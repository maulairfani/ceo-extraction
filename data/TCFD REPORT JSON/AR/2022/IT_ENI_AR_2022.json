        "page_content": "## Letter to shareholders\n\nDear Shareholders,\n\n2022 has been a challenging year for our company, engaged in delivering fast and tangible solutions to the European energy crisis, at the same time while managing the related risks and progressing the transition to a sustainable development model in line with the climate targets of the EU and the 2030 Agenda of the United Nations.  Russia's  military  invasion  of  Ukraine  has  dramatically highlighted the need of our society for secure and affordable energy. The stability and security of energy supplies has altered at least in the short-term the priority of energy agendas of States and operators, balanced on the other hand by reaffirming and indeed relaunching the decarbonization targets in the medium and long-term, in the awareness that the climate emergency needs quick actions.\n\nWe  are  confident  that  our  distinctive  strategy,  leveraging  on available tools and technologies capable of immediately reducing emissions and on the central role of gas in our portfolio, based on its lower carbon footprint, will allow us to address in an effective and practical manner the trilemma of environmental sustainability, energy security and affordability, building upon the geographical and technological diversification of energy sources.\n\nWe will work with all our Stakeholders and Partners to fulfil this proposal.\n\nIn facing the unprecedented challenges posed by the 2022 operating environment,  our  Company  delivered  excellent  results  thanks  to financial  discipline  and  a  constant  focus  on  asset  integrity  and made a significant contribution to the security of energy supplies to Italy and Europe, boosting objectives of continuous development to adapt to a dynamic energy landscape.\n\nAt  the  same  time,  we  achieved  a  significant  reduction  in  the carbon footprint of our asset portfolio, thanks to an ever-growing pipeline of renewable and biofuel projects.\n\nFew  months  after  the  outbreak  of  the  war,  in  a  context  of uncertainty and volatility, we signed several agreements with our long-standing partners to diversify gas supplies to Italy and Europe with a view to fully replacing about 20 billion cubic meters of Russian supplies by 2025, accelerating an ongoing program of focusing on equity reserves.\n\nWe plan to increase production in Algeria and Egypt, freeing up new export volumes that will be delivered to Europe through the existing infrastructures (the Damietta terminal and Sea Corridor's TTPC/Transmed pipelines). We will invest to revitalize national gas fields. In the medium term, new gas supplies will be fueled by the gas project 'A&E Structures' in Libya, recently signed off. LNG equity projects will be the other strategic leg for the security and geographical diversification of supplies. The Congo project is designed to monetize Marine XII block's reserves, with expected to start-up in 2023. We entered the Qatar North Field East project, the largest in the world, with a 3% interest and growing contributions are expected from the likes of Nigeria, Angola, Indonesia. Finally, Mozambique, the new frontier of world scale LNG projects, has entered the stage thanks to the historic milestone of the start of the Coral South field and FLNG vessel, built and commissioned in just 5 years and in line with scheduled times and costs, despite the pandemic disruptions.\n\nIn a period of extreme market volatility, without requesting any financial  aid  from  the  State,  Eni  successfully  preserved  the robustness of its balance sheet by proactively managing the significant  financial  risks  arisen  in  connection  with  the  war in Ukraine. To accomplish this, we strengthened our liquidity reserves, restructured hedging activities to reduce the risk of outsized margin calls and rescheduled sale commitments to account possible interruptions in Russian gas flows.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "2022 marked a year of substantial progress in our transition strategy, founded on the pillars of proprietary technologies, the satellite model and stakeholder alliances.\n\nProprietary technologies matured  within  our  traditional businesses are one of the drivers of our decarbonization path. The Ecofining refining technology has been successfully applied to upgrade our sites of Gela and Venice, converting them into biorefineries. Gas reservoir and storage technologies are being used  to  develop,  in  synergy  with  depleted  fields,  effective solutions  for  CO 2 underground  storage.  A  first  deployment is planned in UK to build the Hynet storage hub, which will leverage  Eni's  depleted  Liverpool  Bay  fields,  to  start  storing CO 2 in 2025, with a target capacity of 10 million tonnes/year from 2030. In 2024, a CCS pilot project is expected to start-up off Ravenna, Italy, in joint venture with Snam, to evaluate the feasibility of a large high potential CCS hub, that will leverage Eni's depleted fields and infrastructures in the area.\n\nBreak-through technologies are key to Eni's long-term success, among them is the magnetic confinement fusion, a potentially inexhaustible,  safe,  and  zero-emission  source  of  energy, expected to change the future energy paradigm. Commonwealth Fusion System, a spin-out of the MIT, of which we are the leading shareholder, is engaged in building, and commissioning a pilot plant to test the net production of energy from magnetic fusion.\n\nEni's satellite business model allows us to enhance the value of our assets, while freeing up additional resources for investment in the energy transition. In Energy Evolution group of businesses, this model foresees the creation of dedicated entities, engaged in the progressive reduction and zeroing of Scope 3 emissions, capable of unlocking their intrinsic value by means of a sale of minority stakes or listing on the market. These entities will be able to access specialized capital markets, while still benefitting from Eni's technologies, know-how and services, so to allow the  Group to optimize its financial structure. While Plenitude has  the  goal  of  supplying  100%  decarbonized  products,  at the beginning of 2023 Eni Sustainable Mobility was set up to offer increasingly decarbonized solutions/products to people on  the  move,  leveraging  the  strong  marketing  network  and biorefineries vertically integrated with our agri-business.\n\nThis model has been applied to selected E&P geographies, by pursuing business combinations resulting in equity-accounted entities where investments will be self-financed, allowing Eni to freeing additional resources to pursue secure and sustainable energy.  Following  the  success  of  the  V\u00e5r  Energi  transaction through its listing at the Norway exchange and entry of new\n\ninvestors, in August Azule Energy, the JV combining Eni and bp asset in Angola, started operations as the largest independent Angolan O&G producer to deliver real value to its shareholders through the development of organic projects, such as Agogo and  the  New  Gas  Consortium  to  extract  value  from  nonassociated gas, and the maximization of operating synergies. Looking forward, we expect to replicate this model in other E&P geographies.\n\nOur  decarbonization  strategy  relies  on  the  production  of advanced biofuels from waste or feedstock not in competition with  the  food  chain,  as  palm  oil  has  been  phased-out  as feedstock  for  Eni's  biorefineries  from  October  2022.  This growth will leverage on integration with our agri-business. In July 2022, we started our agricultural business in Kenya, the first one on this field. Africa will increasingly become part of a vertically integrated supply chain of our biorefineries, supplying bio-oil  from  raw  materials  grown  in  unproductive  land,  with important, positive effects on local employment and income. In 2022, a first  cargo  of  vegetable  oil  has  been  shipped  to  Eni's plants, with higher emission savings compared to the European standards provided for by the Renewable Energy Directive. We intend to apply this model to other African Countries, such as Congo,  Mozambique,  Angola,  the  Ivory  Coast,  Rwanda  and then  to  Kazakhstan,  where  feasibility  studies  are  underway, as  well  as  to  Italy  in  cooperation  with  Bonifiche  Ferraresi. The Agri-business embodies the fundamental pillars of Eni's sustainability: decarbonisation, circular economy, local content. With  the  manufacture  of  SAF,  Sustainable  Aviation  Fuels,  Eni is contributing to decarbonize the air transport thanks to the production  at  the  Taranto  and  Livorno  refineries.  In  2024, production  of  Biojet  will  start  in  Gela  and  Venice  with  an expected capacity of 0.2 million tons by 2026.\n\nSustainability is an integral part of our financial strategy. With the adoption in 2020 of a Sustainability-Linked Framework, the Company intends to cover 25% of total gross debt with financial instruments indexed to sustainability targets by 2025.\n\nIn February 2023, Eni successfully finalized the placement of its first sustainability-linked bond among the retail public in Italy for a total amount of \u20ac2 billion, with orders five times higher than the initially offered amount.\n\nThanks to the growing commitment to transparency and the business model set up by Eni to create sustainable value in the  long-term,  in  2022,  Eni  has  been  confirmed  or  improved its  excellent  ranking  in  the  main  ESG  ratings  of  the  financial",

Finally, Eni has been included in the MIB \u00ae ESG index of Borsa Italiana, a new index dedicated to blue chips excelling in ESG performance.  Referring to gender equality, Eni has been included for the second consecutive year in the Bloomberg Gender Equality Index 2023 and in the Top 100 of the Equileap Gender Equality Ranking.\n\nAgainst  the  backdrop  of  a  supportive  commodity  pricing environment, 2022 results were driven by financial  discipline and  cost  control,  operational  effectiveness  and  sound  risk management  of  the  price  volatility  and  supply  shortages. Adjusted  operating  profit  of  \u20ac20.4  billion,  more  than  double the 2021 result, was fueled by the excellent performance of E&P (+\u20ac7 billion), able to capture the upside of the oil scenario, GGP (+\u20ac1.5 billion), thanks to the continuous optimization of the gas and LNG diversified portfolio, and R&M (+\u20ac2.2 billion) which,  in  a  tight  market  of  refined  products,  leveraging  on plant availability and output optimization as well as efficiency measures to address the rise in plant utility expenses, reported a record performance.\n\nAdjusted  net  profit  was  \u20ac13.3  billion,  approximately  tripling the  2021  result,  thanks  also  to  better  contribution  of  our equity-accounted  entities.  Operating  performance  generated a robust cash flow of \u20ac20.4 billion, net of \u20ac8.5 billion of taxes paid, including the payment of extraordinary contributions on energy's profits for over \u20ac1 billion.\n\nAfter  funding  organic  investments  of  \u20ac8.2  billion,  working capital needs and replenishment of gas storage, we earned a discretionary cash flow of \u20ac12.8 billion, that was utilized to finance net acquisitions, to remunerate shareholders with \u20ac5.4 billion (\u20ac3 billion dividends and an accelerated buy-back program of \u20ac2.4 billion)  and  to  reduce  net  financial  debt  by  \u20ac2  billion,  bringing leverage to an all-time low of 0.13.  Portfolio transactions related mainly  to  acquisitions  intended  to  accelerate  the  growth  of Plenitude, assets for the diversification of gas supplies, including the FLNG Tango for the Congo project and a 3% interest in the NFE  project  in  Qatar,  as  well  as  the  capital  increase  for  the relaunch of Saipem, highly appreciated by the market.\n\nExploration  confirmed  its  streak  of  excellent  performances with the discovery of around 750 million boe of new resources, at a competitive unit cost of less than 2 $/boe, thanks to the contribution  of  the  Baleine  appraisal  and  new  discoveries  in\n\nCyprus, Algeria, Egypt, Angola, and the United Arab Emirates. Plenitude delivered against its operating and financial targets with a proforma EBITDA exceeding \u20ac0.6 billion and a renewable capacity of over 2 GW.\n\nVersalis affected by competitive pressures in the commodity segments  is  implementing  a  transformation  of  the  business towards  a  more  sustainable  and  competitive  portfolio  of products,  strengthening  its  partnership  with  Novamont  to develop green chemicals and progressing the conversion of the Porto Marghera hub, thanks to the agreement with Forever Plast for the mechanical recycling of plastic waste.\n\n## Strategy and targets\n\nEni  four-year  plan  for  the  period  '23-'26  identifies  industrial programs and initiatives aimed at consolidating the transition strategy  by  means  of:  (a)  leveraging  the  integration  of technologies and new business models to offer decarbonised products to customers and to guarantee energy security and affordability through the geographical diversification of sources, and (b) ensuring cash flow and economic returns. At the Brent scenario of 85 $/bbl in 2023 and 80 $/bbl in the long-term, we expect to invest \u20ac37 billion in the four-year plan, of which about 25% is allocated to low carbon projects.\n\nOur strategic guidelines in the E&P segment are to maximize cash generation by focusing on highly profitable projects, to deploy our fast-track model of reserves development and to reduce direct emissions. The main planned developments comprise the gas initiatives in Congo, Libya, Egypt, Italy and the Middle East, as well as the giant Baleine oil discovery off the Ivory Coast. As result of those planned projects and of maintaining the plateau at legacy assets, Eni expects a CAGR of 3-4% in production over the 4-year plan period, which will be achieved organically and by gradually increasing the proportion of gas in our portfolio to 60% by 2030. Eni reaffirms its commitment to exploration as a driver of growth and of support to energy security. We expect to invest around \u20ac0.5 billion on average per year, focusing on gas initiatives, and mature/near-field areas such as North Africa, West Africa and the UAE.\n\nThe  profitability  of  the  GGP  business  will  be  underpinned  by maximizing  the  value  of  the  integrated  gas  and  LNG  equity projects and by portfolio flexibilities. Contracted LNG volumes are expected to exceed 18 million tonnes/y by 2026 compared to 9 million tonnes/y in 2022.\n\nWe  expect  a  significant  growth  in  the  biofuel  segment,  by",

        "page_content": "## Business Model\n\nWe are an integrated energy company supporting a socially fair energy transition that through concrete and economically sustainable solutions, aims to face the crucial challenges of our time: combating climate change and giving access to energy in an efficient and sustainable way for all\n\nOur business model is aimed at creating long-term value for all stakeholders through a strong presence along the entire energy value chain. The core is represented by our mission 1 , inspired by the United Nations 2030 Agenda, whose foundations are embodied in our distinctive approach , which permeates all activities. Eni is committed to fulfilling the essential pillars of the energy system trilemma, pursuing environmental sustainability together with energy security and affordability.\n\nThese goals leverage the diversified geographical presence and a diversified mix of energy sources, which, together with a portfolio of new technologies and their fast-track development, will create a diversified energy mix for energy transition and to support energy security, progressing in the value creation and breakthrough  opportunities,  while  recognising  the  essential  role  of partnerships  and  alliances  with stakeholders to ensure active involvement in the transformation of energy system.\n\nOur agile and innovative business model leverages proprietary  technologies at the base of traditional businesses for the development of a satellite model of creating dedicated entities capable of independently accessing capital markets to fund their growth and to reveal the real value of each business.\n\nThis integrated business model is supported by a Corporate Governance system 2 inspired by the principles of transparency and integrity, an integrated risk management process 3 ensuring, through the assessment and analysis of the risks and opportunities of the reference scenario, informed and strategic decisions, as well as materiality analysis 4 to examine the most significant impacts generated by Eni on the economy, environment and people, including those on human rights.\n\nThe operation of the business model is focused on the best possible use of all the resources (inputs)of the group and on their transformation into outcomes, through the implementation of its strategy , while contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda. Eni also organically integrates its business plan with the principles of environmental and social sustainability, deploying its actions along three levers :\n\nOPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE: Eni's business is aimed to operational excellence through the continuous commitment in the enhancement, health and safety of people, assets integrity, environmental protection, respect for human rights, resilience and diversification of activities and financial soundness. These elements allow Eni to seize the opportunities deriving from the possible developments in the energy market and to progress its transformation path.\n\nCARBON NEUTRALITY BY 2050: Eni's business model envisages a decarbonization path towards carbon neutrality by 2050 based on an approach oriented to emissions generated throughout the life cycle of energy products. This path, achieved through existing technologies, will allow Eni to totally reduce its carbon footprint, both in terms of net emissions and in terms of net carbon intensity. In this context gas figure as a bridge energy source in transition.\n\nALLIANCES FOR THE PROMOTION OF DEVELOPMENT: Eni is committed to reduce energy poverty in the countries where it operates through the development of infrastructures linked to traditional business but also to the new frontiers of renewables with the aim of generating value in the long-term by transferring its know-how and skills to local partners (so called 'Dual Flag' approach). In these countries, Eni promotes initiatives to support local communities accessing to energy, to diversify economy, training and health of community, access to water and sanitation, and protection of the territory, in collaboration with international players and in line with the National Development Plans and the United Nations 2030 Agenda.\n\n- (1) See the dedicated section of this Report.\n- (2) See chapter 'Governance'.\n- (3) See chapter 'Integrated Risk Management'\n- (4) See the 'Consolidated Non-Financial Statement', section 'Material topics for Eni'.",

The  Company delivered excellent financial and operating  results  while  contributing to the stability of energy supplies to Italy  and  Europe  and  progressing  its decarbonization plans. During the year, we  were  able  to  finalize  agreements and activities to fully replace Russian gas  by  2025,  leveraging  our  strong relationships with producing states and fast-track  development  approach  to ramp-up volumes from Algeria, Egypt, Mozambique,  Congo  and  Qatar.  The recently  signed  deal  with  Libya's  NOC on  the  A&E  Structures  development and exploration successes off Cyprus, Egypt and Norway will further strengthen our integrated supply diversification.  This  prompt  reaction to  the  gas  crisis  and  the  integration with the E&P activities were important driver of the performance of our GGP business, which was able to ensure its supply commitments through different sources.'\n\nClaudio Descalzi\n\nCEO Eni\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Profile of the year\n\n- \u00b7 In 2022 the Group delivered strong results with an adjusted EBIT of \u20ac20.4 billion, doubling the amount of the FY 2021, driven by an excellent performance of the E&P, GGP and R&M businesses.\n- \u00b7 FY 2022 adjusted net profit attributable to Eni shareholders was \u20ac13.3 billion and, compared with FY 2021, was \u20ac9 billion higher due to a strong operating performance and higher results of equity-accounted entities.\n- \u00b7 FY 2022 net profit  attributable  to  Eni  shareholders  was  \u20ac13.9  billion  and,  compared  with  FY 2021, was driven by an improved underlying performance benefitting from a favorable trading environment, partly offset by lower net special gains mainly due to inventory evaluation.\n- \u00b7 Shareholders  remuneration:  in  September  and  November,  Eni  paid  the  first  and  the  second quarterly instalment of the 2022 dividend of \u20ac0.22 per share each, amounting to \u20ac1.47 billion. The third instalment of \u20ac0.22 per share will be paid to shareholders on March 22, 2023, being the ex-dividend date March 20, 2023.\n- \u00b7 In November, Eni completed the announced buy-back program of \u20ac2.4 billion, repurchasing 195.55 million shares withdrawn from the market (equal to 5.48% of the share capital), at the average price of \u20ac12.27 per share.\n- \u00b7 Net borrowings ex-IFRS 16 as of December 31, 2022, were \u20ac7 billion, down by \u20ac2 billion compared to December 31, 2021, and Group leverage stood at 0.13, versus 0.20 as of December 31, 2021.\n- \u00b7 In  January  2023,  Eni  successfully  placed  the  first  sustainability-linked  bond  among  the  retail public in Italy for a total amount of \u20ac2 billion. Orders for over \u20ac10 billion were received compared to \u20ac1 billion initially offered. The offering was closed in advance in just 5 days.\n\n## Advancing satellite model\n\nIn 2022 significant progresses were made in the development of our distinctive satellite model, through the set-up of dedicated entities focused on specific scopes, capable of independently accessing capital markets to fund their growth and to reveal the real value of each business. These entities will continue to benefit from Eni's technologies, know-how and services, while allowing the Group to optimize its financial structure: Plenitude and Sustainable Mobility in the Energy Evolution business Group. Azule Energy and V\u00e5r Energi in the Natural Resources business Group were established with the aim of developing new hydrocarbon reserves to support energy security, remunerating shareholders with stable dividend flows and tend to grow and independently financing the related investments, allowing the Group to have additional resources for the optimization of investments in the decarbonized energy portfolio.\n\n## Operational milestones\n\n- \u00b7 In FY 2022 around 750 million boe of new resources were added to the reserve base continuing the delivery of outstanding exploration performance. Several discoveries were made close to existing assets and facilities as part of our fast-track development model in Algeria, Egypt and Abu Dhabi.\n- \u00b7 Eni signed relevant agreements for the development of Carbon Capture and Storage projects: with  Snam  to  jointly  develop  and  manage  the  Ravenna  Carbon  Capture  and  Storage  (CCS) Project, with the National Oil Corporation of Libya (NOC) for the development of the large gas reserves of A&E Structures, offshore Tripoli, comprising the construction of an onshore Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) hub.\n- \u00b7 As part of the development of the biorefining business, Eni signed definitive agreements with PBF to partner in a 50-50 joint venture, St. Bernard Renewables LLC (SBR), for the biorefinery currently under construction in Louisiana (US). The biorefinery start-up is expected in the first half of 2023, with a target processing capacity of about 1.1 million tonnes/year of raw materials to produce mainly HVO Diesel.\n- \u00b7 Signed significant  agreements  with  strategic  partners  for  the  development  of  joint  initiatives in  the  field  of  sustainability  and  innovation,  to  foster  the  energy  transition  process  and decarbonisation of its activities, also leveraging joint development innovative initiatives in the fields of agriculture, the protection of forest ecosystems, health and technologies, promoting both agricultural initiatives for the cultivation of oil plants to feed Eni's biorefineries for the production of biofuels and initiatives for the generation of carbon credits and supporting the development of infrastructure and services for health and education of local communities.",

Participation supports maximising  the  long-term  value creation for both the company and its stakeholders while reducing corporate  risks.  Also  in  line  with the  Code  of  Ethics,  Eni  maintains relations based on principles such as  fairness,  legality,  transparency, traceability, respect for human rights, inclusion,  gender  equality and protection of the environment and  communities.  Participation  in and  sharing  of  company  choices, objectives  and  results  foster  solid relationships and mutual trust and are even a  vital component of the materiality process. In 2022, about 3,000 stakeholders were engaged in the  materiality  analysis  that  steers corporate  strategy  and  guides  the definition  of  the  Strategic  Plan.  The continuous  dialogue  that  touches all corporate functions with different roles, levels of involvement  and responsibilities allows to understand the expectations and needs of Eni's stakeholders, present in 62 countries with  very  different  characteristics and contexts. To support the relationship with local stakeholders, Eni uses the company's 'Stakeholder Management System' (SMS) application, which maps some 5,300 stakeholders and which allows constant and timely management of grievances and requests.\n\n| CATEGORIES                                                    | RELEVANT THEMES                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ENI'S PEOPLE AND NATIONAL  AND INTERNATIONAL UNIONS           | Health and safety of workers    Innovation   Development of human capital   Diversity, inclusion and work-life balance                                                                                                        |\n| FINANCIAL COMMUNITY                                           | Economic and financial strategy and performance (*)   Combating climate change   Reduction of environmental impacts    Protection of human rights   Transparency, anti-corruption and tax strategy    Circular economy        |\n| LOCAL COMMUNITIES  AND COMMUNITY BASED  ORGANISATIONS         | Local development   Transparency, anti-corruption and tax strategy    Reduction of environmental impacts   Access to energy   Responsible supply chain management    Protection of human rights                               |\n| CONTRACTORS, SUPPLIERS  AND COMMERCIAL PARTNERS               | Health and safety of workers    Combating climate change    Protection of human rights   Development of human capital    Diversity, inclusion and work-life balance    Digitalisation and Cyber security   Customer relations |\n| NATIONAL, EUROPEAN  AND INTERNATIONAL  INSTITUTIONS           | Combating climate change    Reduction of environmental impacts    Access to energy   Circular economy    Innovation    Energy Security (*)                                                                                    |\n| UNIVERSITIES,  RESEARCH CENTRES                               | Combating climate change    Innovation   Local development                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|                                                               | Reduction of environmental impacts    Circular economy                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| AND INNOVATION HUBS                                           | Protection of human rights                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| VOLUNTARY ADVOCACY  AND CATEGORY  ORGANIZATIONS  AND INDUSTRY | Development of human capital    Circular economy   Reduction of environmental impacts    Health and safety of workers   Innovation                                                                                            |\n| ASSOCIATIONS                                                  | Combating climate change                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|                                                               | Local development   Combating climate change                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| ORGANISATIONS FOR  DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION                    | Circular economy   Access to energy                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|                                                               | Innovation   Health and safety of workers                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n\n- (*)  Corporate  functions  indicated  the  topics  with  an asterisk as prominent in the interaction with the stakeholder  of  reference.

In 2014 we undertook an industrial and financial transformation path which progressively enabled us to create value even in difficult scenarios, delivering security of supplies and environmental sustainability. We have been focusing our exploration and production strategy mainly on gas, leveraging our own production and diversifying our investments across different countries. This has enabled us to put in place our Plan aimed at replacing 20 billion cubic meters of Russian gas by 2025. We have been transforming our downstream platform and invested in technology to create and grow our transition businesses aiming at net zero Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. This enables us today to fully confirm our decarbonization targets despite the current energy security scenario and the need to respond to a strong demand for traditional sources. Today we can clearly outline how the Company will be in 2030: our Upstream operations will no longer produce net emissions; our hydrocarbon production will be composed mainly by gas; our biofuel capacity will exceed 5 million\n\n## CONFIRMING OUR PATH TO REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Net zero GHG lifecycle emissions\n\n(Scope 1, 2 and 3) by 2050\n\n## Net GHG Lifecycle Emissions\n\n(Scope 1, 2 and 3) vs. 2018:\n\n-35% by 2030\n\n-80% by 2040\n\nEni Net Carbon Footprint\n\n(Scope 1 and 2) Net zero emission by 2035\n\n## Net Carbon Footprint Upstream\n\n(Scope 1 and 2)\n\n-65% by 2025 (vs. 2018)\n\nNet Zero emission by 2030\n\n## NEW ENERGY SOLUTION\n\n## Plenitude\n\nover 15 mln customers and of renewable\n\n15 GW capacity by 2030\n\n## Biorefinery\n\ncapacity at over\n\n5 mln tonn/y from 2030\n\nMagnetic fusion\n\nexpected\n\n## first commercial plant\n\nby the next ten years\n\n## CAPEX\n\nforeseen a growing share\n\nof capex for new energy solutions: 30% by 2026 70% by 2030 until 85% by 2040\n\n<!-- image -->",

For this purpose, the Risk Committee evaluates and expresses opinions, at the instance of CEO, related to the main results of the IRM process.\n\n## INTEGRATED RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS\n\nThe IRM process ensures the detection, consolidation and analysis of all Eni's risks and supports the BoD to verify the compatibility of the risk profile with the strategic targets, also in a medium/long-term approach. The IRM supports management in the decision-making process by strengthening awareness of the risk profile and the associated mitigations. The process, regulated by the 'Management System Guideline (MSG) Integrated Risk Management' is continuous, dynamic and includes the following sub-processes: (i) Risk governance, methodologies and tools (ii) Risk Strategy, (iii) Integrated Rrisk Management, (iv) Risk knowledge, training and communication.\n\nThe IRM process starts from the specialist contribution to the elaboration of the Strategic Plan provided  on  the  basis  of  the  overall  risk  management  activity,  with  particular  reference  to  the definition of the de-risking areas, the analysis of the risk profile underlying the Plan proposal and the identification of the main actions with effective de-risking of the strategic company's top risks. The results of the activities are presented to the Administrative and Control structures in times consistent with the Strategic Planning process.\n\nThe ' Integrated Risk Management ' sub-process includes: periodic risk assessment and monitoring cycles (Integrated Risk Assessment) in order to understand the risks taken on the basis of the strategic targets and the initiatives defined to achieve them; contract risk management and analysis aimed at the best allocation of the contractual responsibilities with the supplier and their adequate management in the operational phase; integrated analysis of existing risks in the Countries of presence or potential interest (ICR) which represents a reference for risk strategy, risk assessment and project risk analysis activities; support to the decision-making process for the authorization of investment projects and main transactions (Integrated Project Risk Management and M&A).\n\nThe risks are assessed with quantitative and qualitative tools considering both the likelihood of occurrence and the impacts that would occur in a defined time horizon when the risk occurs.\n\nThe  assessment  is  expressed  following  an  inherent  and  a  residual  level  (taking  into  account  the effectiveness of the mitigation actions) and allows to measure the impact with respect to the achievement of the objectives of the Strategic Plan and for the whole life as regards the business. The risks are represented on the basis of the likelihood of occurrence and the impact on matrices that allow their comparison and classification by relevance. Risks with economic/financial impact are also analyzed in an integrated perspective on the basis of quantitative models that allow to define on a statistical basis the distribution of risk flows or to simulate the aggregate impact of risks in the face of hypothetical future scenarios (what if analysis or stress test).\n\nIn 2022, two assessment sessions were performed: the Annual Risk Profile Assessment performed in the first half of the year, involving 134 companies in 45 Countries and the Interim Top Risk Assessment performed in the second half of the year, relating to the update of the evaluation and treatment of Eni's top risks and the main business risks.\n\nThe two assessment results were submitted to Eni's management and control bodies in July and December 2022. In addition, three monitoring processes were performed on Eni's top risks.\n\nThe monitoring of such risks and the relevant treatment plans allow to analyze the risks evolution (through update of appropriate indicators) and the progress in the implementation of specific treatment",

Eni, however, has been considering the interest of stakeholders other than shareholders as one of the necessary elements Directors must evaluate in making informed decisions since 2006. This approach is implemented in particular in the list of powers that the Board of Directors has decided to reserve to itself exclusively, recently updated on  January  26,  2023  with  the  aim  of  further  consolidating  its  duties  in  line  with  the  Corporate Governance Code, with the best national and international practices and with the Company and Group's transformation resulting from the transition process undertaken.\n\nEni is committed to building a Corporate Governance system founded on excellence in our open dialogue with the market and all stakeholders. It is part of our efforts to ensure the effective exercise of shareholders' rights. In 2022 Eni continued to pursue a dialogue with the market on matters of governance and to seize the opportunities deriving from studies and experience at the international level, in spite of the complications associated with the health emergency which prevented more immediate contacts, in particular with reference to the shareholders' meeting. Shareholders were granted all legal rights and additional information tools were provided in order to allow the greatest possible involvement. The policy for managing dialogue with investors, approved on March 8, 2022 by Eni's Board of Directors, upon the proposal of the Chairman and in agreement with the Chief Executive Officer, was also adopted.\n\nIn line with the principles defined by the Board of Directors, Eni is committed to creating a Corporate Governance system inspired by criteria of excellence, also participating in initiatives to improve it. In particular, the various initiatives in 2022 included participating in working groups for in-depth analysis of topics subject to European legislation such as corporate sustainability reporting and sustainability due diligence, as well as in-depth studies on Say on Climate. In particular, in the occasion of the Shareholders'  Meeting  on  May  11,  2022,  in  continuity  with  the  previous  year,  a  message  was published by the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer about the climate transition, which asked shareholders to express, through the designated representative, their opinions on the climate strategy outlined in the document.",

        "page_content": "## THE ENI CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## Eni Corporate Governance model\n\nEni's Corporate Governance structure is based on the traditional Italian model, which - without prejudice to the role of the Shareholders' Meeting - assigns the management of the Company to the Board of Directors, supervisory functions to the Board of Statutory Auditors and statutory auditing to the Audit Firm.\n\n## Appointment and composition of corporate bodies\n\nEni's Board of Directors and Board of Statutory Auditors, and their respective Chairmen, are elected by the Shareholders' Meeting. To ensure the presence of Directors and Statutory Auditors selected by noncontrolling shareholders a slate voting mechanism is used.\n\nEni's Board of Directors and Board of Statutory Auditors 2 , whose term runs from May 2020 until the Shareholders' Meeting called to approve the 2022 financial statements, are made up of 9 and 5 members, respectively. Three directors and two Standing Statutory Auditors, including the Chairman of the Board of Statutory Auditors, were elected by non-controlling shareholders, thereby giving minority shareholders (i.e. shareholders other than the controlling shareholder) a larger number of representatives than that provided for under law. In deciding the composition of the Board of Directors, the Shareholders' Meeting was able to take account of the guidelines provided to investors by the previous Board with regard to diversity, professionalism, experience and competence, also with reference to corporate strategies, the Company's transformation and energy transition. The outcome was a balanced and diversified Board of Directors, as also confirmed by the results of the self-assessments conducted annually by the Board, which showed a positive opinion on the professionalism within the Board in terms of knowledge, experience and skills 3 and on the individual contribution made by Directors to the Board in relation to sustainability, ESG and the energy transition, topics that characterised the Board's work for its entire mandate. There was unanimous recognition of the effort and commitment of the entire Board to the energy transition, climate change, sustainability and ESG, and within its role of strategic guidance and monitoring in relation to the transition process undertaken. Significant support also came from the Board Committees, especially from the Sustainability and Scenarios Committee due to its specific functions, in terms of quality and depth of discussion about ESG topics and sustainability, as well as topics related to the energy transition and climate change.\n\nIn 2020 the Board of Statutory Auditors had also prepared a shareholders' advice providing indications on the composition of the body in relation to the tasks it was called upon to perform. The composition of the Board of Directors and of the Board of Statutory Auditors is also more diversified in gender terms, in accordance with the provisions of applicable law and the By-laws. The latter was promptly amended to be compliant with the law in February 2020 in view of the renewal of the corporate bodies. In particular, for 6 consecutive terms the management and control bodies shall be composed of at least 2/5 of the less represented gender. Furthermore, based on the assessments most recently carried out on February 22, 2023, the number of independent directors on the Board of Directors (7 4 of the 9 serving, of whom 8 are non-executive Director including the Chairwoman) remains greater than the number provided for in the By-laws and by Corporate Governance Code. In light of the upcoming renewal in 2023 during approval of  the  financial  statements ended as at December 31, 2022 and, as recommended by the Corporate\n\n(2) Following the resignation of a Standing Statutory Auditor on September 1 st , 2020, replaced by an Alternate Statutory Auditor, the Shareholders' Meeting of May 12, 2021 appointed a Statutory Auditor and an alternate Auditor for the duration of the term of the Board of Statutory Auditors in office, to restore full membership of the Board of Statutory Auditors. (3) In particular, the Chief Executive Officer and Director Vermeir possess solid experience and expertise in the Company's business sector; Director Litvack, the current Chairman of the Sustainability and Scenarios Committee, on ESG topics. (4) Independence as defined by applicable law, to which the Eni By-laws refer, and by the Corporate Governance Code.",

The guidelines highlighted in particular the central role of sustainability, ESG and energy transition expertise, also underlining the importance of ensuring that Eni's directors have knowledge of topics related to sustainability and climate and environment risk control, operated in managerial or business roles and acquired in industrial contexts comparable to those in which the Company operates. Similarly, the Board of Statutory Auditors expressed guidelines for shareholders on its own quantitative and qualitative composition considered to be optimal.\n\n## COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(a) Independence as defined by applicable law and Corporate Governance Code.\n\n(b) Figures at December 31, 2022.\n\n## The structure of the Board of Directors\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  appointed  a  Chief  Executive  Officer  on  May  14,  2020  and  established  four internal committees with advisory and recommendation functions: the Control and Risk Committee , the Remuneration Committee , the Nomination Committee and the Sustainability and Scenarios Committee. The Committees report, through their Chairmen, on the main issues they address at each meeting of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors also retained the Chairman's major role in internal controls, with specific regard to  the  Internal  Audit  unit.  In  agreement  with  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  the  Chairman  proposes  the appointment, revocation and remuneration of its Head and the resources available to it, without prejudice to the support to the Board of the Control and Risks Committee and the Nomination Committee, to the extent of their competences, and having heard the Board of Statutory Auditors, and also directly manages relations with the unit on behalf of the Board of Directors (without prejudice to the unit's functional reporting to the Control and Risk Committee and the Chief Executive Officer, in charge of the Internal Control and Risk Management System). The Chairman is also involved in the appointment of the primary Eni officers responsible  for  internal  controls  and  risk  management,  including  the  officer  in  charge  of  preparing financial reports, the members of the Watch Structure, the Head of Integrated Risk Management and the Head of Integrated Compliance. Finally, the Board of Directors, acting on a recommendation of the Chairman, appoints the Secretary, charged with providing assistance and advice to the Chairman, the Board of Directors and the individual directors . In view of this role, the Secretary, who reports to the Board\n\n(5) As regards the composition of the Control and Risk Committee, Eni requires that at least two members shall have appropriate knowledge and experience with  accounting,  financial  or  risk  management  issues,  exceeding  the  provision  of  the  2018  Corporate Governance Code, in force at the time of the appointment, confirmed by the new Corporate Governance Code, which recommends only one such member. In this regard, on May 14, 2020 the Eni Board of Directors determined that 2 of the 4 members of the Committee, including the Chairman, have the appropriate experience.\n\n(6) In line with the Recommendation of the 2018 Corporate Governance Code, in force at the time of the appointment, confirmed by the new Corporate Governance Code, the Rules of the Remuneration Committee require that at least one member shall have adequate knowledge and experience in finance or compensation policies. These qualifications are assessed by the Board of Directors at the time of appointment. In this regard, on May 14, 2020 the Eni Board of Directors determined that all three members of the Committee have the appropriate expertise and experience. The level of expertise and experience of the Committee members therefore exceeds that provided for in the Committee Rules and Corporate Governance Code.\n\n(7) The Charter of the Board Secretary and Board Counsel, attached to the Rules of the Board of Directors, is available on the Eni website, in the Governance section.",

More specifically, the Board decided that the Integrated Risk Management function reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer and created an Integrated Compliance function, also reporting to the Chief Executive Officer, separate from the Legal unit. Furthermore, in June 2020, the Board redefined the organizational structure of the Company with the establishment of two General Departments (Energy Evolution and Natural Resources), launching a new structure consistent with the corporate mission and functional to the achievement of strategic objectives.\n\nAmong the Board of Directors' most important duties is the appointment of people to key management and control positions in the Company, such as the officer in charge of preparing financial reports, the Head of Internal Audit, the members of the Watch Structure. In performing these duties, the Board of Directors is supported by the Nomination Committee.\n\n## Reporting flows\n\nIn order for the Board of Directors to perform its duties as effectively as possible, the Directors must be in a position to assess the decisions they are called upon to make, possessing appropriate expertise and information. The current members of the Board of Directors, who have a diversified range of skills and  experience,  including  on  the  international  stage,  are  well  qualified  to  conduct  comprehensive assessments of the variety of issues they face from multiple perspectives. The directors also receive timely complete briefings on the issues on the agenda of the meetings of the Board of Directors. To ensure this operates smoothly, Board meetings are governed by specific procedures that establish deadlines for providing members with documentation and the Chairman ensures that each Director can contribute effectively to Board discussions. The same documentation is provided to the Statutory Auditors. In addition to meeting to perform the duties assigned to the Board of Statutory Auditors by Italian law, including in its capacity as the 'Internal Control and Audit Committee', and by US law in its capacity as the 'Audit Committee', the Statutory Auditors also participate in the meetings of the Board of Directors and, also through individual members, at meetings of the Control and Risk Committee thus ensuring the timely exchange of key information for the performance of their respective duties. The Chairman, in agreement with the Chief Executive Officer supported by the Secretary of the Board, ensures that the executives of the Company and of the Group companies responsible for the relevant corporate functions connected with the items to be discussed attend the Board meetings, also at the request of individual directors, to provide appropriate in-depth information on the items on the agenda. Finally, the adequacy and timeliness of reporting flows towards the Board of Directors is subject to periodic review by the same Board as part of the annual self-assessment process (see next section).\n\n## Board Review and ongoing training\n\nOn an annual basis, the Board of Directors conducts a self-assessment (the Board Review) 9 , for which benchmarking against national and international best practices and an examination of Board dynamics are essential elements, also with a view to provide shareholders with guidelines on the most appropriate professional profiles for members of the Board. Following the Board Review, the Board of Directors develops an action plan, if necessary, to improve the functioning of the Board and its Committees.",

The Board Review for 2022 concluded at the meeting on February 22, 2023 with the presentation of the results of the process by the consultant. Confirming the positive elements already emerged from previous board reviews, the presentation highlighted in particular a positive evolution in: the mix of knowledge, experience and expertise acquired in relation to the businesses, scenarios, the Plan's strategic and monitoring role, the sectors in which the Company operates and associated risks; the effective supporting role of the BoD in the process of energy diversification, transition and security, topics that characterised the Board's work for its entire mandate, in addition to the commitment and time spent on ESG issues, sustainability and the energy transition and on the adequate adoption of ESG principles into the Company's policies; the functioning of the BoD in terms of individual commitment dedicated to the role and in terms of efficacy of the joint proceedings, considered balanced, competent and contributing, also by virtue of the effective consultation and investigation support from the Board Committees; the role performed by the Chairman of the Board in ensuring the correct function of the Board and the organisation of board meetings, in particular for the timeliness, completeness and quality of the documentation made available; the role and actions of the Chief Executive Officer, recognised for his excellent capacity for vision, innovation and entrepreneurship, significant authority in leading the company, and managerial skills, including in light of the important steps taken in the process launched for the overall and transformative energy transition; the role of the Committees, leadership of the Chairmen and contribution made to the Board, also recognised by the time and attention dedicated to them within the Board, as well as induction activities, in terms of both scope and quality of the topics addressed. In the year 2022 it was decided not to carry out the final peer review.\n\nThe Board of Statutory Auditors also conducted its own self-assessment in 2022.\n\nFor a number of years now, Eni has supported the Board of Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors with an induction programme, which involves the presentation of the activities and organization of Eni by top management. Following the appointment of the Board of Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors, multiple induction sessions were held, open to Directors and Statutory Auditors, during meetings of the Board of Directors, Board of Statutory Auditors and Board Committees, on topics within the remit of the committees. In particular, the issues addressed during the mandate include those relating to the corporate structure and its business model, Eni's mission and decarbonisation path, Eni's positioning compared to its peers in terms of decarbonisation objectives and strategies, the inclusion of climate-related risks and climate scenarios in the financial information, the transition in emerging countries, the classification of sustainable economic activities based on the EU Taxonomy, climate change, the environmental and social sustainability of Eni's activities, human rights, governance, compliance, the Internal Control and Risk Management System, accounting and tax issues, the new responsibilities of directors on financial reporting according to the European Single Electronic Format ESEF - for annual financial reports, remuneration policy, human capital, the succession plan, as well as internal regulations on transactions with related parties, cyber security and business strategies pursued by the Company in the most important sectors.\n\nWith particular reference to induction and onboarding activities, also considering the positive assessment emerging from the Board Review, the Board recommends that, in the next mandate, ongoing training activities for the benefit of directors, especially on issues relating to the implementation and updating of the strategic and energy transition plan.\n\n## The governance of sustainability\n\nEni's governance structure reflects the Company's willingness to integrate sustainability, including in the form of 'sustainable success' as outlined in the Corporate Governance Code, into its business model. A central role is reserved for the Board of Directors, upon the proposal of the Chief Executive Officer, in the definition of the strategic guidelines and objectives of the Company and the Group, pursuing their",

In detail, a central theme in which the Board of Directors plays a key role is the process of energy transition to a low carbon future 10 .\n\nIn this regard, the Board Review for 2022, carried out with the support of an independent external consultant and completed in February 2023 11 , provided extremely positive opinions on the mix of knowledge, experience and expertise acquired and the commitment and time spent on ESG issues, sustainability and the energy transition and on the adequate adoption of ESG principles into the Company's policies, as well as on the effective supporting role of the BoD in the process of energy diversification, transition and security, topics that characterised the Board's work for its entire mandate. Furthermore, with a view to pursuing sustainable success, Eni's Board of Directors, in line with the 2020 Corporate Governance Code, promotes dialogue with shareholders and other stakeholders relevant to the Company. In particular, as already indicated, the Board, upon proposal of the Chairman in agreement with the Chief Executive Officer, has adopted the policy for managing dialogue with shareholders, also in order to ensure an orderly and consistent communication.\n\nAnother central issue of interest for the Board of Directors is respect for Human Rights. Eni continued to implement its Declaration on Respect for Human Rights approved by Eni's BoD in December 2018; in particular, the management model was updated in order to ensure the performance of the due diligence process according to the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP). Eni's Board of Directors has a central role in the internal control and risk management system, within which the economic and environmental impacts and the impacts on people of the Company's activities are also important. Particular reference is made to the role of the Board of Directors: when approving business transactions reserved to it which also include the outcomes of the risk analysis and any assessments of the ESG impacts associated with the transaction; when approving the strategic plan which also includes the assessment of the associated risks and ESG impacts; when promoting dialogue with shareholders and stakeholders and the related information flows; in the quarterly review of the main risks, including relevant ESG risks; when defining the guidelines on the management and control of financial risks when establishing the Sustainability and Scenarios Committee with the task of  supporting it with sustainability issues; when establishing the Control and Risk Committee with the task of supporting it with issues related to the internal control and risk management system (ICRMS); when approving and reviewing the regulatory instruments used to monitor risks and when receiving information flows (such as regulatory instruments on transactions involving the interests of the directors and statutory auditors and transactions with related parties, anti-corruption and internal audits, as well as the ICRMS guidelines).\n\nIn its strategic guidance role, the Board also approves the Company's Management, Supervision and Control Model for Health, Safety and Environment, Security and Public Safety Risks, and its substantial amendments; it conducts an annual evaluation of the HSE Report prepared by the Head of the competent Company function and included in the flows relating to the ICRMS adequacy assessment.\n\nFor these issues, the Board also receives support from the Board Committees, within their respective remit, by virtue of their preparatory, advisory and consultative functions.\n\n## In particular:\n\n- \u00b7 Eni's Control and Risk Committee assesses the suitability of periodic financial and non-financial information to correctly represent, among other things, the impacts of the Company's activities,\n\n(10) For further information on the role of the Board of Directors in the process of energy transition and the pursuit of sustainable success, see the section of this Report relating to the Consolidated Non-Financial Statement, pursuant to Legislative Decree no. 254/2016.",

Furthermore, on adopting the  new  Corporate  Governance  Code,  Eni's  Board  of  Directors  established  various  actions  and application and improvement methods to comply with the recommendations on the ICRMS, already generally accepted as in line with the best practices of Corporate Governance 16 .\n\nIn this respect, in order to strengthen the integration between strategic planning and internal controls and risk management, upon the proposal of the Chief Executive Officer and with the support of the Control and Risks Committee, the Board of Directors has called for the definition of specific annual guidelines for the ICRMS, that exceed the ICRMS model contained in internal regulations, as part of the Strategic plan, in line with the strategies of the company. It was also envisaged that the implementation of specific guidelines of the ICRMS is subject to periodic monitoring on the basis of a report by the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nEni has also equipped itself with a reference model for Integrated Compliance, which together with Model 231 and the Code of Ethics, is aimed at ensuring that all Eni personnel who are contributing to the achievement of business objectives operate in full compliance with the rules of integrity and applicable laws and regulations in an increasingly complex national and international regulatory framework, defining a comprehensive process, developed using a risk-based approach, for managing activities to prevent non-compliance.\n\nWith  this  in  mind,  risk  assessment  methodologies  were  developed  aimed  at  modulating  controls, calibrating monitoring activities and planning training and communication activities based on the compliance  risk  underlying  the  various  cases,  to  maximize  their  effectiveness  and  efficiency.  The Integrated Compliance process was designed to stimulate integration between those who work in the business activities and the corporate functions that oversee the various compliance risks, both internal or external to the Integrated Compliance unit.\n\nFurthermore,  acting  on  the  proposal  of  the  Chief  Executive  Officer,  having  obtained  a  favourable opinion from the Control and Risk Committee, the Board of Directors of Eni approved the internal rules concerning the Market Information Abuse (Issuers). These, by updating the previous Eni rules for the aspects relating to 'issuers', incorporate the amendments introduced by Regulation No. 596/2014/ EU of April 16, 2014 and the associated implementing rules, as well as the national regulations, taking account of Italian and foreign institutional guidelines on the matter.\n\nThe  updated  internal  rules  lay  down  principles  of  conduct  for  the  protection  of  confidentiality  of corporate information in general, to promote maximum compliance, as also required by Eni's Code of Ethics and corporate security measures. Eni recognizes that information is a strategic asset to be managed in such a way as to ensure the protection of the interests of the Company, shareholders and the market.\n\nIn order to ensure the protection of corporate assets, of the interests of shareholders and the market, as well as the transparency and integrity of conduct, Eni has adopted - in compliance with Consob regulatory provisions - internal rules on transactions involving the interests of directors and statutory auditors and transactions with related parties. These rules were most recently updated in 2021 by the Board of Directors, with the unanimous and favourable opinion of the Control and Risks Committee, with the aim of ensuring regulatory compliance, but also taking into account the experience gained, as well as the indications of the Board Committees and supervisory bodies.\n\nAs regards the prevention and reduction of conflicts of interest, in addition to the regulatory instrument for transactions involving the interests of directors and statutory auditors and transactions with related parties, the Company's Code of Ethics also requires Eni employees to promote the company's interests by making objective decisions and avoiding situations in which conflicts of interest could arise, intervening as envisaged by said Code.",

        "page_content": "Furthermore, the regulations on the function and organisation of the Board of Directors, most recently approved at the meeting on December 16, 2021, state, in line with the provisions of Art. 2391 of the Italian Civil Code, that before each item on the Board meeting's agenda is discussed, each director and statutory auditor must disclose whether they hold any personal interest or interest on behalf of thirdparties in relation to the matters or issues to be discussed, clarifying their nature, terms, origin and extent. The aforesaid regulations also state that, during Board resolutions, directors holding an interest in issues to be deliberated upon do not normally take part in the discussion and resolution, leaving the meeting room.\n\nAn integral part of the Eni internal control system is the internal control system over financial reporting, the objective of which is to provide reasonable certainty of the reliability of financial reporting and the ability of the financial report preparation process to generate such reporting in compliance with generally accepted international accounting standards.\n\nEni's CEO, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Head of Accounting and Financial Statements and budget manager, in his capacity as officer in charge of preparing financial reports, are responsible for planning, establishing  and  maintaining  the  internal  control  system  over  financial  reporting.  A  central  role  in the Company's Internal Control and Risk Management System is played by the Board of Statutory Auditors, which in addition to the supervisory and control functions provided for in the Consolidated Law on Financial Intermediation, also monitors the financial reporting process and the effectiveness of the internal control and risk management systems, consistent with the provisions of the Corporate Governance Code, including in its capacity as the 'Internal Control and Audit Committee' pursuant to Italian law and as the 'Audit Committee' under US law. The responsibilities assigned and the regulatory and reporting instruments defined as part of Eni's Internal Control and Risk Management System, in particular for the purposes of assessing its adequacy and efficacy, also make it possible to identify the 'critical concerns', understood as any complaints with potential impacts on the company's stakeholders. Of the ICRMS instruments, since 2006, Eni has adopted rules governing receipt, analysis and processing of reports (so-called whistleblowing), including those transmitted in confidential or anonymous form, to Eni SpA and to its subsidiaries in Italy and abroad. The rules allow anyone (employees or third parties) to report facts relating to the ICRMS and concerning behaviours in violation of the Code of Ethics, laws, regulations, provisions of the Authorities, or internal regulations, that may cause damage or prejudice, even if only in terms of image, to Eni. The rules (published on the Company's website) define roles and responsibilities related to the investigations and information flows in relation to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer and the Audit Firm, among other parties.",

In particular:\n- -signed an agreement with Snam to jointly develop and manage the Ravenna Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Project, which is intended to gather data to support the planned construction of a large CCS hub, which will leverage Eni's depleted offshore fields in the area. The project Phase 1 is ongoing and from 2024 is expected to begin capturing 25 ktons/year of CO 2 emitted from Eni's natural gas treatment plant in Casalborsetti (Ravenna), to be subsequently transported and injected into a nearby depleted gas field. By 2026, Phase 2 will start the industrial scale up with a storage injection of up to 4 million tons/year;\n- -submitted to the UK authorities an application for carbon storage license for the Hewett depleted field in the UK Southern North Sea, for the development of a CCS project aimed at decarbonising the Bacton and Thames Estuary area. In addition, the set-up of the Bacton Thames Net Zero initiative  was  announced  with  the  aim  to  decarbonise  energy-intensive  and  hard-to-abate industrial businesses in the area.\n- \u00b7 Progressed Eni's initiatives within the Natural Climate Solutions, such as projects focusing on the forest's  protection,  conservation  and  sustainable  management,  mainly  in  developing  Countries, by means of the REDD+ project scheme which was designed by the United Nations as well as the application of technological solutions in different areas to progressively maximize the carbon removal component:\n- -finalized agreements for the future projects development in Ivory Coast, Kenya and Mozambique where feasibility studies are ongoing. In addition, an agreement was signed with the Rwanda Development Board and the non-profit tech start-up Rainforest Connection in Rwanda to testing the application of artificial intelligence technologies in the forest protection and conservation;\n- -launched projects to support the distribution of improved cookstoves (ICS) in the energy poverty areas. In particular, in Ivory Coast over 300,000 people will benefit from an ongoing program of ICS distribution.\n- \u00b7 Signed agreements with the government of Mozambique, Benin and Rwanda, in addition to the ones already finalized with the government of Kenya, Congo, Angola, Kazakhstan and Ivory Coast for biofuel projects through the set-up of integrated agri-biofeedstock value chains to supply renewable feedstock to Eni's biorefineries, without impacting the local food chain and to decarbonize the local energy mix:\n- -Delivered the first cargoes of vegetable oil produced from Kenya to the Eni's biorefinery in Gela. Development program in the County is expected to scale up to 20,000 tons in 2023. Other ongoing initiatives concerned projects in Congo, Mozambique and Ivory Coast, with start-up in 2023;\n- -signed agreement with Bonifiche Ferraresi to evaluate the agribusiness development initiatives in Italy, through the cultivation of oilseeds to be used as feedstocks for biofuels production in degraded, abandoned, or polluted areas, without impacting the food chain.",

Another photovoltaic plant is planned at the Menzel Ledjmet East Project (MLE) production complex, with construction expected to begin in 2023.\n- \u00b7 Start-up of photovoltaic plant in Tataouine, Southern Tunisia, built by a joint venture between Eni and ETAP (Entreprise Tunisienne d'Activit\u00e9s P\u00e9troli\u00e8res) by means of the linkage to the national grid. The plant, with an installed capacity of 10 MW, is expected to supply over 20 GWh of renewable electricity per year under a 20-year Power Purchase Agreement.\n\n## EXPLORATION\n\n- \u00b7 In 2022 around 750 million boe of new resources were added to the reserve base at competitive cost of lower 2 $/barrel continuing the delivery of outstanding exploration performance:\n- -several discoveries were made close to existing assets and facilities as part of our fast-track development model in Algeria, Egypt and Abu Dhabi;\n- -important reserve additions were made with the appraisal wells of the offshore Ndungu oilfield in Angola and of the offshore Baleine oilfield in the Ivory Coast, allowing us to significantly raise the estimated hydrocarbons in place in both cases. The XF-002 in the UAE and the Cronos off Cyprus gas discoveries also significantly contributed to the year's results. The later success of Zeus in Cyprus, still in evaluation at the end of the year and of Nargis in Egypt in January 2023, further confirmed the potential of the East Mediterranean area.\n- \u00b7 Reloading exploration portfolio with the addition of approximately 18,900 square kilometers with the entry in Qatar as well as new leases in Algeria, Egypt, Norway and Ivory Coast.\n- \u00b7 In 2022 exploration expenses were \u20ac605 million (\u20ac558 million in 2021) and included the write-off of unsuccessful wells amounting to \u20ac385 million (\u20ac364 million in 2021), which also related to the writeoff of unproved exploration rights, if any, associated to projects with negative outcome. In particular, exploration and appraisal activities comprised write-offs of unsuccessful exploration wells costs for \u20ac365 million mainly in Libya, Egypt, Ivory Coast, Vietnam and Kenya. Write-offs of \u20ac13 million are related to exploration licenses due mainly to exiting from marginal areas. In addition, 103 exploratory drilled wells are in progress at year-end (50.6 net to Eni).\n\n## DEVELOPMENT\n\n- \u00b7 In  2022,  significant  progress  was  made  in  pursuing  Eni's  distinctive  satellite  model  of  creating independent entities focused on defined areas. In upstream business these entities will continue to bring new volumes to the market for energy security, while freeing additional capital and delivering dividends that allow the Group to optimize investments in its decarbonized energy portfolio:\n- -Azule Energy, the JV combining Eni and bp asset in Angola, started operations as the largest independent Angolan O&G producer to pursue growth opportunities and deliver real value to its shareholders;\n- -Completed with the equity fund HitecVision the listing of V\u00e5r Energi on the Oslo stock exchange, the largest O&G IPO in Europe in 15 years, placing an interest of 16.2% of the investee's share capital.\n- \u00b7 Achieved production start-up of the following projects:\n- -in Algeria, with fast-track development of two gas fields as part of the new Berkine South contract, just six months from the closing, and then, the HDLE/HDLS project, in the Zemlet el Arbi concession in the Berkine North Basin, just six months after the discovery;\n- -in Mozambique with the Coral start-up, in the ultra-deep waters of the Rovuma Basin, marking a milestone in the worldwide LNG business thanks to our ability to deliver the project on time and on budget notwithstanding the pandemic disruptions, while launching the Country as a new relevant LNG hub;\n- -in  Mexico, with the start-up of the Miamte FPSO in the Mizt\u00f3n field and of the Amoca WHP-1 platform, within the full field development of the Area 1 license.",

Proved oil & gas reserves are those quantities of liquids (including condensates and natural gas liquids) and natural gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain.\n\nOil and natural gas prices used in the estimate of proved reserves are obtained from the official survey published by Platt's Marketwire, except when their calculation derives from existing contractual conditions. Prices are calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of- the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period. Prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements.\n\nEngineering  estimates  of  the  Company's  oil  &  gas  reserves  are  inherently  uncertain.  Although authoritative guidelines exist regarding engineering criteria that have to be met before estimated oil & gas reserves can be designated as 'proved', the accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of  the  quality  of  available  data  and  engineering  and  geological  interpretation  and  evaluation. Consequently, the estimated proved reserves of oil and natural gas may be subject to future revision and upward and downward revisions may be made to the initial booking of reserves due to analysis of new information.\n\nProved reserves to which Eni is entitled under concession contracts are determined by applying Eni's equity interest to total proved reserves of the contractual area, until expiration of the relevant mineral right. Eni's proved reserves entitlements at PSAs are calculated so that the sale of production entitlements cover expenses incurred by the Group for field development (Cost Oil) and recognize a share of profit set contractually (Profit Oil). A similar scheme applies to service contracts.\n\n## Reserves governance\n\nEni retains rigorous control over the process of booking proved reserves, through a centralized model of reserves governance. The Reserves Department of the Exploration & Production segment is  in  charge of: (i) ensuring the periodic certification process of proved reserves; (ii) updating the",

        "page_content": "Company's guidelines on reserves evaluation and classification and the internal procedures; and (iii) providing training of staff involved in the process of reserves estimation.\n\nCompany guidelines have been reviewed by DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M), an independent petroleum engineering company, which stated that those guidelines comply with the SEC rules 1 . D&M has also stated that the Company guidelines provide reasonable interpretation of facts and circumstances in line with generally accepted practices in the industry whenever SEC rules may be less precise. When participating in exploration and production activities operated by other entities, Eni estimates its share of proved reserves on the basis of the above guidelines.\n\nThe process for estimating reserves, as described in the internal procedure, involves the following roles and responsibilities: (i) the business unit managers (geographic units) and Local Reserves Evaluators (LRE) are in charge with estimating and classifying gross reserves including assessing production profiles, capital expenditure, operating expenses and costs related to asset retirement obligations; (ii) the petroleum engineering department and the operations unit at the head office verify the production profiles of such properties where significant changes have occurred and operating expenses, respectively; (iii) geographic area managers verify the commercial conditions and the progress of the projects; (iv) the Planning and Control Department provides the economic evaluation  of  reserves;  and  (v)  the  Reserves  Department,  through  the  Headquarter  Reserves Evaluators (HRE), provides independent reviews of fairness and correctness of classifications carried out by the above-mentioned units and aggregates worldwide reserves data.\n\nThe head of the Reserves Department attended the La Sapienza University of Rome and received a degree in Environmental Engineering and received a Master's in petroleum engineering from Imperial College of London. He has 20 years of experience in evaluating reserves.\n\nStaff involved in the reserves evaluation process fulfils the professional qualifications requested by the role and complies with the required level of independence, objectivity and confidentiality in accordance with professional ethics. Reserves Evaluators qualifications comply with international standards defined by the Society of Petroleum Engineers.\n\n## Reserves independent evaluation\n\nEni has its proved reserves audited on a rotational basis by independent oil engineering companies 2 . The  description  of  qualifications  of  the  persons  primarily  responsible  for  the  reserves  audit  is included in the third-party audit report. In the preparation of their reports, independent evaluators rely upon information furnished by Eni, without independent verification, with respect to property interests, production, current costs of operations and development, sales agreements, prices and other factual information and data that were accepted as represented by the independent evaluators. These data, equally used by Eni in its internal process, include logs, directional surveys, core and PVT (Pressure Volume Temperature) analysis, maps, oil/gas/water production/injection data of wells, reservoir studies, technical analysis relevant to field performance, development plans, future capital and operating costs.\n\nIn order to calculate the net present value of Eni's equity reserves, actual prices applicable to hydrocarbon sales, price adjustments required by applicable contractual arrangements and other pertinent information are provided by Eni to third-party evaluators. In 2022 3 , Ryder Scott Company and Sproule provided an independent evaluation of approximately 27% of Eni's total proved reserves at December 31, 2022 4 , confirming, as in previous years, the reasonableness of Eni internal evaluation. In the 2020-2022 three-year period, 90% of Eni total proved reserves were subject to an independent evaluation. As at December 31, 2022, the Nen\u00e9 and Litchendjili fields in Congo were the main Eni assets, which did not undergo an independent evaluation in the last three years.\n\n- (1) The reports of independent engineers are available on Eni website eni.com section Publications/Integrated Annual Report 2016.

Net additions to proved reserves were 278 mmboe and derived from: (i) revisions of previous estimates were positive for 88 mmboe (including the effect of an updating of the gas conversion factor of 30 mmboe) and mainly derived from the Nen\u00e9 field in Congo and the E Structure fields in Libya partly offset by negative changes in some fields in Nigeria. Revisions also included net negative price effects of 34 mmboe due to an increase in oil price environment where the Brent reference price used in the reserve estimation process was 101 $/barrel in 2022, much higher than the 69 $/barrel used in 2021. This price effect was determined to the recovery of volumes reserves which were previously uneconomic in the 2021 scenario more than offset by net lower reserves entitlements under PSA contracts. Revisions of previous estimates were positive in Azule and V\u00e5r Energi for 74 mmboe and 66 mmboe, respectively; (ii) extensions and discoveries were up by 179 mmboe, mainly due to the final investment decision made for the Baleine project in Ivory Coast as well as the Bashrush project in Egypt. In Azule new discoveries were 54 mmboe while in V\u00e5r Energi were up by 7 mmboe and mainly related to Bl\u00e5bj\u00f8rn, Verdande and Halten East fields; and (iii) improved recovery of 11 mmboe mainly related to the Mizton project in Mexico and Azule activities.\n\nPortfolio transactions were positive for 296 mmboe and mainly related to: (i) the purchase of 3% interest in the North Field East LNG project in Qatar; (ii) the purchase of the BHP asset in Algeria and other minor assets in Italy and the United States; (iii) sales of 16.2% stake in our associates V\u00e5r Energi following the process of listing the investee at the local stock exchange; (iv) the disposal of our production assets in Pakistan and our interest in the OML 11 block in Nigeria; and (v) the business combination between Eni and bp, leading to the creation of Azule Energy, an equity-accounted joint venture (Eni's interest 50%). and all sources reserves replacement ratio was 47% and 98%, respectively. The reserves life\n\nThe organic 5 index was 11.3 years (10.8 years in 2021).\n\nFor further information, please see the additional information on Oil & Gas producing activities required by the SEC in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n(5) Organic ratio of changes in proved reserves for the year resulting from revisions of previously reported reserves, improved recovery, extensions and discoveries, to production for the year. All sources ratio includes sales or purchases of minerals in place. A ratio higher than 100% indicates that more proved reserves were added than produced in a year. The Reserves Replacement Ratio is not an indicator of future production because the ultimate development and production of reserves is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. These include the risks associated with the successful completion of large-scale projects, including addressing ongoing regulatory issues and completion of infrastructure, as well as changes in oil and gas prices, political risks and geological and environmental risks.",

At year-end, proved undeveloped reserves of liquids amounted to 1,104 mmbbl and of natural gas amounted to 6,943 bcf, mainly concentrated in Africa and Asia. Proved undeveloped reserves of consolidated subsidiaries amounted to 727 mmbbl of liquids and 4,759 bcf of natural gas. The table below provide a summary of changes in total proved undeveloped reserves for 2022.\n\n|                                                     | (mmboe)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2021 | 2,020     |\n| Additions                                           | (317)     |\n| Extensions and discoveries                          | 152       |\n| Revisions of previous estimates                     | 227       |\n| Improved recovery                                   | 4         |\n| Portfolio                                           | 337       |\n| Proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2022 | 2,423     |\n\nDuring  2022,  Eni  matured  317  mmboe  of  proved  undeveloped  reserves  to  proved  developed reserves due to progress in development activities, production start-ups and project revisions. The main reclassifications to proved developed reserves related to the following fields/projects: Coral in Mozambique, Kashagan in Kazakhstan and Amoca in Mexico.\n\nFor further information, please see the additional information on Oil & Gas producing activities required by the SEC in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn 2022, capital expenditure amounted to approximately \u20ac7.1 billion to progress the development of PUDs.\n\nReserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect the timing of the projects development and execution, such as the complexity of development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructures or plant capacity and contractual  limitations  that  establish  production  levels.  The  Company  estimates  that  0.6  bboe  of proved undeveloped reserves have remained undeveloped for five years or more at the balance sheet date and increased from 2021. The proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more at the balance sheet date mainly related to: (i) certain Libyan gas fields (0.4 bboe) where development completion and production start-ups are planned according to the delivery obligations set forth in a long-term gas supply agreement currently in force; (ii) Johan Castberg project for V\u00e5r Energi, the development of which is ongoing and first oil is expected in the last quarter of 2024 (0.1 bboe); and (iii) other fields in Italy and Iraq (0.1 bboe) where development activities are in progress.\n\n## Delivery commitments\n\nEni, through consolidated subsidiaries and equity-accounted entities, sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Some of these contracts, mostly relating to natural gas, specify the delivery of fixed and determinable quantities.\n\nEni is contractually committed under existing contracts or agreements to deliver in the next three years mainly natural gas to third parties for a total of approximately 576 mmboe from producing assets  located  mainly  in  Algeria,  Australia,  Egypt,  Ghana,  Indonesia,  Kazakhstan,  Libya,  Nigeria, Norway and Venezuela.\n\nThe sales contracts contain a mix of fixed and variable pricing formulas that are generally indexed to the market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products. Management believes it  can  satisfy  these  contracts  from  quantities  available  mainly  from  production  of  the  Company's proved developed reserves and supplies from third parties based on existing contracts. Production is expected to account for approximately 99% of delivery commitments.\n\nEni has met all contractual delivery commitments as of December 31, 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Oil and gas production\n\nIn 2022 hydrocarbon production averaged 1.610 million boe/d, down by 4.3% compared to 2021. The decrease was due to planned and unplanned outages in Kazakhstan, local issues in Nigeria, lower production in Norway and Egypt as well as mature fields decline. Production was supported by the start-up of the Coral project in Mozambique and the Amoca project in Mexico, higher activity in Algeria, also following the business acquisition, and in the United States as well as the progressive easing of OPEC+ production quotas (particularly in the United Arab Emirates).\n\nLiquid production was 751 kbbl/d, down 7.6% compared to 2021. The reduction in Kazakhstan, Norway and Nigeria as well as mature fields decline was partly offset by production growth in Algeria, Mexico and in the United States as well as the progressive easing of OPEC+ production quotas.\n\nNatural gas production was 4,523 mmcf/d, down 2.3% compared to 2021. Lower production in Norway, Nigeria and Egypt as well as mature fields decline was partly offset by production growth in Algeria and Mozambique.\n\nOil and gas production sold amounted to 532 mmboe. The 56 mmboe difference over production (588 mmboe) mainly reflected volumes of natural gas consumed in operations (45 mmboe), changes in inventory levels and other variations. Approximately 63% of liquids production sold (270 mmbbl) was destined to Eni's  Refining  &  Marketing  business.  About  16%  of  natural  gas  production  sold (1,381 bcf) was destined to Eni's Global Gas & LNG Portfolio segment.",

natural gas from cubic feet to boe has been updated to 1 barrel of oil = 5,263 cubic feet of gas (it was 1 barrel of oil = 5,310 cubic feet of gas). The effect of this update on production expressed in boe was approximately 3 mmboe for the full year of 2022. Other per-boe indicators were only marginally affected by the update (e.g. realized prices, costs per boe) and also negligible was the impact on depletion charges. Other oil companies may use different conversion rates.",

The overall commercial success rate was 45% (44% net to Eni) as compared to 54% (49% net to Eni) in 2021 and 28% (30% net to Eni) in 2020.\n\n## EXPLORATORY WELL ACTIVITY\n\n|                       | Net wells completed (a)   | Net wells completed (a)   | Net wells completed (a)   | Net wells completed (a)   | Net wells completed (a)   | Net wells completed (a)   | Wells in progress  at Dec. 31 (b)   | Wells in progress  at Dec. 31 (b)   |\n|-----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                       | 2022                      | 2022                      | 2021                      | 2021                      | 2020                      | 2020                      | 2022                                | 2022                                |\n| (number)              | productive                | dry c)                    | productive                | dry (c)                   | productive                | dry (c)                   | gross                               | net                                 |\n| Italy                 |                           |                           |                           |                           |                           |                           |                                     |                                     |\n| Rest of Europe        | 0.4                       | 1.2                       | 0.1                       | 0.3                       | 0.8                       | 0.4                       | 26.0                                | 6.7                                 |\n| North Africa          | 1.0                       | 4.0                       |                           |                           | 0.5                       | 1.5                       | 9.0                                 | 6.0                                 |\n| Egypt                 | 4.4                       | 4.3                       | 5.0                       | 5.0                       | 0.7                       | 1.5                       | 12.0                                | 10.3                                |\n| Sub-Saharan Africa    | 3.7                       | 2.4                       | 1.1                       | 0.4                       | 0.1                       | 0.9                       | 39.0                                | 19.7                                |\n| Kazakhstan            |                           |                           |                           |                           |                           | 1.1                       |                                     |                                     |\n| Rest of Asia          | 0.7                       | 1.0                       | 0.7                       | 1.0                       | 0.8                       | 0.9                       | 13.0                                | 5.7                                 |\n| Americas              |                           |                           |                           | 0.7                       |                           | 0.6                       | 3.0                                 | 1.9                                 |\n| Australia and Oceania |                           |                           |                           |                           |                           |                           | 1.0                                 | 0.3                                 |\n|                       | 10.2                      | 12.9                      | 7.0                       | 7.4                       | 2.9                       | 6.9                       | 103.0                               | 50.6                                |\n\n- (a) Includes number of wells in Eni's share.\n- (b) Includes temporary suspended wells pending further evaluation.\n- (c) A dry well is an exploratory, development, or extension well that proves to be incapable of producing either oil or gas sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or gas well.",

As of December 31, 2022, Eni's mineral right portfolio consisted of 752 exclusive or shared rights of exploration and development activities for a total acreage of 308,550 square kilometers net to Eni (335,501 square kilometers net to Eni as of December 31, 2021), of which 643 square kilometers related to the CCUS activities in Norway and the United Kingdom. Developed acreage was 27,262 square kilometers and undeveloped acreage was 281,288 square kilometers net to Eni.\n\nIn 2022, main changes derived from: (i) the entry in Qatar and new leases were purchased or awarded in Algeria, Egypt, Norway, and Ivory Coast as well as the CCUS project in Norway for a total increase in acreage of approximately 18,900 square kilometers; (ii) relinquishment for the year related mainly to South Africa, Myanmar, Bahrain, Greenland, Ireland, Pakistan, Italy, Mozambique and Montenegro covering an acreage of approximately 39,650 square kilometers; (iii) interest increases were reported mainly in Vietnam, Algeria and Congo for a total acreage of approximately 1,450 square kilometers; and (iv) partial relinquishment was reported mainly in Angola, Indonesia and Norway for approximately 7,700 square kilometers.\n\nThe gross undeveloped acreages that will expire in the next three years are related to exploration leases, blocks, concessions in: (i) Rest of Europe, in particular in Albania and Cyprus; (ii) Rest of Asia, in particular in Oman, Vietnam, Indonesia, Russia and United Arab Emirates; (iii) North Africa, in particular in Morocco and Libya; (iv) Sub-Saharan Africa, in particular in Kenya, Ivory Coast and Mozambique; and (v) Americas, in particular in Mexico. In most cases extension or renewal options are contractually defined and may or may not be exercised depending on the results of the studies and the planned activities. Management believes that a significant amount of acreage will be maintained following extension or renewal.",

        "page_content": "## Main exploration and development project\n\nEni's  exploration  and  production  activities  are  conducted  in  many  Countries  and  are  therefore subject  to  a  broad  range  of  legislation  and  regulations.  These  cover  virtually  all  aspects  of exploration and production activities, including matters such as license acquisition, production rates, royalties, pricing, environmental protection, export, taxes and foreign exchange. The terms and condition of the leases, licenses and contracts under which these Oil & Gas interests are held vary from Country to Country. These leases, licenses and contracts are generally granted by or entered into with a government entity or state company and are sometimes entered into with private property owners. These contractual arrangements usually take the form of concession agreements or production sharing agreements.\n\nConcessions contracts. Eni operates under concession contracts mainly in Western Countries. Concessions  contracts  regulate  relationships  between  States  and  oil  companies  with  regards to  hydrocarbon  exploration  and  production  activity.  Contractual  clauses  governing  mineral concessions, licenses and exploration permits regulate the access of Eni to hydrocarbon reserves. The company holding the mining concession has an exclusive right on exploration, development and production activities, sustaining all the operational risks and costs related to the exploration and development activities, and it is entitled to the productions realized. As a compensation for mineral concessions, pays royalties on production (which may be in cash or in-kind) and taxes on oil revenues to the state in accordance with local tax legislation. Both exploration and production licenses are granted generally for a specified period of time (except for production licenses in the United States which remain in effect until production ceases): the term of Eni's licenses and the extent to which these licenses may be renewed vary by area. Proved reserves to which Eni is entitled are determined by applying Eni's share of production to total proved reserves of the contractual area, in respect of the duration of the relevant mineral right.\n\nProduction  Sharing  Agreement  (PSA). Eni  operates  under  PSA  in  several  of  the  foreign jurisdictions mainly in African, Middle Eastern, Far Eastern Countries. The mineral right is awarded to the national oil company jointly with the foreign oil company that has an exclusive right to perform exploration, development and production activities and can enter into agreements with other local or international entities. In this type of contract, the national oil company assigns to the international contractor the task of performing exploration and production with the contractor's equipment (technologies) and financial resources. Exploration risks are borne by the contractor and  production  is  divided  into  two  portions:  'Cost  Oil'  is  used  to  recover  costs  borne  by  the contractor and 'Profit Oil' is divided between the contractor and the national company according to variable schemes and represents the profit deriving from exploration and production. Further terms and conditions of these contracts may vary from Country to Country. Pursuant to these contracts, Eni is entitled to a portion of a field's reserves, the sale of which is intended to cover expenditures incurred by the Company to develop and operate the field. The Company's share of production volumes and reserves representing the Profit Oil includes the share of hydrocarbons which corresponds to the taxes to be paid, according to the contractual agreement, by the national government  on  behalf  of  the  Company.  As  a  consequence,  the  Company  has  to  recognize  at the same time an increase in the taxable profit, through the increase of the revenues, and a tax expense. Proved reserves to which Eni is entitled under PSAs are calculated so that the sale of production entitlements should cover expenses incurred by the Group to develop a field (Cost Oil) and recognize the Profit Oil set contractually (Profit Oil). A similar scheme applies to some service contracts.\n\n## Italy\n\nIn the gas assets of the Adriatic Sea, development activities concerned: (i) maintenance and production optimization intervention at the Bonaccia, Arianna and Basil offshore fields; and (ii) decommissioning plan to plug-in depleted wells and to remove idle platforms progressed in the year in compliance with Italian Ministerial Decree February 15, 2019 'Linee guida nazionali per la dismissione mineraria delle piattaforme per la coltivazione in mare e delle infrastrutture connesse'. The decommissioning process is ongoing as required by the Ministerial Decree for the first 10 platforms.",

        "page_content": "Within Eni's strategy to minimize carbon footprint, a program was launched to build a hub for the capture and storage of CO 2 (Carbon Capture and Storage - CCS) in depleted fields off the coast of Ravenna with a potential CO 2 store capacity of 500 million tonnes/year. The development program includes a Phase 1 of project to build a CCS plant to storage 25 ktonnes/year of CO 2 from 2024. In December 2022 Phase 1 was sanctioned. By 2026, Phase 2 will start the industrial scale up with a storage injection of 4 million tonnes/year.\n\nIn 2022 the Energy Valley project activities progressed and concerned certain initiatives with the  support  of  local  stakeholders,  in  the  area  nearby  at  the  Val  d'Agri  Oil  Center,  relating  to environmental sustainability, innovation, rehabilitation and enhancement of the area. In particular: (i) the agricultural rehabilitation programs through the 'Agricultural Center for Experimentation and Training' project with sustainable agricultural initiatives and experimental crops; and (ii) training activities also by means of the partnership agreement with the CNH industrial company in the farm mechanization; and (iii) biomonitoring programs with innovative techniques.\n\nIn June 2022 Eni, Shell and the Basilicata Region, signed a Memorandum of Intent for a sustainable development of the ten-year program at the Val d'Agri concession. The agreement provides for: (i) energy transition and circular economy projects; (ii) development initiatives to enhance the area and socio-economic, cultural and environmental programs; and (iii) partnerships and networks developments with local and national stakeholders as well as local resources.\n\nWithin the Memorandum of Understanding for the Gela area, signed with the Ministry of Economic Development in November 2014, the construction activities of the gas treatment plant progressed at the Argo and Cassiopeia development project (Eni's interest 60%). The project will be developed in about 3 years with an investment of over \u20ac800 million.\n\nThe  onshore  and  offshore  project  facilities  will  speed  up  the  development  of  any  additional production resulting from the exploratory programs following the regulatory update to relaunch domestic natural gas production. Natural gas production start-up is expected in the first half of 2024. Project configuration and design will support to achieve the carbon neutrality target (Scope 1 and 2).\n\nWithin the local support communities' initiatives, according to the ratification of the framework agreement with the Fondazione Banco Alimentare Onlus, Banco Alimentare della Sicilia Onlus and the Municipality of Gela, activities were launched to create a food storage and distribution center for disadvantaged communities.\n\n## Rest of Europe\n\nNorway During 2022, Eni and the private equity fund HitecVision, shareholders of V\u00e5r Energi, have finalized the process of listing the investee at the local stock exchange, the largest O&G IPO in Europe in 15 years, placing about a 16.2% interest. Following the closing Eni's interest is 63.1%.\n\nExploration activity yielded positive results with the Lupa (Eni's interest 31.54%), Snofonn (Eni's interest 18.92%) and Skavl Sto (Eni's interest 18.92%) discoveries in the Barents Sea, and the Calypso discovery (Eni's interest 12.61%) in the Norwegian Sea.\n\nThe  mineral  interest  portfolio  increased  with  twelve  exploration  licenses  (five  of  which  are operated) following the 'Awards in Predefined Areas 2022' (APA) by the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy of Norway. The licenses are distributed over the three main sections of the Norwegian continental shelf. The new acquired licenses are located in both near-fields already in production or development areas with high exploration mineral potential.\n\nIn 2022, V\u00e5r Energi acquired: (i) 30% and operatorship of the PL820S and PL820 SB production licenses, north of the Balder field in the North Sea. The transaction is pending government approval; and (ii) the 40% stake and operatorship of the PL 917 and PL  917B production licenses, west of the Balder field, through an equity swap with Aker BP in PL 956 and PL 985 licenses. The transaction has been approved by the authorities. These transactions are part of the long-term growth strategy focused on the North Sea hubs and will be included in the further development of the Balder area. Development activities mainly concerned: (i) the Johan Castberg (Eni's interest 18.92%) sanctioned project with start-up expected in 2024; (ii) the Balder X sanctioned project in the PL 001 license, located in the North Sea. The Balder project scheme provides for drilling additional productive wells,",

Eni plans to offset its residual emissions by leveraging on the Natural Climate Solutions initiatives and the technological applications in different areas to progressively maximize the carbon removal. These initiatives are expected to achieve a carbon credits portfolio on yearly basis to offset less than 25 million tons of CO 2 in 2050.\n\n## Natural Climate Solutions\n\nWithin  the  Natural  Climate  Solutions  (NCS)  area,  starting  from  2019  Eni  launched  the  forest protection,  conservation  and  sustainable  management  projects,  in  particular  in  developing Countries. The forest projects are considered the most significant at internationally level within climate change mitigation strategies.\n\nThese projects are framed in the REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) scheme. The REDD+ scheme was designed by the United Nations (in particular within the UNFCCC - United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) and involves conservation forest activities to reduce emissions and improve the natural storage capacity of CO 2 , as well as supporting, with a different development model, the local communities through socio-economic projects, in line with sustainable management, forest protection and biodiversity conservation. In this scheme, Eni's protection forest activities support national governments, local communities and UN agencies in the REDD+ strategies, in line with the NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions) and National Development Plans and, mainly, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of UN.\n\nEni built solid partnerships over time with recognized international developers of REDD+ projects that allows to oversee every phase of the projects, from the design to the implementation up to verify the reduction emissions, with an active role in the governance of the project. The Eni's role is essential to allow the alignment with the REDD+ scheme and also with highest standards for certification of the carbon emissions reduction (Verified Carbon Standard - VCS) and social and environmental effects (Climate Community & Biodiversity Standards - CCB), internationally recognized.\n\nMain  initiatives  supported  by  Eni  are  Luangwa  Community  Forest  Project  (LCFP)  and  Lower Zambezi REDD+ Project (LZRP) in Zambia, Kulera in Malawi, Ntakata Mountains in Tanzania and Amigos de Calakmul, in Mexico. In 2022 Eni achieved allowance of carbon credits by the projects to offset GHG emissions equivalent to about 3.5 million tons of CO 2 .\n\nDuring 202 Eni finalized agreements to support the future development projects in Ivory Coast, Kenya and Mozambique where feasibility studies are underway.\n\nIn November 2022 Eni signed an agreement with the Rwanda Development Board and the non-profit tech start-up Rainforest Connection in Rwanda to testing the application of artificial intelligence technologies in the forest protection and conservation.\n\nEni  continues  to  evaluate  further  NCS  initiatives  in  restoration  and  sustainable  management ecosystems in Africa, Latin America, and Asia.\n\n## Technological projects\n\nThe technological application in different areas area is one of the levers in the residual emission reduction. In particular, Eni launched projects to promote the Improved Cookstoves (ICS) distribution for cooking food in energy poverty areas and continued to assess initiatives in renewable energy, waste management, agricultural practices improvement that ensuring in addition to climate change mitigation also significant social and environmental benefits for local stakeholders.",

        "page_content": "These initiatives ensure to offset emissions by generating high credits quality, certified according to the highest international environmental standards (Verified Carbon Standard - VCS) and support the achievement of the SDGs (Sustainable Development Verified Impact Standard - SD VISta). In June 2022 Eni launched the distribution of ICS to vulnerable households in Ivory Coast. It is expected that more than 300,000 people form the Region of Gb\u00eak\u00ea Project will benefit from the projects which targeting to deliver 100,000 ICS over a period of 6 years, starting already this year. All the stoves are produced by a local manufacturer, contributing to the development of local content and in-country value creation.\n\nThis activity will enhance Eni's decarbonization strategy in the Baleine discovery development. The project is expected to generate high-quality carbon credits certified by the international standard VERRA amounting to approximately 1 million of VCU (Verified Carbon Units) over the next 10 years. Similar  initiatives  are  planned  in  several  countries,  including  Mozambique,  Congo,  Kenya  and Rwanda.\n\n## Agri-feedstock projects\n\nDuring the year Eni finalized agreement with the authorities of Mozambique, Benin and Rwanda as well as in 2021 in Kenya, Congo, Angola, Kazakhstan and Ivory Coast aiming to promote agricultural initiatives for the cultivation of oil plants to be used as feedstock (Low ILUC feedstock - Indirect Land Use Change) for Eni's biorefineries, enhancing marginal areas not destined to the food chain. The development activities plan is focused on vertical integration and includes agreements to produce oilseeds by local farmers and cooperatives and the construction of oil collection and extraction centers by Eni (Agri Hubs). The supply chain byproducts will be aimed for domestic market and also for export. These initiatives will also support rural development, land restoration through  sustainable  and  regenerative  agriculture,  with  positive  impacts  on  socio-economic development and employment, access to market opportunities as well as human rights protection, health and food security. Further programs are being evaluated in other countries with a model in analogy to the ones applied.\n\nIn particular, in October 2022, a first cargo of vegetable oil, produced at Eni's Makueni agri-hub in Kenya, was shipped to the Eni's biorefinery of Gela. Makueni agri-hub started operations in July 2022. Production of such sustainable oil is expected to scale up rapidly to 20,000 tons by 2023 from current production of 2,500 tones at the end of 2022. The supply chain in Kenya is certified according  to  the  ISCC-EU  (International  Sustainability  and  Carbon  Certification)  sustainability scheme, one of the main voluntary standards recognised by the European Commission for the certification of biofuels (EU RED II). In addition, the agreement reached with Kenya also provides for the engineering activities to conversion the Mombasa traditional refinery to biorefinery for HVO and Biojet production; as well as the collection of UCO (Used Cooking Oil) to be used as feedstock. Other ongoing activities concerned: (i) in Congo, started the cultivation with the first 2 thousand hectares sown. Launched the engineering and construction phases of the first Agri Hub with a capacity of 30 thousand tons/year and start-up in 2023. Full capacity is expected to produce 250 thousand tons starting from 2027; (ii) in Mozambique, in November 2022, started the cultivation of pilot fields and engineering activities of the first Agri Hub with a capacity of 30 thousand tons/year and start-up in 2023. Full capacity is expected to produce 200 thousand tons in 2027; (iii) in Angola, in December 2022, started the cultivation of pilot fields in the Luanda area. The construction area of the Agri-Hub plant has been identified. Production capacity is expected to 30 thousand tons/year; (iv) in Ivory Coast, are ongoing preliminary activities for the production chain definition and the area selection to build the Agri-Hub plant with start-up in 2023; and (v) in Italy, launched a project in partnership with the Bonifiche Ferraresi company, to evaluate the crops development for energy use, recovering degraded or polluted land not destinated to the food chain.\n\nAgricultural  productions  projects  started  or  under  development  will  respond  to  the  ISCC-EU sustainability certification scheme.\n\nOverall target production is expected to subsequently reach an agri-feedstock volume of over 700 thousand tonnes by 2026 leveraging on planned initiatives.",

Eni and Sonatrach signed strategic agreements to accelerate emissions reduction and strengthen energy security. In particular, opportunities for the reduction of greenhouse gas and methane gas emissions will be identified and will be defined energy efficiency initiatives, renewable energy developments, green hydrogen projects and carbon dioxide capture and storage projects, to support energy security and a sustainable energy transition. In addition, studies will be conducted to identify possible measures to improve Algerian energy export capacity to Europe.\n\n## DEVELOPMENT OF LNG BUSINESS\n\nIn  June 2022, in the LNG business, Eni entered in the North Field East LNG project in Qatar, the world's largest, expanding its presence in the Middle East and gaining access to a leading country in the LNG production. In August, Eni acquired the Tango FLNG floating liquefaction plant, that will be used in the Republic of Congo, as part of the activities of the natural gas development project Marine Block XII. The plant has an LNG production capacity of approximately 0.6 million tons/year (about 1 billion standard cubic meters/year). Furthermore, in December among the same project, a turnkey contract for construction, installation and commissioning activities of a FLNG floating unit with a capacity of 2.4 million tons/year was signed. This plant, together with the Tango FLNG ship, acquired earlier, will accelerate the Eni development plan in the area. LNG production is expected to reach plateau capacity of 3 million tons/year in 2025.\n\n## PORTFOLIO DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn January 2023, as part of Eni's portfolio optimization, Eni finalized the sale to Snam of the 49.9% interest (directly and indirectly held) in the companies operating two groups of international gas pipelines connecting Algeria to Italy, in particular the onshore pipelines that extend from the border between Algeria and Tunisia to the Tunisian coast (TTPC) and the offshore pipelines connecting the  Tunisian  coast  to  Italy  (TMPC).  These  interests  were  transferred  by  Eni  to  SeaCorridor  Srl held by Snam (49.9% interest) and Eni (50.1% interest). Eni and Snam exercise joint control over SeaCorridor, based on the principles of equal governance.\n\n## Natural gas\n\n## Supply of natural gas\n\nEni's consolidated subsidiaries supplied 60.59 bcm of natural gas, decreased by 10.39 bcm or by 14.6% from the full year 2021.\n\nGas volumes supplied outside Italy from consolidated subsidiaries (57.19 bcm), imported in Italy or sold outside Italy, represented approximately 94% of total supplies, decreased by 10.20 bcm or by 15.1% from the full year 2021. This mainly reflected lower volumes purchased in Russia (down by 13.01 bcm), in Norway (down by 0.77 bcm), in the UK (down by 0.74 bcm), in Libya (down by 0.56 bcm) and in Indonesia (down by 0.45 bcm) partly offset by higher purchases in Algeria (up by 1.74 bcm), in the other European markets, in particular France, Germany and Spain (overall increase of 5.72 bcm). Supplies in Italy (3.40 bcm) reported a decrease of 5.3% from the full year 2021.",

        "page_content": "## BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS AND PORTFOLIO TRANSACTION\n\nIn January 2023, as a part of the Group's satellite strategy to set-up new dedicated entities to accelerate the decarbonization of its customer portfolio (Scope 3 emission), Eni established the new entity Eni Sustainable Mobility. The company is vertically integrated and will support Eni's energy transition by combining the offer of increasingly sustainable fuel with advanced services for drivers in Italy and Europe, leveraging on a network of 5,000 service stations, that will be also enhanced to support electric and hydrogen-based mobility. Eni Sustainable Mobility will manage Eni's biorefining and biomethane assets and will continue the development of new projects, including those at Livorno and Pengerang in Malaysia, which are currently under evaluation.\n\nIn line with the energy transition path, in 2022 the development of green chemistry business progressed through the strengthening of the partnership with Novamont. The commitment to Matr\u00ecca - the joint venture set up between Versalis and Novamont at Porto Torres specializing in manufacturing bioproducts from renewable sources - has been reaffirmed aiming at enhancing technologies and productive assets in order to fully develop its products, also within supply chains integrated with the two partners, by focusing on growth in the previously referenced markets. In this context, shareholder agreements have also been redefined: Versalis has increased its interest in Novamont from 25% to 35%.\n\n## BIOREFINING AND BIOFEEDSTOCK BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS\n\nIn October 2022, a first cargo of vegetable oil for biorefining, produced at Eni's Makueni agri-hub in Kenya, has been shipped to Gela's biorefinery. Vegetable oil is obtained processing castor, croton, and cotton seeds. The initial production of 2,500 tons in 2022, is planned to scale up rapidly to 20,000 tons in 2023. This project marks the start of Eni's innovative model of agri-business vertically integrated with its biorefineries, supplying sustainable feedstock not competing with the food chain and capable of significantly contribute to local development and to the circular economy. This model will be replicated in other African countries, long-term partners of Eni. In addition, in October, the phase-out of palm oil as feedstock supply for Eni's biorefineries was completed, fully replacing by sustainable raw materials.\n\nAs a part of Eni's decarbonisation strategy and with the aim to increase the availability of decarbonized and sustainable products to our customers and to achieve the Scope 1+2+3 emission reduction targets, in October an economic feasibility study of the construction and management of a biorefinery in Livorno was launched. The project involves three new plants for the production of hydrogenated biofuels: a biogenic feedstock pre-treatment unit, a 500,000 ton/year Ecofining\u2122 plant and a plant for the production of hydrogen from methane gas. The transformation plan for the Livorno refinery will be discussed with local institutions and trade unions, within the framework of a participatory and inclusive industrial relations model.\n\nIn December, Eni, Euglena and Petronas started a collaboration in order to estimate the economic feasibility for the construction and management of a biorefinery in Malaysia in the Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC). The three parties are currently carrying out technical and economic feasibility assessments for the proposed project. The investment decision is expected to be reached by 2023 and the plant is targeted to be operational by 2025. The expected capacity of the biorefinery is about 650,000 tonnes/y with an expected production capacity up to 12,500 barrels/d of biofuel (SAF, HVO and bionaphtha). The raw materials will not compete with those in the food",

        "page_content": "chain. The biorefinery will use the Honeywell UOP's Ecofining\u2122 process which was developed by Eni in cooperation with Honeywell UOP.\n\nIn February 2023, a collaboration agreement was announced with the refining company PBF relating to the St. Bernard Renewables LLC (SBR) biorefining project, under construction in Louisiana (USA) through a joint venture. The transaction, subject to the usual closing conditions, involves a capital injection of $835 million by the subsidiary Eni Sustainable Mobility and the contribution of the biorefining technologies. The start-up of the plant is expected in the first half of 2023 with the target of a processing capacity of about 1.1 million tons/year, mainly for the production of HVO Diesel.\n\n## SUSTAINABLE MOBILITY INITIATIVES\n\nAs a part of the path of transport and mobility decarbonization, Eni signed a letter of intent with IVECO to develop a sustainable mobility platform for commercial fleets by offering innovative vehicles powered by biofuels and other sustainable energy vectors, such as HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil), biomethane, hydrogen and electricity and the related infrastructure. The areas of collaboration include Eni's offer of 100%-pure HVO for IVECO heavy trucks equipped with engines able to operate on it. HVO biofuels derived from materials of vegetable origin and waste, produced using the proprietary Ecofining\u2122 technology at Eni's  Venice  and  Gela  biorefineries.  100%-pure  HVO enables CO 2 emission reductions of 60% to 90% (calculated throughout the lifecycle) compared to the standard fossil fuel mix.\n\nFurthermore, Eni and IVECO intend to speed up the market availability of biomethane, a renewable fuel from agro-industrial waste, which can be both compressed (CNG) and liquified (LNG). This will be made possible through partnerships in Italy and abroad.\n\nIn  order  to  develop  projects  for  the  air  transport  decarbonization,  Eni  in  December  signed  an agreement with DHL Express Italy and SEA Group, which manages Milan Malpensa and Milan Linate airports to test Eni Biojet, a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) 20% blended with JetA1 and produced exclusively from waste raw materials, animal fat and used vegetable oils. In 2022, some flights departing from Malpensa were be powered also by SAF produced by Eni in its Livorno refinery in partnership with Eni's biorefinery in Gela.\n\nIn February 2023, Eni signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Saipem finalized to boost biofuels on Saipem's drilling and construction naval vessels, with particular attention to operations in the Mediterranean Sea. This agreement represents an important milestone for Eni and Saipem, confirming the mutual commitment to diversifying energy sources and to reducing the carbon footprint across offshore operations.\n\nAs part of the development of hydrogen mobility, in June 2022 Eni inaugurated a new Eni-branded hydrogen refuelling station in Mestre (Venice). This is the first road mobility station to open to the public in an urban area in Italy where it is also possible to refuel using hydrogen.\n\nThe system is equipped with two dispensing points with a capacity of over 100 kg/day, which can refuel vehicles in about 5 minutes and buses.\n\nFurthermore in October 2022, two projects by Eni and Enel Green Power to develop green hydrogen will receive public funding approved by the European Commission under IPCEI Hy2Us, the European project aimed at supporting the hydrogen value chain. The electrolyzers with a capacity of 20 MW and 10 MW will be implemented at the Gela biorefinery in Sicily, and at Taranto refinery, respectively. Both will use PEM (polymer electrolyte membrane) technology.",

        "page_content": "## SMART MOBILITY\n\nIn line with the decarbonization strategy, in 2022 Eni strengthened the collaboration with XEV, through a cooperation agreement to explore areas of collaboration concerning research and development into sustainable mobility systems to reduce the environmental impact of vehicles, the development of battery swapping technology and the assembly of the car manufacturer's vehicles. The agreement is aimed at developing the electric city car sector jointly, in particular to implement XEV's battery swapping technology, but also for the possible assembly of XEV vehicles or parts of them in Italy and for the management of the car battery life cycle from production to installation, maintenance and end-of-life through recycling. During 2022, Eni's car sharing service has been expanded through the introduction of the XEV YOYO in Turin, Bologna, Florence and Milan. XEV YOYO is an electric car always in operation thanks to battery swapping, alternative to plug-in columns.\n\n## CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND GREEN CHEMISTRY\n\nAs part of the initiatives aimed at developing circular economy, Versalis in June 2022 announced the start of the use of packaging made from recycled raw materials from post-consumer industrial packaging. To achieve this goal, two projects have been implemented, 'Bag to Bag' and 'Liner to Liner', in order to create a virtuous circle aimed at recovering and recycling industrial polyethylene packaging bags and putting them back into the system.\n\nAs far as the 'Bag to Bag' project is concerned, sacks are made with 50% of recycled materials and are fully recyclable. The project has passed the testing phase at all Versalis operating sites. Currently, the sacks are used at the Ragusa and Ferrara plants and by the end of the year, the project will be operational at Brindisi and at the foreign subsidiaries located in Dunkerque and Oberhausen.\n\nThe 'Liner to Liner' project, developed and applied mainly at the Brindisi site, relates to the interior coverings of containers used for transporting bulk polyethylene, called 'Liners'. They were sent for recycling and transformed into new Liners, containing 50% of recycled plastic. The two projects will help to reduce the consumption of virgin raw materials by 50% respectively with a consequent reduction in terms of CO 2 .\n\nAs part of the transformation process of the Porto Marghera site, Versalis signed a new agreement with Forever Plast, an Italian company, leader in Europe in the recycling of post-consumer plastics. The agreement involves the acquisition of an exclusive licence to build an advanced mechanical recycling unit for selected post-consumer plastics from waste sorting, in particular polystyrene and high-density polyethylene. The plant, which is scheduled to go onstream in 2024 will have a transformation capacity of 50,000 tonnes/y and will produce recycled polymer compounds. The deal also includes an extension of the contract with Forever Plast, which will ensure the volumes required for the expansion of Versalis' portfolio of recycled products and consolidate its current competitive advantage. The company has already started a collaboration based on which new polystyrene compounds with up to 75% of recycled content, already available on the market under the Versalis Revive \u00ae brand, were developed for food packaging, thermal insulation and the electrical sector.\n\nIn December 2022, Versalis acquired from DSM a technology to produce enzymes for second-generation ethanol to be employed at the Crescentino plant to integrate the proprietary Proesa \u00ae technology to deliver sustainable bioethanol and chemical products from lignocellulosic biomass.",

Average throughput per service station (1,445 kliters) increased by 83 kliters from 2021 (1,362 kliters). Eni's retail market share of 2022 was 21.7%, slightly down from 2021 (22.2%).\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Eni's retail network in Italy consisted of 4,003 service stations, lower by 75 units from December 31, 2021 (4,078 service stations), resulting from the negative balance of acquisitions/releases of lease concessions (90 units), the negative balance of the companyowned stations (9 units), partly balanced by the increase of 24 lease stations.\n\n## RETAIL AND WHOLESALES SALES OF REFINED PRODUCTS\n\n|                                   | (mmtonnes)   |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 | Change   | % Ch.   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------|--------|--------|--------|----------|---------|\n| Italy                             |              |  11.57 |  11.14 |  10.31 | 0.43     | 3.8     |\n| Retail sales                      |              |   5.38 |   5.12 |   4.56 | 0.26     | 5.1     |\n| Gasoline                          |              |   1.49 |   1.38 |   1.16 | 0.11     | 8.0     |\n| Gasoil                            |              |   3.54 |   3.38 |   3.1  | 0.16     | 4.7     |\n| LPG                               |              |   0.32 |   0.31 |   0.27 | 0.01     | 3.2     |\n| Others                            |              |   0.03 |   0.05 |   0.03 | (0.02)   | (40.0)  |\n| Wholesale sales                   |              |   6.19 |   6.02 |   5.75 | 0.17     | 2.7     |\n| Gasoil                            |              |   3.04 |   3.11 |   3.11 | (0.07)   | (2.3)   |\n| Fuel Oil                          |              |   0.04 |   0.03 |   0.02 | 0.01     | 33.3    |\n| LPG                               |              |   0.16 |   0.17 |   0.18 | (0.01)   | (5.9)   |\n| Gasoline                          |              |   0.43 |   0.34 |   0.3  | 0.09     | 26.5    |\n| Lubricants                        |              |   0.05 |   0.08 |   0.08 | (0.04)   | (43.8)  |\n| Bunker                            |              |   0.48 |   0.59 |   0.63 | (0.11)   | (18.6)  |\n| Jet fuel                          |              |   1.5  |   0.92 |   0.7  | 0.58     | 63.0    |\n| Other                             |              |   0.49 |   0.78 |   0.73 | (0.29)   | (37.2)  |\n| Outside Italy (retail+wholesale)  |              |   5.08 |   4.82 |   4.93 | 0.26     | 5.4     |\n| Gasoline                          |              |   1.11 |   1.06 |   1.13 | 0.05     | 4.7     |\n| Gasoil                            |              |   2.92 |   2.78 |   2.73 | 0.14     | 5.0     |\n| Jet fuel                          |              |   0.11 |   0.07 |   0.09 | 0.04     | 57.1    |\n| Fuel Oil                          |              |   0.13 |   0.08 |   0.13 | 0.05     | 62.5    |\n| Lubricants                        |              |   0.08 |   0.11 |   0.09 | (0.03)   | (27.3)  |\n| LPG                               |              |   0.53 |   0.53 |   0.5  | 0.00     | 0.0     |\n| Other                             |              |   0.2  |   0.19 |   0.26 | 0.01     | 5.3     |\n| TOTAL RETAIL AND WHOLESALES SALES |              |  16.65 |  15.96 |  15.24 | 0.69     | 4.3     |",

        "page_content": "## RETAIL SALES IN THE REST OF EUROPE\n\nRetail sales in the Rest of Europe were 2.12 mmtonnes, substantially in line with 2021 as result of higher volumes sold in Germany, France, Spain and Austria partly balanced by the decrease of the volumes in Switzerland.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, Eni's retail network in the Rest of Europe consisted of 1.240 units, increasing by 4 unit from December 31, 2021, mainly thanks to the openings in Germany and Austria balanced by the reduction in Switzerland and France. Average throughput (2,027 kliters) increased by 2 kliters compared to 2021 (2,025 kliters).\n\n## WHOLESALE AND OTHER SALES\n\nWholesale sales in Italy amounted to 6.19 mmtonnes, increasing by 2.7% from 2021, due to higher sales of jet fuel for the recovery of the aviation sector which offset lower volumes marketed in all the other segments.\n\nWholesale sales in the Rest of Europe were 2.44 mmtonnes, up by 11.4% from 2021 particularly in Germany, Austria and Spain.\n\nSupplies of feedstock to the petrochemical industry (0.39 mmtonnes) decreased by 25%. Other sales in Italy and outside Italy (10.76 mmtonnes) decreased by 0.74 mmtonnes or down by 6.4% mainly due to lower volumes sold to oil companies.\n\n## Chemicals\n\nPetrochemical sales of 3,676 ktonnes decreased from 2021 (down by 775 ktonnes, or 17.4%). In particular, the main changes were registered in olefine (down by 22.8%), elastomer (down by 18.7%), in the polyethylene (down by 16.4%) and in the styrenic (down by 12.1%).

        "page_content": "Petrochemical production of 6,775 ktonnes were down by 1,701 ktonnes from 2021 due to lower production of intermediates business (down by 1,387 ktonnes), particularly olefins and aromatics.\n\nThe main decreases in production were registered at the Porto Marghera site (down by 821 ktonnes), Dunkerque (down by 563 ktonnes) and Priolo (down by 164 ktonnes).\n\nNominal capacity of plants decreased from 2021. The average plant utilization rate calculated on nominal capacity was 59.0% lower compared to 2021 (66.0% in 2021).\n\n## Business trends\n\n## INTERMEDIATES\n\nIntermediates revenues (\u20ac2,368 million) increased by \u20ac202 million from 2021 (up by 9.3%) mainly reflecting the higher commodity prices scenario. Sales (2,158 ktonnes) decreased by 18.5% vs. 2021. The main reductions were registered in olefins (down by 22.8%), aromatics (down by 15.3%) and derivatives (down by 0.8%).\n\nAverage prices increased by 34.2%, in particular aromatics (up by 47.2%), olefins (up by 32.4%) and derivatives (up by 23.5%). Intermediates production (4,897 ktonnes) registered a decrease of 22.1% from 2021. Decreases were also registered in olefins (down by 24.3%), in the aromatics (down by 22.6%), while a slight increase was reported in derivatives (up by 0.6%).\n\n## POLYMERS\n\nPolymers revenues (\u20ac3,203 million) increased by \u20ac89 million or 2.9% from 2021 due to the increase of the average unit prices. The styrenics business benefitted by the increase of sale prices (up by 25.8%), notwithstanding the reduction of volumes sold (down by 12.1%) for lower product availability and lower demand. The reduction in volumes is mainly attributable to AN (down by 33.1%), EPS (down by 26.8%) and GPPS (down by 11.5%), partly offset by higher sales of ABS (up by 11.9%).\n\nIn the elastomers business, the decrease of sold volumes (down by 17.2%) was attributable to the decline in European and extra-European consumption and to the non-competitive prices, due to the higher energy costs. In particular were registered lower sales of BR (down by 23.7%), SBR (down by 17.9%) and NBR rubbers (down by 17.3%). Overall, the sold volumes of polyethylene business reported a decrease (down by 16.4%) with lower sales of LDPE (down by 27.7%), EVA (down by 12.5%) and HDPE (down by 10.6%). In addition, average sale prices increased by 13.4%.\n\nPolymers productions (1,873 ktonnes) decreased by 14.2% from the 2021 due to the lower productions of polyethylene (down by 17.3%), elastomers (down by 17.2%) and styrenics (down by 10%).\n\n## OILFIELD CHEMICALS, BIOCHEM E MOULDING & COMPOUNDING\n\nOilfiled chemicals revenues (\u20ac83 million) increased by 26.6% (up by \u20ac17 million compared to 2021) as a result of the combined mix of increased unit price for formulations and for the associated services.\n\nBiochem business revenues (\u20ac25 million) decreased by \u20ac35 million from 2021, mainly due to lower production of disinfectant, following the end of the health emergency, partly offset by the sale of energy produced at the biomass power plant at the Crescentino hub, at full capacity.\n\nMoulding & Compounding business revenues of \u20ac327 million include compounding activities for \u20ac78 million, moulding for \u20ac108 million and the Padanaplast activities for \u20ac141 million.",

The acquired company includes 90,000 retail customers in Italy and a capacity portfolio of 1.6 GW. The agreement allows Plenitude to strengthen its presence in the two countries, consolidating a vertically integrated platform.\n- \u00b7 In the United States, Plenitude, through its US subsidiary Eni New Energy US Inc., acquired the 81 MW Kellam photovoltaic plant, located in North Texas. This acquisition has been finalized in January 2023. The plant, sold by Hanwha Qcells USA Corp., joins the other assets within Texas and the rest of the United States in Plenitude's portfolio, which reaches, with this transaction, an installed capacity of 878 MW in the US market. The operation was carried out with the support of Novis Renewables, LLC, a partnership between Eni New Energy US, Inc. and Renantis North America, Inc., which is exclusive for the US and dedicated to the development of solar, wind and storage projects. The plant stands on over 150 hectares of land and the produced energy will be sold to a local power company.\n\nIn order to strengthen the presence in the wind sector and contribute to the expansion of the Norwegian joint venture V\u00e5rgr\u00f8nn, Plenitude and HitecVision have signed an agreement with the aim to consolidate its presence among the most important players in the offshore wind industry. Plenitude, in October, sold to the joint venture its 20% stake in Dogger Bank (UK) which is developing major offshore wind projects. As a result of this transaction, HitecVision increased its stake in V\u00e5rgr\u01a1nn from 30.4% to 35% through a capital injection.\n\nWith the aim to optimize its portfolio, in December 2022, Plenitude sold to Depa Infrastructure, a Greek subsidiary of Italgas, a 49% stake of Eda Thess (Thessaloniki Thessalia Gas Distribution S.A), one of the main operators of the gas infrastructure system in Greece.\n\nFinally,  to  support  the  energy  transition  process,  Plenitude  in  2022  invested  in  innovative technological  solutions,  in  particular  in  EnerOcean  S.L.,  a  Spanish  developer  of  the  W2Power technology  for  floating  wind  power.  The  agreement  is  structured  as  a  long-term  partnership focused on the deployment of the W2Power technology as a lead solution for floating wind power developments worldwide. Plenitude will contribute to the development program of EnerOcean S.L. with capital and expertise and will initially retain a 25% stake in the Company, which will continue to operate independently.\n\n## DEVELOPMENTS IN THE RENEWABLE BUSINESS\n\nIn line with the strategy of energy transition and decarbonization of product and process, Plenitude inaugurated:\n\n- \u00b7 the Badamsha 2 wind farm located in the Aktobe region, Kazakhstan, the second wind installation in the region, allowing to double the installed capacity of Badamsha 1 project (48 MW, for a total amount of 96 MW installed in the Country);\n- \u00b7 the 104.5 MW El Monte wind farm, located in the Spanish region of Castilla La Mancha, built in collaboration with the strategic partner Azora Capital. The plant will produce about 300 GWh/year, equivalent to the domestic consumption of 100,000 households;\n- \u00b7 the 263 MW 'Golden Buckle Solar Project' solar farm in Brazoria County, Texas (USA), in January 2023. The plant was built in just over a year and will produce a yearly average of 400 to 500 GWh of solar energy. The plant development was carried out with the support of Novis Renewables, LLC. GreenIT,  a  joint  venture  with  the  Italian  agency  CDP  Equity,  acquired  the  entire  portfolio  of  Fortore Energia Group, consisting of four onshore wind farms operating in Italy with a total capacity of 110",

Compared to the 2021 average of about 15 $/mmBTU for the European spot reference Title Transfer Facility (TTF) which already represented a historical record, in 2022 values recorded 80-90 $/mmBTU due to fears of shortage for the following winter season in relation to the progressive downsizing of Russian export flows via pipeline, in the context of a continuous deterioration of political relations with the EU.\n\nIn the final part of 2022 and early 2023, natural gas prices, thanks to  a  particularly  mild  winter  season  and  significant  exports  of LNG from the USA, corrected substantially, closing at year end at values equal to or lower than those recorded before the outbreak of the conflict.\n\nRefining margins were supported by a recovery in fuel demand in  all  sectors,  including  civil  aviation,  and  substantial  diesel shortages mainly due to lower supplies from Russia.",

        "page_content": "In FY 2022, the adjusted operating profit was \u20ac20,386 million, an increase of \u20ac10,722 million compared to 2021.\n\nThis performance was driven by the E&P segment due to a strong recovery in commodity prices, by the GGP segment leveraging on  continuing  optimization  across  the  flexible  gas  and  LNG portfolio, as well as by the R&M business due to plant availability and cost and output optimization allowing to capture the upside of a strong refining environment.\n\nThe  operating  performance  achieved  record  results  with  the following breakdown by business segment:\n\n- \u00b7 E&P reported a higher than 70% increase in adjusted operating profit to \u20ac16.4 billion due to its capacity to capture the upside of a favorable commodity environment;\n- \u00b7 GGP reported an operating performance of \u20ac2.1 billion, replacing Russian flows with equity gas or supplies from countries where we operate, and ensuring optimization of the gas and LNG portfolio in a tight market, while ensuring stable and secure supplies to its customers and managing financial risks;\n\n## BREAKDOWN OF SPECIAL ITEMS\n\nNet profit includes special items consisting of net gains of \u20ac185 million, mainly relating to the following:\n\n- i) environmental provision of \u20ac2,056 million taken at dismissed Italian industrial hubs, based on management's accumulate know-how about scale, reach and  timing  of  remediation  activities  and  a  stabilized regulatory  framework,  allowing  reliable  estimate  of the  future  costs  of  the  reclamation  of  groundwater. This  amount  includes  an  approximately  \u20ac300  million decommissioning  charge  relating  to  certain  refinery production units and facilities;\n- ii) asset impairment charges driven by reserve revisions and expenditures updates (\u20ac432 million in the year);\n- iii) impairment losses of chemical plants to reflect a reduced profitability outlook and the write-down of capital expenditures made for compliance and stay-in-business at certain CGU with expected negative cash flows in the R&M business (overall \u20ac717 million);\n- iv) provisions for redundancy incentives (\u20ac202 million);\n- v) the  difference  between  the  value  of  gas  inventories accounted for under the weighted-average cost method provided  by  IFRS  and  management's  own  measure  of inventories, which moves forward at the time of inventory drawdown, the margins captured on volumes in inventories above  normal  levels  leveraging  the  seasonal  spread  in gas prices net of the effects of the associated commodity derivatives (gains of \u20ac70 million);\n- vi) the  accounting  effect  of  certain  fair-valued  commodity derivatives  lacking  the  formal  criteria  to  be  classified  as hedges or to be elected under the own use exemption (gain of \u20ac389 million) driving by high volatility of natural gas prices;\n- vii) the  reclassification  to  adjusted  operating  profit  of  the\n- \u00b7 R&M  achieved  its  best  performance  ever  with  \u20ac2.2  billion, compared to breakeven in 2021, due to plant availability and output optimization allowing to capture the upside of a strong refining environment, and efficiency measures to address the rise in plant utility expenses;\n- \u00b7 Plenitude delivered against its operating and financial targets with EBIT of \u20ac0.34 billion and a renewable capacity of 2.2 GW, despite the challenging market scenario;\n- \u00b7 Versalis was impacted by competitive pressures, weakening demand and higher gas-indexed utilities expenses, driving a loss of \u20ac0.25 billion.\n\nA  detailed  disclosure  on  businesses  performance,  see  the paragraph 'Results by business segments'.\n\nIn FY 2022, adjusted net profit amounted to \u20ac13,301 million, an increase of \u20ac8,971 million from 2021, due to a strong operating performance and higher results of equity-accounted entities.\n\npositive balance of \u20ac149 million related to derivatives used to manage margin exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements and exchange translation differences of commercial payables and receivables;\n\n- viii) risk provisions (\u20ac87 million);\n- ix) a gain of \u20ac2.5 billion (including the reversal of accumulated exchange rate translation differences) arising in connection with  the  contribution  of  Eni's  subsidiaries  operating  in Angola in exchange for a 50% equity interest in the newly established  Azule  Energy  JV  with  bp,  which  has  been recognized to the extent that the gain was attributable to the other party to the joint venture based on the provisions of IAS 28;\n- x) a gain on the share offering of the V\u00e5r Energi investee through an IPO and listing at the Norwegian stock exchange (\u20ac0.4 billion);\n- xi) charges of \u20ac0.3 billion relating to the JV V\u00e5r Energi, driven by impairment losses and currency translation differences at finance debt denominated in a currency other than the reporting currency for which the cash outflows are expected to be matched by highly probable cash inflows from the sale of production volumes, in the same currency as the finance debt as part of a natural hedge relationship;\n- xii) extraordinary income taxes of \u20ac2.2 billion relating to windfall taxes levied on energy companies in Italy and German. Such  charges  included  an  Italian  solidarity  contribution enacted  by  Budget  Law  2023  calculated  on  the  2022 taxable income, determined considering the distribution of certain revaluation reserves of the parent company;\n- xiii) recognized deferred tax assets of about \u20ac2.2 billion:\n- xiv)  Eni's share of non current charges/impairments relating to Saipem (charges of \u20ac22 million).",

It enables investors to understand the connection existing between changes in cash and cash equivalents (deriving from the statutory cash flows statement) and in net borrowings (deriving from the summarized cash flow statement) that occurred in the reporting period. The measure which links the two statements is represented by the 'free cash flow' which is calculated as difference between the cash flow generated from operations and the net cash used in investing activities. Starting from free cash flow it is possible to\n\ndetermine either: (i) changes in cash and cash equivalents for the period by adding/deducting cash flows relating to financing debts/receivables (issuance/repayment of debt and receivables related  to  financing  activities),  shareholders'  equity  (dividends paid,  net  repurchase  of  own  shares,  capital  issuance)  and the effect of

In determining adjusted results, inventory holding gains or losses are excluded from base business performance, which is the difference between the cost of sales of the volumes sold in the period based on the cost of supplies of the same period and the cost of sales of the volumes sold calculated using the weighted average cost method of inventory accounting as required by IFRS, except in those business segments where inventories are utilized as a lever to optimize margins.\n\nFinally, the same special charges/gains are excluded from the Eni's share of results at JVs and other equity accounted entities, including any profit/loss on inventory holding.\n\nManagement is disclosing Non-GAAP measures of performance  to  facilitate  a  comparison  of  base  business performance across periods, and to allow financial analysts to evaluate Eni's trading performance on the basis of their forecasting models.\n\nNon-GAAP financial measures should be read together with information determined by applying IFRS and do not stand in for them. Other companies may adopt different methodologies to determine Non-GAAP measures.\n\nFollows the description of the main alternative performance measures adopted by Eni. The measures reported below refer to the performance of the reporting periods disclosed in this press release.\n\n## Adjusted operating and net profit\n\nAdjusted  operating  profit  and  adjusted  net  profit  are determined by excluding inventory holding gains or losses, special  items  and,  in  determining  the  business  segments' adjusted results, finance charges on finance debt and interest income.  The  adjusted  operating  profit  of  each  business segment  reports  gains  and  losses  on  derivative  financial instruments entered into to manage exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, which impact industrial margins  and  translation  of  commercial  payables  and receivables.  Accordingly,  also  currency  translation  effects\n\nrecorded through profit and loss are reported within business segments' adjusted operating profit. The taxation effect of the items excluded from adjusted operating or net profit is determined based on the specific rate of taxes applicable to each of them.\n\nFinance charges or income related to net borrowings excluded from  the  adjusted  net  profit  of  business  segments  are comprised of interest charges on finance debt and interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents not related to operations.  Therefore,  the  adjusted  net  profit  of  business segments  includes  finance  charges  or  income  deriving from certain segment operated assets, i.e., interest income on  certain  receivable  financing  and  securities  related  to operations and finance charge pertaining to the accretion of certain provisions recorded on a discounted basis (as in the case of the asset retirement obligations in the Exploration & Production segment).\n\n## Inventory holding gain or loss\n\nThis is the difference between the cost of sales of the volumes sold in the period based on the cost of supplies of the same period and the cost of sales of the volumes sold calculated using  the  weighted  average  cost  method  of  inventory accounting as required by IFRS.\n\n## Special items\n\nThese  include certain significant income  or  charges pertaining  to  either:  (i)  infrequent  or  unusual  events  and transactions, being identified as non-recurring items under such circumstances; (ii) certain events or transactions which are not considered to be representative of the ordinary course of  business,  as  in  the  case  of  environmental  provisions, restructuring charges, asset impairments or write ups and gains or losses on divestments even though they occurred in past periods or are likely to occur in future ones. Exchange rate differences and derivatives relating to industrial activities and commercial payables and receivables, particularly exchange rate derivatives to manage commodity pricing formulas which are quoted in a currency other than the functional currency are  reclassified  in  operating  profit  with  a  corresponding adjustment  to  net  finance  charges,  notwithstanding  the handling of foreign currency exchange risks is made centrally by  netting  off  naturally-occurring  opposite  positions  and then dealing with any residual risk exposure in the derivative market. Finally, special items include the accounting effects of fair-valued commodity derivatives relating to commercial exposures, in addition to those which lack the criteria to be designed as hedges, also those which are not eligible for the own use exemption, including the ineffective portion of cash flow  hedges,  as  well  as  the  accounting  effects  of  settled commodity  and  exchange  rates  derivatives  whenever  it  is deemed that the underlying transaction is expected to occur in future reporting periods.",

        "page_content": "Correspondently,  special  charges/gains  also  include  the evaluation  effects  relating  to  assets/liabilities  utilized  in  a natural hedge relation to offset a market risk, as in the case of accrued currency differences at finance debt denominated in a currency other than the reporting currency, where the cash outflows for the reimbursement are matched by highly probable cash inflows in the same currency. The deferral of both  the  unrealized  portion  of  fair-valued  commodity  and other derivatives and evaluation effects are reversed to future reporting periods when the underlying transaction occurs. As  provided  for  in  Decision  No.  15519  of  July  27,  2006 of  the  Italian  market  regulator  (CONSOB),  non-recurring material income or charges are to be clearly reported in the management's discussion and financial tables.\n\n## Leverage\n\nLeverage is a Non-GAAP measure of the Company's financial condition, calculated as the ratio between net borrowings and shareholders' equity, including non-controlling interest. Leverage is the reference ratio to assess the solidity and efficiency of the Group balance sheet in terms of incidence of funding sources including third-party funding and equity as well as to carry out benchmark analysis with industry standards.\n\n## Gearing\n\nGearing is calculated as the ratio between net borrowings and capital employed net and measures how much of capital employed net is financed recurring to third-party funding.\n\n## Cash flow from operations before changes in working capital at replacement cost\n\nThis is defined as net cash provided from operating activities before changes in working capital at replacement cost. It also excludes certain non-recurring charges such as extraordinary credit allowances and, considering the high market volatility, changes in the fair value of commodity derivatives lacking the  formal  criteria  to  be  designed  as  hedges,  including derivatives which were not eligible for the own use exemption, the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges, as well as the effects of certain settled commodity derivatives whenever it is deemed that the underlying transaction is expected to occur in future reporting periods.\n\n## Free cash flow\n\nFree cash flow represents the link existing between changes in  cash  and  cash  equivalents  (deriving  from  the  statutory cash flows statement) and in net borrowings (deriving from the summarized cash flow statement) that occurred from the beginning of the period to the end of period. Free cash flow is the cash in excess of capital expenditure needs. Starting from free cash flow it is possible to determine either: (i) changes in cash and cash equivalents for the period by adding/deducting cash flows relating to financing debts/receivables (issuance/ repayment  of  debt  and  receivables  related  to  financing activities), shareholders' equity (dividends paid, net repurchase\n\nof own shares, capital issuance) and the effect of changes in consolidation and of exchange rate differences; (ii) changes in net borrowings for the period by adding/deducting cash flows relating to shareholders' equity and the effect of changes in consolidation and of exchange rate differences.\n\n## Net borrowings\n\nNet borrowings is calculated as total finance debt less cash, cash  equivalents,  financial  assets  measured  at  fair  value through profit or loss and financing receivables held for nonoperating purposes. Financial activities are qualified as 'not related to operations' when these are not strictly related to the business operations.\n\n## ROACE Adjusted\n\nIs the return on average capital invested, calculated as the ratio between net income before minority interests, plus net financial charges on net financial debt, less the related tax effect and net average capital employed.\n\n## Coverage\n\nFinancial  discipline  ratio,  calculated  as  the  ratio  between operating profit and net finance charges.\n\n## Current ratio\n\nMeasures the capability of the Company to repay short-term debt,  calculated  as  the  ratio  between  current  assets  and current liabilities.\n\n## Debt coverage\n\nRating companies use the debt coverage ratio to evaluate debt sustainability. It is calculated as the ratio between net cash provided by operating activities and net borrowings, less cash and cash-equivalents, securities held for non-operating purposes  and  financing  receivables for non-operating purposes.\n\n## Net Debt/EBITDA adjusted\n\nNet  Debt/adjusted  EBITDA  is  the  ratio  between  the  profit available to cover the debt before interest, taxes, amortizations and impairment. This index is a measure of the company's ability pay off its debt and gives an indication as to how long a company would need to operate at its current level to pay off all its debt.\n\n## Profit per boe\n\nMeasures the return per oil and natural gas barrel produced. It is calculated as the ratio between Results of operations from E&P activities (as defined by FASB Extractive Activities - Oil and Gas Topic 932) and production sold.\n\n## Opex per boe\n\nMeasures efficiency in the Oil & Gas development activities, calculated as the ratio between operating costs (as defined by FASB Extractive Activities - Oil and Gas Topic 932) and production sold.",

It is calculated as the overall amount of exploration and development expenditure, the consideration for  the  acquisition  of  possible  and  probable  reserves  as well as additions of proved reserves deriving from improved recovery,  extensions,  discoveries  and  revisions  of  previous\n\nestimates (as defined by FASB Extractive Activities - Oil and Gas Topic 932).\n\nThe following tables report the group operating profit and Group adjusted net profit and their breakdown by segment, as well as is represented the reconciliation with net profit attributable to Eni's shareholders of continuing operations.\n\n## RECONCILIATION TABLES OF NON-GAAP RESULTS TO THE MOST COMPARABLE MEASURES OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE TO GAAPS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| 2022                                                          | Exploration & Production   | or      | Global Gas & LNG P tfolio   | Refining & Mark eting and Chemicals   | Plenitude & P ower   | Corporate and other  activities   | Impact of unrealiz ed intragroup profit elimination   | Group   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Reported operating profit (loss)                              |                            | 15,908  | 3,730                       | 460                                   | (825)                | (1,901)                           | 138                                                   | 17,510  |\n| Exclusion of inventory holding (gains) losses                 |                            |         |                             | (416)                                 |                      |                                   | (148)                                                 | (564)   |\n| Exclusion of special items:                                   |                            |         |                             |                                       |                      |                                   |                                                       |         |\n| -

        "page_content": "## Risk factors and uncertainties\n\n## The Group's performance is mainly exposed to the volatility of the prices of crude oil and natural gas and to changing margins of oil derivative products such as, refined products and chemical products\n\nThe price of crude oil is the main driver of the Company's operating performance  and  cash  flow,  given  the  current  size  of  Eni's Exploration & Production segment relative to other Company's business  segments.  The  price  of  crude  oil  has  a  history  of volatility because, like other commodities, it is influenced by the ups and downs in the economic cycle and several other macro-variables that are beyond management's control. Crude oil prices are mainly determined by the balance between global oil  supplies  and  demand,  the  global  levels  of  commercial inventories  and  producing  countries'  spare  capacity.  In  the short-term, worldwide demand for crude oil is highly correlated to the macroeconomic cycle. A downturn in economic activity normally triggers lower global demand for crude oil and possibly a supply and/or an inventory build-up, because in the short-term producers are unable to respond to swings in demand quickly. Whenever global supplies of crude oil outstrip demand, crude oil prices weaken. Factors that can influence the global economic activity  in  the  short-term  and  demand  for  crude  oil  include several, unpredictable events, like trends in the economic growth which shape crude oil demand in big consuming countries like China, India and the United States, financial crisis, geo-political crisis,  local  conflicts  and  wars,  social  instability,  pandemic diseases, the flows of international commerce, trade disputes and governments' fiscal policies, among others. All these events could influence demands for crude oil. Long-term demands for crude oil is driven, on the positive side, by demographic growth, improving living standards and GDP (Gross Domestic Product) expansion; on the negative side, factors that in the long-term may significantly reduce demands for crude oil include availability of alternative  sources  of  energy  (e.g.,  nuclear  and  renewables), technological  breakthroughs,  shifts  in  consumer  preferences, and  finally  measures  and  other  initiatives  adopted  or  planned by governments to tackle climate change and to curb carbondioxide emissions (CO 2 emissions), including stricter regulations and control on production and consumption of crude oil. Many governments and supranational institutions, with the USA and EU leading the way, have begun implementing policies to transition the  economy  towards  a  low  carbon  model  of  development through various means and strategies, particularly by supporting development  of  renewable  energies  and  the  replacement  of internal  combustion  engine  vehicles  with  electric  vehicles, including the possible adoption of tougher regulations on the use  of  hydrocarbons  such  as  the  taxation  of  CO 2 emissions. According to Eni's management, the push to reduce worldwide\n\ngreenhouse gas emissions and an ongoing energy transition towards a low carbon economy are likely to materially affect the worldwide energy mix in the long-term and may lead to structural lower crude oil demands and prices. See the section dedicated to the discussion of climate-related risks below.\n\nNotwithstanding  the  USA  being  the  first  oil  producer  in  the world since the shale oil revolution of 2011, global oil supplies are  controlled  to  a  large  degree  by  the  Organization  of  the Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  ('OPEC')  cartel  and  its  allied countries,  like  Russia  and  Kazakhstan,  known  as  the  OPEC+ alliance.  Saudi  Arabia  plays  a  crucial  role  within  the  cartel, because it is estimated to hold huge amounts of reserves and a vast majority of worldwide spare production capacity. This explains why geopolitical developments in the Middle East and particularly in the Gulf area, like regional conflicts, acts of war, strikes, attacks, sabotages, and social and political tensions can have a big influence on crude oil prices. Furthermore, due to expectations of a slowdown in the growth rate of the US shale oil production or of a possible decline in the long-term due to capital discipline and industrial factors like a shrinking number of  premium locations and high-yield wells, the OPEC+ alliance could exert an increasingly large influence over the crude oil market. Finally, sanctions imposed by the United States and the EU against certain producing countries may influence trends in crude oil prices.\n\nTo a lesser extent, extreme weather events, such as hurricanes in areas of highly concentrated production like the Gulf of Mexico, and operational issues at key petroleum infrastructure may have an impact on crude oil prices.\n\n2022 marked one of the most volatile year in the history of crude oil prices, as measured by the number of days in a year in which the Brent crude oil benchmark moved by more than 5 $/bbl.\n\nImmediately after the start of Russia's military operations in Ukraine,  the  price  of  the  Brent  crude  oil  benchmark  spiked, approaching its all-time high set in 2008 at approximately 140 $/bbl,  then  retreated  once  fears  dissipated  about  possible disruptions in the flows of liquid hydrocarbons from Russia to international  markets.  Overall,  crude  oil  prices  remained  well supported in the first half of the year. A favorable combination of  macro  and  micro  developments  helped  sustain  prices  in the  100-120  $/bbl  range  through  the  first  half  of  2022.  The full  reopening  of  Western  economies  and  the  post-pandemic recovery drove pent-up demand for all kinds of refined products with the last leg of end-markets, the airline sector, joining a rebound in consumption.

        "page_content": "shale producers in the USA remained reluctant to invest in new oil  &  gas  fields  and  retained  the  financial  discipline  adopted in  response  to  the  COVID-19  crisis,  allocating  the  extra-cash generated in the high oil-price environment to restructure the balance sheet and to boost shareholders' returns. Pressured by investor demanding higher returns and by ESG considerations and, in the case of European players, by the need to allocate more funds to the businesses of the energy transition, Oil & Gas companies have continued to constrain the spending in the traditional upstream business, reinvesting in the business just a fraction of the cash flows to maintain production. According to market sources, global upstream's capital expenditures in 2022 increased by about 20% from 2021 mainly in response to cost inflation. According to market intelligence, the current level of global upstream investment is insufficient to hold oil production steady at 100 million barrels/d, which is the needed level to match current global oil demand.\n\nThe  alliance  of  petroleum  producers  OPEC+  has  continued supporting  the  oil  market  by  means  of  effective  production management. The production performance exhibited a systematic trend of underdelivering against the stated production targets, raising doubts about the ability to retain an adequate spare capacity to meet eventual demand spikes. New consumption trends emerged in response to surging natural gas costs in Europe, like a resumption of the utilization of fuel oil to produce electricity (gas-to-oil switch). Finally, continuing uncertainties have been surrounding a possible return of Iran to comply with a revised version of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, known  as  JCPOA,  that  would  see  Western  countries  lift  the embargo on Iranian crude oil in exchange.\n\nThese price-supporting developments were partially mitigated by the effects of the zero-tolerance policy adopted by the Chinese authorities against the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the continuing lockdowns of large cities and districts, thus dampening mobility and economic activities. Furthermore, to mitigate market imbalances and reduce the cost of fuels to American consumers, U.S. authorities executed an emergency plan to release 1 million bbl/day of crude oil from the national Strategic Petroleum Reserve for a six-month period, starting in May; other sales were arranged in the months of November and December.  Other  OECD  governments  coordinated  by  the  IEA also arranged the release of their strategic reserves in response to the Russia-Ukraine crisis.\n\nCrude oil prices peaked at the end of June. As developments in the second half of 2022 would demonstrate, the oil industry is a cyclical business, and our results of operations and cash flows\n\nare exposed to the risks of rapidly changing market conditions and of sudden and sharp price downturns due to the complexity and unpredictability of macro variables to which the oil business is subject. Among those variables, one of the most important, albeit difficult to be perceived, is the relatively low elasticity of supplies, which helps when demand rebounds, but backfires in case of a demand shock, leading to a quick build-up in supplies and a sell-off in prices. It is worth mentioning, based on our experience, that a small imbalance between supply and demand could cause a significant contraction in prices.\n\nAs  a  matter  of  fact,  the  trading  environment  has  changed radically  from  the  end  of  June  2022.  The  resurgence  of inflationary  pressures  led  by  rising  commodity  prices  forced the Federal Reserves ('Fed') to change course in its monetary policy and to start a tightening cycle by raising interest rates and suspending its program of buying treasuries. Other central banks have followed the Fed's new stance towards inflation. Rising interest rates and quantitative tightening are expected to dent economic activity and to reduce demand for crude oil. Furthermore, since the Fed has been moving at a faster pace than other central banks, it has driven the value of the US dollar that  has  appreciated  significantly  against  all  other  currencies. A stronger dollar makes the dollar- denominated contracts for crude oil more expensive for holders of other currencies, thus weighing on demand.\n\nMacroeconomic  indicators  started  to  weaken  during  the summer  months  amid  the  uncertainties  associated  with  the Russia-  Ukraine  war,  growing  geopolitical  risks  and  surging energy  costs  impacting  industrial  activity  and  consumers' confidence, fueling fears of a prolonged slowdown or of a global recession  and  expectations  of  lower  demand  for  crude  oil. Furthermore,  Russian  production  levels  and  exports  towards Western markets held steady, defying expectations of a sharp drop. Those developments triggered a sharp correction in the price of Brent crude oil that lost approximately 40 $/bbl or 30% in just a quarter (from 125 $/bbl at the end of June 2022 to approximately 85 $/bbl by the end of September). In the final months of 2022, Brent prices seemed to stabilize due to the decision of the OPEC+ alliance to reduce the production quotas by about 2 million bbl/day from November 2022 until December 2023, resulting in an actual production cut of approximately half that amount considering that many cartel countries were producing well below their respective stated quotas. The market was also affected by uncertainties due to the entry into force of an EU ban on importation of seaborne Russian crude and the perceived risks of a reduction at Russian supplies, while China",

        "page_content": "began relaxing the restrictive measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.  Finally,  G-7  nations,  the  EU  and  Australia  agreed to impose a price cap on Russian crude at 60 $/bbl, banning Western  insurers  and  shippers  to  provide  services  to  support transportation of Russian crude oil unless the price cap is fulfilled. The downtrend in crude oil prices resumed in December, erasing all the gains made so far in 2022, with prices falling below 80 $/ bbl. The downturn in crude oil prices in the second half of 2022 was largely driven by the liquidation of derivative positions by financial market participants driven by fears and uncertainties about  possible  broad-based  macroeconomic  issues,  that pushed the forward prices curve back into contango in relation to short- term deliveries. However, the physical markets continued to signal steady demand trends as highlighted by continuing drawdowns of global inventories of crude oil, including global oilon-water, with commercial stocks at OECD countries falling to about 4 billion barrels at the end of the year. That is one of the lowest levels for this time of year on record.\n\nOverall, in 2022 global demand for crude oil continued recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic lows, increasing by approximately 2 million bbl/d to reach a level almost in line with 2019, at approximately 99.6 million bbl/d.\n\nLooking forward, we believe crude oil prices to be negatively affected by continuing uncertainties among market participants about  a  possible  slowdown  or  a  recession  of  the  global economy leading to a contraction in demand for crude oil, thus limiting  the  chance  of  a  price  recovery  from  the  2022  lows registered in December 2022. Furthermore, due to pressures from governments to increase output, international Oil & Gas companies have been announcing capital budget significantly higher than in 2022 and that could lead to faster growth in supplies than the market is currently anticipating.\n\nNatural gas prices experienced a degree of volatility even higher than that of crude oil, especially in Europe (see risk factors below).  Overall,  natural  gas  prices  rose  sharply  across  all geographies due to slow additions of new supplies reflecting a slowdown in expenditures in past years and a demand recovery in the wake of an improved macroeconomic backdrop. Russia's military invasion of Ukraine greatly compounded the already tight  market  fundamentals,  triggering  fears  among  market participants of possible disruptions in the natural gas flows from Russia to Europe. During summer months, prices reached all time-highs at spot markets in Europe driven by tight supplies, a progressive reduction in the flows of gas imported via pipeline from Russia amidst deteriorating political relationships with the EU block of nations (see below) and increased demand to replenish natural gas inventories in preparation of the heating season. In 2022, the spot price at the European reference hub Title  Transfer  Facility  'TTF'  averaged  about  40  $/mmBTU, almost  a  threefold  increase  versus  2021.  However,  from the  final  months  of  2022  and  the  beginning  of  2023,  market fundamentals have begun trending lower due to a recovery in\n\nUS production of dry natural gas and a significant increase in exported volumes through LNG facilities, the wide adoption of energy saving measures in Europe, a slowdown in industrial activities and finally a warmer-than usual winter season which has reduced heating consumption in the Western Hemisphere. In response to those trends, natural gas prices have been falling very rapidly: by the end of February 2023, the TTF European benchmark  has  plunged  below  20  $/mmBTU,  an  eighteenmonth low, down about 80% from the all-time high reached during the summer 2022. We believe this deteriorating trend in natural gas prices to affect significantly and adversely our results of operations and cash flows in 2023.\n\nThe volatility  of  hydrocarbons  prices  significantly  affects  the Group's financial performance. Lower hydrocarbon prices from one year to another negatively affect the Group's consolidated results of operations and cash flow; the opposite occurs in case of a rise in prices. This is because lower prices translate into lower revenues recognised in the Company's Exploration & Production segment at the time of the price change, whereas expenses in this segment are either fixed or less sensitive to changes in crude oil prices than revenues. With respect to price assumptions for 2023 (our Brent crude oil price forecast for 2023 is 85 $/bbl), we estimate our cash flow from operations to  vary  by  approximately  \u20ac0.13  billion  for  each  one-dollar change in the price of the Brent crude oil applied to liquids and oil-linked gas and by approximately \u20ac0.13 billion for each onedollar change in the spot price (1 $/mmbtu) of the European benchmark TTF spot price of natural gas compared to our assumption of 25-26 $/mmBTU for 2023. Eni is planning to gradually increase the share of natural gas production in its portfolio to reach 60% by 2030. Considering the higher volatility experienced in the natural gas market compared to the crude oil market, this long-term shift in the production mix could increase the variability of the Group's results of operations and cash flows.\n\nThe exposure of our cash flow from operations to the volatility of hydrocarbons prices and our expectations of lower hydrocarbons prices in 2023 compared to 2022 are due to increase our financial risk  profile  going  forward,  in  light  of  the  projected  significant expected increase in the capital budget planned for 2023, which at about \u20ac9.5 billion is featuring a 15% rise compared to 2022.\n\nFinally,  movements  in  hydrocarbons  prices  significantly  affect the  reportable  amount  of  production  and  proved  reserves under  our  production  sharing  agreements  ('PSAs'),  which represented about 54% of our proved reserves as of end of 2022. The  entitlement  mechanism  of  PSAs  foresees  the  Company is  entitled  to  a  portion  of  a  field's  reserves,  the  sale  of  which is  intended to cover expenditures incurred by the Company to develop and operate the field. The higher the reference prices for Brent crude oil used to estimate Eni's proved reserves, the lower the number of barrels necessary to recover the same amount of expenditure, and vice versa. In 2022 our reported production and",

Considering the current portfolio of oil & gas assets, the Company estimates its production to vary by about 0.5 KBOE/d for each one-dollar change in the price of the Brent crude oil. Eni's Refining & Marketing and Chemical businesses are cyclical. Their results are impacted by trends in the supply and demand of oil products and plastic commodities, which are influenced by  the  macro-economic  scenario  and  by  product  margins. Generally speaking, margins for refined and chemical products depend upon the speed at which products' prices adjust to reflect movements in oil prices.\n\nAll these risks may adversely and materially impact the Group's results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, business prospects, financial condition, and shareholder returns, including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's share.\n\n## Risks  in  connection  with  Russia's  military aggression of Ukraine\n\n## a)  A prolonged war could derail the post-pandemic macroeconomic recovery and that could reduce demands for hydrocarbons\n\nRussia's  military  aggression  of  Ukraine  in  late  February 2022 occurred against a backdrop of already tight crude oil and natural gas markets, particularly in Europe. The postpandemic recovery leading to a pent-up demand for all kind of energy commodities and the suppression of supplies due to the financial discipline of Oil & Gas companies, and years of underinvestment in the industry drove a strong upcycle in commodity prices. Against this backdrop, the war triggered an energy crisis that hit severely businesses' balance sheet and the purchasing power of households across all of EU member states and the UK, souring mood and confidence. Increasingly high costs of natural gas and electricity have reignited  inflationary  pressures  along  the  supply  chain, forcing central banks to change course in their monetary policy. In response to Russia's aggression, the EU nations, the UK and the USA have adopted massive economic and financial sanctions to curb Russia's ability to fund the war and that is negatively affecting the economic activity. All these developments have resulted in a significant slowdown of the economy in the Euro-zone, in the UK, in the USA and in other areas.\n\nA  prolonged  armed  conflict,  a  possible  escalation  in  the military action, an enlargement of the ongoing geopolitical crisis and a further tightening up of the economic sanctions against  Russia  represent  elements  of  uncertainty  that could  eventually  sap  consumers'  confidence  and  deter investment decisions, increasing the risks of a worldwide macroeconomic  recession  and  with  it,  expectations  of  a\n\nreduction in hydrocarbons demands. This scenario would lead to lower commodity prices and would adversely and significantly  affect  our  results  of  operations  and  cash flow, as well as business prospects, with a possible lower remuneration of our shareholders.\n\n- b)  2022  was  characterized  by  an  unprecedented  level  of volatility  in  the  European  natural  gas  market  due  to  the uncertainties  triggered  by  the  Russia-Ukraine  crisis  and continuing  disruptions  in  the  supplies  from  Russia.  We expect prices to remain volatile in the foreseeable future and this may negatively affect our results of operations and cash flow\n\nIn the aftermath of the start of the conflict, hydrocarbons prices rallied well above the peaks recorded in 2021, driven by the macro-uncertainty associated with the geopolitical situation, the possible fallout of the economic sanctions adopted by EU countries, the USA, and the UK against Russia and rising worries among market participants about possible disruptions in  the  hydrocarbons  flows  from  Russia  to  international markets. While the Brent benchmark crude oil price initially approached its all- time highs at about 140 $/bbl and then retreated to below 80 $/bbl due to macroeconomic drivers, the natural gas market in Europe underwent far more complex trading conditions due to Europe's dependency on Russian supplies.  The  Title  Transfer  Facility  (TTF),  the  European benchmark of natural gas, which was trading at about 6 $/ mmBTU at the beginning of 2021, increased exponentially throughout  the  year  and  approached  the  90-dollar  mark in August 2022, driven by strong fundamentals and rising uncertainties about supply risks, amidst deteriorating political relationships  between  the  EU  and  Russia.  Those  latter materialized in the summer months as on several occasions the flows of natural gas from Russia to Europe were halted or reduced due to a dispute between Russia and European nations about the currency of settlement of the payments due by European operators. To make things worse, in September 2022, a massive leak occurred at the North-Stream pipeline, which is one of the main routes for transporting natural gas from Russia to Europe, forcing the operator to completely shut down the facility to execute major repairs. Natural gas flows from Russia to Italy experienced a significant reduction, too. With prices of natural gas increasing by several hundred percentage points against the backdrop of unprecedented volatility, traders like Eni faced large margin calls and high funding costs that increased pressure on their balance sheet and leverage.\n\nThe exceptionally large price movements resulted in sizeable daily or even intraday variation margin calls as derivatives contracts were marked to market. Furthermore, the elevated volatility prompted  central  counterparties  and  financial institutions to increase the initial margin substantially. As a matter of fact, to maintain derivatives positions, traders are required to pledge liquid assets as collateral for the settlement",

        "page_content": "of the derivative transactions (initial margin). Materially higher natural  gas  prices  triggered  proportional  increases  in  the initial margins (margin call), leading to substantially higher funding needs of traders and impairing their creditworthiness, as  many traders saw their bond prices fall significantly.  To cope  with  raising  borrowing  costs  and  surging  financing needs, traders opted to reduce the volume of transactions in financial derivatives leading to substantially thinner markets. Trading  volumes  in  both  exchange  markets  and  over-thecounter  saw  large  declines.  In  response  to  much  higher funding requirements than in the past to maintain derivatives positions, as well as due to much lower hedging opportunities because of thinner liquidity in the financial derivatives markets, the Company has opted to reduce our usual risk management activities and to retain a higher share of the commodity price risks unhedged, also considering risks of a possible default of supplies from our Russian counterparts (see below). Those developments may negatively affect our results of operations and cash flow in the GGP business that engages in trading large  volumes  of  natural  gas  in  the  European  markets.  We believe  this  risk  factor  to  continue  affecting  the  business performance for the foreseeable future as trading conditions in the natural gas market are expected to remain challenging and volatile.\n\nIn  response  to  our  expectations  of  much  more  volatile markets going forward, we have increased our financial headroom  by  raising  our  reserves  of  cash  on  hand, increasing  amounts  of  committed  credit  lines,  and entering into repurchase agreements using our portfolio of securities as collateral, to cope with expected higher margins requirements and other possible financing needs. This  could  lead  to  higher  finance  expense  and  reduced investment opportunities.\n\n## c) Risks in connection with our presence in Russia and our commercial relationships with Russia's State-owned companies\n\nEni's assets located in Russia are immaterial to the Group results. Our exploration projects in the Russian Oil & Gas sector  have  been  suspended  indefinitely,  following  the previous sanction regime, and the expenditures incurred in relation to those projects were written off in past reporting periods.  Currently,  we  do  not  have  booked  hydrocarbons reserves in Russia.\n\nThe Group has announced the intention to divest its interest in the Blue Stream joint operations, which manages the gas pipeline that transports natural gas produced in Russia to Turkey through the Black Sea. Those volumes of gas are jointly marketed by Eni and Gazprom to the Turkish stateowned company Botas. This divestment is not expected to have a significant  effect  on  the  Group  consolidated  results and balance sheet; the book value of this asset was \u20ac90 million as of December 31, 2022.\n\nIn 2022 the Group ceased signing new supply contracts of Russian crude oil  to  supply  its  operated  refineries  and  has incurred higher expenses and lower margins to replace the Russian crude oil. We do not plan to alter our course of action in 2023 and will continue to avoid supplying any quantity of Russian crude for processing at our refineries or otherwise to trade any volume of Russian crude oil or refined products. In 2022 the purchase of crude oil from Russia represented 5% of the total volumes of crudes traded by Eni to support its operated refineries; those volumes were supplied before the start of the war.\n\nFinally,  Russian  Oil  &  Gas  companies  are  currently  joint operators  in  certain  upstream  projects  where  we  have a  working  interest.  Every  possible  decision  about  the participation of the Russian counterparts to those projects are in the power of the state-owned companies of the host countries where such projects are located.\n\nThe  most  important  transactions  that  involve  Russian counterparts relate to the purchase of natural gas from the  Russian  state-owned  company  Gazprom  and  its affiliates, based on long-term supply contracts with takeor-pay  clauses.  In  the  past,  the  volumes  supplied  from Russia have represented a material amount of our global portfolio of natural gas supplies. In 2022, we significantly reduced natural gas supplies from Russia to 28% (down from  43%  in  2021).  We  intend  to  continue  our  effort  to substitute Russian-origin gas in our portfolio, with the aim to  continue  to  reduce  such  dependence  in  the  shortest possible timeframe.\n\nFurther, although we have access to increased supplies from other geographies in our portfolio by means of developing our existing reserves and we are currently able to import larger volumes from producing countries under existing contracts, should supplies from non-Russian sources be insufficient to compensate for lower quantities purchased from Gazprom and its affiliated companies, we may suffer adverse effects which we cannot currently estimate or quantify, but could be material.\n\nTo  cope  with  the  emerging  risk  of  a  possible  shortfall of  natural  gas  supplies  from  Russia  and  with  a  view  to reducing our contractual selling obligations going forward, the business has adopted a cautious stance in signing new selling contracts for the current thermal year (October 2022 September 2023) and in doing so, it has been missing out on better selling margin opportunities than what can be earned by selling natural gas at the spot markets.\n\nThe process of substituting Russian-origin gas may entail operational  and  financial  risks  which  may  be  significant. Those development could negatively and significantly affect the performance of the GGP business.",

There is no guarantee that a similar level of performance can be sustained in the near future\n\nIn 2022, the profitability in the GGP business was underpinned by management's ability to leverage the assets portfolio (longterm  natural  gas  purchase  contracts,  transport  capacity booked at the main European pipelines, access to storage capacity, thermoelectric plants, presence in the LNG business) to drive sales opportunities and margin improvements on the back of favorable market trends. There is no guarantee that a similar level of performance can be reiterated next year or in the medium-term due to rapidly changing market conditions and  unpredictable  developments  in  the  European  natural gas markets. The Company's decision to reduce its hedging activity in response to risks of undersupplies from its Russian counterparts has also increased the business exposure to the commodity risk.\n\n- e) In response to the current energy crisis, EU member states have been implementing measures intended to curb the consumption of electricity and to contain the cost of energy to  businesses  and  households,  and  that  could  negatively affect  demand  for  natural  gas  and  electricity  and  the profitability of our operations\n\nRussia's  military  invasion  of  Ukraine  triggered  a  relevant deterioration in the fundamentals of the European natural gas and electricity sectors due to European' dependency on Russian natural gas supplies and actual reductions in the volumes of natural gas available to Europe. This has driven material increases in the price of natural gas and in the cost of  electricity  that  is  indexed  to  natural  gas.  High  energy costs have put enormous pressure on the balance sheet of businesses, also in the energy sector, forcing many industrial undertakings  to  halt  production  or  to  shut  down  plants indefinitely,  while  several  energy  wholesalers  and  retailers unable  to  manage  volatility  have  gone  bankrupt  or  have been bailed out by governments. Many businesses highly dependent  on  energy  consumption  have  been  assessing whether to relocate their operations overseas to reduce the costs of energy inputs. Households have seen their energy bills increase manyfold, resulting in social anger and protest. The economic and social ramifications of this crisis have yet to be appreciated. In response to the crisis, EU member states have been implementing several initiatives intended to reduce electricity  consumptions  by  imposing  mandated  saving targets to each of the member states and to reduce the cost of electricity by introducing a mandatory cap on market revenues of electricity producers from certain sources (e.g. photovoltaic and wind power) and the possibility for the member states to temporarily set electricity prices below production costs. For example, the EU Commission's REPowerEU plan has set a strategic goal of ceasing the EU's dependency on Russia's natural  gas  well  before  2030,  through  various  measures\n\nincluding supplies diversification, development of renewable energies and energy savings. Those measures could reduce electricity consumption and hence demands for natural gas and that could significantly and adversely affect the results of operations and cash flow of our E&P and GGP businesses. The mandated cap on market revenues of electricity produced at  photovoltaic  and  wind  facilities  will  limit  the  profitability upside in our business of renewable energies. Governments may introduce administrative measures intended to limit the ability of retail operators in the natural gas and electricity markets to pass increases in the cost of supplies onto final customers and that could significantly and adversely affect the results of operations and cash flow at our retail subsidiary Plenitude.  Finally,  governments  across  Europe  and  in  the UK  have  imposed  windfall  taxes  on  the  profits  of  energy companies to raise funds to compensate businesses and households for the surging energy costs and this trend has negatively affected our results of operations and cash flow (see below).\n\n## There is strong competition worldwide, both within the oil industry and with other industries, to supply energy and petroleum products to the industrial, commercial, and residential energy markets\n\nThe  current  competitive  environment  in  which  Eni  operates is  characterized  by  volatile  prices  and  margins  of  energy commodities,  limited  product  differentiation  and  complex relationships with state-owned companies  and  national agencies  of  the  countries  where  hydrocarbons  reserves  are located  to  obtain  mineral  rights.  As  commodity  prices  are beyond the Company's control, Eni's ability to remain competitive and  profitable  in  this  environment  requires  continuous  focus on  technological  innovation,  the  achievement  of  efficiencies in operating costs, effective management of capital resources and the ability to provide valuable services to energy buyers. It also depends on Eni's ability to gain access to new investment opportunities.\n\nIn the  Exploration  &  Production  segment,  Eni  is  facing competition  from  both  international  and  state-owned  oil companies  for  obtaining  exploration  and  development  rights and  developing  and  applying  new  technologies  to  maximize hydrocarbon  recovery.  Because  of  the  larger  size  of  some other international oil companies, Eni may face a competitive disadvantage when bidding for large scale or capital intensive projects and it may be exposed to the risk of obtaining lower cost savings in a deflationary environment compared to its larger competitors  given  its  potentially  smaller  market  power  with respect to suppliers, whereas in case of rising input costs due to a shortage of materials, labour and other productive factors Eni may experience higher pressure from its suppliers to raise the price of goods and services to the Company compared to Eni's larger competitors. Due to those competitive pressures, Eni may fail to obtain new exploration and development acreage,",

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused Exploration & Production companies  to  significantly  reduce  their  capital  investment  in response to lower cash flows from operations and to focus on the more profitable and scenario-resilient projects. The Company believes that this development will be long-lasting and likely drive increased competition among players to gain access to relatively cheaper reserves (onshore vs. offshore; proven areas vs. unexplored areas).\n\nIn the Global Gas & LNG Portfolio business, Eni is facing strong competition  in  the  European  wholesale  markets  to  sell  gas to  industrial  customers,  the  thermoelectric  sector  and  retail companies from other gas wholesalers, upstream companies, traders and other players. The results of Eni's wholesale gas business  are  affected  by  global  and  regional  dynamics  of gas demand and supplies, as well as by the constraints of its portfolio of long-term, take-or-pay supply, whereby the Company is obligated to offtake minimum annual volumes of gas or in case of failure to pay the corresponding purchase price (see below). Due to the competitive nature of the business, sales margins tend to be small. We believe wholesale margins of gas will be negatively affected by competitive pressures and by the expected growth of renewable sources of energy that will replace natural gas in supplying electricity to European markets in the medium-term. Also, the energy crisis of 2022 stimulated energy saving  measures  and  a  curtailment  of  consumption  among businesses and households and by public administrations and that could lead to long-term natural gas demand destruction, intensifying competition.\n\nThe results of the LNG business are mainly influenced by the global balance between demand and supplies, considering the higher level of flexibility of LNG with respect to gas delivered via pipeline.\n\nIn  its  Refining  &  Marketing segment, Eni is facing competition both in the refining business and in the retail marketing of fuels. Eni's  refining  business  has  been  negatively  affected  for  many years  by  structural  headwinds  due  to  muted  trends  in  the European demand for fuels, refining overcapacity and continued competitive pressure from players in the Middle East, the United States and Far East Asia. Those competitors can leverage on larger plant scale and cost economies, availability of cheaper feedstock  and  lower  energy  expenses.  Those  unfavorable competitive  dynamics  were  exacerbated  by  the  economic downturn triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, whose effects rippled throughout 2021 due to the gradual lifting of restrictions to mobility and air travel. In 2022, the weak underlying fundamentals of the sector were superseded by a widespread recovery  in  demands  for  refined  products  also  helped  by  a recovery in the airline sector, and by market disruptions caused by the Russia-Ukraine war which negatively affected the flows of products from Russia, reducing particularly the supplies of gasoil, and other market dislocations. The trading environment\n\nwas very volatile with refining margins hitting historic highs on some occasions (for example in the second quarter and at the start of the Autumn months) and then retreating.\n\nOverall,  in  2022  the  Company's  own  internal  performance measure to gauge the profitability of its refineries, the SERM, averaged about 8 $/bbl, a noteworthy increase compared to 2021 when the margin was negative at minus 0.9 $/bbl, and one of the best values in several years. However, due to the start-up of new refining capacity in Middle East and other geographies, management does not expect that level of refining margin to be sustainable in the future. Furthermore, management expects demand for oil-based refined products in Europe to be negatively affected  by  the  market  penetration  of  EV  and  a  growth  in biofuels.  Based  on  those  assumptions,  despite  the  strong results of the refining business in 2022, management did not record any reversal of previously recognized impairment losses and  confirmed  the  full  write-off  of  the  Company's  oil-based, operated refineries. Furthermore, management assessed that certain  refinery  production  lines  that  were  shut  down  during the COVID-19 downturn would not restart under management's planning assumptions and forecast trading environment. As a consequence of that, management recognized a provision to decommission such product lines, for an amount of about \u20ac300 million.\n\nFurthermore,  refinery's  operating  expenses  were  negatively affected by higher costs for the purchase of emission allowances to comply with the requirements of the European ETS, which reached all-time highs due to a combination of macroeconomic recovery  which  drove  industrial  production  and  rising  coal consumption to fire power generation due to a shortage of gas supplies and cost competitiveness. The 2022 cost for emission allowance was on average 80 \u20ac/ton, up by about 50% from 2021 (53.4 \u20ac/ton). We believe costs for the purchase of CO 2 allowances to continue trending higher in the foreseeable future also due to a possible revision of the EU regulation that is anticipated to reduce free allowances.\n\nEni's  Chemical  business  has  been  facing  for  years  strong competition  from  well-established  international  players  and state-owned petrochemical companies, particularly in the most commoditized market segments such as the production of basic petrochemical products (like polyethylene), where demand is a function of macroeconomic growth. Many of these competitors based in the Far East and the Middle East have been able to benefit  from  cost  economies  due  to  larger  plant  scale,  wide geographic moat, availability of cheap feedstock and proximity to end-markets. Excess worldwide capacity of petrochemical commodities  has  also  fueled  competition  in  this  business. Furthermore, petrochemical producers based in the United States have regained market share, as their cost structure has become competitive due to the availability of cheap feedstock deriving from the production of domestic shale gas from which ethane is derived, which is a cheaper raw material to produce ethylene",

Finally, it is likely that rising public concern about climate change and the preservation of the environment will negatively affect the consumption of single-use plastics going forward. In 2021 those challenging business fundamentals were mitigated by the post-pandemic economic recovery and supply chain  issues,  which  alleviated  competitive  issues.  In  2022, the Eni's chemicals business reverted to its historical trend of underperformance driven by a recovery in the export of cheap product flows from the Middle and Far East, the entry into service of new capacity and surging costs of plant utilities indexed to the price of natural gas. An uncertain macroeconomic outlook also weighed on the purchase decision of distributors and resellers who  opted  for  destocking  their  inventories.  Management believes  the  profitability  prospects  of  the  chemicals  business to remain weak in the foreseeable future and as a consequence the carrying amounts of the Company's chemicals plants were marked down to account for lower recoverable values with an impairment loss of \u20ac385 million.\n\nPlenitude & Power business engages in the supply of gas and electricity  to  customers  in  the  retail  markets  mainly  in  Italy, France, Spain, and other Countries in Europe. Customers include households,  large  residential  accounts  (hospitals,  schools, public administration buildings, offices) and small and mediumsized businesses. The retail market is characterized by strong competition among selling companies which mainly compete in terms of pricing and the ability to bundle valuable services with the supply of the energy commodity. In this segment, competition has intensified in recent years due to the progressive opening of the market and the ability of residential customers to switch smoothly from one supplier to another.\n\nEni  also  engages  in  the  business  of  producing  gas-fired electricity that is largely sold in the wholesale market and in the dispatching services market. As far as the wholesale market is  concerned,  margins  of  electricity  production  from  gasfired plants ('Clean Spark Spread' or 'CSS') have experienced some fluctuations in recent years due to the volatility of costs of  production,  as  well  as  to  increasing  competition  from renewables. In 2022, the business profitability was driven by a  non-recurring  increase  in  revenues  from  the  dispatching services market. Looking forward, management is assuming service revenues to normalize.\n\nIn case the Company is unable to effectively manage the above described competitive risks, which may increase in case of an economic  slowdown  or  a  recession  weaker-than  anticipated recovery  in  the  post-pandemic  economy  or  in  a  worst  case scenario of the imposition by governments of new lockdown measures and other restrictions in response to the pandemic, the  Group's  future  results  of  operations,  cash  flow,  liquidity, business  prospects,  financial  condition,  shareholder  returns, including  dividends,  the  amount  of  funds  available  for  stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares may be adversely and\n\nsignificantly affected.\n\n## The Group is exposed to significant safety, security, environmental  and  other  operational  risk  in connection with the nature of its operation s\n\nThe Group engages in the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, processing, transportation and refining of crude oil, transport of natural gas, storage and distribution of petroleum products and the production of base chemicals, plastics, and elastomers.  By  their  nature,  the  Group's  operations  expose Eni  to  a  wide  range  of  significant  health,  safety,  security,  and environmental risks. Technical faults, malfunctioning of plants, equipment and facilities, control systems failure, human errors, acts  of  sabotage,  attacks,  loss  of  containment  and  climaterelated  hazards  can  trigger  adverse  consequences  such  as explosions, blowouts, fires, oil and gas spills from wells, pipeline and tankers, release of contaminants and pollutants in the air, ground and water, toxic emissions, and other negative events. The magnitude of these risks is influenced by the geographic range, operational diversity, and technical complexity of Eni's activities.  Eni's  future  results  of  operations,  cash  flow  and liquidity depend on its ability to identify and address the risks and hazards inherent to operating in those industries.\n\nIn  the  Exploration  &  Production  segment,  Eni  faces  natural hazards and other operational risks including those relating to the physical and geological characteristics of oil and natural gas fields. These include the risks of eruptions of crude oil or of natural gas, discovery of hydrocarbon pockets with abnormal pressure, crumbling of well openings, oil spills, gas leaks, risks of blowout, fire or explosion and risks of earthquake in connection with drilling activities.\n\nEni's  activities  in  the  Refining  &  Marketing  and  Chemical segment entail health, safety and environmental risks related to the handling, transformation and distribution of oil, oil products and  certain  petrochemical  products.  These  risks  can  arise from the intrinsic characteristics and the overall lifecycle of the products manufactured and the raw materials used in the manufacturing process, such as oil-based feedstock, catalysts, additives,  and  monomer  feedstock.  These  risks  comprise flammability,  toxicity,  long-term  environmental  impact  such as greenhouse gas emissions and risks of various forms of pollution and contamination of the soil and the groundwater, emissions and discharges resulting from their use and from recycling or disposing of materials and wastes at the end of their useful life.\n\nAll of Eni's segments of operations involve, to varying degrees, the  transportation  of  hydrocarbons.  Risks  in  transportation activities  depend  on  several  factors  and  variables,  including the hazardous nature of the products transported due to their flammability and toxicity, the transportation methods utilized (pipelines, shipping, river freight, rail, road and gas distribution",

All  modes of transportation of hydrocarbons are particularly susceptible to risks of blowout, fire and loss of containment and, given that normally  high  volumes  are  involved,  could  present  significant risks to people, the environment and the property.\n\nEni has material offshore operations relating to the exploration and production of hydrocarbons. In 2022, approximately 71% of Eni's total oil and gas production for the year derived from offshore fields, mainly in Egypt, Norway, Libya, Angola, Congo, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates, Kazakhstan, the United States, Venezuela and the United Kingdom. Offshore operations in the oil and gas industry are inherently riskier than onshore activities. Offshore accidents and spills could cause damage of catastrophic proportions to the ecosystem and to communities' health and security due to the apparent difficulties in handling hydrocarbons  containment  in  the  sea,  pollution,  poisoning of  water  and  organisms,  length  and  complexity  of  cleaning operations and other factors. Furthermore, offshore operations are subject to marine risks, including storms and other adverse weather conditions and perils of vessel collisions, which may cause material adverse effects on the Group's operations and the ecosystem.\n\nThe Company has invested and will continue to invest significant financial  resources  to  continuously  upgrade  the  methods  and systems for safeguarding the reliability of its plants, production facilities,  vessels,  transport  and  storage  infrastructures,  the safety  and  the  health  of  its  employees,  contractors,  local communities, and the environment, to prevent risks, to comply with applicable laws and policies and to respond to and learn from unforeseen incidents. Eni seeks to manage these operational risks  by  carefully  designing  and  building  facilities,  including wells,  industrial  complexes,  plants  and  equipment,  pipelines, storage sites and other facilities, and managing its operations in a safe and reliable manner and in compliance with all applicable rules and regulations, as well as by applying the best available techniques in the marketplace. However, these measures may ultimately not be completely successful in preventing and/or altogether eliminating risks of adverse events. Failure to properly manage these risks as well as accidental events like human errors,  unexpected  system  failure,  sabotages,  cyberattacks or  other  unexpected  drivers  could  cause  oil  spills,  blowouts, fire, release of toxic gas and pollutants into the atmosphere or the environment or in underground water and other incidents, all of which could lead to loss of life, damage to properties, environmental pollution, legal liabilities and/or damage claims and  consequently  a  disruption  in  operations  and  potential economic losses that could have a material and adverse effect on the Group's results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, business prospects, financial condition, and shareholder returns, including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares.\n\nEni also faces risks once production is discontinued because Eni's  activities  require  the  decommissioning  of  productive infrastructures, well plugging and the environmental remediation and  clean-up  of  industrial  hubs  and  oil  and  gas  fields  once production and manufacturing activities cease. Furthermore, in certain  situations  where  Eni  is  not  the  operator,  the  Company may  have  limited  influence  and  control  over  third  parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks. Eni  retains  worldwide  third-party  liability  insurance  coverage, which is designed to hedge part of the liabilities associated with damage to third parties, loss of value to the Group's assets related to adverse events and in connection with environmental clean-up and remediation. As of the date of this filing, maximum compensation allowed under such insurance coverage is equal to $1.1 billion in case of offshore incident and $1.3 billion in case  of  incident  at  onshore  facilities  (refineries).  Additionally, the Company may also activate further insurance coverage in case of specific capital projects and other industrial initiatives. Management  believes  that  its  insurance  coverage  is  in  line with industry practice and is enough to cover normal risks in its operations. However, the Company is not insured against all potential risks. In the event of a major environmental disaster, such as the incident which occurred at the Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico several years ago, Eni's third-party liability insurance would not provide any material coverage and thus the Company's liability would far exceed the maximum coverage provided by its insurance. The loss Eni could suffer in case of a disaster of material proportions would depend on all the facts and circumstances of the event and would be subject to a whole range  of  uncertainties,  including  legal  uncertainty  as  to  the scope of liability for consequential damages, which may include economic damage not directly connected to the disaster. The Company cannot guarantee that it will not suffer any uninsured loss and there can be no guarantee, particularly in the case of a major environmental disaster or industrial accident, that such a loss would not have a material adverse effect on the Company.\n\nThe occurrence of any of the above-mentioned risks could have a material and adverse impact on the Group's results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, business prospects, financial condition, and shareholder returns, including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares and could also damage the Group's reputation.\n\n## Risks  deriving  from  Eni's  exposure  to  weather conditions\n\nSignificant changes in weather conditions in Italy and in the rest of Europe from year to year may affect demand for natural gas and some refined products.\n\nIn colder years, demand for such products is higher. Accordingly, the results of operations of Eni's businesses engaged in the marketing of natural gas and, to a lesser extent, the Refining & Marketing business, as well as the comparability of results over",

Over  recent  years,  this  pattern  could  have  been possibly  affected  by  the  rising  frequency  of  weather  trends like  milder  winter  or  extreme  weather  events  like  heatwaves or unusually cold snaps, which are possible consequences of climate change.\n\n## The  Group  is  exposed  to  significant  financial, operational and industrial risks associated with the exploration and production of crude oil and natural gas\n\nThe exploration and production of oil and natural gas require high levels of capital expenditures and are subject to natural hazards and other uncertainties, including those relating to the physical characteristics of oil and gas fields. The exploration and production activities are subject to the mining risk that is the risk of discovering uncommercial quantities of hydrocarbons or of producing less reserves than initially estimated, and the risks of cost overruns and delayed start-up at the projects to develop and produce hydrocarbons reserves with adverse consequences on the return on capital employed. Those risks could have an adverse,  significant  impact  on  Eni's  future  growth  prospects, results  of  operations,  cash  flows,  liquidity,  and  shareholders' returns.\n\nThe production of oil and natural gas is highly regulated and is subject to conditions imposed by governments throughout the  world  in  matters  such  as  the  award  of  exploration  and production leases, the imposition of specific drilling and other work  obligations,  higher-than-average  rates  of  income  taxes, additional  royalties  and  taxes  on  production,  environmental protection  measures,  control  over  the  development  and decommissioning of fields and installations, and restrictions on production. A description of the main risks facing the Company's business in the exploration and production of oil and gas is provided below.\n\n## a)  Exploratory drilling efforts may be unsuccessful\n\nExploration activities are mainly subject to the mining risk, i.e. the risk of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. The costs of drilling and completing wells have margins of uncertainty, and drilling operations may be unsuccessful because of a large variety of factors, including geological failure, unexpected drilling conditions, pressure or heterogeneities in formations, equipment failures, well control (blowouts) and other forms of accidents. A large part of the Company exploratory drilling operations is located offshore, including in deep and ultra-deep waters, remote areas and environmentally-sensitive  locations  (such  as  the  Barents Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, deep water leases off West Africa, Indonesia,  the  Mediterranean  Sea  and  the  Caspian  Sea).  In these  locations,  the  Company  generally  experiences  higher operational risks and more challenging conditions and incurs higher  exploration  costs  than  onshore.  Furthermore,  deep\n\nand  ultra-deep  water  operations  require  significant  time before  commercial  production  of  discovered  reserves  can commence, increasing both the operational and the financial risks associated with these activities.\n\nBecause  Eni  plans  to  make  significant  investments  in executing exploration projects, it is likely that the Company will incur significant amounts of dry hole expenses in future years.  Unsuccessful  exploration  activities  and  failure  to discover additional commercial reserves could reduce future production of oil and natural gas, which is highly dependent on  the  rate  of  success  of  exploration  projects  and  could have an adverse impact on Eni's future performance, growth prospects and returns.\n\n## b) Development  projects  bear  significant  operational  risks which may adversely affect actual returns\n\nProjects to develop reserves of crude oil and natural gas normally take several years before production start-up after a discovery. Such long lead times are due to the complexity of the activities and tasks that need to be performed before a project final investment decision is made and commercial production  can  be  achieved.  Those  activities  include  the appraisal  of  a  discovery  to  evaluate  the  technical  and economic feasibility of the development project, obtaining the necessary authorizations from governments, state agencies or national oil companies, signing agreements with the first party regulating a project's contractual terms such as the production sharing and cost recovery, agreeing on fiscal terms, obtaining partners' approval, environmental permits and other conditions, signing long-term gas contracts, carrying out the concept design and the front-end engineering and building and commissioning the related plants and facilities. Moreover, projects executed with partners and joint venture partners reduce the ability of the Company to manage risks and costs, and Eni could have limited influence over and control of the operations and performance of its partners. The execution of development projects on time and on budget depends on several factors:\n\n- \u00b7 the outcome of negotiations with joint venture partners, governments and state-owned companies, suppliers and potential customers to define project terms and conditions, including,  for  example,  the  fiscal  take,  the  production sharing terms with the first party, or Eni's ability to negotiate favorable long-term contracts to market gas reserves;\n- \u00b7 timely issuance of permits and licenses by government agencies, including obtaining all necessary administrative authorizations to drill locations, install producing infrastructures, build pipelines and related equipment to transport and market hydrocarbons;\n- \u00b7 the ability to carry out the front-end engineering design in order to prevent the occurrence of technical inconvenience during the execution phase;\n- \u00b7 timely manufacturing and delivery of critical plants and equipment by contractors, like floating production storage",

We expect the prices of key input factors such as labour, basic materials (steel, cement, and other metals) and utilities to increase meaningfully in the next year or two due to rising  inflationary  pressures  rippling  through  the  entire supply chain at our development projects driven by higher worldwide  demand  for  commodities  and  semi-finished goods  as  well  as  a  shortage  of  productive  factors.  We also expect a rise in the daily rates of leased rigs and other drilling vessels and facilities as oil companies competes for a stable amount of supply of this kind of equipment. As a matter of fact, oilfield services companies have seen their revenues shrink meaningfully in recent years due to a contraction in capital expenditures made by their clients, and  they  have  responded  to  the  downturn  by  slashing costs and reducing expenditures in fleet upgrading and expansion;\n- \u00b7 the actual performance of the reservoir and natural field decline;\n- \u00b7 and  the  ability  and  time  necessary  to  build  suitable transport  infrastructures  to  export  production  to  final markets.\n\nThe occurrence of any of such risks may negatively affect the time-to-market of the reserves and may cause cost overruns and start-up delays, lengthening the project pay-back period. Those risks would adversely affect the economic returns of Eni's development projects and the achievement of production growth targets, also considering that those projects are exposed to the volatility of oil and gas prices which may be substantially different from those estimated when the investment decision was made, thereby leading to lower return rates.\n\nFinally, if the Company is unable to develop and operate major projects  as  planned,  it  could  incur  significant  impairment losses of capitalized costs associated with reduced future cash flows of those projects.\n\n## c)  Inability  to  replace  oil  and  natural  gas  reserves  could adversely  impact  results  of  operations  and  financial condition, including cash flows\n\nIn case the Company's exploration efforts are unsuccessful at  replacing  produced  oil  and  natural  gas,  its  reserves will decline. In addition to being a function of production, revisions  and  new  discoveries,  the  Company's  reserve replacement is also affected by the entitlement mechanism in its production sharing agreements ('PSAs'), whereby the Company is entitled to a portion of a field's reserves, the\n\nsale of which is intended to cover expenditures incurred by the Company to develop and operate the field. The higher the reference prices for Brent crude oil used to estimate Eni's  proved  reserves,  the  lower  the  number  of  barrels necessary to recover the same amount of expenditure, and vice versa.\n\nFuture oil and gas production is a function of the Company's ability  to  access  new  reserves  through  new  discoveries, application of improved techniques, success in development activity, negotiations with national oil companies and other owners of known reserves and acquisitions.\n\nAn  inability  to  replace  produced  reserves  by  discovering, acquiring, and developing additional reserves could adversely impact future production levels and growth prospects. If Eni is unsuccessful in meeting its long-term targets of reserve replacement, Eni's future total proved reserves and production will decline.\n\n## d) Uncertainties in estimates of oil and natural gas reserves\n\nThe accuracy of proved reserve estimates and of projections of future rates of production and timing of development costs depends  on  several  factors,  assumptions  and  variables, including:\n\n- \u00b7 the quality of available geological, technical and economic data and their interpretation and judgment;\n- \u00b7 management's assumptions regarding future rates of  production  and  costs  and  timing  of  operating  and development costs. The projections of higher operating and  development  costs  may  impair  the  ability  of  the Company  to  economically  produce  reserves  leading  to downward reserve revisions;\n- \u00b7 changes  in  the  prevailing  tax  rules,  other  government regulations and contractual terms and conditions;\n- \u00b7 results  of  drilling,  testing  and  the  actual  production performance  of  Eni's  reservoirs  after  the  date  of  the estimates  which  may  drive  substantial  upward  or downward revisions; and\n- \u00b7 changes in oil and natural gas prices which could affect the quantities of Eni's proved reserves since the estimates of reserves are based on prices and costs existing as of the date when these estimates are made.\n\nIn  2022,  despite  rising  hydrocarbons  prices,  we  incurred around \u20ac400 million of asset impairment at upstream cash generating units 'CGU' located in Congo, Egypt, the USA and Algeria  due  to  the  above-mentioned  risks  and  accounting estimates. As part of our yearly review of recoverability of the carrying amounts of oil & gas assets, we determined that certain amounts of previously booked proved reserves were no longer economically producible at those assets and we  increased  future  expected  development  expenditures leading to lower recoverable amounts and the recognition of impairment losses.",

        "page_content": "Lower  oil  prices  may  impair  the  ability  of  the  Company  to economically produce reserves leading to downward reserve revisions.\n\nMany of the factors, assumptions and variables underlying the  estimation  of  proved  reserves  involve  management's judgment  or  are  outside  management's  control  (prices, governmental  regulations)  and  may  change  over  time, therefore  affecting  the  estimates  of  oil  and  natural  gas reserves from year-to-year.\n\nThe prices used in calculating Eni's estimated proved reserves are, in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  (the  'U.S.  SEC')  requirements,  calculated  by determining the unweighted arithmetic average of the firstday-of-the-month  commodity  prices  for  the  preceding  12 months. For the 12-months ending at December 31, 2022, average  prices  were  based  on  101  $/barrel  for  the  Brent crude oil. Compared to the 2022 reference price, Brent prices have declined significantly in the first quarter of 2023. If such prices do not increase in the coming months, Eni's future calculations  of  estimated  proved  reserves  will  be  based on lower commodity prices which would likely result in the Company having to remove non-economic reserves from its proved reserves in future periods.\n\nAccordingly, the estimated reserves reported as of the end of  2022  could  be  significantly  different  from  the  quantities of oil and natural gas that will be ultimately recovered. Any downward revision in Eni's estimated quantities of proved reserves  would  indicate  lower  future  production  volumes, which  could  adversely  impact  Eni's  business  prospects, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\n\n## e)  The  development  of  the  Group's  proved  undeveloped reserves  may  take  longer  and  may  require  higher  levels of capital expenditures than it currently anticipates or the Group's proved undeveloped reserves may not ultimately be developed or produced\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2022,  approximately  37%  of  the Group's  total estimated  proved  reserves  (by  volume) were  undeveloped  and  may  not  be  ultimately  developed or  produced.  Recovery  of  undeveloped  reserves  requires significant capital expenditures  and  successful  drilling operations.  The  Group's  reserve  estimates  assume  it can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully. These assumptions may prove to be inaccurate and are subject to the risk of a structural decline in the prices of hydrocarbons due to a possible acceleration towards a low-carbon economy and a shift in consumers' behavior and preferences. In case of a prolonged decline in the prices of hydrocarbon the Group may not have enough financial  resources  to  make  the  necessary  expenditures  to recover  undeveloped  reserves.  The  Group's  reserve  report as of December 31, 2022 includes estimates of total future development and decommissioning costs associated with\n\nthe  Group's  proved  total  reserves  of  approximately  \u20ac44.3 billion  (undiscounted,  including  consolidated  subsidiaries and  equity-accounted  entities).  It  cannot  be  certain  that estimated costs of the development of these reserves will prove correct, development will occur as scheduled, or the results of such development will be as estimated. In case of change  in  the  Company's  plans  to  develop  those  reserves, or if it is not otherwise able to successfully develop these reserves as a result of the Group's inability to fund necessary capital expenditures or otherwise, it will be required to remove the associated volumes from the Group's reported proved reserves.\n\n## f)  The Oil & Gas industry is a capital-intensive business and needs large amount of funds to find and develop reserves. In case the Group does not have access to sufficient funds its oil&gas business may decline\n\nThe Oil & Gas industry is a capital intensive business. Eni makes and expects to continue making substantial capital expenditures in its business for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves. Over the next four  years,  the  Company  plans  to  invest  in  the  Oil  &  Gas business approximately \u20ac6-6.5 billion per year on average. Historically,  Eni's  capital  expenditures  have  been  financed with cash generated from operations, proceeds from asset disposals, borrowings under its credit facilities and proceeds from the issuance of debt and bonds. The actual amount and timing of future capital expenditures may differ materially from  Eni's  estimates  as  a  result  of,  among  other  things, changes in commodity prices, changes in cost of oil services, available cash flows, lack of access to capital, actual drilling results, the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment,  the  availability  of  transportation  capacity,  and regulatory, technological and competitive developments. Eni's cash flows from operations and access to capital markets are subject to several variables, including but not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 the amount of Eni's proved reserves;\n- \u00b7 the volume of crude oil and natural gas Eni is able to produce and sell from existing wells;\n- \u00b7 the prices at which crude oil and natural gas are marketed;\n- \u00b7 Eni's ability to acquire, find and produce new reserves;\n- \u00b7 and the ability and willingness of Eni's lenders to extend credit or of participants in the capital markets to invest in Eni's bonds.\n\nIf  revenues  or  Eni's  ability  to  borrow  decrease  significantly due to factors such as a prolonged decline in crude oil and natural gas prices or a more stringent investment framework on  part  of  lenders  and  financing  institutions  due  to  ESG considerations, Eni might have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain its planned capital expenditures. In  addition,  a  greater  than  expected  capital  expenditure may  curtail  Eni's  ability  to  return  cash  to  is  shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. If cash generated by operations, cash from asset disposals, or cash available",

        "page_content": "under  Eni's  liquidity  reserves  or  its  credit  facilities  is  not sufficient to meet capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of operations relating to development of Eni's reserves, which in turn could adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows and its ability to achieve its growth plans. The variability of Eni's cash flow from operation has become an even greater risk factor in the current scenario, which is featuring significant increases in expenditures to sustain the Company's current production plateau. In 2022 our capital expenditures in the E&P segment increased by about 60% to \u20ac6.4 billion due to the need to catch up following the capex cuts and activities rescheduling  made  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  cost inflation, the appreciation of US dollar against the Euro (up by 10% in 2022) and the start of new projects. Higher cash requirements to fund the Company's capital plans at a time when hydrocarbons prices may come under pressure due to macroeconomic risks may increase the Company's financial risk profile and may require us to take on new finance debt from banks and financing institutions.\n\nFinally, funding Eni's capital expenditures with additional debt will increase its leverage and the issuance of additional debt will require a portion of Eni's cash flows from operations to be used for the payment of interest and principal on its debt, thereby reducing its ability to use cash flows to fund capital expenditures and dividends.\n\n## g) Oil & gas activity may be subject to increasingly high levels of income taxes and royalties\n\nOil and gas operations are subject to the payment of royalties and income taxes, which tend to be higher than those payable in other commercial activities. Management believes that the marginal tax rate in the oil & gas industry tends to increase in correlation with higher oil prices, which could make it more difficult  for  Eni  to  translate  higher  oil  prices  into  increased net  profit.  However,  the  Company  does  not  expect  that  the marginal tax rate will decrease in response to falling oil prices. Adverse changes in the tax rate applicable to the Group's profit before income taxes in its oil and gas operations would have a negative impact on Eni's future results of operations and cash flows.\n\nThe surge in hydrocarbons and electricity prices drove a strong rebound in the results of companies in the energy sector.  This  trend  started  in  2021  due  to  a  rebound  in economic  activity  post  the  COVID-19  downturn  and  then accelerated  in  2022  due  to  market  fundamentals  and geopolitical factors. The rise in the cost of fuels and energy has significantly  and  adversely  affected  businesses'  profit margins and households' disposable income. In response to growing public concern, in the course of 2022 governments of  EU  member  states  and  of  UK  have  enacted  or  have announced  the  intention  to  enact  one-off  or  temporary windfall levies to increase the taxes on the profits of energy\n\ncompanies relating to the portion of those profits deemed to exceed historical averages, to collect funds to alleviate the financial burden on households and businesses due to rising costs of fuels and energy.\n\nIn Italy, Law No.51 of May 20, 2022, enacted a solidarity contribution for energy companies by establishing a one-off, windfall tax on the profits of those businesses. The levy was calculated by applying a 25% rate to the increase of the balance of sales and purchases declared in the periodic settlement of the value added tax in the six-month period starting October 1 st , 2021 through April, 30, 2022 over the corresponding prior years  period.  The  Company  recognized  a  cash  expense  of about \u20ac1.04 billion to settle this tax item.\n\nIn October, EU regulation 1854/2022 introduced a solidarity contribution for EU companies with activities in the crude petroleum, natural gas, coal and refinery sectors in order to mitigate the economic effects of the soaring energy prices for public  authorities'  budgets,  final  customers  and  companies across the EU. Each Member State is demanded to adopt a  national  legislation  to  comply  with  that  regulation.  As part of that framework, the Italian government through the budget law for 2023 has enacted a windfall levy calculated by applying a 50% rate to the portion of taxable profit earned by companies in the hydrocarbons sector in 2022, which exceeds an amount equal to 110% of the average taxable profit of the previous four-year period. To account for this additional levy, the Group recognized a tax expense of about \u20ac1 billion, with the relevant cash out due in the course of 2023. Also Germany enacted a similar levy on the company's our refining activity in this country, leading to the recognition of a tax expense of \u20ac0.17 billion.\n\nFinally,  the  UK  Energy  Profits  Levy  was  enacted  effective May 26, 2022, which added a windfall tax rate of 25% to the corporate tax rate of oil & gas companies operating in UK and in the UK continental shelf. As a result of this windfall tax, the UK corporate tax rate increased to 65%. The windfall tax will remain valid until hydrocarbons prices normalize, and however no further than December 31, 2025. Eni accrued a  charge  of  about  \u20ac170  million  to  account  for  that  levy. Furthermore, the UK proposal of budget law for fiscal year 2023 provisioned an increase of that rate to 35% and an extension of its term until the first quarter of 2028. Based on the latest levy modifications, the Company expects to incur a significant burden of income taxes at its UK activities in the next years, until the planned levy expiration in 2028.\n\nOverall, all those extraordinary tax charges affected the Group net income for about \u20ac2.4 billion and reduced the yearly cash flow by about \u20ac1.1 billion.\n\nGiven the current environment of high energy prices, rising pressures on public finances due to an expected economic slowdown  and  the  perception  the  oil  &  gas  companies",

        "page_content": "may  be  benefiting  from  the  ongoing  geopolitical  situation, management cannot rule out the possibility of the introduction of new windfall taxes and other extraordinary levies targeting the hydrocarbons sector, which could negatively affect the Group's results of operations and cash flows.\n\n## h) The present value of future net revenues from Eni's proved reserves  will  not  necessarily  be  the  same  as  the  current market value of Eni's estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves\n\nThe present value of future net revenues from Eni's proved reserves may differ from the current market value of Eni's estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves. In accordance with  the  SEC  rules,  Eni  bases  the  estimated  discounted future net revenues from proved reserves on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month commodity prices for the preceding twelve months. Actual future prices may be materially higher or lower than the SEC pricing method in the calculations. Actual future net revenues from crude oil and natural gas properties will be affected by factors such as:\n\n- \u00b7 the actual prices Eni receives for sales of crude oil and natural gas;\n- \u00b7 the actual cost and timing of development and production expenditures;\n- \u00b7 the timing and amount of actual production; and\n- \u00b7 changes in governmental regulations or taxation.\n\nThe timing of both Eni's production and its incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of crude oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing and  amount  of  actual  future  net  revenues  from  proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. Additionally, the 10% discount factor Eni uses when calculating discounted future net revenues may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with Eni's reserves or the crude oil and natural gas industry in general.\n\n- i)  Oil  and  gas  activity  may  be  subject  to  increasingly  high levels  of  regulations  throughout  the  world,  which  may have an impact on the Group's extraction activities and the recoverability of reserves\n\nThe production of oil and natural gas is highly regulated and is subject to conditions imposed by governments throughout the world in matters such as the award of exploration and production  leases,  the  imposition  of  specific  drilling  and other work obligations, environmental and safety protection measures, control over the development and abandonment of fields and installations, and restrictions on production. These risks can limit the Group's access to hydrocarbons reserves or may cause the Group to redesign, curtail or cease its oil and gas operations with significant effects on the Group's business prospects, results of operations and cash flow.\n\n## Risks related to political considerations\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, about 81% of Eni's proved hydrocarbon reserves were located in non-OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation  and  Development)  countries,  mainly  in  Africa, Central Asia and Middle East where the socio-political framework, the financial system and the macroeconomic outlook are less stable than in the OECD countries. In those non-OECD countries, Eni is exposed to a wide range of political risks and uncertainties, which may impair Eni's ability to continue operating economically on a temporary or permanent basis, and Eni's ability to access oil and gas reserves. Particularly, Eni faces risks in connection with the following potential issues and risks:\n\n- \u00b7 socio-political instability leading to internal conflicts, revolutions, establishment of non-democratic  regimes, protests, attacks, and other forms of civil disorder and unrest, such as strikes, riots, sabotage, blockades, vandalism and theft of crude oil at pipelines, acts of violence and similar events. These risks could result in disruptions to economic activity, loss of output, plant closures and shutdowns, project delays, loss of assets and threats to the security of personnel. They may disrupt financial and commercial markets, including the supply of and pricing for oil and natural gas, and generate greater  political  and  economic  instability  in  some  of  the geographical areas in which Eni operates. Additionally, any possible reprisals because of military or other action, such as acts of terrorism in Europe, the United States or elsewhere, could have a material adverse effect on the world economy and hence on the global demand for hydrocarbons. In recent years including 2022, we have experienced higher-than-usual frequency in the theft of oil at our pipelines in Nigeria, which have resulted in significant loss of output and revenues;\n- \u00b7 lack  of  well-established  and  reliable  legal  systems  and uncertainties surrounding the enforcement of contractual rights;\n- \u00b7 unfavorable enforcement of laws, regulations and contractual arrangements leading, for example, to expropriation, nationalization or forced divestiture of assets and unilateral cancellation or modification of contractual terms;\n- \u00b7 sovereign default or financial instability since those countries rely heavily on petroleum revenues to sustain public finance. Financial  difficulties  at  country  level  often  translate  into failure by state-owned companies and agencies to fulfil their financial  obligations  towards  Eni  relating  to  funding  capital commitments in projects operated by Eni or to timely paying for supplies of equity oil and gas volumes;\n- \u00b7 restrictions on exploration, production, imports and exports;\n- \u00b7 tax or royalty increases (including retroactive claims);\n- \u00b7 difficulties in finding qualified international or local suppliers in critical operating environments; and\n- \u00b7 complex  processes  of  granting  authorizations  or  licenses affecting time-to-market of certain development projects.\n\nAreas where Eni operates and where the Company is particularly exposed to political risk include, but are not limited to Libya, Venezuela, and Nigeria.",

        "page_content": "Eni's  operations  in  Libya  are  currently  exposed  to  significant geopolitical  risks.  The  social  and  political  instability  of  the Country  dates  back  to  the  revolution  of  2011  that  brought  a change of regime and a civil war, triggering an uninterrupted period of lack of well-established institutions and recurrent acts of internal conflict, clashes, acts of war, disorders and other forms of civil turmoil and unrest between the two conflicting factions that emerged in the post-revolution political landscape. In  the  year  of  the  revolution,  Eni's  operations  in  Libya  were materially affected by a full-scale war, which forced the Company to shut down its development and extractive activities for almost all  of  2011,  with  a  significant  negative  impact  on  the  Group's results of operation and cash flow. In subsequent years, Eni has experienced frequent disruptions to its operations, albeit on a smaller scale than in 2011, due to security threats to its installations and personnel and plan shutdowns due to force majeure. Since September 2020, the country had undergone a phase of stability which lasted for a large part of 2021, thanks to a pacification agreement with the aim of installing a new government freely elected by the entire population. However, the electoral process failed and the opposition between the Government  of  National  Unity  installed  in  Tripoli  and  the self-appointed National Stability Government installed in the east  of  the  country  resumed,  fueling  protests  for  a  better redistribution of oil revenues and social tension. In 2022, the situation of instability and disorder determined between April and June the almost total shutdown of oil production in the eastern part of the country and the main export terminals, while two factions were disputing the appointment of the top management of the NOC State Company. The force majeure affected  some  assets  participated  by  Eni.  In  2022,  Eni's production in Libya was 159 kboe/d.\n\nManagement  believes  that  Libya's  geopolitical  situation  will continue to represent a source of risk and uncertainty to Eni's operations in the country and to the Group's results of operations and  cash  flow. Currently, Libyan production represents approximately 10% of the Group's total production.\n\nVenezuela  is  currently  experiencing  a  situation  of  financial stress, which has been exacerbated by the economic recession caused  by  the  effects  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Lack  of financial resources to support the development of the country's hydrocarbons  reserves  has  negatively  affected  the  country's production levels and hence fiscal revenues. The situation has been made worse by certain international sanctions targeting the country's financial system and its ability to export crude oil to U.S. markets, which is the main outlet of Venezuelan production, as well as a US ban on dealing with Venezuela's state-owned petroleum entities.\n\nCurrently, the Company retains just one main asset in Venezuela: the 50%-participated Card\u00f3n IV joint venture, which is operating an offshore natural gas field and is supplying its production to the national oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA ('PDVSA'), under\n\na long-term supply agreement. PDVSA has failed to regularly pay the receivables for the gas volumes supplied by Card\u00f3n IV and consequently a significant amount of overdue receivables is outstanding at the closing date of the financial year 2022 and a credit loss provision has been booked to reflect the counterparty risk. The Company incurred in past years significant impairment losses and reserves de-bookings at the other main project in Venezuela  relating  to  the  PetroJunin  onshore  oilfield  and  at other minor projects, which were completely written off in past reporting periods. As of 31 December 2021, Eni's invested capital in Venezuela was approximately \u20ac1.1 billion, mainly relating to trade receivable owed to us by PDVSA. Due to a partial lifting of US sanctions on the trade of Venezuelan crude oil, Eni was able in 2022 to obtain the reimbursement in-kind of a portion of its trade receivables, so to partly offset the increase of the year due to the current natural gas production and revenues. However, there is still a great deal of uncertainty about any possible evolution of the US sanctions against Venezuela and our ability to recover our outstanding receivables.\n\nThe  Group  has  significant  credit  exposure  towards  stateowned and privately-held local companies in Nigeria in relation to their share of funding of petroleum projects operated by Eni.  Eni  has  incurred significant credit losses because of the ongoing difficulties of Eni's Nigerian counterparts to reimburse amounts past due.\n\nFurthermore, Eni's operations in Nigeria were negatively affected by continuing acts of theft of oil at onshore pipelines.\n\nFinally, Eni's Oil Prospecting License 245 expired in May 2021 and a request is pending to convert the license into an oil mining license to start development operations of the license reserves before the Nigerian authorities in charge. The management believes the request of conversion complies with the contractual terms, deadlines, and any other applicable conditions. However, the Nigerian authorities are holding back the approval. Eni has started an arbitration before an ICSID court to preserve the value of its asset.\n\n## Sanction targets\n\nThe most relevant sanction programs for Eni are those issued by the European Union and the United States of America and, as of today, the restrictive measures adopted by such authorities in respect of Russia and Venezuela.\n\nAs consequence of Russia's military aggression of Ukraine, the European Union, the United Kingdom, the United States and the G-7 countries adopted a comprehensive system of sanctions against Russia to weaken its economy and its ability to finance the war. The sanction system is constantly evolving.\n\nThe main targets of the sanctions are the Russian Central Bank and the major financial institutions of the country. The EU has sanctioned  the  Russian  Central  Bank  and  many  commercial banks by freezing assets and imposing a ban on EU operators",

In  accordance  with  these  guidelines, Eni complied with a new procedure of payment in rubles of Russian gas supplies, requested by the supplier GazpromExport in  execution  of  legislative  acts  to  which  Eni  is  not  subject (presidential decrees of the President of the Russian Federation).\n\nThe adhesion to this new payment procedure, not provided by the existing contractual provisions of regulation in euro, took place after considering the risks of possible violation of the sanction's regime, as well as all the risks related to the duty to implement fairly the contractual obligations and after obtaining the prior approval of the Italian Authorities, responsible for verifying the compliance with the EU sanctions.\n\nEni  has  agreed  to  adhere  to  the  new  procedure,  which  we believe  does  not  constitute  a  unilateral  modification  of  the supply contract and invoices have continued to be issued in euro. This new procedure provides: (i) the opening by Eni, as a precautionary measure, of two currency accounts called \"K accounts\" at the Russian Gazprombank; (ii) the deposit by Eni of the invoices balance expressed in euro in one of the two K accounts (the one denominated in euro); (iii) the conversion by Gazprombank into rubles at the Moscow Stock Exchange in the following 48 hours through a clearing agent; (iv) the transfer according to the procedure of rubles obtained in the second K account (denominated in rubles). GazpromExport will be paid through this latter K account.\n\nEni  considers  that  this  conversion  does  not  constitute  the management of assets or reserves of the Russian Central Bank or a form of financing for Gazprombank or other entities subject to EU sanctions, as well as that the opening of K accounts takes place without prejudice to any of its contractual rights, which provide for the fulfilment of the obligation to pay in euro, while the risks and charges for conversion into rubles remains at the responsibility of the Russian supplier.\n\nAs a precautionary measure, Eni has initiated an international arbitration  based  on  the  Swedish  law  (as  required  by  the existing contracts) to resolve doubts regarding the contractual changes required by the new payment procedure and the correct allocation of costs and risks.\n\nFurthermore, an escalation of the international crisis, resulting in a tightening of sanctions, could entail a significant disruption of energy supply and trade flows globally, which could have a  material  adverse  effect  on  the  Group's  business,  financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.\n\nFrom  2017,  the  United  States  have  enacted  a  regime  of economic and financial sanctions against Venezuela. The scope of the restrictions, initially targeting certain financial instruments issued or sold by the Government of Venezuela, was gradually expanded over 2017 and 2018 and then significantly broadened during the course of 2019 when PDVSA, the main national stateowned enterprise, has been added to the 'Specially Designated Nationals  and  Blocked  Persons  List'  and  the  Venezuelan government  and  its  controlled  entities  became  subject  to assets freeze in the United States. Even if such U.S. sanctions are substantially 'primary' and therefore dedicated in principle to U.S. persons only, retaliatory measures and other adverse consequences may also interest foreign entities which operate with Venezuelan listed entities and/or in the oil sector of the country. The U.S. sanction regime against Venezuela was further tightened in the final part of 2020 by restricting any Venezuelan oil exports, including swap schemes utilised by foreign entities to  recover  trade  and  financing  receivables  from  PDVSA  and other Venezuelan counterparties. This latter tightening of the sanction regime has reduced the Group's ability to collect the trade receivable owed to Eni for its activity in the country in 2021 and 2022, except for limited waivers agreed with US relevant authorities.\n\nEni carefully evaluates on a case-by-case basis the adoption of adequate measures to minimize its exposure to any sanctions risk which may affect its business operation. In any case, the U.S. sanctions add stress to the already complex financial, political and operating outlook of the country, which could further limit the ability of Eni to recover its investments in Venezuela.\n\n## Specific risks of the Company's gas business in Italy\n\n- a) Current, negative trends in the competitive environment of the European natural gas sector may impair the Company's ability to fulfil its minimum off-take obligations in connection with its take-or-pay, long-term gas supply contracts\n\nEni is currently party to a few long-term gas supply contracts with  state-owned  companies  of  key  producing  countries, from where most of the gas supplies directed to Europe are sourced  via  pipeline  (Russia,  Algeria,  Libya  and  Norway). These contracts which were intended to support Eni's sales plan in Italy and in other European markets, provide takeor-pay  clauses  whereby  the  Company  has  an  obligation to lift minimum, preset volumes of gas in each year of the contractual term or, in case of failure, to pay the whole price, or a fraction of that price, up to a minimum contractual quantity. Similar  considerations  apply  to  ship-or-pay  contractual",

        "page_content": "obligations  which  arise  from  contracts  with  transmission system operators or pipeline owners, which the Company has entered into to secure long-term transport capacity. Longterm gas supply contracts with take-or pay clauses expose the Company to a volume risk, as the Company is obligated to purchase an annual minimum volume of gas, or in case of failure, to pay the underlying price. The structure of the Company's portfolio of gas supply contracts is a risk to the profitability outlook of Eni's wholesale gas business due to the current competitive dynamics in the European gas markets. In past downturns of the gas sector, the Company incurred significant  cash  outflows  in  response  to  its  take-or-pay obligations. Furthermore, the Company's wholesale business is exposed to volatile spreads between the procurement costs of gas, which are linked to spot prices at European hubs or to the price of crude oil, and the selling prices of gas which are mainly indexed to spot prices at the Italian hub.\n\nEni's  management  is  planning  to  continue  its  strategy  of renegotiating the Company's long-term gas supply contracts in order to constantly align pricing terms to current market conditions as they evolve and to obtain greater operational flexibility to  better  manage  the  take-or-pay  obligations (volumes and delivery points among others), considering the risk factors described above. The revision clauses included in these contracts state the right of each counterparty to renegotiate  the  economic  terms  and  other  contractual conditions  periodically,  in  relation  to  ongoing  changes  in the gas scenario. Management believes that the outcome of those renegotiations is uncertain in respect of both the amount  of  the  economic  benefits  that  will  be  ultimately obtained and the timing of recognition of profit. Furthermore, in case Eni and the gas suppliers fail to agree on revised contractual  terms,  both  parties  can  start  an  arbitration procedure to obtain revised contractual conditions. All these possible  developments  within  the  renegotiation  process could increase the level of risks and uncertainties relating the outcome of those renegotiations.\n\n- b) Risks  associated  with  the  regulatory  powers  entrusted  to the  Italian  Regulatory  Authority  for  Energy,  Networks  and Environment in the matter of pricing to residential customers Eni's wholesale gas and retail gas and power businesses are subject to regulatory risks mainly in Italy's domestic market. The Italian Regulatory Authority for Energy, Networks and Environment (the 'Authority') is entrusted with certain powers in the matter of natural gas and power pricing. Specifically, the Authority retains a surveillance power on pricing in the natural gas market in Italy and the power to establish selling tariffs for the supply of natural gas to residential and commercial users who are opting for adhering to regulated tariffs until the market is fully opened. Developments in the regulatory framework intended to increase the level of market liquidity or of deregulation or intended to reduce operators' ability to transfer to customers cost increases in raw materials may\n\nnegatively affect future sales margins of gas and electricity, operating results, and cash flow. In the current environment characterized by rising energy costs, it is increasingly possible that  the  Authority  may  enact  measures  intended  to  limit revenues of inframarginal power generation and to reduce the indexation of the cost of the raw materials in pricing formulae applied by retail companies that market natural gas and electricity to residential customers and that development could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flow in the domestic retail business of natural gas and power. In the current energy crisis context, characterized by many regulatory interventions at EU and national level aimed at ensuring security of supply and curbing consumptions and energy  prices  for  final  customers,  also  our  GGP  business that engages in the wholesale marketing of natural gas and the power generation business that sell produced electricity on the spot market could be exposed to a regulatory risk, although on a smaller scale than the retail business due to well-established and liquid spot markets for natural gas and electricity.\n\n## Risks related to environmental, health and safety regulations and relevant legal risks\n\nEni  has  incurred  in  the  past,  and  will  continue  incurring  in future years, material operating expenses and expenditures in relation  to  compliance  with  applicable  environmental,  health and safety regulations, including compliance with any national or international regulation on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\n\nEni  is  subject  to  numerous  European  Union,  international, national,  regional  and  local  laws  and  regulations  regarding the impact of its operations on the environment and on health and safety of employees, contractors, communities and on the value of properties. Laws and regulations intended to preserve the environment and to safeguard health and safety of workers and  communities  impose  several  obligations,  requirements and  prohibitions  to  the  Company's  businesses  due  to  their inherent nature because of flammability, dangerousness and toxicity of hydrocarbons and of objective risks of industrial processes to explore, develop, extract, refine and transport oil, gas, and products. Generally, these laws and regulations require acquisition of a permit before drilling for hydrocarbons may commence, restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with exploration, drilling and production activities, including refinery and petrochemical plant operations, limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain protected areas, require to remove and dismantle drilling platforms and other equipment and well plug-in once oil and gas operations have terminated, provide for measures to be taken to protect the safety of the workplace,  the  health  of  employees,  contractors  and  other Company  collaborators  and  of  communities  involved  by  the Company's activities,  and  impose  criminal  and  civil  liabilities for  polluting  the  environment  or  harming  employees'  or",

These laws and regulations control the emission of scrap substances and pollutants, discipline the handling of hazardous materials and set limits to or prohibit the discharge of soil, water or groundwater contaminants, emissions of toxic gases and other air pollutants or can impose taxes on carbon dioxide  emissions,  as  in  the  case  of  the  European  Trading Scheme that requires the purchase of an emission allowance for each tons of carbon dioxide emitted in the environment above a pre-set threshold, resulting from the operation of oil and natural gas extraction and processing plants, petrochemical plants, refineries, service stations, vessels, oil carriers, pipeline systems and other facilities owned or operated by Eni.\n\nIn addition, Eni's operations are subject to laws and regulations relating  to  the  production,  handling,  transportation,  storage, disposal and treatment of waste. Breaches of environmental, health  and  safety  laws  and  regulations  as  in  the  case  of negligent or willful release of pollutants and contaminants into the atmosphere, the soil, water or groundwater or exceeding the concentration thresholds of contaminants set by the law expose the Company to the incurrence of liabilities associated with compensation for environmental, health or safety damage and  expenses  for  environmental  remediation  and  clean-up. Furthermore, in the case of violation of certain rules regarding the safeguard of the environment and the health and safety of employees, contractors, and other collaborators of the Company, and  of  communities,  the  Company  may  incur  liabilities  in connection with the negligent or willful violations of laws by its employees as per Italian Law Decree No. 231/2001.\n\nEnvironmental, health and safety laws and regulations have a substantial impact on Eni's operations. Management expects that  the  Group  will  continue  to  incur  significant  amounts  of operating expenses and expenditures in the foreseeable future to  comply  with  laws  and  regulations  and  to  safeguard  the environment and the health and safety of employees, contractors and communities involved by the Company operations, including:\n\n- \u00b7 costs  to  prevent,  control,  eliminate  or  reduce  certain types  of  air  and  water  emissions  and  handle  waste  and other  hazardous  materials,  including  the  costs  incurred in connection with government action to address climate change  (see  the  specific  section  below  on  climate-related risks);\n- \u00b7 remedial and clean-up measures related to environmental contamination or accidents at various sites, including those owned by third parties;\n- \u00b7 damage compensation claimed by individuals and entities, including local, regional or state administrations, should Eni cause any kind of accident, oil spill, well blowouts, pollution, contamination, emission of air pollutants and toxic gases above  permitted  levels  or  of  any  other  hazardous  gases, water, ground or air contaminants or pollutants, as a result of its operations or if the Company is found guilty of violating environmental laws and regulations; and\n\n- \u00b7 costs in connection with the decommissioning and removal of drilling platforms and other facilities, and well plugging at  the  end  of  oil  and  gas  field  production.  Also,  in  case management  decides  to  shut  down  production  lines  at refineries or petrochemicals complex, the Group would incur liabilities to dismantle and remove production facilities put out of service and to clean up and to remediate the area, as occurred in 2022 with management's resolution to halt a refinery unit and ancillary equipment at an Italian refinery.\n\nAs  a  further  consequence  of  any  new  laws  and  regulations or  other  factors,  like  the  actual  or  alleged  occurrence  of environmental damage at Eni's plants and facilities, the Company may be forced to curtail, modify or cease certain operations or implement temporary shutdowns of facilities. If any of the risks set out above materialise, they could adversely impact the Group's results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, business prospects, financial condition, and shareholder returns, including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares.\n\n## Climate change-related risks\n\n- a) Increasing worldwide efforts to tackle climate change may lead to the adoption of stricter regulations to curb carbon emissions and this may end up suppressing demands for our products in medium-to-long term.\n\nGovernments of the nations that have signed the 2015 COP 21 Paris Agreement have been advancing plans and initiatives intended to transition the economy towards a low-carbon model in the long run to pursue the objective of containing the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above preindustrial levels and  tackling  risks  of  structural  modifications  to  the  Earth climate, which would pose serious threat to life on the planet. The scientific community has been sounding alarms over the potential, catastrophic consequences caused by rising global temperatures to the environment and has established that the release in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) as a result of burning fossil fuels and other human activities and the emissions of other harmful gases like methane are the main drivers of climate change. The rising in frequency and dangerousness of many extreme weather events has been widely recognized as a direct consequence of the climate change  such  as  floods,  drought,  hurricanes,  heat  waves, cold snaps, rising sea levels, fires, and other environmental mutations,  which  have  been  causing  material  damage to  economies,  loss  of  human  lives,  damage  to  property, destruction of ecosystems and other negative impacts. The energy transition, as well as increasingly stricter regulations in  the  field  of  CO 2 emission, could adversely and materially affect  demands  for  the  Group's  products  and  hence  our business, results of operations and prospects.\n\nThe dramatic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic activity and people's lifestyle could have possibly accelerated",

        "page_content": "the evolution toward a low-carbon model of development. This is because many governments and the EU deployed massive amounts of resources to help the economy recover and a large part of this economic stimulus has been or is planned to be directed to help transitioning the economy and the energy mix towards a low-carbon model, as in the case of the EU's recovery fund, which provides for huge investments in the sector of renewable energies and the green economy, including large-scale adoption of hydrogen as a new energy source.\n\nThose risks may emerge in the short, medium and long term. Eni expects that the achievement of the Paris Agreement goal of limiting the rise in temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above  pre-  industrial  levels  in  this  century,  or  the  more ambitious  goal  of  limiting  global  warming  to  1.5\u00b0C,  will strengthen  the  global  response  to  the  issue  of  climate change and spur governments to introduce measures and policies targeting the reduction of GHG emissions, which are expected to bring about a gradual reduction in the use of fossil fuels over the medium to long-term, notably through the diversification of the energy mix, likely reducing local demand  for  fossil  fuels  and  negatively  affecting  global demand for oil and natural gas.\n\nAlthough the Company is investing a significant amount of resources  to  develop  decarbonized  products  and  to  grow the generation capacity of renewable power and other low and zero carbon technologies to produce power or absorb carbon  dioxide  (CO 2 )  from  the  atmosphere,  the  Group's financial performance and business prospects still depends in a substantial way on the legacy business of Exploration &  Production.  In  case  demands  for  hydrocarbons  decline rapidly due to widespread adoption of regulations, rules or international  treaties  designed  to  reduce  GHG  emissions, our results of operations and business prospects may be significantly and negatively affected.\n\nEni  expects  its  operating  and  compliance  expenses  to increase in the short term due to the likely growing adoption of carbon tax mechanisms. Some governments have already introduced carbon pricing schemes, which can be an effective measure to reduce GHG emissions at the lowest overall cost to society. Currently, about half of the direct GHG emissions coming from Eni's operated assets are included in national or  supranational  Carbon  Pricing  Mechanisms,  such  as  the European Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), which provides an  obligation  to  purchase,  on  the  open  market,  emission allowances in case GHG emissions exceed a pre-set amount of emission allowances allotted for free. In 2022 to comply with this carbon emissions scheme, Eni purchased on the open  market  allowances  corresponding  to  16.73  million tons  of  CO 2 emissions incurring expenses of around \u20ac950 million (12.42 million tons in 2021 for a total expense of \u20ac660 million). Due to the likelihood of new regulations in this area and expectations of a reduction in free allowances under the\n\nEuropean ETS and the likely adoption of similar schemes by a rising number of governments, Eni is aware of the risk that a growing share of the Group's GHG emissions could be subject to carbon-pricing and other forms of climate regulation in the near future, leading to additional compliance and cost obligations with respect to the release in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide. In the future, we could incur increased investments  and  significantly  higher  operating  expenses  in case the Company is unable to reduce the carbon footprint of its operations. Eni also expects that governments will require companies to apply technical measures to reduce their GHG emissions.\n\n## b) In  the  long-term  demands  for  hydrocarbons  may  be materially  reduced  by  the  projected  mass  adoption  of electric  vehicles,  the  development  of  green  hydrogen,  the deployment  of  massive  investments  to  grow  renewable energies also supported by governments fiscal policies and the development of other technologies to produce clean feedstock, fuels and energy.\n\nIn the long-term, the role of hydrocarbons in satisfying a large portion of the energy needs of the global economy may  be  displaced  by  the  emergence  of  new  products and  technologies,  as  well  as  by  changing  consumers' preferences. The automotive industry is investing material amounts  of  resources  to  upgrade  its  assembly  line  to ramp-up production of electric vehicles (EVs) and to boost the EVs line-up, with R&D efforts focused on reducing the performance and cost gap with the internal-combustionengine cars and light-duty vehicles, particularly by extending batteries range. The EV market has attracted large amounts of venture capital and financing, which have propelled the growth of an entirely new batch of pure-EV players, which are introducing smart EV models to gain consumers preference and market share, fueling continuing innovation in the sector and accelerating the strategic shift of well-established car companies. Sales of EVs have grown significantly in 2022, also  thanks  to  fiscal  incentives  designed  to  increase  the affordability of EVs by middle and low-income households, and according to market projections sales of EVs will surpass internal-combustion-engine sales by 2030 also helped by proposed measures to be introduced by states and local administration  to  ban  sales  of  new  internal-combustionengine cars. This trend could disrupt in the long term the consumption of gasoline which is one of the main drivers of  global  crude  oil  demand.  Other  potentially  disruptive technologies designated to produce clean energy and fuels are emerging, driven by the development of hydrogen-based solutions as an energy vector or the utilization of renewables feedstock to manufacture fuels and other goods replacing oil-based products. Production of hydrogen by means of green technologies will also reduce hydrocarbons demands. The  electricity  generation  from  wind  power  or  solar technologies is projected to grow massively in line with the stated targets by several governments and institutions like",

If existing or future laws, regulations, treaties,  or  international  agreements  related  to  GHG  and climate  change,  including  state  incentives  to  conserve energy  or  use  alternative  energy  sources,  technological breakthroughs in the field of renewable energies, hydrogen, production of nuclear energy or mass adoption of electric vehicles trigger a structural decline in worldwide demand for oil and natural gas, Eni's results of operations and business prospects may be materially and adversely affected.\n\n## c)  Supranational  institutions,  like  the  United  Nations,  civil society  and  the  scientific  community  are  calling  for bold  action  to  tackle  climate  change  and  this  may  lead governments to take extraordinary measures to cut carbon emissions\n\nThe United Nations, representatives from the civil society, some Non-Governmental Organizations ('NGO'), international institutions  and  the  scientific  community  have  become increasingly  vocal  about  the  dramatic  consequences  of climate  change  for  the  life  on  the  planet,  warning  about irreversible  damages  to  the  ecosystem  and  calling  for drastic  and  immediate  actions  by  governments  to  tackle the  emergency.  In  a  report  issued  on  May  18,  2021  the International Energy Agency has claimed that to reach netzero  GHG  emissions  by  2050  and  commitments  set  out in the Paris Agreement, there must be an immediate ban on investments in new oil and gas projects. In response to those  requests  for  intervention,  it  is  possible  that  certain governments  in  jurisdictions  where  we  operate  may  deny permissions to start new oil and gas projects or may impose further restrictions on drilling and other field activities or ban oil&gas operations altogether. These possible developments could  significantly  and  negatively  affect  our  business's prospects and results of operations.\n\n- d) We are exposed to growing legal risks in connection with the  hundreds  of  lawsuits  pending  in  various  jurisdictions against oil&gas companies based on alleged violation of human rights, damage to environment and other claims and such legal actions may be brought against us\n\nIn recent years, there has been a marked increase in climatebased litigation. Courts could be more likely to hold companies who have allegedly made the most significant contributions to  climate  change  to  account.  Oil&gas  companies  are particularly exposed to that risk.\n\nIn 2021, a Dutch court ordered an international oil company to reduce their worldwide emissions (Scope 1, 2, and 3) by a significant amount within a preset timeframe. This indicates that  oil  and  gas  companies  may  have  an  individual  legal responsibility to reduce emissions to address climate change and confirms the risk of liability, including liability for human rights violations. Courts may condemn oil and gas companies to compensate individuals, communities, and states for the economic losses due to global warming as a consequence of their alleged responsibility in supporting hydrocarbons and knowingly hurting the environment.\n\nFor  example,  we  are  defending  in  California  against claims brought to us by local administrations and certain associations of individuals who are seeking compensation for alleged economic losses and environmental damage due to climate change.\n\nBoard's directors may be summoned before courts for having failed to implement a climate strategy in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement or for not having acted quickly to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 'GHG'.\n\nPrivate individuals, associations and NGOs may also bring legal  actions  against  states  to  get  them  condemned  to adopt stricter national targets of reduction in the absolute level of GHG emissions and that could entail more restrictive measures  on  businesses.  For  example,  an  association  of private individuals have sued the Italian state for allegedly violating human rights and have claimed the Italian State to increase the national targets of reduction of GHG emissions and that could have negative consequences for Eni.\n\nThere are also risks that governments, regulators, organizations, NGOs and individuals may sue us for alleged crimes against the environment in connection with past and present GHG emissions related to our operations and the use of the products we have manufactured.\n\nAs  such,  climate  litigation  constitutes  a  material  risk  for the  company  and  its  investors.  In  case  the  Company  is condemned to reduce its GHG emissions at a much faster rate  than  planned  by  management  or  to  compensate  for damage related to climate change due to ongoing or potential lawsuits, we could incur a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business's prospects.\n\n- e)  Asset  managers,  banks  and  other  financing  institutions have  been  increasingly  adopting  ESG  criteria  in  their investment and financing decisions and this could reduce the attractiveness of our share or limit our ability to access the capital markets\n\nMany professional investors like asset managers, mutual funds,  global  allocation  funds,  generalist  investors  and pensions funds have been reducing their exposure to the fossil  fuel  industry  due  to  the  adoption  of  stricter  ESG",

        "page_content": "criteria in selecting investing opportunities. In some cases, those  investors  have  adopted  climate  change  targets  in determining  their  policies  of  asset  allocations.  Many  of them have announced plans to completely divest from the fossil  fuel  industry.  This  trend  could  reduce  the  market for our share and negatively affect shareholders' returns. Likewise,  banks,  financing  institutions,  lenders  and  also insurance companies are cutting exposure to the fossil fuel industry due to the need to comply with ESG mandate or to reach emission reduction targets in their portfolios and this  could  limit  our  ability  to  access  new  financing,  could drive a rise in borrowing costs to us or increase the costs of insuring our assets. During COP 26 at Glasgow (UK), 450 financial institutions, mostly banks and pension funds, in 45 countries with assets estimated at $130 trillion have committed to limiting greenhouse gas emitting assets in their portfolios. The finance pledge, known as the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), will mean that by 2050 all the assets under management by the institutions that signed on can be counted toward a net-zero emission pathway. However, while this pledge does not preclude the continued  funding  of  fossil  fuels,  as  of  recently  several large,  international  financing  institutions  have  taken  a tougher  approach  as  they  announced  they  would  not support direct financing to develop new oil and gas fields soon, a move that could herald an emerging trend among banks and lenders towards a phase-out of financing the hydrocarbons sector.\n\nAs a result of those developments, we expect the cost of capital to the Company to rise in the future and reduced ability on part of  Eni  to  obtain  financing  for  future  projects  in  the oil & gasbusiness or to obtain it at competitive rates, which may curb our investment opportunities or drive an increase in  financing  expenses,  negatively  affecting  our  results  of operations and business prospects.\n\n## f)  Activist  shareholders  have  been  increasingly  pressuring oil&gas  companies  to  accelerate  the  shift  to  renewable energies  and  to  reduce  CO 2 emissions  and  this  may interfere with management's plans and lead to sub-optimal investment decisions\n\nShareholders and activist funds may have resolutions passed at annual general meetings of listed oil&gas companies, which would force management to implement faster than planned actions to curb emissions or to revise industrial plans to obtain a quicker pace of emissions reduction and that could interfere with management's long-term goals, strategies and capital allocation  processes  leading  to  unplanned  cost  increases and sub-optimal investment decisions. For example, in 2021, activist  shareholders  succeeded  in  passing  a  nonbinding shareholders  resolution  to  force  Chevron  into  cutting  its carbon emissions, including those relating to the products the company sells to its customers. Similar resolutions were also approved at other US oil&gas companies.\n\nMeanwhile, an activist hedge fund conducted a successful proxy  fight  at  ExxonMobil  and  won  a  seat  in  its  board  of directors.  This  will  likely  lead  to  greater  scrutiny  of  the company strategies and capital allocation plans by the board.\n\nMore recently, activist investors have pursued claims against oil&gas companies. In UK, a group of institutional investors have brought a lawsuit against the board of directors of an oil&gas  company  over  alleged  climate  mismanagement, arguing  that  directors  failed  to  manage  the  material  and foreseeable risks posed to the company by climate change, and as such they were breaking company law.\n\nIt is the first, notable lawsuit by a shareholder against a board over the alleged failure to properly prepare for a shift away from fossil fuels.\n\nThese events underscore the growing pressure from investors and capital markets on oil&gas companies towards a future based on renewables energies and an acceleration in the phase-out of investments into fossil fuels. We believe that our company could be exposed to that kind of risk.\n\n## g) Extreme  weather  phenomena,  which  has  been  widely recognized as a direct consequence of climate change, may disrupt our operations\n\nThe  scientific  community  has  concluded  that  increasing global  average  temperature  produces  significant  physical effects,  such  as  the  increased  frequency  and  severity  of hurricanes,  storms,  droughts,  floods,  or  other  extreme climatic  events  that  could  interfere  with  Eni's  operations and  damage  Eni's  facilities.  Extreme  and  unpredictable weather phenomena can result in material disruption to Eni's operations, and consequent loss of or damage to properties and facilities, as well as a loss of output, loss of revenues, increasing maintenance and repair expenses and cash flow shortfall.\n\n## h) We are exposed to reputational risks in connection with the public perception of oil&gas companies as entities primarily responsible for the climate change\n\nThere is a reputational risk linked to the fact that oil companies are increasingly perceived by governments, financial institutions  and  the  general  public  as  entities  primarily responsible for global warming due to GHG emissions across the hydrocarbon value chain, particularly related to the use of energy products, and as poorly-performing players alongside ESG dimensions. This could possibly impair the company reputation and a societally recognized mission to operate in the e&p area. This could also make Eni's shares and debt instruments  less  attractive  to  banks,  funds  and  individual investors who have been increasingly applying ESG criteria and have been growing cautions in assessing the risk profile of oil and gas companies, due to their carbon footprint, when making investment and lending decisions.",

Eni is also exposed to claims under environmental requirements and, from time to time, such claims have been made  against  the  Company.  Furthermore,  environmental regulations  in  Italy  and  elsewhere  typically  impose  strict liability. Strict liability means that in some situations Eni could be exposed to liability for clean-up and remediation costs,  environmental  damage,  and  other  damages  as  a result  of  Eni's  conduct  of  operations  that  was  lawful  at the  time  it  occurred  or  of  the  management  of  industrial hubs by prior operators or other third parties, who were subsequently  taken  over  by  Eni.  In  addition,  plaintiffs may  seek  to  obtain  compensation  for  damage  resulting from events of contamination and pollution or in case the Company is found liable for violations of any environmental laws or regulations. In Italy, Eni is exposed to the risk of expenses and environmental liabilities in connection with the impact of its past activities at certain industrial hubs where  the  Group's  products  were  produced,  processed, stored,  distributed,  or  sold,  such  as  chemical  plants, mineral-metallurgic  plants,  refineries,  and  other  facilities, which  were  subsequently  disposed  of,  liquidated,  closed, or shut down. At these industrial hubs, Eni has undertaken several initiatives to remediate and clean up proprietary or concession  areas  that  were  allegedly  contaminated  and polluted by the Group's industrial activities. State or local public administrations have sued Eni for environmental and other damages and for clean-up and remediation measures in addition to those which were performed by the Company, or  which  the  Company  has  committed  to  performing. In some cases, Eni has been sued for alleged breach of criminal laws (for example for alleged environmental crimes such as failure to perform soil or groundwater reclamation, environmental  disaster  and  contamination,  discharge  of toxic materials, amongst others). Although Eni believes that it may not be held liable for having exceeded in the past pollution thresholds that are unlawful according to current regulations,  but  were  allowed  by  laws  then  effective,  or because the Group took over operations from third parties, it cannot be excluded that Eni could potentially incur such environmental liabilities. Eni's financial statements account\n\nfor  provisions  relating  to  the  costs  to  be  incurred  with respect to clean ups and remediation of contaminated areas and groundwater for which legal or constructive obligations exist and the associated costs can be reasonably estimated in  a  reliable  manner,  regardless  of  any  previous  liability attributable to other parties. In 2022, due to environmental regulation development setting more clear criteria concerning  the  recovery  management  of  groundwater pollutants, and taking into account the expertise cumulated in years of environmental management, the Group was in position to reliably accrue a provision of about \u20ac1.3 billion to  account  for  the  future  expected  costs  of  completing ongoing cleanup of groundwater at a number of Italian hubs, where operations were shut down years ago. The accrued amounts  of  the  existing  environmental  risk  provision represent management's best estimates of the Company's existing  liabilities  for  future  remediation  and  clean-up  of Eni's shut-down Italian sites.\n\nManagement believes that it is possible that in the future Eni may incur significant or material environmental expenses and liabilities in addition to the amounts already accrued due to: (i) the likelihood of as yet unknown contamination; (ii) the results of ongoing surveys or surveys to be carried out on the environmental status of certain Eni's industrial sites as required by the applicable regulations on contaminated sites; (iii) unfavourable developments in ongoing litigation on the environmental status of certain of the Company's sites where a number of public administrations, the Italian Ministry of the Environment or third parties are claiming compensation for environmental or other damages such as damages to people's health and loss of property value; (iv) the possibility that new litigation might arise; (v) the probability that new and stricter environmental laws might be implemented; and (vi) the circumstance that the extent and  cost  of  environmental  restoration  and  remediation programs are often inherently difficult to estimate leading to underestimation of the future costs of remediation and restoration, as well as unforeseen adverse developments both in the final remediation costs and with respect to the final liability allocation among the various parties involved at  the  sites.  As  a  result  of  these  risks,  environmental liabilities could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the Group's results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, business prospects, financial condition, and shareholder  returns,  including  dividends,  the  amount  of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares.\n\nFinally, in case  of  conviction  of  Eni's  employees  for environmental crimes, the Company could be held liable as per  Italian  Legislative  Decree  231/2001  which  states  the responsibility of legal entities for certain violations of laws committed  by  their  employees  and  could  face  fines  and restrictive  measures  to  perform  industrial  activities  which could adversely and significantly affect results of operations,",

In  future  years  Eni  may incur  significant  losses  due  to:  (i)  uncertainty  regarding  the final  outcome  of  each  proceeding;  (ii)  the  occurrence  of new  developments  that  management  could  not  take  into consideration  when  evaluating  the  likely  outcome  of  each proceeding in order to accrue the risk provisions as of the date of the latest financial statements or to judge a negative outcome only as possible or to conclude that a contingency loss could not be estimated reliably; (iii) the emergence of new evidence and information; and (iv) underestimation of probable future losses due to circumstances that are often inherently difficult to  estimate.  Certain  legal  proceedings  and  investigations  in which Eni or its subsidiaries or its officers and employees are defendants involve the alleged breach of anti- bribery and anticorruption laws and regulations and other ethical misconduct. Such proceedings are described in the notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements, under the heading 'Legal Proceedings'. Ethical misconduct and noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations, including noncompliance with  anti-bribery  and  anti-corruption  laws,  by  Eni,  its  officers and employees, its partners, agents or others that act on the Group's behalf, could expose Eni and its employees to criminal and civil penalties and could be damaging to Eni's reputation and shareholder value.\n\n## c)  Risks from acquisitions\n\nEni  is  constantly  monitoring  the  market  in  search  of opportunities to acquire individual assets or companies with a view of achieving its growth targets or complementing its asset portfolio. Acquisitions entail an execution risk - the risk that the acquirer will not be able to effectively integrate the  purchased  assets  to  achieve  expected  synergies.  In addition,  acquisitions  entail  a  financial  risk  -  the  risk  of not being able to recover the purchase costs of acquired assets, in case of a prolonged decline in the market prices of  commodities.  Eni  may  also  incur  unanticipated  costs or assume unexpected liabilities and losses in connection with companies or assets it acquires. If the integration and financial risks related to acquisitions materialize, expected synergies from acquisition may fall short of management's targets  and  Eni's  financial  performance  and  shareholders' returns may be adversely affected.\n\n## d) Eni's crisis management systems may be ineffective\n\nEni has developed contingency plans to continue or recover operations following a disruption or incident. An inability to restore or replace critical capacity to an agreed level within an agreed period could prolong the impact of any disruption and could severely affect business, operations and financial results. Eni has crisis management plans and the capability to deal with emergencies at every level of its operations. If Eni\n\ndoes not respond or is not seen to respond in an appropriate manner  to  either  an  external  or  internal  crisis,  this  could adversely  impact  the  Group's  results  of  operations,  cash flow,  liquidity,  business  prospects,  financial  condition,  and shareholder returns, including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares.\n\n## e)  Disruption  to  or  breaches  of  Eni's  critical  IT  services  or digital infrastructure and security systems could adversely affect the Group's business, increase costs and damage Eni's reputation\n\nThe Group's activities depend heavily on the reliability and security of its information technology (IT) systems and digital security. The Group's IT systems, some of which are managed by  third  parties,  are  susceptible  to  being  compromised, damaged, disrupted or shutdown due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components, power or network outages, hardware failures, cyberattacks (viruses, computer intrusions), user errors or natural  disasters.  The  cyber  threat  is  constantly  evolving. The  oil  and  gas  industry  is  subject  to  fast-evolving  risks from cyber threat actors, including nation states, criminals, terrorists,  hacktivists  and  insiders.  Attacks  are  becoming more  sophisticated  with  regularly  renewed  techniques while the digital transformation amplifies exposure to these cyber threats. The adoption of new technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) or the migration to the cloud, as  well  as  the  evolution  of  architectures  for  increasingly interconnected systems, are all areas where cyber security is a very important issue. The Group and its service providers may not be able to prevent third parties from breaking into the Group's IT systems, disrupting business operations or communications  infrastructure  through  denial  of  service, attacks,  or  gaining  access  to  confidential  or  sensitive information  held  in  the  system.  The  Group,  like  many companies, has been and expects to continue to be the target of attempted cybersecurity attacks. While the Group has not experienced any such attack that has had a material impact on its business, the Group cannot guarantee that its security measures will be sufficient to prevent a material disruption, breach or compromise in the future. As a result, the Group's activities and assets could sustain serious damage, services to clients could be interrupted, material intellectual property could be divulged and, in some cases, personal injury, property damage, environmental harm and regulatory violations could occur. If any of the risks set out above materialise, they could adversely  impact  the  Group's  results  of  operations,  cash flow,  liquidity,  business  prospects,  financial  condition,  and shareholder returns, including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's share.\n\n## f)  Violations  of  data  protection  laws  carry  fines  and  expose the  Company  and/or  its  employees  to  criminal  sanctions and civil suits\n\nData protection laws and regulations apply to Eni and its joint",

        "page_content": "ventures and associates in the vast majority of countries in  which  they  do  business.  The  General  Data  Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR) came into effect in May 2018 and increased penalties up to a maximum of 4% of global  annual  turnover  for  breach  of  the  regulation.  The GDPR  requires  mandatory  breach  notification,  a  standard also followed outside of the EU (particularly in Asia). Noncompliance with data protection laws could expose Eni to regulatory  investigations,  which  could  result  in  fines  and penalties as well as harm the Company's reputation. In addition to imposing fines, regulators may also issue orders to stop processing personal data, which could disrupt operations. The Company could also be subject to litigation from persons or corporations allegedly affected by data protection violations. Violation of data protection laws is a criminal offence in some countries, and individuals can be imprisoned or fined. If any of the risks set out above materialise, they could adversely impact the Group's results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, business  prospects,  financial  condition,  and  shareholder returns, including dividends, the amount of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares.\n\n- g) Eni is exposed to treasury and trading risks, including liquidity risk,  interest  rate  risk,  foreign  exchange  risk,  commodity price risk and credit risk and may incur substantial losses in connection with those risks\n\n## Market risk\n\nEni's business is exposed to the risk that changes in interest rates,  foreign  exchange  rates  or  the  prices  of  energy commodities and products will adversely affect the value of assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows.\n\nThe  Group  does  not  hedge  its  exposure  to  volatile hydrocarbons  prices  in  its  business  of  developing  and extracting  hydrocarbons  reserves  and  other  types  of commodity  exposures  (e.g.  exposure  to  the  volatility  of refining margins and of certain portions of the gas long-term supply  portfolio)  except  for  specific  markets  or  business conditions.  The  Group  has  established  risk  management procedures and enters derivatives commodity contracts to hedge exposure to the commodity risk relating to commercial activities, which derives from different indexation formulas between  purchase  and  selling  prices  of  commodities. However, hedging may not function as expected. In addition, Eni undertakes commodity trading to optimize commercial margins or with a view of profiting from expected movements in market prices. Although Eni believes it has established sound  risk  management  procedures  to  monitor  and control commodity trading, this activity involves elements of forecasting and Eni is exposed to the risk of incurring significant losses if prices develop contrary to management expectations and to the risk of default of counterparties.\n\nEni  is  exposed  to  the  risks  of  unfavorable  movements in  exchange  rates  primarily  because  Eni's  consolidated\n\nfinancial  statements  are  prepared  in  Euros,  whereas  Eni's main  subsidiaries  in  the  Exploration  &  Production  sector are utilizing the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. This translation risk is unhedged.\n\nFurthermore,  Eni's  euro-denominated  subsidiaries  incur revenues and expenses in currencies other than the euro or are otherwise exposed to currency fluctuations because prices of oil, natural gas and refined products generally are denominated in, or linked to, the U.S. dollar, while a significant portion of Eni's expenses are incurred in euros and because movements in exchange rates may negatively affect the fair value  of  assets  and  liabilities  denominated  in  currencies other than the euro. Therefore, movements in the U.S. dollar (or other foreign currencies) exchange rate versus the euro affect  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows  and  year-onyear  comparability  of  the  performance.  These  exposures are normally pooled at Group level and net exposures to exchange rate volatility are netted on the marketplace using derivative transactions. However, the effectiveness of such hedging  activity  is  uncertain,  and  the  Company  may  incur losses  also  of  significant  amounts.  As  a  rule  of  thumb,  a depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the euro generally has an adverse impact on Eni's results of operations and liquidity because it reduces booked revenues by an amount greater than the decrease in U.S. dollar-denominated expenses and may also  result  in  significant  translation  adjustments  that impact Eni's shareholders' equity.\n\nEni is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates that may affect the fair value of Eni's financial assets and liabilities as well as the amount of finance expense recorded through profit. Eni enters into derivative transactions with the purpose of minimizing its exposure to the interest rate risk.\n\nEni's  credit  ratings  are  potentially  exposed  to  risk  from possible reductions of the sovereign credit rating of Italy. Based on the methodologies used by Standard & Poor's and Moody's, a potential downgrade of Italy's credit rating may have a potential knock-on effect on the credit rating of Italian issuers such as Eni and make it more likely that the credit rating of the debt instruments issued by the Company could be downgraded.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nEni  is  exposed  to  credit  risk.  Eni's  counterparties  could default, could be unable to pay the amounts owed to it in a  timely  manner  or  meet  their  performance  obligations under contractual arrangements. These events could cause the Company to recognize loss provisions with respect to amounts owed to it by debtors of the Company and cash flow shortfall. In recent years, the Group has experienced a  significant  level  of  counterparty  default  due  to  Europe and Italy's weak economic growth and a downturn in crude oil prices affecting the solvency of national oil entities and",

Those trends were made worse by the COVID-19 recession, resulting in a significantly deteriorated credit and financial profile of many of Eni's counterparties, including joint operators and national oil companies in Eni's upstream projects, retail customers in the gas retail business and other industrial accounts. In 2022, the significant rise in the prices of energy commodities has increased Eni's exposure to the credit risk in the mid and downstream businesses of natural gas. The retail gas & power business managed by Plenitude is particularly exposed to the credit risk due to its large and diversified  customer  base,  which  includes  thousands  of medium and small-sized businesses and retail customers whose  financial  condition  has  been  negatively  and adversely affected because the value of invoices has risen manyfold putting at stress the ability of our counterparts to pay amounts owed to us. Also, certain large industrial accounts at our wholesale natural gas business have been facing difficulties at paying amounts due to us. Due to that trend, we increased our credit loss provisions in 2022. It is possible that the ability of our debtors to pay amounts due to us will deteriorate in the next future, especially in case of a continuing uptrend in the prices of energy commodities. Furthermore, we are exposed to risks of growing working capital  needs  in  case  regulatory  authorities  introduce measures  intended  to  safeguard  households  and  other residential customers by mandating us to extend payment terms.\n\nEni believes that the management of doubtful accounts in the current environment of surging energy prices represents a significant financial risk to the Company, which will require management  focus  and  commitment  going  forward.  Eni cannot exclude the recognition of significant provisions for doubtful accounts in future reporting periods and increasing working capital needs.\n\nIf any of the risks set out above materializes, this could adversely  impact  the  Group's  results  of  operations,  cash flow,  liquidity,  business  prospects,  financial  condition,  and shareholder  returns,  including  dividends,  the  amount  of funds available for stock repurchases and the price of Eni's shares.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity  risk  is  the  risk  that  suitable  sources  of  funding for the Group may not be available, or that the Group is unable to sell its assets on the marketplace to meet shortterm financial requirements and to settle obligations. Such a situation would negatively affect the Group's results of operations and cash flows as it would result in Eni incurring higher borrowing expenses to meet its obligations or, under the worst conditions, the inability of Eni to continue as a going  concern.  Global  financial  markets  are  volatile  due to several macroeconomic risk factors and unpredictable developments. In case new restrictive measures in response to a resurgence of the pandemic or the war in Ukraine lead to a double-dip in economic activity and energy demand, in the event of extended periods of constraints in the financial markets, or if Eni is unable to access the financial markets (including cases where this is due to Eni's financial position or market sentiment as to Eni's prospects) at a time when cash flows from Eni's business operations may be under pressure, the  Company  may  incur  significantly  higher  borrowing costs than in the past or difficulties obtaining the necessary financial resources to fund Eni's development plans, therefore jeopardizing Eni's ability to maintain long- term investment programs. A reduction in the investments needed to develop Eni's  reserves  and  to  grow  the  business  may  significantly and negatively affect Eni's business prospects, results of operations  and  cash  flows,  and  may  impact  shareholder returns, including dividends or share price.",

The  new  GRI  standards  came  into  force  for  the  NFI  2022,  both  the  Universal Standards (i.e. those required of all companies regardless of the results of the materiality analysis and those specific to the Oil & Gas sector). Since last year, the NFI includes the disclosure requirements for listed companies, provided for in Article 8 of EU Regulation 852/2020 relating to suitable economic activities and assets for the purposes of achieving the objectives of the Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Regulation. In continuity with previous editions, the document is structured according to the three levers of the integrated business model, Carbon Neutrality by 2050, Operational Excellence and Alliances for Development, which aim to create long-term value for all stakeholders. The contents of the 'Carbon neutrality by 2050' chapter have been organized according  to  the  voluntary  recommendations  of  the  Task  Force  on  Climate-related  Financial Disclosures (TCFD) of the Financial Stability Board, of which Eni has been a member since its foundation, in order to provide even clearer and more in-depth disclosure on these issues. In addition, the main United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), that constitute an important reference for Eni in the conduct of its activities, have been mentioned in the various chapters. The NFI is included in the Management Report in the Annual Report, to meet the information needs of Eni stakeholders in a clear and concise manner, further favouring the integrated disclosure of financial and non-financial information. In order to avoid duplication of information and ensure that disclosures are as concise as possible, the NFI provides integrated disclosures, which may include references to other sections of the Management Report, the Corporate Governance and Shareholding Structure Report and the Report on remuneration policy and remuneration paid, when the issues required by Legislative Decree 254/2016 are already contained therein or for further details. Specifically, the Management Report describes the Eni business model and governance, the main results and targets, the integrated risk management system and the risk and uncertainty factors in which the main risks, possible impacts and treatment actions are detailed, in line with the disclosure requirements of Italian regulations. The NFI contains detailed information on corporate policies, management and organizational models, an in-depth analysis of ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) risks, the strategy on the topics covered, the most important initiatives of the year, the main performances with related comments and the 2022 materiality analysis. In the 2022 NFI, the 'core' metrics defined by the World Economic Forum 2 (WEF) in the 2020 White Paper 'Measuring Stakeholder Capitalism - Towards Common Metrics and Consistent Reporting of Sustainable Value Creation' were also included. As in previous years, on the occasion of the Shareholders' Meeting, Eni will also publish Eni for, the voluntary sustainability report that aims to further enhance non-financial information. The 2022 edition of Eni for will also include a report dedicated to human rights (Eni for - Human Rights 3 ). Below is a reconciliation table showing the information content required by the Legislative Decree 254/2016, the areas and relative positioning in the NFI, the Management Report, the Corporate Governance and Shareholding Structure Report and the Report on remuneration policy and remuneration paid.\n\n- (1) For further details, reference is made to the paragraph: 'Reporting Principles and Criteria'.\n- (2) The reconciliation with the WEF core metrics is directly shown in the Content Index in a dedicated column.\n- (3) The update of the Eni for - Human Rights report will be published subsequent to Eni for.",

        "page_content": "## THE COMPANY MISSION AND COMMITMENT TO A JUST TRANSITION\n\nEni's mission confirms its commitment to a Just Transition as the main challenge for the energy sector by balancing the need to ensure universal access to energy for a growing population and the urgency of tackling climate change by acting immediately on all available levers and accelerating the  transition  process  towards  a  sustainable  mix  that  is socially just at the same time. Furthermore, the mission is inspired by the UN's 'Sustainable Development Goals' Eni intends to contribute to, aware that business development can  no  longer  be  separated  from  these.  Eni's  goal  is  to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, with a view to sharing social and economic benefits with workers, the value chain, communities  and  customers  in  an  inclusive,  transparent and socially equitable manner, taking into consideration the different  level  of  development  of  the  Countries  in  which  it operates, minimising existing inequalities. In this sense, in 2020, the evaluation against business projects SDGs was launched for a few pilot cases to quantify their contribution to  the  Country  of  presence  and  to  guide  project  choices. In addition, to contribute to the achievement of the SDGs and  to  the  growth  of  the  Countries  in  which  it  operates, Eni  is  committed  to  building  alliances  with  national  and international development cooperation actors, in line with the results  of  the  Third  International  Conference  on  Financing for Development, organized by the United Nations in Addis Abeba in July 2015. Eni is aware the social dimension of the ambitious path mapped out has significant relevance. First and foremost, the energy transition is a technological transition:  only  with  solid  industrial,  innovative  capacity, as well as a willingness to combine forces and skills, will Eni be able to implement the transition by improving at the\n\nsame  time  the  opportunity  for  people.  With  this  in  mind, Eni is working to ensure that the decarbonization process offers  opportunities  for  converting  existing  activities  and developing new production supply chains with significant opportunities  for  workers,  economies  and  communities in  the  Countries  where  the  company  operates.  At  the same  time,  Eni  is  committed  to  managing  any  potential negative impact that may be linked to the energy transition on workers, communities, consumers  and  suppliers. This  ambition  necessarily  requires  the  involvement  of  all stakeholders, especially those who can play a relevant role in  the  just  transition,  such  as  trade  unions  and  workers' representatives,  institutions,  community  representatives, and industry organisations. The approach highlighted by the mission is also confirmed by the application from January 1 st , 2021 of the 2020 Corporate Governance Code, which identifies 'sustainable  success'  as  the  objective  that  must  guide  the action of the Board of Directors and consists of creating longterm value for the benefit of shareholders, taking into account the interests of other relevant stakeholders (see pp. 30-41). Eni, however, has been considering the interest of stakeholders other than shareholders as one of the necessary elements directors must  evaluate  in  making  informed  decisions  since  2006.  In compliance  with  the  Code,  last  year,  the  BoD  also  approved, at the proposal of the Chairman, in agreement with the CEO, a policy for dialogue with shareholders that identifies the parties responsible for its management and the manner in which it is carried out at the initiative of shareholders or the Company; the policy also governs reporting to the Board on the development and significant content of the dialogue that has taken place and the manner in which it is disclosed and updated.\n\n## MAIN REGULATORY TOOLS, GUIDELINES AND MANAGEMENT MODELS RELATED TO THE SCOPE OF LEGISLATIVE DECREE 254/2016\n\nIn order to implement the mission in actual practice and to ensure integrity, transparency, correctness and effectiveness in its processes, Eni adopts rules for the performance of corporate activities and the exercise of powers, ensuring compliance with the general principles of traceability and segregation.\n\nAll of Eni's operating activities can be grouped into a map of\n\nprocesses functional to the corporate activities and integrated with  control  requirements  and  principles  set  out  in  the compliance and governance models and based on the By-laws, the Code of Ethics and the Corporate Governance Code 2020 4, the Model 231 5 , the SOA 6 principles and the CoSO Report 7 .\n\nWith  regard  to  the  types  of  instruments  that  make  up  the Regulatory System:\n\n(6) US Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\n\n- (7) Framework issued by the 'Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (CoSO)' in May 2013.",

The Policies cut across all processes and are focused on a key element of business management. They apply to Eni SpA and, following the implementation process, to all subsidiaries;\n- \u00b7 the  Management  System  Guidelines  ('MSGs')  are  the guidelines  common  to  all  Eni's  companies  and  may  be process  or  compliance/governance  guidelines  (the  latter normally approved by the Board of Directors) and include sustainability aspects. The individual MSGs issued by Eni SpA apply to subsidiaries, which ensure their implementation, unless a derogation is needed;\n- \u00b7 the Procedures set out the operating procedures by which the  Companies'  activities  are  to  be  carried  out.  They describe the tasks and responsibilities of the organizational contacts involved, management and control methods and communication flows. They also regulate operations in order to pursue the objectives of compliance with local regulations. The content is defined in compliance with the Policies and MSGs as implemented by the companies;\n- \u00b7 the Operating Instructions define the details of the operating procedures referring to a specific function/organizational unit/ professional area or professional family, or to Eni's people and functions involved in the fulfilments regulated therein.\n\nThe  regulatory  instruments  are  published  on  the  Company's Intranet site  and,  in  some  cases,  on  the  Company's  website. In addition, in 2020 Eni updated its Code of Ethics in which it renewed the corporate values that characterize the commitment of Eni people and all third parties who work with the Company: integrity, respect and protection of human rights, transparency, promotion of development, operational excellence, innovation, teamwork and collaboration.\n\nIn the first of the next two tables (pp. 156-157), in addition to the Policies and the Code of Ethics, other Eni regulatory instruments approved  by  the  CEO  and/or  the  BoD  are  also  considered. The second table (pp. 158-159) show the management and organization models, including management systems, multiyear plans, processes and interfunctional working groups.\n\nFinally, in 2022, with a view to continuous improvement and to  go  along  the  Company's  transition  strategy,  an  initiative was  launched  to  verify  (through  the  analysis  of  market best  practices)  possible  actions  to  improve  the  current Eni  Regulatory  System  in  terms  of  tools  and  management process. On January 26, 2023, the BoD updated the key lines of the Regulatory System Policy in line with the operational and governance requirements for the new strategy. These called for an evolution of the Regulatory System architecture that will lead to (i) more accessible regulatory instruments; (ii) betterstreamlined decision-making and operational processes; and (iii) greater management awareness in identifying risks and mitigation actions.",

Risks are assessed with quantitative and  qualitative  tools  considering  both  the  probability  of occurrence and the impacts (environmental, health and safety, social, and reputational) that would take place in a given time frame if the risk were to occur. These are represented on matrices that allow comparison and classification by relevance based on the probability of occurrence and impact. The results of the risk assessment, including the main ESG risks, are submitted to the Board of Statutory Auditors, the Control and Risk Committee and the BoD on a half yearly basis. Climate Change Risk is confirmed among  the  main  risks  in  the  international  scene's  evolution. Eni's aims to ensure the security and sustainability of the energy system, maintaining a clear focus on a fair energy transition and the creation of value for stakeholders.\n\nDe-risking  actions  include:  upstream  decarbonization  through energy efficiency and projects to reduce flaring; development of\n\nCarbon Capture and Storage initiatives for hard-to-abate industrial cycles;  expansion  of  biofuels  with  feedstock  diversification by  leveraging  vertical  integration  with  the  agribusiness  chain; development of chemicals from renewable and recycled sources; growth of customer portfolio and renewable capacity; initiatives to  accelerate  the  development  of  breakthrough  technologies oriented  to  decarbonization.  In  terms  of  the  risk  portfolio evolution,  'biological  risk'  was  confirmed  among  the  Top  Risks with  a  reduction  in  impact  due  to  the  progressive  easing  of containment measures related to the pandemic; in light of the international situation, the alert level for Cyber Security has been raised, requiring constant monitoring to define timely actions to mitigate ICT risk scenarios.\n\nFor the effects of the Russia-Ukraine war, please refer to the dedicated paragraph of the AR (p. 130).\n\nThe  table  below  provides  a  summary  view  of  Eni  ESG  risks classified according to the areas of Legislative Decree 254/2016. For each risk event, the type of risk - top risk and non-top risk and the page references, where the main treatment actions are set out, are indicated.\n\n## RISK MANAGEMENT MODEL\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| SCOPE OF LEGISLATIVE  DECREE 254/2016   | RISK EVENT                                                    | TOP  RISK                                                 | MAIN TREATMENT ACTIONS                                                                                                                                        |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| CROSS-CUTTING RISKS                     |                                                               |                                                           |                                                                                                                                                               |\n|                                         | \u00b7  Risks associated with research and  development activities |                                                           | NFI -  Carbon neutrality by 2050, pp. 164-170;  Safety, pp. 178-180; Respect for the environment,  pp. 180-186.                                               |\n|                                         | \u00b7  Cyber Security                                             |                                                           | AR  - Integrated Risk Management, pp. 24-29;  Cyber Security Risk, p. 148                                                                                     |\n|                                         | \u00b7  Relationship with local stakeholders                       |                                                           | AR  - Integrated Risk Management, pp. 24-29;  Country risk, pp. 139-140; Specific risks associated  with hydrocarbon exploration and production, pp.  135-139 |\n|                                         |                                                               |                                                           | NFI  - Alliances for development, pp. 195-197                                                                                                                 |\n|                                         | \u00b7                                                             | Political and social instability and global security risk | AR  - Integrated Risk Management, pp. 24-29;  Country Risk, pp. 139-140                                                                                       |\n|                                         | \u00b7                                                             | Risks connected with Corporate governance                 | AR  - Integrated Risk Management, pp. 24-29;                                                                                                                  |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Eni has long been committed to promoting comprehensive and effective disclosure on climate change and in this respect confirms its commitment to implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) of the Financial Stability Board, which Eni has adopted since 2017, the first year applicable for reporting.\n\nDisclosure on Carbon Neutrality by 2050 is organized according to  the  four  thematic  areas  indicated  by  TCFD:  Governance, Risk Management, Strategy and Metrics and Targets. The key elements of each area are presented below; for a complete analysis of Eni's climate strategy, please see 'Eni for - A Just Transition' while additional information will be available through Eni's disclosure to CDP Climate Change 2023 questionnaire.\n\n## Governance\n\nRole of the BoD. Eni's decarbonization strategy is an integral part of Eni's business strategy and is also implemented through a  structured system of Corporate Governance, where the BoD and the CEO play a central role in managing key climate change issues. Specifically, the BoD examines and approves the Strategic Plan proposed by the CEO, which sets out strategies and targets including those related to climate change and energy transition, and, starting 2019, examines and approves also Eni's medium/ long-term plan which aims to outline and monitor the evolution of decarbonization objectives and their economic and business sustainability in a time frame up to 2050.\n\nSince 2014, the Eni BoD has been supported in performing its  duties  by  the  Sustainability  and  Scenarios  Committee (SSC),  established  on  a  voluntary  basis,  which,  among other  tasks,  periodically  examines  the  integration  between strategy, development scenarios and the medium/long-term sustainability of the business with a view to energy transition and climate change. During 2022, the SSC explored various topics related to climate change, including R&D activities for the energy transition, carbon pricing systems, agri-feedstock activities, Nature & Technology Based carbon offsets, Eni's positioning on climate targets and strategies versus peers, Eni's performance in CDP questionnaires, climate resolutions and Shareholders' Meeting disclosures, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) projects, and Just Transition related topics.\n\nWith reference to the composition of the Board, it is reported\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthat on the basis of the self-assessment conducted, about 90% of the Board Members expressed their positive opinion on  the  professionalism  within  the  Board  -  in  terms  of knowledge, experience and skills (with particular reference to advisory, training and publication activities in the energy and  environmental  field,  participation  in  governmental  and non-governmental, national and international bodies that deal with these issues) - and on the personal contribution that the individual Board Members make to the Board of Directors in matters of sustainability, ESG and energy transition, which have characterized the BoD's work for their entire mandate. The relevance of these skills is reaffirmed in the Guidelines for Shareholders on the optimal composition of the Future Board  of  Directors,  which  emphasises  the  importance  of ensuring Eni's directors have knowledge of topics related to sustainability and the control of climate and environmental risks, acted out in managerial or entrepreneurial roles and acquired in industrial contexts comparable to those in which the Company operates.\n\nThe  commitment  of  the  entire  Board  of  Directors  on  the issues of energy transition, climate change, sustainability and ESG is unanimously recognised in its strategic guiding role and monitoring activities for the transition path undertaken. Equally  significant  is  the  support  provided  by  the  board committees,  in  particular  the  Sustainability  and  Scenarios Committee, to maintain continuity of training and discussion on  these  topics,  which  are  unanimously  seen  as  growing in  perspective,  along  with  strategy  and  business  issues. Immediately after the appointment of the Board of Directors and  the  Board  of  Statutory  Auditors,  a  board  induction programme  was  implemented  for  directors  and  statutory auditors, which covered, among other topics, issues related to the decarbonization process and the environmental and social sustainability of Eni's activities. The economic-financial exposure of Eni to the risks deriving from the introduction of new carbon pricing mechanisms is examined by the BoD both in the phase leading up to authorisation of each investment and in the following half-year monitoring of the entire project portfolio. The BoD is also informed annually on the results of the impairment test carried out on the main Cash Generating Units.  Since  2021,  the  IEA's 9 NZE  (Net  Zero  Emissions) scenario is included in the scenarios for portfolio evaluations (see pp. 143-146, chapter on 'Climate Change Risk'). Finally, the BoD is informed on a quarterly basis on the results of the risk assessment and monitoring activities related to Eni's top risks, including climate change.",

        "page_content": "Role of management. All company structures are involved in the definition or implementation of the carbon neutrality strategy  that  is  reflected  in  Eni's  organizational  structure with the two business groups: Natural Resources, active in the  optimisation  and  progressive  decarbonization  of  the Upstream  portfolio,  Natural  Climate  Solutions  initiatives and CO 2 storage projects, and Energy Evolution, active in the expansion of bio, renewable and circular economy activities and the offer of new energy solutions and services. As of 2019, climate strategy issues are managed by the CFO area through dedicated structures with the aim of overseeing the process of  defining  Eni's  climate  strategy  and  the  related  portfolio of initiatives, in line with international climate agreements. The strategic commitment in carbon footprint reduction is part of the essential goals of the Company and is therefore also reflected in the Variable Incentive Plans for the CEO and Company's management. In particular, the Long-Term Stockbased Incentive Plan, in line with the previous one, provides specific objectives for decarbonization and energy transition that include the production of biojet fuel and circular economy projects, for a total weight of 35%, in line with the objectives communicated to the market and with the aim of aligning with the interests of all stakeholders. The Short-Term Incentive Plan, in line with the previous one, is closely linked to Eni's strategic  transformation  targets,  including  decarbonization and energy transition objectives consistent with the LongTerm Incentive Plan, with an overall weight of 25% for the CEO and, according to weights consistent with the responsibilities assigned, for all Company management.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe  process  for  identifying  and  assessing  climate-related risks is part of Eni's Integrated Risk Management Model (see section 'Integrated Risk Management' of the AR, pp. 24-29) developed to ensure that decisions made take into account risks from an integrated, comprehensive and forward-looking perspective. The process ensures the detection, consolidation and analysis of all Eni's risks and supports the BoD in checking the compatibility of the risk profile with the strategic targets, also in a long-term perspective, and monitoring the evolution of the main risks and the de-risking actions.\n\nRisks, including Climate Change, are assessed with quantitative and  qualitative  tools  considering  both  the  probability  of occurrence and the impacts (environmental, health and safety, social, and reputational) that would take place in a given time frame if the risk were to occur. These risks are represented on  matrices  that  allow  comparison  and  classification  by relevance based on the probability of occurrence and impact. Risks related to climate change are analysed, assessed and managed  by  considering  the  drivers  identified  in  the  TCFD recommendations, which refer both to energy transition risks (market  scenario,  regulatory  and  technological  evolution, reputation  issues)  and  physical  risk  (acute  and  chronic) associated  with  climate  change.  The  identification  of  main transition risks adopts an integrated bottom-up and top-down approach. The former is applied during risk assessment down to the business line and subsidiary level, and it assesses the executive risks related to strategic climate change de-risking actions  through  interviews  with  risk  owners.  The  top-down approach involves multi-disciplinary teams (covering regulatory, legal,  technological,  etc.  aspects)  and  identifies,  for  in  the medium-to-long-term,  possible  context  developments.  The analysis considers both external sources (e.g. IEA scenarios) and  internal  monitoring.  Concerning  physical  risk,  Eni  has developed an assessment process that includes both its assets and those of third parties that may impact Eni's operations. The process, which is constantly evolving based on the results of the first implementations, based on data provided by specialist data providers, assesses the inherent risk of assets (based on position and over a 30-year time frame) against ten identified risks (acute and chronic). The strength and effectiveness of existing  mitigation  actions  is  assessed  for  exposed  assets, identifying the residual risk (per individual asset). Assets still exposed are analysed in more detail as part of the Asset Integrity process  with  a  specific  check  on  the  consistency  between adopted design criteria and prospective climatic conditions. When the process ends, if necessary, further mitigation actions are identified and implemented. The table below summarises the  main  risks  and  opportunities  identified  by  Eni  in  relation to the energy transition. For an in-depth content analysis by individual driver, including physical risk, please refer to the Risk Factors section on pp. 126-150 of the AR.",

2018  and Net Zero Carbon Footprint Eni @2035;\n- \u00b7  -35% Net GHG Lifecycle Emissions (Scope 1+2+3) @2030 vs. 2018, -55% @2035 and -80% @2040;\n- \u00b7  -15% Net Carbon Intensity of energy products sold @2030 vs. 2018 and -50% @2040.\n\nThe residual emissions will be compensated through offsets, mainly from Natural Climate Solutions, which will contribute to about 5% of the overall reduction of the value chain emissions in 2050.\n\nEni's decarbonisation objectives are based on a transformation industrial plan that will be implemented punctually according to market dynamics and in line with the evolution of the Company, and which is based on solutions and technologies that are already available:\n\n- \u00b7  reduction of hydrocarbon production in the medium/longterm with a plateau expected through 2030 and gradual growth of the gas share, which will reach more than 60% by 2030 and more than 90% after 2040;\n- \u00b7  increase 'organic' refining capacity to more than 5 million tonnes by 2030, palm oil free since the end of 2022 and vertical integration with Upstream with 700,000 tonnes of feedstock by 2026;\n- \u00b7  progressive increase in Plenitude installed renewable capacity with over 15 GW by 2030, to reach 60 GW in 2050 within a customer base growth to more than 20 million in 2050;\n- \u00b7  business development for sustainable mobility with about 30,000 charging points for electric vehicles by 2026 and about 160,000 by 2050;\n- \u00b7  progressive  increase  in  the  production  of  new  energy carriers and magnetic fusion, with the first operational plant expected by the beginning of 2030;\n- \u00b7  development of CO 2 storage hubs for hard-to-abate emissions both  from  Eni  and  third-party  industrial  sites,  reaching  a storage capacity of about 50 MtCO 2 in 2050 (Eni share).\n\nThe  evolution  towards  a  portfolio  of  totally  decarbonised products  will  be  supported  by  the  progressive  growth  of investments dedicated to new energy solutions and services, reaching 30% of total investments in 2026, 70% in 2030 and up to 85% in 2040. After 2035, these activities will generate positive free cash flow and contribute to about 75% of the Group's cash flow average over 2040-2050. Spending on zero and low-carbon activities will amount to \u20ac13.8 billion 10 in the 2023-26 period. Eni is also committed to aligning its plans and investment decisions to its decarbonisation strategy: the share of expenditures related to O&G activities will be gradually reduced and main investment projects evaluated  consistently with emission reduction targets and  the  commitment  to  gradually  phase  out  investments  in carbon-intensive 'unabated' activities or products, as a necessary condition  to  achieve  carbon  neutrality  by  mid-century.  The decarbonization plan is integrated into Eni's financing strategy, which aligns economic and environmental sustainability, with the  issuance,  in  2021,  of  the  first  sustainability-linked  bond of the O&G sector and in 2022 the underwriting of a \u20ac6 billion committed  sustainability-linked  credit  line,  both  tied  to  the company's announced energy transition goals.",

In addition to these, in 2020 new indicators were defined, accounted for on an equity basis. These indicators refer to a  distinctive  GHG  accounting  methodology  that  considers all  energy  products  managed  by  Eni's  various  businesses, including purchases from third parties, and all the emissions they  generate  along  the  entire  value  chain  (Scope  1+2+3), according to a well-to-wheel approach.\n\nThe  methodology  was  developed  with  the  collaboration  of independent experts. The resulting indicators are subject to third-party  verification  as  part  of  Eni's  GHG  data  verification process (see the Eni for Sustainability Performance 2022 for the auditor's report and GHG Statement).\n\nThe performance of key equity indicators is described below:\n\nNet GHG Lifecycle Emissions: the indicator refers to all Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions associated with Eni activities and energy products sold by Eni, along their value chain, net of offsets, mainly from Natural Climate Solutions. In 2022, the indicator decreased by about 8% compared to 2021, mainly driven by the decline in upstream production and gas sales in the GGP sector.\n\nNet Carbon Intensity: the indicator is calculated as the ratio between absolute net GHG emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) along the value chain of energy products and the amount of energy they  contain.  In  2022,  it  was  essentially  stable  compared to  2021  (-0.4%);  the  trend  is  influenced  by  the  increase  in renewable energy production (+160% vs. 2021), partly offset by the reduction in GGP's gas sales.\n\nThese metrics are integrated by specific indicators to monitor operational emissions:\n\nNet  Carbon  Footprint  Upstream: the  indicator  considers Scope 1+2 emissions from all upstream assets, operated by Eni and by third parties, net of offsets mainly from Natural Climate Solutions. In 2022, the indicator decreased by around 11% compared to 2021 mainly in relation to lower upstream production and compensation through carbon credits, which in 2022 amount to 3 MtCO 2 eq. The credits are linked to Natural Climate Solutions (NCS) projects to halt deforestation.\n\nNet Carbon Footprint Eni: the indicator considers Scope 1+2 emissions from activities carried out by Eni and third parties, net of offsets, mainly from Natural Climate Solutions.\n\nIn  2022,  the  indicator  decreased  by  around  11%  mainly  in relation to a decrease in emissions from the Upstream and Power businesses and compensation through carbon credits, which in 2022 amount to 3 MtCO 2 eq.\n\nThe indirect  GHG  emissions  Scope  3 are  accounted  for  in accordance  with  IPIECA  guidelines,  which  require  an  activitybased analysis. These include GHG emissions related to the final consumption of the products sold (the so-called Scope 3, end-use category) form the largest contribution, and are calculated on the basis of upstream production in equity share. These emissions form  part  of  the  Scope  3  end-use  emissions  considered  in the  Net  GHG  Lifecycle  Emissions  and  Net  Carbon  Intensity indicators. In particular they represent the emissions from end users from Eni's upstream supply chain. They decreased by 7% in 2022 compared to 2021 due to the reduction in hydrocarbon production sold by the upstream business. For the other Scope 3 emission categories, the trend is broadly constant over the 20162022 period.\n\nWith reference to  operated assets, the following is a summary of the performance of the main indicators, accounted on a 100% basis according to the operatorship approach.\n\nOverall, direct  GHG  Scope  1  emissions  from  the  assets operated by Eni , in 2022 amounted to 39.4 million tons of CO 2 eq.,  a  slight  reduction  compared  to  2021,  mainly  due to the decrease of emissions in the upstream, power and chemicals sectors, partially compensated for by an increase in the transport and gas liquefaction sector. Indirect GHG Scope 2 Emissions decreased by about 3% in 2022 compared to 2021 due to lower consumptions in the Chemicals sector (new Porto Marghera plant configuration). These emissions are related to the purchase of energy from third parties for the consumption of the operated assets and are marginal for  Eni  as  electricity  is  generated  mainly  through  its  own installations.\n\nThe  energy  efficiency  interventions  implemented  in  the  year resulted in actual primary energy savings compared to baseline consumption  of  about  422  ktoe/year  resulting  mainly  from upstream projects (about 84%), with an emission reduction benefit of about 1 million tons of CO 2 eq. If Scope 2 emissions, i.e., those from power and heat purchase, are also considered, the  net  CO 2 savings from energy saving projects amount to about 1.1 million tons of CO 2 eq.\n\nIn 2022, Eni's consumption of raw primary sources decreased also in relation to lower production levels compared to 2021. The  total  energy  consumed  was  517  million  GJ:  upstream 226 million GJ, Power 161 million GJ, R&M 60 million GJ and Chemical 55 million GJ.\n\nConcerning upstream operated assets , the overall reduction of the Scope 1 GHG emission intensity with respect to 2014 is around 23%, slightly behind schedule, mainly due to COVID pandemic and local factors in Libya. Flaring down and CCS projects  are  being  sanctioned,  and  their  impact  on  target achievement  date  will  be  evaluated.  With  respect  to  2021, the  index  slightly  increased  mainly  in  relation  to  the  exit",

The  volumes  of hydrocarbons sent for routine flaring decreased by around 9% in 2022 compared to 2021, mainly due to energy efficiency and flaring down interventions in Egypt and Nigeria. Fugitive emissions are decreasing thanks to LDAR (Leak Detection And Repair) campaigns implemented periodically with a reduction of emission of about 50 ktCO 2 eq. compared to 2021. Methane emission intensity is improving and equal to 0.08%, in line with the commitment to maintain it below 0.2%.\n\nIn 2022, the renewables business reached an installed capacity from  renewable  sources  of  2.3  GW  (doubling  the  result for 2021). This growth was achieved thanks to the organic development of projects in the United States (Brazoria, Texas), Spain (Cerillares) and Kazakhstan (Badamsha 2), as well as recent acquisitions in Europe (PLT Group, Fortore Energia in Italy  and  Cuevas  in  Spain)  and  the  United  States  (Corazon, Texas). Renewable energy production reached 2.8 TWh (more than twice the 2021 result), thanks to the contribution of both organically developed and acquired assets in operation.\n\nCompared to 2021, the production of biofuels has declined due to a few stops at the biorefinery in Gela; production in Venice grew. For 2022, the financial commitment of Eni in scientific research and technological development amounted to  \u20ac164  million,  of  which  \u20ac114  allocated  to  the  process carbon  footprint  reduction,  circular  economy,  renewable energy exploitation and magnetic confinement fusion. This expenditure includes, in particular, the topics of biorefining, chemistry  and  energy  production  from  renewable  sources (including biomass), energy storage, CO 2 capture, transport, storage and reuse, carbon footprint reduction of processes, gas utilization with a view to blue hydrogen production, green hydrogen production.\n\nClimate disclosure - Transparency in climate related disclosure and the strategy implemented by the company have enabled Eni to be confirmed, once again in 2022, as a leading company in CDP Climate Change Programme. The A- rating achieved by\n\nEni is higher than both the global average (C) and the sector rating of B 11 .\n\nIn  the  same  year,  Carbon  Tracker's 12 research on Integrated Energy Companies (IEC) placed Eni first among the peers for the  completeness  of  the  GHG  emissions  methodology,  the medium/long-term  intermediate  targets  and  the  emission boundary extended to the entire company. For the second year in  a  row,  the  Net  Zero Company Benchmark of the CA100+ 13 investor coalition reported Eni as one of the companies most aligned  with  the  Benchmark  requirements  regarding  GHG emission reduction targets, governance and climate disclosure. The CA100+ valuation is one of the primary references for the dialogue with investors on aspects related to climate strategy.\n\nCommitment to partnerships - Partnerships are one of the strategic drivers of Eni's decarbonization path, as the company has long been working with the academic world, civil society, institutions and businesses to promote the energy transition, making it possible to exploit and generate knowledge, share best practices and support initiatives that can simultaneously create value for the company and its stakeholders. Within the framework  of  its  partnerships  and  advocacy  activities,  Eni supports and shares clearly and transparently its positioning on the principles considered essential in climate protection, having published its guidelines on responsible climate change engagement  within  the  associations  to  which  it  belongs  in 2020 14 . The  alignment  between  Eni's  positioning  and  the business associations it participates in is periodically assessed through  the  'Assessment  of  industry  association's  climate policy  positions' 14 . Among  the  many  international  climate initiatives Eni participates in, the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) plays a key role in accelerating the Oil & Gas industry's response to the challenges of climate change. Established in 2014 by five companies, including Eni, OGCI now counts twelve Oil  &  Gas  companies,  representing  about  one-third  of  the global hydrocarbon production. The CEOs of the participating companies sit on the initiative's Steering Committee.\n\n- (11) On an assessment scale from D (minimum) to A (maximum).\n- (12) Independent financial think tank that has been conducting analyses for years to assess the impact of the energy transition on carbon intensive companies and financial markets.\n- (13) Climate Action 100+ is the largest shareholder engagement initiative on climate change issues with about 700 investors to date.\n- (14) Guidelines on responsible climate change engagement in trade associations can be found at Eni.com\n- https://www.eni.com/assets/documents/investor/2020/eng/Assessment-of-industry-associations-climate-policy-positions.pdf",

Planned evolution  of  business  activities,  strategic  directions  and  the challenges posed by changes in technology and the labour market in general imply an important commitment to increase the value of human capital over time through upskilling and reskilling initiatives, aimed at enriching or redirecting the set of skills required. In 2022, initiatives continued to communicate and assimilate a new model of capabilities and behaviours aimed effectively managing the transition, initiating processes to revise professional models and upgrade skills for the growth of more complete and integrated professionalism.  Concerning  the  management  of  its  resources, Eni  launched  a  new  model  for  resource  management  and development  (People  Journey)  that  defines  development  paths throughout  the  corporate  lifecycle.  These  paths  are  diversified and consistent with the new business model to enhance the various  professional  skills  and  talents  in  an  inclusive  logic while  fostering  people's  motivation,  sense  of  belonging  and proactivity.  In  this  respect,  the  appointment  processes  for about 400 senior profiles identified within the planned pathways were  finalised  in  2022,  the  revision  of  the  models  concerning about  4,400  resources  was  completed  and  the  updating  of the models involving a further 5,700 resources was started. In addition, internal mobility initiatives have resumed, recording an increase of around 28% in 2022 over the previous year, thanks to improvements to the internal job posting site and international mobility  initiatives  to  foster  greater  international  exposure. These actions have strengthened a cross-cultural approach that enhances the richness of continuous exchange and comparison between contexts.\n\n## A CULTURE OF PLURALITY AND PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT\n\nEni's  approach  to  Diversity  &  Inclusion  (D&I)  is  based  on the fundamental  principles  of  non-discrimination,  equal opportunities and inclusion of all forms of diversity, as well as of integrating and balancing work with personal and family concerns of Eni people.\n\nThese elements allow Eni to seize the opportunities related to the possible evolutions of the energy market and to continue on its path of transformation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe D&I strategy has a number of fundamental objectives, such  as  (a)  combining  business  objectives  with  the valorisation  of  uniqueness;  (b)  promoting  the  well-being of all Eni people as individuals and as part of the corporate system; and (c) achieving a sustainable inclusion process. Implementation  of  the  strategy  and  action  plan  -  defined through listening and involvement initiatives at all company levels - envisages focusing efforts on two priority areas of intervention:  the  creation  of  an  inclusive  mindset  and  the identification of actions aimed at specific targets such as gender, internationality, age, disability and sexual orientation. In 2022, the following training and communication initiatives continued: (i) D&I Matters, focused on some typical areas of diversity analysed through the lens of Unconscious Biases and actions aimed at overcoming them; (ii) Eni for Inclusion, a  month  dedicated  to  spreading  the  culture  of  valuing diversity;  (iii)  Community  internal  D&I  confrontation;  (iv) anti-discrimination  and  harassment,  for  management  and personnel, in view of the new corporate standard, implementing the  ILO190  Convention;  (v)  communication  campaigns  to support  women  (e.g.  #IoConLei  Orange  the  World  United Nations campaign to end of violence against women); (vi) launch of the project for listening directly to people abroad on the D&I topics. Eni also continued and enriched initiatives to  strengthen  the  presence  and  empowerment  of  women, including through activities for attracting female talent and promoting technical-scientific subjects (STEM) among female students thanks to the growing and effective testimony of role models and ambassadors, and with the valorisation of the female presence in positions of corporate responsibility; partnerships  were  also  set  up  aimed  at  strengthening women's  empowerment  and  entrepreneurship  (e.g.  Women X Impact). Specific projects were launched to promote the inclusion of people with disabilities 16 and their families. For example, assessing the accommodation capacity of offices and workplaces (pilot on five buildings) in terms of logistics and working tools made it possible to structure a work plan for the coming years.",

        "page_content": "Particular  attention  was  paid  to  the  communication  of  an inclusive  mindset  (especially  sexual  orientation  and  gender identity) through numerous actions of engagement, listening, awareness-raising and communication to all colleagues in Italy and abroad while respecting the regulations of the Countries of reference. With a focus on Age, Eni reviewed the path of its resources in the first three years after recruitment, specifically focusing on the first months of entry. There are also mentoring and coaching programmes. The latter is highly recommended for  new  teams,  especially  those  facing  significant  transition challenges. In 2022, the focus on internationality was confirmed while enhancing local content through the involvement of local personnel  in  the  operating  activities  of  individual  Countries, leading  to  the  use  of  expatriate  staff  only  for  particular professionalism  and  skills  that  are  difficult  to  find  in  the Country of reference. In addition, a listening activity involving 17 Countries was carried out to identify specific D&I target groups, especially in relation to the local context. Remuneration policies for Eni employees are defined according to an integrated model at global level and promote salary progression linked exclusively to meritocratic criteria referring to the skills expressed in the role held, the performance achieved and the references of the local remuneration market. In order to verify implementation of these policies, Eni has been monitoring on an annual basis the wage gap between women and men since 2011, finding a substantial alignment of remuneration. In addition, in relation to ILO (International Labour Organization) standards, Eni performs annual analyses on the remuneration of local personnel in the main  Countries  in  which  it  operates,  which  show  minimum salary levels of Eni personnel significantly higher than both the minimum legal salaries and the minimum market remuneration levels,  identified  for  each  Country  by  international  providers (for further information, see Report on remuneration policy and remuneration paid 2023). In 2022, performance appraisal and management review processes covered 91% and 96% of the target population. Potential appraisal activities covered 97% of the planned total, with a slight decrease mainly due to the entry of new resources (especially from abroad).\n\n## TRAINING\n\nClassroom,  distance  and  self-study  training  is  increasingly instrumental in achieving the corporate mission and supporting change. To increase training quality, microlearning initiatives (a teaching methodology characterised by small portions of training content) were carried out, with which the platform (also accessible by third parties ( Mychange ) was enriched with training content related to energy transition, sustainable development and digital transformation.  In  addition,  retraining  through  upskilling  and reskilling initiatives continued this year (a two-year training project linked to the Expansion Contract was presented to the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs), to integrate new skills necessary for business evolution (professional and behavioural) or for the challenges posed by technological change and the labour market.\n\nTraining efforts on the new Code of Ethics, induction courses for new recruits on leadership and, in continuation of previous years, on  HSE  and  Human  Rights  issues  were  addressed.  Finally,  a course on inclusive behaviour for all employees was updated, and a first edition was delivered at the end of the year.\n\n## INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS\n\nIn Italy , on May 2 nd ,  2022, an Expansion Contract was signed between Eni, the Ministry of Labour and Social Policies and trade  unions,  valid  for  two  years  (2022-23).  This  contract confirms itself as an instrument to support the energy transition transformation and allows for generational change by including new key professional figures for the decarbonization process, the implementation of an essential investment for educating and training all employees with upskilling and reskilling paths, and at the same time a critical turn-over plan. In 2022, meetings continued with the trade unions as envisaged in the INSIEME Protocol  'Industrial  Relations  Model  to  Support  the  Energy Transition Path', and in November, an agreement was signed to integrate the results bonus, which recognised the extraordinary contribution made by Eni people to achieving the company's positive results through a 30% increase in the 2022 bonus and a simultaneous advanced payment in November. On December 12, 2022, the NOI - Protocol on initiatives and services for the well-being of Eni people was signed with the trade unions. It strengthens welfare by intervening in health, social security, income support, housing and support in family management, seeking a proper balance with work activities. It presents an increasingly  attentive  approach  to  the  personal  and  social sphere,  bringing  the  company  closer  to  people's  needs  by further improving the existing services offered, making them easier to access throughout the territory.\n\nAbroad , in June  2022,  international  industrial  relations meetings were held, namely the 25 th meeting of the European Works Council (EWC) for Eni employees, the European Agency for Health, Safety and the Environment and the annual meeting provided for by the Global Framework Agreement on International Industrial  Relations  and  Corporate  Social  Responsibility.  The meetings focused on Eni's commitment to a fair and equitable energy  transition  as  part  of  its  decarbonization  pathway including the R&D initiatives, and presenting the Eni Plenitude and Versalis 17 bio-circular economy models. To integrate Eni's strategy more fully with participatory models, including from a transnational perspective, energy transition has been included among  the  EWC's  information  and  consultation  topics.  The EWC agreement was renewed for a further four-year period. During  the  year,  a  gradual  extension  of  the  Smart  Working discipline to realities abroad was initiated.\n\n## CORPORATE WELFARE AND WORK-LIFE BALANCE\n\nEni  has  a  system  of  corporate  welfare  and  benefits  that includes a set of services, initiatives and instruments aimed",

        "page_content": "at improving the well-being of employees. Eni's Smart Working (SW) model (agreement signed in October 2021) provides all employees in Italy with 8 days/month for office sites and 4 days/month  for  operational  sites  and  numerous  Welfare options to support not only parenthood and disability but also the health of individuals or their cohabiting family members. It is further enriched by an opportunity to manage a cohabiting family member's temporary, sudden and unplannable health problems.  The  SW  model  has  been  progressively  adopted in  other  Countries  as  well,  in  line  with  local  regulations. Furthermore,  again  in  relation  to  parenting,  in  all  Countries where  Eni  operates,  it  continues  to  recognise:  10  working days 100% paid to both parents, 14 minimum weeks' leave for the primary carer as per the ILO convention and the payment of an allowance equal to at least 2/3 of the salary received in the previous period. As far as welfare services are concerned, Eni has a system of benefits ranging from health protection to social security coverage, from recreational and educational services  to  financial  and  insurance  services,  and  from mobility to catering. Further services have been planned that will be provided in 2023, based on listening to the following emerging needs: work-life balance, psychophysical well-being, caregiving needs and new parenthood.\n\n## HEALTH\n\nEni  considers  health  protection  an  essential  Human  Right and promotes the psycho-physical and social well-being of its people, their families and the communities of the Countries in which  it  operates  (see  chapter  'Alliances  for  development'). The extreme variability of working contexts requires a constant effort to update health risk matrices and makes it particularly challenging to guarantee health at every stage of the business cycle.  To  rise  to  this  challenge,  Eni  has  developed  a  health management system that ensures services to its people, covering occupational  health,  industrial  hygiene,  traveller  medicine, health  assistance  and  medical  emergency,  health  promotion initiatives, assessment of the impacts of business operations on  the  health  of  communities,  as  well  specific  programs  to support the communities in which it operates. In addition to the maintenance and continuous improvement of health services, the  health  management  strategy  aims  to:  (i)  strengthen  the access to care for all Eni people; strengthen community-based interventions; strengthen emergency assistance services and initiatives to support situations of fragility, in particular, regarding to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  and  mental  health  protection;  (ii) spreading the culture of health through initiatives in favour of workers,  their  families  and  communities  identified  with  the analysis of the health indicators available to the general public; (iii) implementing occupational medicine activities also with the contribution of scientific research and in consideration of the risks related to new projects and industrial processes, and the results of industrial hygiene activities; (iv) promoting the digitalization of health processes and services through the use of information technologies,  telemedicine,  and  mobile  communications.  In 2022, all of the Group companies continued the implementation\n\nof health management systems with the objective of promoting and maintaining the health and physical, mental and social wellbeing of Eni people and ensuring adequate risk management in the workplace. Initiatives include the pilot launch of a home and  digital  assistance  project,  'Pi\u00f9  Salute'  (More  Health), for  employees  and  their  families;  the  activation  of  a  PFA (Psychological First Aid) service in the event of catastrophic, sudden and unexpected events, through an external provider, made  up  of  specialist  psychologists,  available  to  100%  of employees; and the strengthening of health promotion activities through new digital tools for internal communication. Research activities continued in cooperation with research centres and universities  to  assess  the  health  impact  of  new  production processes and business models related to the energy transition. Collaboration with health institutions in Countries of presence and with international organisations was strengthened, including a contribution to a WBCSD report on the role of businesses in contributing to global health. Finally, concerning the COVID-19 emergency,  continued  support  was  given  to  business  units through specific initiatives: monitoring epidemiological updates and new guidelines issued by international bodies; continuous updating and implementation of measures for prevention and containment; implementation of travel medicine measures to reduce the risk for travelling personnel; and use of the international transport service with medical support for personnel suffering serious health conditions.\n\n## Performance metrics and comments\n\n## EMPLOYMENT AND DIVERSITY\n\nOverview - Overall employment amounts to 31,376 people, of whom  20,471  in  Italy  (65.2%  of  Eni's  employees)  and  10,905 abroad (34.8% of Eni's employees). In 2022, employment at global level dropped by 512 people compared to 2021, equal to -1.6%, with a decrease both in Italy (-161 employees) and abroad (-351 employees). The decrease in employment is linked: (i) in Italy to personnel turnover, achieved through extraordinary instruments that minimise the social impact (Expansion and 'Isopensione' Early Retirement - Contract), almost entirely offset by new hires and acquisitions; (ii) abroad to M&A transactions (divestments and deconsolidation) relating to optimising the Natural Resources business portfolio. In 2022, the female presence increased by 0.6 percent compared to 2021, with simultaneous growth also in positions of responsibility (1.2 percent vs. 2021).\n\nHires - Overall, in 2022, 2,524 people were hired (+93% approx. vs. 2021) of which 1,796 with permanent contracts ( approx. +86%  vs.  2021).  About  47%  of  permanent  hires  involved employees up to the age of 30. Of the total number of hires, approximately 66% were for the Energy Evolution Department (total 1,656, including 1,199 permanent and 457 with fixed-term contracts), 20% for the Natural Resources Department (total 502, 319 permanent and 183 fixed-term) and the remaining 14%",

        "page_content": "in Support Functions (total 366 of which 278 permanent and 88 fixed-term).\n\nTerminations - 2,683 contracts were terminated (1,556 in Italy and 1,127 abroad), 2,215 of which were permanent contracts 18 , with a 30% impact on female personnel. 40% of employees with permanent contracts who ended their employment in 2022 were under 50 years of age. Eni's transformation process, which requires a high skills turnover, is also reflected in the trend in the turnover rate, which in 2022 was the highest for the last four years, equal to 12.6%.\n\nTurnover rate - Eni's transformation process, which needs a strong turnover of competencies to support the energy transition, can also be seen in the trend of the turnover rate, which in 2022 records the most important measure of the last 4 years (2019: 9.8%; 2020: 6.1%; 2021: 10.5%; 2022: 12.6%).\n\nIn  the  area  of  inclusiveness  and  Age  Diversity,  the  figures  of turnover of female staff and the under-30 population increased vs. 2021: female turnover (16.2% vs. men 11.3%) grows by 4.9 p.p., while turnover under 30 by 18.7 p.p. The turnover for staff aged 30-50 is slightly up vs. 2021 (+3.2 p.p.), while that of staff over 50 is essentially stable.\n\nDiversity & Inclusion - In 2022, the percentage of female personnel grew by 0.6% compared to 2021 and stood at 26.86%, divided by position (ratio of women to the total): 17.51% of executives, 29.67% of middle management, 30.73% of white collar workers, 13.86% of blue collar workers. The overall percentage of women on the management bodies of subsidiaries has remained unchanged from 2021, and is 24%, while it is down compared  to the past, the overall percentage of women on the supervisory bodies of subsidiaries, which in 2022 stands at 38% (43% in 2021). In 2022, the percentage of women in positions of responsibility rose to 28.5% compared to 27.3% in 2021, in all, women accounted for 26.86% of the total workforce. At Eni, 33% of those reporting directly to the CEO are women. There were 662 permanent female hires in 2022 out of 1,796, counting for 36.9%, up slightly compared to 2021 of approx. +4.4 p.p. with higher than average growth expected compared to the targets set for 2030 (Gender Diversity target: 2030 vs. 2020 +3 p.p., average annual growth +0.3 p.p.). In recent years, about 20% of the resources in positions of responsibility are local foreign resources. This figure is in line with 2021, with a slight decrease of -0.8 p.p. due to changes in the scope of consolidation (deconsolidation in Angola and divestment in Pakistan).\n\nEni's population consists of 108 different nationalities. In Italy, Eni and its subsidiaries have about 850 employees in protected categories  as  set  out  in  Law  No.  68/99.  More  than  60  new employees belonging to protected categories were recorded in 2022. In addition, Eni has signed institutional commitments for the placement of approximately 120 resources over the next few years, a commitment that will be increased to approximately 250 resources.\n\nEmployment in Italy - There were 1,213 hires in Italy, of which 1,096  permanent  contracts  (35.2%  women).  The  reduction in  employment  of  -161  units  (-0.8%),  carried  out  through an  extraordinary  exit  plan,  together  with  a  selective  and punctual turnover plan, has allowed the population under 30 to increase by 12.7% in favour of a reduction in the senior age groups: the population over 50 decreased by 5.8%. Again in Italy, in 2022, there were 1,556 terminations, 1,437 of which related  to  employees  with  permanent  contracts  (of  which 26% were women). Overall in Italy, at the end of 2022 there was a replacement ratio between new permanent hires and terminations of approximately 1:1.3 (1 hire to 1.3 terminations).\n\nEmployment  abroad -  Average  presence  of  local  personnel abroad is constant and around 87% in the last three years on average. In 2022, there were 1,311 new hires abroad, of which 700 with permanent contracts (39.4% women). The balance between hires and terminations abroad at year-end was +184, of which 1,311 hires (65% Energy Evolution Department; 26% Natural  Resources  Department;  9%  Support  Functions)  and 1,127 terminations of which 778 were permanent contracts. Of these, 25.3% regarded employees under the age of 30, and 37.5% were women personnel. Abroad, there was a decrease of -351 resources (-3.1%) compared to the previous year, compared to  -430  local  resources  (-4.3%),  mainly  related  to  perimeter changes,  +9  Italian  expatriates  (+0.9%),  +70  international resources (+22%). Abroad there are a total of 1,384 expatriates (including 1,001 Italians and 383 international expatriates).\n\nEmployment  by  business  unit -  About  25%  of  permanent hires were in the chemical sector, which has strengthened both in Countries with traditional activities (e.g. France and UK) and in Countries with new activities (e.g. Mexico, India, and  Romania).  Growth  also  concerned  the  Retail  Market G&P,  Upstream  and  Support  business  areas,  that  further consolidated their skills and expertise. Terminations mainly related to the Upstream (19%), Chemicals (22%) and Support (24%) businesses.\n\nAverage age - The average age of Eni people worldwide is 45.1 years (45.9 in Italy and 43.6 abroad), unchanged compared to 2021; this result was achieved thanks to the important turnover work carried out through the use of extraordinary early retirement incentive tools (Expansion and 'Isopensione' Contract) combined with an important recruitment programme aimed in particular at innovative professionals: 49 years (49.7 in Italy and 47.2 abroad) for senior and middle managers, 44.2 years (45 in Italy and 42.6 abroad) for white collars workers and 41 years (40.2 in Italy and 41.9 abroad) for blue collars workers.\n\n## REMUNERATION\n\nEni annually monitors wage equity, a principle explicitly referred",

        "page_content": "to in the annual implementation provisions for remuneration policies,  to  assess  possible  corrective  actions.  Specifically, in  2022,  the  ratio  of  CEO/DG's  remuneration  to  the  median of  employees  Italy  (main  operating  location)  is  35  for  fixed remuneration and 137 for total remuneration; considering all employees, these ratios are 35 and 140, respectively. The total remuneration of all employees compared to 2021 varied by 5.8 percent while that of the CEO/DG varied by 5.3 percent. The gender pay ratio calculated by professional category shows a substantial alignment of women's and men's remuneration for middle managers and white collars while for senior managers and blue collars the deviations are mainly related to a smaller female presence. The indicator at the overall level, without considering professional categories, is 101 for fixed remuneration (Italy 102) and 97 for total remuneration (Italy 98).\n\n## INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS\n\nIn Italy, 100% of employees are covered by collective bargaining by  virtue  of  current  regulations.  Abroad,  in  relation  to  the specific regulations operating in the individual Countries, this percentage stands at 54.87%.\n\nIn Countries where employees are not covered by collective bargaining, Eni ensures  in  any  case  full  compliance with  international  and  local  legislation  applicable  to  the employment relationship as well as some higher standards of protection guaranteed by Eni throughout the group through the application of its company policy worldwide.\n\n## TRAINING\n\nIn 2022, training trends tended to remain constant compared to 2021: both the total value of hours used and the average value confirm the 2021 results with a value of 31.1 per employee with a different combination for the professional categories. However, there is a slight increase in the average expenditure of about 1.4% compared to 2021 due to the resumption of inperson training. This phenomenon also impacted the delivery mode mix: distance training decreased slightly from 62% 19 to 57% this year.\n\n## HEALTH\n\nIn 2022, the number of health services provided by Eni was 384,291, of which 243,118 for employees, 72,261 for family members, 61,230 for contractors and 7,682 for others (e.g. visitors and external patients). The number of participants in health promotion initiatives in 2022 was 82,700, of whom 63,760 were employees, 16,019 contractors and 2,921 family members. As concerns occupational illnesses, in 2022 there were  29  claims,  of  which  3  related  to  current  employees and 26 related to former employees. Of the 29 occupational disease claims submitted in 2022, 2 were submitted by heirs (all relating to former employees). As part of digital initiatives to monitor the healthiness of indoor workplaces, 20 sensors were tested at onshore operational sites in Italy in 2022. It is planned to extend testing to 80 sensors, including offshore and abroad, by 2026.",

        "page_content": "## Safety\n\nFor Eni, the culture  of  safety and the communication of its indispensable value among  employees,  contractors  and stakeholders have always been crucial to achieving business objectives. Eni constantly invests in research and development for all the necessary actions to be taken to ensure safety at work, in particular in the development of organizational models for risk assessment and management and in the promotion of a culture of safety, in order to pursue its commitment eliminating accidents and protecting the integrity of its assets. In 2022, despite  the  efforts,  there  were  four  fatal  accidents  involving contractors' personnel, one in Italy and three abroad. An analysis of the year's injuries revealed a prevalence of causes belonging to the Integrated Systems & Human Performance area, mainly related to the works management and execution of activities. To prevent such incidents in the future, initiatives were introduced to  strengthen  the  awareness  and  involvement  of  employees and contractors in the HSE field (Safety Leadership, Coaching Programme,  promotion  of  the  Stop  Work  Authority 20 ).  Other activities aimed to improve work areas in terms of personnel safety , and management documents and operating instructions were updated. Eni's commitment also focused on three main themes: non-technical skills, technical skills and digitalization. For  non-technical  skills,  the  THEME  methodology  on  worker behaviour and human reliability analysis was applied in 2022 to identify action strategies to fortify human barriers and safe behaviour.  With  regard  to  technical  skills,  (i)  a  new  training course on Operational Safety Management was developed and disseminated to familiarise people with the basic principles and minimum safety requirements to be applied in risky activities to  prevent  the  occurrence  of  possible  accidents;  (ii)  trained HSE personnel on the new accident root-cause investigation methodology according to Eni standards. Regarding digitalization,  the  Safety  Presence  tool  was  extended  to  all business units. By exploiting artificial intelligence, it can predict recurring dangerous situations from unsafe conditions/unsafe acts/near-miss reports and send alerts to the site to implement corrective  actions  before  an  accident  occurs.    Smart  Safety was extended to contractors, involving wearable devices that alert workers in dangerous conditions and emergencies. Finally, the dissemination of the AppHSEni was promoted, allowing for reporting of unsafe conditions from the field, compiling of Work Preparation Checklists and field inspections, and consulting the Safety Golden Rules and Process Safety Fundamentals 21 .\n\nIn the area of process safety , to minimise accidents and improve performance, Eni carried out several activities: the creation and widespread communication of Process Safety Fundamentals (the principles of process safety to be followed during plant\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nactivities); the development of a training course to disseminate the  fundamental  elements  defined  in  the  Process  Safety Management  System,  aimed  at  all  technical/operational  and HSEQ area personnel; the in-depth study of fluid management safety issues for new energy chains, revising process safety standards to include specific design requirements for hydrogen, CO 2 and other substances from new chains.\n\nEni applies the Asset Integrity process to all its plants, which ensures  that  they  are  correctly  designed  and  built  properly with  the  most  appropriate  materials,  carefully  operated  and decommissioned, managing residual risk in the best possible way, guaranteeing maximum reliability and above all safety for people and the environment. The Asset Integrity Management System therefore  is  employed  from  the  initial  design  stage  (Design Integrity), to procurement, construction, installation and testing (Technical Integrity) through to operating and decommissioning (Operating Integrity). During 2022, Eni continued the organisation of initiatives to further promote the Asset Integrity culture with the continuous build-up of its management of data, documents, and models through the entire life cycle of its assets ('Lifecycle Information'), taking a cross and widespread approach, including the new energy transition supply chains.\n\nRegarding the management of contractors , the 147 people of the  Safety  Competence  Centre  (SCC)  continued  to  proactively monitor and support the process of improvement of companies towards management models characterised by a safety culture that is more preventive, monitoring over 2,500 suppliers, equal to 70% of those with potential HSE criticalities in Italy, managing the anomalies detected with immediate corrective actions and sharing  innovative  good  practices.  In  addition,  Safety  Pacts (voluntary  agreements  with  companies)  have  been  extended to environmental issues at all sites where Eni operates in Italy. At the same time, they are active or being implemented with various contractors at some Eni sites abroad (Nigeria, Tunisia, Congo,  Mexico,  Angola,  USA,  Indonesia,  Egypt,  Ghana,  Libya, Albania, and Pakistan).\n\nEni  promotes technological  innovation to  design  innovative processes  and  products,  adopt  methods  and  techniques  to reduce hazardous substances and/or encourage the adoption of products with a lower impact on the environment, health and safety. According to the regulation, all substances and mixtures produced  and  marketed  are  accompanied  by  appropriate technical documentation (which can also be consulted online in  real-time)  aimed  at  informing  workers  and  customers  on optimal handling, storage and disposal conditions and providing guidance on the correct use of personal protective equipment, where necessary. Finally, all substances/mixtures classified as",

        "page_content": "hazardous to health are assessed for health and safety impact. Regarding  the management  system  relating  to  health  and safety in the workplace, Eni's HSE regulatory system establishes criteria for clustering the operational units of Eni SpA and its subsidiaries based on the HSE risk of the activities performed. Three  types  of  clusters  are  identified:  significant  HSE  risk clusters (industrial activities), for which there is an obligation to  adopt  an  HSE  management  system,  certification  to  ISO 14001  and  ISO  45001 22 standards  and  annual  internal  HSE audits;  limited  HSE  risk  clusters  (office  activities  or  activities of limited relevance), for which there is an obligation to adopt (but not certify) an HSE management system and annual or fiveyearly internal HSE audits; and no HSE risk clusters (absence of  employees  and  operating  activities),  for  which  there  are no  specific  obligations.  Within  this  context,  all  companies  at significant risk have ISO 45001 and ISO 14001 certification or have planned to achieve it. All companies at limited risk have implemented an HSE management system or have planned its development. In particular, by the end of 2022: 88% of those with significant  risk  have  already  achieved  ISO  45001  certification and 87% ISO 14001, while 79% of those required to develop an HSE management system have already implemented an HSE management system. During 2022, more than 1,300 internal audits on HSE issues were carried out in addition to third-party audits for maintaining certifications.\n\n## Performance metrics and comments\n\nIn 2022, the total recordable injury rate (TRIR) of the workforce increased compared to 2021 (+20%), due to an increase in the number of total recordable injuries (113 compared to 88 in 2021), in particular recorded by contractors (88 vs. 55\n\nin 2021), while the number of recordable employee injuries decreased (25 vs. 33 in 2021).\n\nIn Italy, the number of total recordable injuries increased (42 events compared to 35 in 2021, of which 15 employees and 27 contractors) and the Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) deteriorated (+22%); abroad, the number of injuries also increased (71 events compared to 53 in 2021, of which 10 employees and 61 contractors) and the total recordable injury  ratio  worsened  by  22%.  Four  fatal  accidents  were recorded for contractors, two in Pakistan (a road accident and  an  operator  hit  by  an  object  during  maintenance activities), one in Egypt (fall from height) and one at the Priolo petrochemical plant (operator hit by an object). The labour force fatality index was 1.46. The value of the HighConsequence Work-Related Injuries rate (calculated based on accidents with more than 180 days of absence and with consequences such as total or partial permanent disability) is 0.01, following two accidents, the first an employee in the UK (crushing of a limb) and the second contractor in Egypt (operator hit by an object). During 2022, there was a further decrease in Tier 1 and Tier 2 23 process safety incidents. It has decreased steadily since 2016, indicating an increased focus on process safety issues at all Eni sites. In particular, 17 process safety (PSE) events were recorded in Tier 1 and 21 in Tier 2. More than half of the events (53%) occurred in upstream activities, 24% in refining activities and 16% in petrochemicals. Two-thirds of the PSEs resulted in a product spill, 21% in a fire and 13% in a release into the atmosphere, to  which  Eni  responded  promptly.  Concerning  reporting possible  hazards  at  work,  there  was  an  increase  in  the number of unsafe conditions and unsafe acts recorded in 2022 compared to 2021, thanks to initiatives and tools to strengthen the reporting and analysis of weak signals.",

Particular attention is paid to the efficient use of natural resources (like water), to reducing oil spills, to managing waste, to managing the  interaction  with  biodiversity  and  ecosystem  services. Environmental culture is an important lever for ensuring the proper  management  of  environmental  issues.  Therefore,  in 2022, Eni continued its awareness-raising activities through a communication campaign targeting all employees, a series of 'Environmental Talks' on topical issues and the 'Together for the Environment' training course. The latter an e-learning course  on  various  thematic  areas  including:  the  possible repercussions of an environmental event on a global and local scale, the value of effective communication of risks associated with  environmental  aspects,  and  roles  and  responsibilities in  environmental  matters.  Awareness-raising  activities  also involved operational sites with specific engagement activities on environmental issue management. In 2022, in collaboration with the University of Padua, Eni launched the Be Green project dedicated to evaluating and analysing the role of the human factor  and  promoting  a  shared  environmental  culture  at various levels in the organisation. The campaign to promote Environmental Golden Rules continued, aimed at employees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nand  suppliers  adopting  virtuous  behaviour  so  that  their activities reflect Eni's values, commitment and standards.\n\nThis  path  led  to  19  sites,  in  Italy,  signing  Environment  and Safety Pacts involving several suppliers who have committed to implement tangible improvement actions that can be measured through  the  Safety  and  Environment  Performance  Index.  In continuity  with  last  year,  the  Company  has  continued  the activities dedicated to environmental digitalization for process optimisation through the creation of IT tools for the management of environmental compliance, including international compliance, and site-specific technical-management assessment models.\n\nThe transition path towards a circular  economy represents for Eni one of the main responses to current environmental challenges,  through  the  promotion  of  a  business  model that applies circular principles to existing supply chains and gives value to new supply chains and sustainable products. Circular  principles  are  internalised  in  the  upstream,  with  the maximisation  of  opportunities  for  the  reuse  of  assets  and recycling  of  materials.  The  same  topics  are  addressed  in procurement, with awareness-raising actions and involvement of suppliers on the 'Open-es' digital platform. In the downstream these  topics  are  addressed  with  the  production  of  biofuels and, in the coming years, biomethane which will be partially obtained from the valorisation of waste and scrap, and new technologies for waste valorisation (e.g. OFMSW). Among its businesses, Versalis is particularly involved in the developing",

        "page_content": "both mechanical and chemical polymer recycling technologies. Eni Rewind 24 enhances the value of soil, water and waste with sustainable remediation and redevelopment projects.\n\nEni  has  continued  the  development  and  application  of  its Circularity  analysis  model 25 , applied  to  different  business contexts, validated by a third-party certification body, which is an essential tool for the control, management, transparency and credibility of the goals and commitments undertaken on the path towards a circular economy model.\n\nThe biorefineries are  part  of  a  context  of  decarbonizing mobility by offering increasingly low-emission  products and  maintaining  employment.  Considering  this,  in  October 2022,  Eni  permanently  discontinued  the  procurement  of palm oil used in the Venice and Gela biorefineries to produce hydrogenated biofuels. This allowed the company to reach the declared goal of becoming 'palm oil free' by the end of 2023 in advance. The amount of palm oil was permanently replaced by alternative feedstocks (e.g. used cooking and frying oils, animal fats and vegetable oil processing waste) and advanced feedstocks (e.g. lignocellulosic material and bio-oils) within the production cycle. Furthermore, in the second half of 2022, the Gela biorefinery received the first cargo shipment of vegetable oil produced in the Makueni agri-hub in Kenya (where castor, croton  and  cotton  seeds  are  pressed)  from  agri-feedstocks produced  by  Eni  that  do  not  compete  with  the  food  chain, grown in degraded areas, harvested from wild trees or resulting from the valorisation of agricultural by-products. The plan to spread of HVO (Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil) biofuels is part of the circular economy, allowing for the addition of value to agricultural and livestock waste and effluents, for light, heavy, maritime and aviation transport.\n\nRegarding waste management , Eni pays particular attention to the traceability of the entire process and to the verification of the parties involved in the disposal/recovery chain, searching for all feasible solutions to prevent the generation of waste. Almost all Eni waste in Italy is managed by Eni Rewind that continued the digitalization project launched in 2020 to improve the efficiency and monitoring of its waste management process. In order to limit the negative impacts related to waste, exclusive use is made of authorised parties, favouring recovery over disposal, in line with the priority criteria indicated by European and national regulations. Eni Rewind, on the basis of the characteristics of  the  individual  waste,  selects  technically  viable  recovery/ disposal solutions, prioritising recovery, treatment operations that  reduce  the  quantities  to  be  sent  for  final  disposal  and suitable plants at a shorter distance from the waste production site;  furthermore,  audits  are  carried  out  on  environmental suppliers, to assess their operational waste management.\n\nEni assesses water use and its impacts on the ecosystem, other users and the organisation itself to ensure the efficient management of water resources.\n\nEspecially in water stressed areas, Eni carries out the mapping and monitoring of water risks and drought scenarios to define short-, medium- and long-term actions aimed at preventing and mitigating the effects of climate change. In addition, Eni's supplier qualification process includes water resource use as an evaluation element. In 2021 Eni published its own position on water resources 26 , in which it undertakes to pursue the CEO Water Mandate and, in particular, to minimise its fresh water withdrawals in areas under water stress. The commitments undertaken lead Eni for optimal water management beyond the  industrial  boundary,  integrated  into  the  territory  and  to minimise the exposure of its activities to water risk, through an  integrated  approach  at  river  basin  level.  In  terms  of transparency, in 2022 Eni gave a public response to the CDP Water Security questionnaire, obtaining an B rating, in line with the industry average. Eni pursues the reduction of freshwater withdrawals by acting on two levers: increasing the efficiency or internal recycling of fresh water and replacing high-quality freshwater  sources  (aquifer,  surface,  municipal  or  thirdparty) with low-quality water, e.g. remediated, wastewater or desalinated water. Eni Rewind is committed to making the treated water from its contaminated groundwater treatment plants (GTP) available for industrial use, reducing high-quality water withdrawals by using similar quantities of water from GTP.  Efforts  to  increase  the  share  of  re-injected  produced water  can  reduce  sea  or  brackish  water  withdrawals, contributing to the preservation of water resources, especially in  water-stressed  areas 27 .  The  implementation  of  specific projects is carried out in compliance with the necessary local authorisations, which may require the involvement of local stakeholders.  In  addition,  Eni  has  adopted  precise  internal standards to be used when mandatory local regulations are less stringent or absent concerning environment and water resource conservation, ultimately complying with the primary international  standards.  Concerning  potentially  hazardous substances 28 for which discharges are treated, Eni monitors its water discharge, particularly hydrocarbons in the discharge water after treatment and total oils in the discharge produced water. Internal pre-alarm thresholds are also adopted if the concentration  of  micropollutants  in  discharged  water  is exceeded,  specific  to  each  production  activity,  to  initiate timely corrective action, if necessary.\n\nWith regard to the management of risks associated with oil spills , Eni is constantly engaged in every area of intervention: prevention, preparedness, followed by mitigation, response and recovery.\n\n(24) Eni Rewind is Eni's environmental company that operates in line with the principles of the circular economy to enhance industrial land, water and waste, or waste derived from remediation activities.\n\n(27) Water stress areas are identified using Aqueduct, a tool developed by the World Resources Institute, and monitored annually through an internal analysis carried out down\n\nto the detail of the individual operational site.\n\n(28) As regulated by Legislative Decree No. 152 (Consolidated Environmental Act) or similar regulatory reference for foreign Countries.",

        "page_content": "As  part  of  oil  spill  prevention  in  Italy,  maintenance  was completed in Val d'Agri on the production network, and the e-vpms \u00ae29 system  was  upgraded.  This  update  was  also performed for the Leak Detection 30 monitoring of the Val d'Agri Oil Unit (COVA) crude oil transport line and the COVA industrial water injection line. Once again, in Val d'Agri, Kassandra Meteo Forecast 31 was optimized, the Early Warning weather warning monitoring programme applied to the continuous control of hydrogeological  risk,  COVA  water  discharge  management and monitoring of agricultural crops (Agri Hub). In addition, feasibility studies were carried out to evolve this system to mitigate  risks  from  natural  events  for  use  in  photovoltaic and wind power plants (Early Warning for Asset Integrity). In Italy, the technological upgrade of the e-vpms \u00ae system and its subsequent start-up was carried out on the Rho-Malpensa and Pantano-Fiumicino downstream lines. Also in Italy, on the retail network, the precautionary remediation of some underground tanks and waste oil tank reclamation and decommissioning was carried out. In Nigeria, the technology upgrade programme of the e-vpms \u00ae system was completed on some trunklines with the simultaneous start-up. On others, the installation of new system  sensors  was  completed.  Meanwhile,  an  operational plan was defined for new e-vpms \u00ae installations on the crude oil production and transportation network. Among the various sustainable  and  circular  approaches  within  the  remediation activities is the forthcoming construction of a phyto-purification plant, which can also be used to treat water from the industrial process. Furthermore, a set of microbiological analyses was included to encourage the use of more sustainable remediation technologies to verify the applicability of bioremediation 32 . The screening  method  for  assessing  risks  from  natural  events that  may  affect  pipelines  was  completed  and  applied  to  a case  study.  Eni  continues  to  work  with  IPIECA  and  IOGP  International Association of Oil & Gas Producers - to strengthen marine pollution response capacity downstream of oil spills. This includes participating in regional initiatives (in areas such as  the  Caspian  Sea,  Black  Sea  and  West/Central/Southern Africa and Central Eurasia).\n\nOperating  on  a  global  scale  in  environmental  contexts with  different  ecological  sensitivities,  Eni  has  developed  a science-based Biodiversity  and  Ecosystem  Services  (BES) management  model  over  time  that  relies  on  long-term collaborations  with  recognised  international  organisations, leaders  in  biodiversity  conservation,  i.e.  Fauna  &  Flora International  (since  2003),  Wildlife  Conservation  Society (since  2016)  and,  most  recently,  IUCN  -  International\n\nUnion  for  Conservation  of  Nature  (2022);  since  2009,  Eni has  been  a  member  of  Proteus,  a  UNEP/WCMC  (World Conservation Monitoring Centre) initiative for collecting and disseminating global data and information on biodiversity and ecosystems. For years, this model has been an integral part of the Integrated HSE Management System, confirming the awareness of the risks for the natural environment 33 resulting from Eni sites and activities. The BES management model is a risk-based approach, applied to the existing operations and to new projects. It ensures that the interactions between environmental  aspects  (such  as  BES,  climate  change, water  resource  management)  and  social  aspects  (such as  the  development  of  local  communities)  are  identified and managed from the early planning stages. BES studies assess the significance of an impact for each project phase, combining the magnitude of the impact with the sensitivity of the BES value in the affected area 34 . Not only are potential impacts on priority BES aspects assessed and managed, but opportunities  to  contribute  positively  to  their  conservation are  also  considered.  This  is  done  through  the  systematic application of the Mitigation Hierarchy. It prioritizes preventative  measures  over  corrective  ones  and  drives continuous improvement of BES management performance towards no net loss or net gain, of biodiversity depending on project-specific risks and context. Active engagement with stakeholders occurs from the early stages of a project and throughout its life cycle to ensure the actual application of the Mitigation Hierarchy. Consultation and collaboration with communities, indigenous peoples and other local stakeholders helps  to  understand  their  expectations  and  concerns, determine how ecosystem services and biodiversity are being used,  and  identify  management  options  that  include  local needs.  Biodiversity  risk  exposure  is  periodically  assessed by  mapping  Eni's  operational  sites  with  respect  to  their geographical proximity to protected areas and areas important for biodiversity conservation. This mapping allows identifying priority  sites  where  to  take  action  with  higher  resolution inquiries to characterize the operational and environmental context  and  assess  potential  impacts  to  be  avoided  or mitigated  through  Action  Plans,  (BAP  -  Biodiversity  Action Plan).  Furthermore,  BAPs  specify  the  targets,  monitoring, timelines, responsibilities and performance indicators. They are updated regularly throughout the project's life, ensuring effective  risk  exposure  management.  In  2019  Eni  adopted a 'NO GO' policy in areas UNESCO recognises as sites with 'Outstanding Universal Value' (OUV)  and communicated its\n\n- (30) Leak Detection is a leak detection system in fluid transport and standby conditions.\n- (31) Advance warning system able to support the management of oil and gas pipeline integrity and forecast possible hydrogeological risks related to natural events (flooding and landslides).\n- (32) Environmental remediation technology that relies on microorganisms capable of biodegrading or detoxifying pollutants.",

Eni promotes with partners the development and adoption of good management practices in line with its BES Policy. In 2022, Eni signed a two-year partnership with IUCN to identify good practices for mitigating biodiversity impact associated with developing renewable energy projects. Led by IUCN and The Biodiversity Consultancy with the collaboration of Fauna & Flora International and four other energy companies, the project will identify criteria and tools for selecting the the most environmentally suitable locations for solar and wind energy development, providing guidance on minimising the impact on biodiversity in the extraction of raw materials used in  renewable  energy  components,  guidance  on  managing cumulative impact, spatial planning and opportunities for for enhancing nature in solar and wind farm development areas. Furthermore, in 2022 through industry associations (IPIECA, WBCSD),  Eni  participated  in  the  negotiations  for  the  new Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, welcoming its objectives and global vision. Among the Framework's most significant  goals  is  the  requirement  for  large  companies to  transparently  monitor,  assess  and  disclose  their  risks, dependencies  and  impacts  on  biodiversity.  This  approach has long been part of Eni's BES management model, which provides for a periodic update of biodiversity risk exposure assessments for the Company's portfolio operations.\n\n## Performance metrics and comments\n\nIn  2022, seawater  withdrawals were  significantly  reduced due to the contribution of all business areas, particularly the R&M  and  Chemicals  sectors  (-200  Mm 3 due to maintenance shutdowns at the Porto Marghera petrochemical plant and the Taranto  Refinery  and  lower  production  at  the  Gela  refinery), Upstream (over -47 Mm 3 due to Eni Angola SpA's exit from the domain) and Corporate and Other Assets (about -13 Mm 3 due to  ILCV  SpA's  exit  from  the  domain).  Freshwater  withdrawals, which were equal about 9% of total water withdrawals and with more than 79% accounted for in the R&M and Chemical sector, recorded an overall increase. This is attributable to the entry of the  Porto  Marghera  and  Ravenna  Consortia  into  the  Versalis consolidation  domain.  These  provide  a  water  management service for the entire industrial site, including the distribution of the water withdrawn for companies other than Eni working at the same location. Excluding withdrawals made for third parties, freshwater withdrawals used in Eni's production processes in 2022 are reduced by 2% compared to the previous year, thanks to  initiatives  undertaken  to  optimise  internal  recovery  at  the Sannazzaro  refinery,  lower  electricity  production  at  Enipower, reduced consumption at the IPP OKPAI power plant in Nigeria and the start-up of the desalination plant at Zohr in Egypt in the second half of 2021 with zero freshwater withdrawals.\n\nEni's freshwater reuse rate was 90%, down slightly from the\n\n2021  figure  (91%),  partly  due  to  the  general  shutdown  of Versalis' Dunkirk site (more than -111 Mm 3 of recycled water). The percentage of reinjected produced water in the Exploration & Production sector increased to 59% (58% in 2021), despite the deconsolidation of V\u00e5r Energi and the sale of some assets in  Congo,  which  resulted  in  a  reduction  of  both  produced and reinjected water volumes. Analysis of the stress level of hydrographic basins and further studies carried out locally show that freshwater withdrawals from areas under stress account for 2% of Eni's total water withdrawals in 2022 (data slightly increased compared to 2021 due to the entrance of the Versalis Consoria in the domain). In 2022, in particular, Eni withdrew 131 Mm 3 of fresh water, of which 30.3 Mm 3 was from water-stressed areas (15.3 Mm 3 from  superficial  water  bodies,  6.3  Mm 3 from groundwater, 3.1 Mm 3 from third parties, 3.0 Mm 3 from urban networks and 2.6 Mm 3 from GTP). Sea water and brackish water withdrawals in water-stressed areas amounted to 942 Mm 3 and 8 Mm 3 respectively. Onshore produced water in water-stressed areas was 21.1 Mm 3 . In 2022, Eni discharged 98 Mm 3 of fresh water, of which 18.8 Mm 3 in water-stressed areas, equal to 19% (20% in 2021). In 2022 Eni's fresh water consumption was 122 Mm 3 (of which 31.7 Mm 3 in water-stressed areas).\n\nCompared  to  2021, operational oil spill barrels decreased by 35%. Among the most significant events were a 300-barrel spill in Egypt from a pipeline transferring crude oil from an offshore platform  to  the  onshore  plant  (almost  half  of  the  product was recovered). Of the barrels spilled, 38% are attributable to activities in Egypt, 19% to those in Lybia and 13% to those in Nigeria. Overall, almost 22% of the operational oil spill volumes were recovered.\n\nWith regard to sabotage oil spills , the number of occurrences in  2022  almost  doubled  compared  to  last  year.  Consequently, the volumes spilt also increased by more than 70%. All events occurred  in  Nigeria:  among  the  most  significant  spills  was  a 1,250-barrel spill caused by the use of explosives on the OgodaBrass  line  in  the  Niger  Delta  area  (over  1,000  barrels  were recovered). Overall, 80 per cent of the total volume from sabotage was recovered. Volumes spilled from operating spills impacted 45%  soil  and  55%  water  bodies,  while  those  from  sabotage impacted 99.6% soil and 0.4% water bodies. Volumes spilled as a result of chemical spills (47 total barrels) are mainly attributable to a spill at the Val d'Agri Oil Unit (31 barrels of product).\n\nWaste from production activities generated in 2022 increased by 29% compared to 2021, mainly due to an increase in the produced water from Zohr (Petrobel, Egypt) treated as hazardous waste.  Non-hazardous  waste  increased  slightly  compared  to 2021 (+2%), particularly in refining after line shutdowns at the Taranto and Gela refineries and for construction sites related to new lines at the Venice and Livorno refineries.\n\nEnipower (construction of a new boiler and two new turbines at the Ravenna power plant) and construction activities for new Plenitude plants in Italy and Slovenia contributed to the upward trend. Recovered and recycled waste remained stable at 11% of the total disposed waste 35 . Disposed waste at third parties was 87% of the total (92% hazardous waste and 83% non-hazardous",

        "page_content": "waste), while waste recovered and recycled at third parties was 91% of the total (100% hazardous waste and 89% non-hazardous waste). In 2022, a total of 4.4 million tons of waste were generated by remediation activities (of which 4.1 million from Eni Rewind), consisting of over 84% of treated water from GTP plants, partly reused and partly returned to the environment; the remaining volumes  are  handled  and  transferred  to  third-party  plants. Expenditure on remediation activities amounted to \u20ac558 million.\n\nEmissions  of  atmospheric  pollutants decreased,  with  the exception of particulate matter (PM) emissions, which increased by  4%  compared  to  the  previous  year.  The  reduction  in  SO x emissions is linked to the lower volume of gas sent to acid flaring at the Southern District COVA centre. In contrast, the reduction in  refinery  and  petrochemical  plant  production  has  affected the  reduction  in  NMVOCs.  PM  emissions  increased  overall  in connection as DLNG Service SAE (Damietta LNG) entered the scope of consolidation and the Sergaz increased gas transport. The 2022 biodiversity risk exposure assessment showed that there is overlap, even partial, with biodiversity important areas 36 at 21 operational sites 37 , all located in Italy with the exception of two sites in Spain and one in France; additional 45 sites 37 in 11 countries (Italy, Australia, Austria, France, Germany, United Kingdom,  Spain,  Switzerland,  Tunisia,  Hungary  and  USA)  are located less than 1 km from protected areas or KBA. About 40% of the sites in, or adjacent to, biodiversity important areas are  sites  for  renewable  energy  generation,  the  remainder are  petrochemical  plants,  refineries  or  depots.  As  regards the  upstream  sector,  29  concessions 37 partially  overlap  with protected areas or KBAs, with operating activities within the overlapping area. These concessions are found in six Countries: Italy, Nigeria, Pakistan, the United States (Alaska), Egypt and the United Kingdom. In general, for all the Business Units, the greatest exposure in Italy and Europe is to the protected areas of the Natura 2000 38 network that is spread across Europe; this exposure is less pronounced than last year due to the exit of the UK Natura 2000 sites. However, the same areas fall under the\n\n'other protected areas' category. In no case, in Italy or abroad, is there any overlap of operating activities with UNESCO World Heritage  Sites  (WHS 39 ); only one Upstream 40 site is located in the vicinity of a WHS natural site (Mount Etna) but there are no operating activities within the protected area, nor has significant impact been identified that could threaten the OUV - Outstanding Universal  Value.  In  2022,  habitat  restoration  or  biodiversity protection activities were performed (initiated and/or ongoing during  the  year)  in  Congo,  Egypt,  Nigeria,  UK,  USA  (Alaska), Mexico, Ghana, Spain and Italy. The main actions implemented concern ecological restoration of forests or other natural habitats, species monitoring and conservation activities, community and worker  awareness-raising  activities.  For  example,  in  Alaska, a BAP has been running since 2009 to mitigate impact and demonstrate progress towards the No Net Loss goal and, where possible, to help improve the status (net gain) and knowledge of  biodiversity  in  the  Alaska  North  Slope  area.  Key  actions in 2022 include: (i) the monitoring of polar bear movements within the operational area, (ii) the restoration of an abandoned gravel pit as a wetland including habitats for local wild birds. In addition, in 2022, Eni engaged a team of Arctic scientists from the international conservation NGO WCS (Wildlife Conservation Society) to work with local authorities and communities to test new low-disturbance strategies for detecting polar bear dens and approaches for protecting and restoring the Arctic tundra. In 2022, the analysis conducted on the global IUCN Red List database 41 showed the possible presence of 57 critically endangered, 155 endangered and 285 vulnerable species near Eni's operational areas. The near-threatened and least concern species are 318 and 4,568, respectively. It should also be noted that there are 313 species listed as 'data deficient', so the information at the global level is inadequate for a direct or indirect assessment of the risk of extinction. Data-poor species are treated by Eni in the same way as intermediate risk categories because they have a high probability of being endangered species, given the lack of adequate data to assess the risk of extinction.\n\n(35) Specifically, in 2022, 4% of the hazardous waste resulting from production activities disposed of by Eni was recovered/recycled, 1% was subjected to chemical/physical/ biological treatment, 6% was incinerated, 1% was disposed of in landfill, while the remaining 88% was sent to other types of disposal (including transfer to temporary storage plants prior to final disposal). With regard to non-hazardous waste resulting from production activities, 16% was recovered/recycled, 3% was incinerated, 6% was disposed of in landfill, while the remaining 75% was sent to other types of disposal (including transfer to temporary storage plants prior to final disposal and incineration of small quantity). (36) Protected Areas and KBAs (Key Biodiversity Areas). KBAs are sites that contribute significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, on land, in freshwater or in the seas. These are identified through national processes by local stakeholders using a set of globally agreed scientific criteria. The KBAs analysed consist of two subsets: 1) Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas 2) Alliance for Zero Extinction Sites. The sources used for the census of protected areas and KBAs are the 'World Database on Protected Areas' and the 'World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas'.",

This commitment, based on the dignity of each human being and on  the  responsibility  of  the  Company  to  contribute  to  the well-being of individuals and communities in the Countries in which it operates, is set out in the Eni's Statement on Respect for Human Rights approved in December 2018 by the BoD. The document highlights the priority areas on which this commitment is focused and on which Eni exercises indepth due diligence, according to an approach developed in line with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) 42 and  the  OECD  Guidelines  for Multinational  Enterprises 43 . These  aspects  are  described within a dedicated report, Eni for Human Rights 44 , published annually  since  2019,  which  provides  a  full  representation of the management model adopted by Eni on the issue and the activities carried out in recent years, using the UNGP Reporting Framework to report commitments and results. In 2022, the Sustainability and Scenarios Committee, which makes proposals and acts as consultants for the BoD on ESG and Human Rights, investigated the activities for the year, including the risk-based management model adopted by Eni and the Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement approved by  the  BoD  in  April  2022.  Again  this  year,  Eni  continued\n\n- (42) UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs).\n- (43) OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.\n- (44) See: https://www.eni.com/assets/documents/eng/just-transition/2021/eni-for-human-rights-2021.pdf\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe process of awarding management incentives linked to human  rights  performance,  assigning  specific  objectives to  all  managers  reporting  directly  to  the  CEO  and  other management levels, based on the role.\n\nWith  regard  to  training,  following  on  with  the  multipleawareness programme launched in 2016, in 2022 specific e-learning  courses  were  provided  to  the  functions  most involved, in order to create a common and shared language and  culture  throughout  the  Company  and  to  improve  the understanding of the possible impacts of the business on human  rights,  including  in-depth  discussions  on  topics  of interest  on  the  individual  activities/professional  families. Eni's commitment, the management model and the activities carried out on human rights focus on the issues considered most  significant  for  the  company  -  as  also  requested  by the  UNGP  -  in  light  of  the  business  activities  conducted and  the  contexts  in  which  the  Company  operates.  These 'Salient human rights issues' are identified by Eni, grouped into 4 categories: human rights (i) in the workplace; (ii) in the communities hosting Eni activities; (iii) in business relations (with  suppliers,  contractors  and  other  business  partners); and (iv) in security services. In 2020, a 'risk-based' evaluation model  for  protecting human  rights  at  the  workplace has been issued with the aim of segmenting Eni companies on the  basis  of  quantitative  and  qualitative  parameters  that",

During 2022, the application of the model in the upstream business subsidiaries already monitored in 2021 was  expanded,  and  an  initial  application  in  the  Energy Evolution area was performed. Eni is committed to preventing possible negative impacts on the human rights of individuals and host communities resulting from the implementation of industrial projects. To this end, in 2018, Eni adopted a riskbased model (updated in 2021) that uses elements related to the operating context, such as risk indexes of the data provider  Verisk  Maplecroft,  and  project  characteristics,  in order to classify upstream business projects according to potential  human  rights  risks  and  to  identify  appropriate management measures. Higher-risk projects are specifically investigated through a 'Human Rights Impact Assessment' (HRIA) or a 'Human Rights Risk Analysis' (HRRA) to identify measures to prevent potential impacts on human rights and manage the existing ones. In 2022, these in-depth studies were  conducted  for  agri-feedstock  development  projects initiated in Kenya and Congo 45 , identifying recommendations to mitigate potential negative impact. They were translated into Action Plans to be implemented in 2023. Over the year, follow-ups were carried out for the Action plans on the 2021 assessment: in Cabinda Province in Angola; on Block 47 in Oman; on the Dumre block in Albania; and on Area C of the Sharjah  Emirate  (UAE).  All  HRIA  reports  conducted  up  to 2020  and  the  related  Action  Plans  adopted,  including  the periodic reports on the progress of the Plans, are publicly available on the Eni 46 website.  In  some  Countries,  such  as Australia and Alaska, Eni operates in areas where indigenous peoples are present, towards which it has adopted specific policies to protect their rights, culture and traditions and to promote their free, prior and informed consultation. The most recent of these Policies, referring to the indigenous peoples in  Alaska 47 affected  by  the  business  activities  carried  out by the Eni US Operating company in the area, was adopted in 2020 and renewed in 2021. No violations of the rights of these populations were detected during the year 48 .\n\nRespect for human rights in the supply chain is an essential requirement for Eni, protected through a procurement process that calls for adopting an assessment model dedicated to\n\n- (45) https://www.eni.com/en-IT/sustainable-mobility/biofuels-vegetable-oils.html\n- (46) https://eni.com/en-IT/just-transition/respect-for-human-rights.html\n- (47) See: https://www.eni.com/assets/documents/Indigenous%20Peoples%20Policy%201DEC2020\\_final.pdf\n- (48) Regarding the Countries mentioned above, no reports emerged through local grievance mechanisms on human rights issues during the year.\n- (49) Based on vulnerabilities and probabilities related to specific conditions such as the level of training and skills needed, the level of labour intensity, the use of manpower agencies, HSE risks. Industrial activities (such as maintenance, construction, assembly, logistics) and  general goods and services (such as cleaning services, catering, security services and property management) have been classified as high-risk activities.\n- (50) In accordance with the English Modern Slavery Act 2015 and, from this year, the Australian Commonwealth Modern Slavery Act 2018.\n- (51) Compliance with the US SEC regulations.\n\nhuman rights, as well as transparent, impartial, consistent and non-discriminatory conduct in the selection of suppliers, the  evaluation  of  bids  and  the  verification  of  contractual activities (see chapter 'Suppliers').\n\nTo set off and reinforce their commitment to fundamental values,  in  particular  to  respect  human  rights,  companies working  with  Eni  are  called  upon  to  sign  the  'Supplier Code  of  Conduct',  a  pact  that  guides  and  characterises relations  with  suppliers  at  all  stages  of  the  procurement process  (from  candidature  to  qualification,  purchasing procedures to the execution phase) based on the principles of social responsibility, including human rights. Human rights assessment  and  monitoring  are  applied  in  procurement processes through a risk-based model. This model allows the analysis and classification of suppliers according to a level of potential risks according to the Country context and the activities 49 carried out. To reinforce the management on the topic and especially on the risks related to forced/compulsory labour and the right to freedom of association and collective bargaining, in 2022, the application of the risk-based model was  extended  to  13  additional  foreign  companies,  for  a total  of  24.  It  allowed  the  identification  of  Nigeria,  Congo and Mozambique as Countries with the highest number of suppliers at risk. In addition to the activities such as due diligence,  tender  evaluation,  performance  feedback  and updates  with  dedicated  questionnaires,  in  line  with  the SA8000 international standards, the risk-based model calls for carrying out audits on suppliers to monitor the respect for human rights. In 2022, more than 350 in-depth document and field audits were carried out on direct and indirect suppliers. To promote knowledge of human rights safeguards, remote training  programmes  and  workshops  were  organised  for colleagues in the Vendor Management functions of foreign subsidiaries. Further actions to counteract forms of modern slavery and human trafficking and to prevent the exploitation of minerals associated with human rights violations in the supply chain are discussed respectively in the 'Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement' 50 and the 'Position on Conflict Minerals' 51 . The  Position  on  Conflict  Minerals  describes the  policies  and  systems  for  the  procurement  of  'conflict minerals' (tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold) by Eni, with the aim of minimising the risk that the procurement of these minerals may contribute to financing, directly or indirectly, human rights violations in the Countries concerned.\n\nEni  manages  its security  operations in  accordance  with international  principles,  including  the  Voluntary  Principles on  Security  &  Human  Rights  promoted  by  the  Voluntary",

        "page_content": "Principles Initiative (VPI), a multistakeholder initiative that combines  major  energy  companies  in  the  protection  and promotion of Human Rights.\n\nAfter  Eni  obtained  admission  as  an  'Engaged  Corporate Participant' in 2020, VPI officially communicated on December 8, 2022 that the company acquired the status of 'Full Member' of the Voluntary Principles Initiative thanks to the demonstration of its commitment to the promotion and awareness of Human Rights by all the functions involved. Among the most significant activities in 2022 was the application of the Conflict Analysis Tool in Nigeria, a project proposed and developed by VPI to analyse the causes of conflict in a given area/Country, starting from the identification  of  those  causes  that  contribute  most to escalate the conflict, and then trying to identify possible actions by the company that could have the mitigating effects on the conflict's causes. The application of this tool has led to more than local 30 interviews being conducted. These analysed the causes of the Nigerian conflict and an Action Plan was prepared containing the relative mitigation actions, involving several operational sites in the Country. Finally, in line with the principles of 'responsible contracting' suggested by the best practices and international guidelines on Business & Human Rights, Eni has prepared a series of standard clauses on human rights compliance to be included on the basis of a risk-based approach  in  the  main  Eni  contractual  cases,  and  provides support to the business for their definition and negotiation.\n\n## Performance metrics and comments\n\nIn 2022, the three-year training cycle was completed that began  in  2020  regarding  mandatory  training  for  senior managers and middle managers (Italy and abroad) of the 4 specific modules: 'Security and Human Rights', 'Human Rights and relations with Communities', 'Human Rights in the Workplace' and 'Human rights in the Supply Chain'. The delivery of the other courses offered on sustainability and human rights issues to the entire Eni population continued. The  overall  course  utilisation  rate  stood  at  89%  of  those enrolled.  The  delivery  of  the  specialised  Human  Rights courses to the target population identified in the plan was\n\nalso completed, and the basic Business & Human Rights course was delivered to new recruits.\n\nAwareness-raising  and  training  activities on  combating violence and harassment at work were launched in 2022, as envisaged in the specific policy issued at the end of 2021 to respond in advance to the provisions of International Labour Organisation Convention No. 190. The percentage of personnel from the Security professional area who have been trained on human rights reached 93%: this number reflects the qualitative/ quantitative turnover of incoming and outgoing resources from the  Professional  Area  year  on  year.  In  addition,  since  2009 Eni has been conducting a training programme for public and private security forces at its subsidiaries, which was recognized as a best practice in the 2013 joint publication by the Global Compact and the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) of  the  United  Nations.  In  this  regard,  a  Security  Workshop  & Human Rights was held from 9 to 11 November 2022, at the subsidiaries  NAOC  (Nigerian  Agip  Oil  Company  ltd)  and  NAE (Nigerian Agip Exploration) in Port Harcourt. The workshop was conducted  by  an  independent  consultancy  firm  specialised in security management and human rights protection in the international  arena  were  engaged  409  participants  were engaged  from  the  Nigerian  armed  forces,  private  security forces as well as NAOC and NAE. This Workshop represented the 21 st edition of the training initiative that has so far involved 15 Countries. With regard to whistleblowing reports, in 2022 investigations  were  completed  on  77  files 52 , of  which  45 included  human  rights  issues,  mainly  concerning  potential impacts on workers' rights and occupational health and safety. Among these, 62 assertions were verified; for 12 of these, the reported  facts  were  confirmed,  even  partially,  and  corrective actions were taken to mitigate and/or minimise their impacts. In particular, the following were undertaken: (i) actions on the Internal  Control  and  Risk  Management  System,  relating  to the  implementation  and  strengthening  of  controls  in  place; (ii)  training on the topics of the Code of Ethics and the 'Zero Tolerance' policy and (iii) actions against employees, including disciplinary measures, in line with the collective agreements and other applicable national laws. At the end of the year, 16 files were still open, 5 of which referred to human rights issues, mainly concerning potential impacts on workers' rights.\n\n(52) Whistleblowing report: a summary document of the investigations carried out on the report(s) (which may contain one or more detailed and verifiable assertions) in which the summary of the investigation carried out on the facts that are the subject of the report, the outcome of the investigations carried out and any action plans identified are reported. In particular, Eni, since 2006, has had regulations governing the process of receiving, analyzing and processing reports (so-called whistleblowing) transmitted, even in confidential or anonymous form, to Eni SpA and its subsidiaries in Italy and abroad to enable anyone, employees and third parties, to report facts pertaining to the SCIGR as well as concerning conduct in violation of the Code of Ethics, laws, regulations, provisions of the Authorities, internal regulations, in any case likely to cause damage or harm, even if only reputational, to Eni. As indicated in the regulations (published on the company's website) that define roles and responsibilities related to investigative activities and information flows, all Whistleblowing Reports are submitted to, among others, the Board of Statutory Auditors as Audit Committee for the purposes of the SOA regulations (Sarbanes - Oxley Act of 2002), the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chief Executive Officer and the Independent Auditors.",

        "page_content": "## Suppliers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEni  has  developed  a  procurement  model  that  considers  the ESG  characteristics  of  suppliers  in  all  its  phases,  from  the selection and qualification of vendors to tender process, from the contractual management to feedback management, with the aim of promoting the generation of shared and lasting value to the supply chain. Eni meets this commitment by promoting its own values with its suppliers, involving them in development initiatives and including them in risk prevention activities. In particular, as part of the Sustainable Procurement process, Eni: (i) periodically subjects all suppliers to qualification and due diligence processes to verify their ethical, reputational, economic-financial, technicaloperational reliability and the application of supervision in the areas of health, safety, environment, governance, cyber security and protection of human rights, to minimise the risks along the supply chain; (ii) requires all suppliers to sign the Supplier Code of  Conduct  as  a  mutual  commitment  to  recognise  and  protect the value of all people, to commit to tackling climate change and its effects, to operate with integrity, protect company resources, promoting the adoption of these principles to their people and their  supply  chain;  (iii)  considers  ESG  characteristics 53 in  the logic of contract awarding, relevant to the scope of the contract and periodically monitors the respect for the commitments the supplier assumes in the various steps of the Procurement process; (iv)  if  the  assessments  expose  critical  issues,  requests  the implementation of corrective actions or, if the minimum standards are not met where provided, limits or prohibits the suppliers from participating in the tender processes. To promote the sustainable supply chain development, in 2022, Eni further strengthened its Sustainable  Supply  Chain  programme  with  initiatives  aimed  at involving suppliers in the fair and sustainable energy transition path,  enhancing  the  aspects  of  environmental  protection, economic  development  and  social  growth.  The  Sustainable Supply Chain Programme focused on: (i) Involving companies in the sustainable development path. In 2022, the systemic path was strengthened through the ever-widening dissemination of the platform powered by Eni, Open-es, a tool to involve and support all companies along the path of measurement and growth on the dimensions of sustainability. Thanks to the open and inclusive approach of the initiative and the adhesion of various actors (supply  chain  leaders,  financial  institutions,  associations,  etc.) and sectors in the value chain, Open-es counts more than 10,000 companies, and about 3,600 of these are in the Eni supply chain. This platform allows companies to create and update their ESG profile,  share  sustainability  information  with  clients  and  other stakeholders, access sector benchmarks to compare themselves with similar entities and identify priority actions to implement in order to improve their ESG profile.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor Eni's Procurement Process, the suppliers' participation in this initiative is an essential requirement for evaluating and enhancing the commitment made by each of the suppliers along a path of sustainable development, with the aim of involving the entire supply chain. To further support the improvement of the companies' ESG performance,  in  2022  an  analysis  on  Open-es's  data  of  2,600 Italian companies was carried out to identify key gaps and areas of strength while defining priorities and actions to be taken in order to be a competitive and sustainable company. As part of the initiative, companies can also participate in 'Open-es ESG Competencies', a series of free events to increase the knowledge of their employees on ESG topics. This creates an opportunity to meet experts on specific aspects (Carbon Neutrality, Social Sustainability and Governance, Diversity  &  Inclusion,  Responsible  Vendor  Management,  and Human Rights); (ii) Supplier Training. In addition to the Open-es training initiatives, open to all companies, Eni organised sectorspecific workshops on ESG topics and webinars on digital themes and cyber security; (iii) Financial support to suppliers. In 2022, as part of the 'Sustainable Energy - Basket Bond' initiative, launched in  2021 to financially support energy supply chains in the energy transition and promote the implementation of sustainable business models, \u20ac23 million in minibonds were financed; (iv) Sustainability criteria and rewarding mechanisms. To enhance the commitment and encourage the adoption of best practices by suppliers during the  procurement  process,  sustainability  criteria  and  rewarding mechanisms are applied in the evaluation of bids for a total amount of over \u20ac4.5 billion of awarded contract value.\n\n## Performance metrics and comments\n\nDuring  2022,  6,622  suppliers 54 were  subject  to  checks  and assessments  with  reference  to  environmental  and  social sustainability  aspects  (including  health,  safety,  environment, human rights, anti-corruption and compliance). Potential critical issues and/or areas for improvement were identified for 10% (659) of the suppliers audited, an increase compared to 2021. The critical issues mainly refer to gaps in compliance with health and safety regulations and the principles established by the Code of Conduct and the Code of Ethics. In the same way, there was an increase in the number of suppliers with whom relations were interrupted (54), due to negative evaluation during the qualification phase or due to suspension or revocation of the qualification.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that, during 2022, an influence on price and logistical criticalities  have been noticed due to the macroeconomic  dynamics  but  without  any  impact  on  the continuity of procurement.\n\n(53) Tender procedures have introduced rewarding requirements such as energy efficiency, use of energy produced from renewable sources, sustainability certifications, vehicle fleet, use of recycled material, disposal methods, gender equality on teams, maintenance of the employment level, etc. (54) It also includes all new suppliers.",

Moreover, since 2009, Eni has designed  and  developed  the Anti-Corruption Compliance Program , in compliance with the applicable provisions in force and international conventions and taking into account guidance and best practices, as well as the policies adopted by leading international organizations. It is an organic system of rules and controls to prevent corrupt practices, and is also instrumental to the prevention of the phenomenon of money laundering in the  context  of  the  non-financial  activities  of  Eni  SpA  and  its subsidiaries. At regulatory level, the Anti-Corruption Compliance Program  is  represented  by  the  Anti-Corruption  MSG 55 and  by regulatory instruments that constitute the reference framework in the identification of the activities at risk and the control tools that Eni makes available to its people to prevent and counter the risk of corruption and money laundering. In Italy and abroad, each subsidiary company where Eni holds a non-controlling interest are encouraged to comply with the standards set forth in internal anticorruption regulations by adopting and maintaining an adequate internal control system consistent with the legal requirements through  a  resolution  of  their  Board  of  Directors 56 .  Eni's  AntiCorruption Compliance Program has evolved over the years with the aim of continuous improvement; in January 2017, Eni SpA was  the  first  Italian  Company  to  achieve  the  ISO  37001:2016 'Anti-bribery  Management  Systems'  certification.  To  maintain this  certification,  Eni  underwent  a  recertification  audit  in  2022, which concluded with a positive outcome. In addition, in order to guarantee  the  effectiveness  of  the  Anti-Corruption  Compliance Program,  Eni  supports  its  subsidiaries  in  Italy  and  abroad, providing specialized assistance in the activity of assessing the reliability of potential counterparties at risk ('due diligence'), the management of any critical issues/red flags that emerge and the development of the related contractual safeguards.\n\nIn particular, specific Business Integrity clauses (Code of Ethics, corporate administrative liability, anti-corruption and anti-money\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nlaundering) are included in contracts with counterparties, which also provide for a commitment to view and abide by the principles contained in Eni's Code of Ethics, Model 231, and Anti-Corruption MSG.\n\nIn the qualification process of potential suppliers (see the section on Suppliers), the ethical and reputational profile is assessed, as well as the adoption by them of an Anti-Corruption Compliance Program for cases with a higher risk of corruption. In any case, business integrity clauses are defined in the relevant contracts, including contractual remedies in the event of breaches of anticorruption compliance obligations and audit rights by Eni for the highest-risk cases. In addition, the subcontractor is also subject to prior checks for ethical and reputational reliability and must only operate based on a written contract that contains compliance commitments equivalent to those of the main supplier. Eni has defined and implemented a structured process of Compliance risk assessment and monitoring aimed respectively at: (i) identifying, assessing and tracking the risks of corruption in the context of its  business activities and for the definition and updating of the control measures provided for in the Anti-Corruption Regulatory instruments; (ii) periodically analysing the trend of the corruption risks identified, through specific controls and the analysis of risk indicators  aimed  at  ensuring  compliance  with  the  regulatory requirements and the effectiveness of the models placed under their  control.  The  activities  at  risk  identified  by  Eni  through the  Compliance  risk  assessment,  due  to  its  operational  and organizational context, include, for example: (i) contracts with third parties at Risk of corruption and money laundering (such as, for example, business associates, joint venture partners, brokers, counterparties in real estate management operations, commercial network  operators,  suppliers,  credit  buyers/assignees,  etc.); (ii) transactions for the purchase and sale of company shares, companies and company branches, mining rights and securities, etc.  and  joint  venture  contracts;  (iii)  non-profit  initiatives,  social projects and sponsorships; (iv) the sale of goods and services (e.g.  contracts  with  customers  in  the  commercial  process), trading and/or shipping operations; (v) the selection, recruitment\n\n(55) The latest version of the Anti-Corruption MSG (which updates and replaces the previous version of 2014) was (i) illustrated and submitted to the Eni SpA Control and Risk Committee for prior opinion and for information to the Board of Statutory Auditors and the Eni SpA Watch Structure; (ii) approved by the Eni SpA Board of Directors on June 24, 2021. The Anti-Corruption MSG was published on July 19, 2021 and is available on the website www.eni.com. (56) Or alternatively, with resolution by the equivalent body depending on the governance of the subsidiary.",

Compliance risk assessment activities and anti-corruption Compliance Monitoring interventions are planned annually according to a risk-based approach. In 2022, the former covered the Anti-Corruption area as a whole and the risk activity 'Sale of Goods and Services' and the latter focused on the 'Joint Ventures' and 'Third Parties' and 'Gifts and Hospitality' risk activities. Both activities' outcomes confirmed the expected risk level and the adequacy of the mitigation measures put in\n\nplace and the effectiveness of the compliance model adopted. Eni also implements an Anti-Corruption training programm aimed at  all  its  employees  (including  part-time  employees)  through e-learning and in-classroom events divided into general workshops and  job-specific  training.  This  optimises  the  identification  of recipients through a systematic segmentation methodology as a function of the corruption risk associated with certain drivers, such as Country, qualification and professional area. In 2022, the new online course 'Code of Ethics, Anti-Corruption and Corporate Administrative Liability' was delivered to the whole of Eni, in Italy and abroad, and the e-learning on the Anti-Corruption Compliance Program for medium- and high-risk personnel was updated to be delivered in 2023.\n\nIn addition, classroom presentations discussing practical cases were held as part of the training course dedicated to the Managing Directors at Eni's subsidiaries and investee companies in Italy and abroad, focusing on compliance and risk mitigation issues. For its third parties, Eni (i) held a webinar aimed at some highrisk suppliers; and (ii) trained employees of the corporate jointventure Isatay Operating Company llp in Kazakhstan. The relevant activities  in  the  Anti-Corruption  Compliance  Program  and  the planning of such activities for the subsequent periods are the subject of an annual report that is an integral part of the Integrated Compliance Report to the Eni SpA management and supervisory bodies. During 2022, the following were brought to the attention of the Board of Directors: (i) the revision of the 'Antitrust' MSG to  implement  the  changes  made  to  the  Integrated  Compliance process and ensure even greater alignment with the guidelines issued by the Italian Antitrust Authority and (ii) the approval of the 'Compliance Models on Company Administrative Responsibility for Eni's Italian Subsidiaries' MSG, to reorganise the company regulatory system on corporate administrative responsibility for subsidiaries.\n\nPeriodic information and training activities for Eni employees are performed through the preparation of short information briefs on compliance, including any anti-corruption issues. Eni's experience in  grows  through  participation  in  international  conventions, events  and  working  groups,  including  the  Partnering  Against Corruption  Initiative  (PACI)  of  the  World  Economic  Forum,  the O&G ABC Compliance Attorney Group (a discussion group on anticorruption issues in the Oil & Gas sector) and, in 2021 and 2022, the of the B20 Italy and B20 Indonesia Taskforce on Integrity and\n\nCompliance. As part of the audit plan approved annually by the BoD, Eni carries out specific checks to verify the fulfilment of the Compliance Program's provisions through dedicated audits and analyses  of  processes  and  companies,  identified  according  to the relevant Country's Risk level and the related size of business, as  well  as  through  checks  on  high-risk  third  parties,  where contractually foreseen. Moreover, since 2006 Eni has issued an internal procedure, updated over time and most recently in 2020, aligned with national and international best practices as well as with the Italian Law (L. 179/2017), in order to manage the process of  receiving,  analysing  and  processing  whistleblowing  reports received,  even  in  confidential  or  anonymous  form,  by  Eni  SpA and its subsidiaries in Italy and abroad. This regulation allows employees and third parties to report facts pertaining to the Internal Control and Risk Management System that concern behaviours in violation of the Code of Ethics, any laws, regulations, provisions of authorities, internal regulations, 231 Model or compliance models for foreign subsidiaries that may cause damage or prejudice to Eni, even if only to its public image. In this regard, dedicated and easily accessible information channels have been set up and are available on eni.com.\n\nEni's tax  strategy , which has been approved by the Board of Directors and is available on the Company's website 57 , is based on the principles of transparency, honesty, fairness and good faith set forth in its Code of Ethics and in the 'OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises' 58 and has as its primary objective the  payment  of  taxes  in  the  various  Countries  in  which  it operates,  in  the  knowledge  that  it  can  contribute  significantly to  tax  revenues  in  those  Countries,  supporting  local  economic and  social  development.  Eni  has  designed  and  implemented a  Tax  Control  Framework  for  which  Eni's  CFO  is  responsible, structured in a three-step business process: (i) assessment of tax  risk  (Risk  Assessment);  (ii)  identification  and  establishment of controls to monitor risks; (iii) verification of the effectiveness of controls and related information flows (Reporting). As part of its tax and litigation activities risk management, Eni adopts prior communication with the tax authorities and maintains relations based on transparency, dialogue and cooperation, participating, where  appropriate,  in  projects  of  enhanced  cooperation  (Cooperative Compliance).\n\nTrue  to  the  commitment  to  better  governance  and  greater transparency in the extraction sector, which is crucial to foster responsible use of resources and prevent corruption, Eni takes part in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) since 2005. In this context, Eni actively participates both at local level, through the Multi-Stakeholder Groups in the member Countries, and in the Board's initiatives at international level. In accordance with Italian Law No. 208/2015, Eni prepares the 'Country-by-Country Report' required by Action 13 of the 'Base erosion and profit shifting - BEPS' project, promoted by the OECD with the sponsorship of the G-20, whose objective",

With a view to fostering fiscal transparency for the benefit of all interested stakeholders, this report is published voluntarily by  Eni,  although  there  are  no  regulatory  obligations  in  this regard 59 . The publication of this report has been recognized as best practice by the EITI 60 . Also in line with its support for the EITI, Eni has published a position on contract transparency in  which  governments  are  encouraged  to  comply  with  the new requirement on contracts publication and it is expressed the  support  to  the  mechanisms  and  initiatives  that  will  be launched by Countries to promote transparency in this area. Finally, anticipating by two years the reporting requirements on  transparency  of  payments  to  States  in  the  exercise  of extraction activities introduced by the EU Directive 2013/34 EU (Accounting Directive), Eni had begun in 2015 to provide disclosure on a voluntary basis of a series of summary data on cash flows paid to States in which it conducts hydrocarbon exploration and production activities.\n\n## Performance metrics and comments\n\nIn 2022 the anti-corruption checks, based on the Anti-Corruption Compliance  Program's  provisions,  have  been  performed  in  25 audits,  carried  out  in  10  Countries,  moreover  19  supervisory activities were carried out on the 231/Compliance Models of the Italian/foreign subsidiaries. As in 2021, this year the number of ascertained cases of corruption 61 relating to Eni SpA amounted to 0. Consequently, there were no terminations for this reason.\n\nFor the proceedings in progress and for all the significant cases of non-conformity to laws and regulations, see the section 'Legal Disputes'  on  page  322.  In  particular,  in  2022,  there  were  no\n\ncases  in  which  Eni  SpA  was  identified  as  a  participant 62 in the area of anti-competitive conduct, antitrust legislation violations and  monopolistic  practices.  In  2022,  anti-corruption  training in  e-learning  mode  was  delivered  through  the  new  course 'Code  of  Ethics,  Anti-Corruption  and  Corporate  Administrative Liability', aimed at the entire Eni workforce in Italy and abroad (about 28,000 employees trained). Approximately 93% of the Eni population attended at least one anti-corruption course during the year. In addition, in 2022, the anti-corruption training continued through  general  workshops  and  specific  job  training  according to the risk-based methodology started in 2019. Regarding the commitment with EITI, Eni follows the activities conducted at international level and contributes to preparation of the Reports in member Countries; additionally, as a member, Eni takes part in the activities of the Multi Stakeholder Groups in Congo, Ghana, Timor Est, and the United Kingdom. In Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Mexico, Mozambique and Nigeria , Eni's subsidiaries participate in local EITI Multi Stakeholder Groups through the industry associations present in the Countries.\n\nIn 2022, Eni generated an economic value of \u20ac134 billion of which \u20ac120 billion was distributed, in particular: 85% are operating costs, 7% payments to the Public Administration, 5% payments to capital suppliers, and 3% wages and salaries for employees. In 2022, the  Eni  Group  received  approximately  \u20ac370  million  in  financial assistance from the Public Administration. This amount includes about \u20ac200 million in tax credits recognised in Italy for energy and  gas  -  consuming  companies  established  by  Decree-Laws No. 4 of 27 January 27, No. 17 of March 1 st , 2022, No. 21 of March 21, 2022, as amended, to meet the higher expenses incurred for the purchase of natural gas and electricity.\n\nOver the year, investments net of depreciation amounted to \u20ac6,916 million, and the total to share buy-backs and dividend payments amounted to \u20ac5,469 million. \u20ac8,488 million in taxes were paid during the year.\n\n(59) For more details please see the most recent edition of the Country-by-Country Report:\n\nhttps://www.eni.com/assets/documents/eng/reports/2021/Country-by-Country-2021-ENG.pdf\n\n(60) EITI pointed out Eni and Shell as the pioneering companies among the leading Oil & Gas companies in the Country-by-Country report (for information, see:\n\nhttps://eiti.org/news/ extractives-companies-champion-tax-transparency).\n\n(61) There have been past convictions on the merits of an act of corruption relating to criminal proceedings for domestic and/or international corruption.\n\n(62) The above information refers to possible violations of Articles 2 or 3 of Law No. 287/1990, Articles 101 or 102 TFEU, or similar regulations to protect competition in other Countries.

This approach is part of the Company's decarbonization strategy. It  encompasses  crucial  topics  as:  'Just  Transition',  which increasingly considers the impact of energy transformation on people, starting with direct and indirect workers, and includes communities  and  consumers;  the  promotion  and  respect  of human rights through a model of responsible management in the key business processes now consolidated; strategies to counter the effects caused by climate change, improving adaptability and resilience; and population growth and migration flows, which are also partly a consequence of climate change. The approach is integrated throughout the business cycle by analysing the human  rights  situation  and  socio-economic  context,  and impact and compensation measures, as well as by assessing local  content,  promoting  local  development  and  stakeholder engagement.  Specifically, local development  programmes promote  a  broad  portfolio  of  community-based  initiatives in  line  with  national  development  plans  and  the  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including supporting the creation of job opportunities and the transfer of know-how and skills to local partners. An essential element to achieving the common objectives  are  alliances  for  sustainable  development  with  all the  players  involved  -  from  private  individuals,  to  the  public sector, international organisations, civil society associations and research institutes - which make it possible to pool resources and human capital to promote inclusive growth. Starting from the analysis of the local socio-economic context, realized on the basis of the Multidimensional Poverty Index (PMI) developed by UNDP and Oxford University, which accompanies the various business project phases in order to ensure greater efficiency and systematicity in the decision-making approach, from the time of license acquisition to decommissioning, Eni adopts tools and methodologies consistent with the main international standards to meet the needs of local populations. These instruments allow, on the one hand, to promote local development and, on the other hand, to reduce possible negative economic impacts (direct and indirect) of new business development activities.\n\nTo this end, Eni always produces an Environmental, Social and Health  Impact  Assessment  (ESHIA)  beyond  the  mandatory\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrequirements for environmental authorisations in the Countries where it is present. This guarantees the adherence of activities to the highest international standards and provides for actions to avoid or minimise the socio-economic impact of activities to a level deemed acceptable. Impact studies are shared with local communities 63 ; moreover, thanks to a mapping of local stakeholders affected by the activities, Eni proactively informs civil  society  and  minority  interest  organisations  about  the possibility of contributing to impact assessments. In addition, through tools such as the Eni Local Content Evaluation (ELCE) and Eni Impact Tool 64 , it is possible to valorise the direct, indirect and induced benefits Eni generates through its business operations and cooperation model. In addition, analyses are carried out to measure the percentage of spending on local suppliers by some relevant  foreign  subsidiaries.  In  2022,  the  rate  amounted  to about 45% of total expenditures. In addition to these activities are the definitions of the specific Local Development Programmes (LDPs) in line with the United Nations 2030 Agenda, the National Development Plans, the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and the commitments under the Paris Agreement (Nationally Determined Contributions -  NDCs),  that  include  five  lines  of  action:  (i)  contribution  to the  socio-economic  development  of  local  communities,  in accordance  with  national  legislation  and  development  plans, also  based  on  the  knowledge  acquired.  These  initiatives  are aimed at improving access to off-grid energy and clean cooking, economic diversification (e.g. agricultural projects, micro-credit, infrastructure  interventions)  and  land  protection,  education and vocational training, access to water and sanitation, proper nutrition and support of health services and systems, as well as improving the health of vulnerable groups. Relevant projects are developed using the Logical Framework Approach (LFA) and are monitored using the Monitoring, Evaluation and Learning (MEL) management tool; (ii) Local Content: generation of added value by transferring skills and know-how, initiating labour along the local supply chain and implementing development projects; (iii) Land  management:  optimal  land  management  starting  from the assessment of the impacts deriving from the acquisition of land on which Eni's activities are carried out in order to find possible alternatives and mitigation measures; Eni undertakes to  evaluate  possible  project  alternatives  with  the  aim  of pursuing the well-being of local communities; (iv) Stakeholder engagement: the Company's ability to relate to stakeholders and\n\n(64) The ELCE (Eni Local Content Evaluation) Model was developed by Eni and validated by the Polytechnic of Milan to assess the direct, indirect and induced effects generated by Eni's activities at a local level in the areas in which it operates. Eni's Impact Tool is a methodology developed by Eni and validated by Polytechnic of Milan that allows assessing the social, economic and environmental impacts of its activities at local level, quantifying the generated benefits and directing investment choices for future initiatives.",

The  definition  of  Local  Development Programmes implies the commitment of Eni in the front line on site and alongside other development players to contribute to the sustainable development of Countries.\n\nThe partnerships developed by Eni with International Organizations  and  -  more  generally  -  with  organizations promoting  cooperation  for  the  development  move  in  this direction. Examples of this are the agreements signed in 2022 with a few prominent national and international actors such as  the  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) in Mexico to reduce hydrogeological risk in the Tabasco region and to protect cultural heritage; the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) to launch the  Oyo  Renewable  Energy  Research  Centre  in  Congo  and  to evaluate potential hydrogen initiatives; the Italian Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS), in Egypt and Kenya, to promote local community development; and the Stakeholder Alliance for Corporate Accountability (SACA) in Nigeria to promote initiatives for the respect of Human Rights.\n\nConcerning  health-related  initiatives,  agreements  were  signed with several Ministries of Health and local health authorities, e.g. in Mozambique and Egypt. A cooperation agreement was signed with  the  IRCCS  Centro  Cardiologico  Monzino  to  support  Azule Energy  Angola  implementing  the  cardiology  capacity  building project, and the project to protect the health of internal refugees in collaboration with Doctors with Africa CUAMM was completed. Collaborations with the private sector launched in 2022 include one  with  CNH  Industrial  and  IVECO  Group  for  economic diversification, education and vocational training starting in the Basilicata  region.  Employing  an  'internal  procedure',  Eni  has defined the guiding principles for designing and implementing the 'Grievance  Mechanism'  on  the  operational  level  at subsidiaries responsible for developing this process, analysing and agreeing on the solution with claimants, whether individuals or communities.\n\nIndeed,  knowledge  of  the  context,  including  the  cultural context, makes it possible to have processes with appropriate channels of access consistent with the context and to apply the  most  pertinent  modes  of  dialogue  and  management  for potential conflict. In particular, when designing the mechanism, subsidiaries may  conduct  dedicated consultations with local  communities,  especially  with  indigenous  peoples,  in\n\ncases  where  the  context  and/or  past  projects  suggest  a high number of grievances, or where the projects or activities involve  economic  or  physical  relocation  of  communities.  All subsidiaries' grievances received, analysed and managed are tracked in the company's 'Stakeholder Management System' (SMS) application. The application is a management tool for 'mapping' stakeholder relations, and monitoring the progress of projects and the results achieved. It allows them to be monitored at subsidiary and central levels from receipt to resolution, it enables  them  to  be  classified  by  theme  and  relevance,  and  it allows the percentage of resolved projects to be verified out of the total received in a given period. Other areas of investigation concern the timeliness of management, the trend analysis of associated issues to understand whether they are reiterated and their possible evolution towards a dispute. Companies may also request feedback from the claimants on their level of satisfaction with the operation of the process, asking them to point out any areas for improvement. Eni requires its suppliers, contractors and subcontractors to make their own Grievance Mechanism available  to  the  workers  and  communities  with  whom  they interact on behalf of Eni.\n\n## Performance metrics and comments\n\nIn 2022, investments for local development amounted to around \u20ac76.4 65 million (Eni share), about 93% of which were in the area of Upstream activities. In Africa, a total of \u20ac39.1 million was spent, of which \u20ac32.9 million in the Sub-Saharan area, mainly for the development and maintenance of infrastructure, particularly school  buildings.  In  Asia,  approximately  \u20ac26.0  million  was spent, mainly on economic diversification, in particular for the development and maintenance of infrastructure. In Italy, \u20ac6.5 million  was  spent.  Overall,  approximately  \u20ac31.3  million  was invested  in  infrastructure  development  activities,  of  which \u20ac17.2 million in Asia, \u20ac13.4 million in Africa, and \u20ac0.7 million in Central and South America. The main projects implemented in 2022 included initiatives to promote: (i) access to clean cooking in  Ivory  Coast,  Mozambique,  Ghana  and  Angola,  through awareness-raising campaigns and the distribution of improved cooking systems; in Kazakhstan, the energy-efficient upgrading of a school in the Turkestan region, carried out in partnership with  UNDP  (United  Nations  Development  Programme),  was completed; (ii) economic diversification in both the agricultural sector in Congo, Egypt, Nigeria and Angola, and support of local and youth entrepreneurship in Ghana, Egypt and Mozambique; in Mexico, training and education activities were carried out to support school programmes and initiatives aimed at improving the  social-economic  conditions  of  communities  with  fishing activity development programmes, and economic diversification activities were launched to create a favourable environment for the development and integration of young people; (iii) access",

Moreover, in continuity with its support to healthcare institutions and facilities for the COVID-19 emergency, in 2022, Eni carried out interventions to strengthen the health system in Italy, intending to contribute to the resilience of local facilities in facing the present and possible future pandemics, such as the Vittorio Emanuele Hospital in Gela, the S. Elia Hospital in  Caltanissetta,  the  Luigi  Sacco  Hospital  in  Milan,  and  the  S. Matteo Hospital in Pavia. In 2022, with the aim of assessing the potential impacts of the projects on the health of the communities involved, Eni completed 11 Health Impact Assessments (HIAs), of which two were preliminary integrated Environmental, Social and  Health  Impact  Assessments  (pre-ESHIA)  and  seven  were integrated  ESHIA  studies.  During  2022,  141  grievances 66 were received, 61 (equal to 43%) of which were resolved. The complaints mainly concerned: management of relations with the communities (most recurring category), management of environmental aspects, land  management,  employment  development,  and  economic diversification.\n\n| KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS   |             | 2022   | 2022                                   | 2021 2020   | 2021 2020   |\n|------------------------------|-------------|--------|----------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                              |             | Total  | of which fully  consolidated  entities | Total       | Total       |\n| Local development investment | (\u20ac million) | 76.4   | 74.3                                   | 105.3       | 96.1        |\n| of which: infrastructure     |             | 31.3   | 31.1                                   | 39.8        | 41.8        |",

Based  on  the  Regulation,  an  economic  activity  qualifies  as environmentally sustainable where that economic activity:\n\n- i) contributes substantially to one or more of the environmental objectives of the EU (set out in Article 9 of the Regulation);\n- ii) does  not  significantly  harm  any  of  the  environmental objectives;\n- iii)  is carried out in compliance with the minimum safeguards foreseen by the Regulation, which are procedures implemented by an undertaking that is carrying out an economic activity to  ensure  the  alignment  with  the  OECD  Guidelines  for Multinational Enterprises and the UN Guiding Principles on Business  and  Human  Rights,  including  the  principles  and rights set out in the eight fundamental conventions identified in the Declaration of the International Labour Organisation on  Fundamental  Principles  and  Rights  at  Work  and  the International Bill of Human Rights;\n- iv)  complies  with  technical  screening  criteria  that  have  been established by the Commission, which define the performance thresholds whereby an economic activity offers a substantial contribution to an environmental objective and at the same time  does  not  hurt  in  a  significant  way  any  of  the  other objectives.\n\nThe  Taxonomy  Regulation  has  established  six  environmental objectives:\n\n- a) climate change mitigation;\n- b) climate change adaptation;\n- c) the  sustainable  use  and  protection  of  water  and  marine resources;\n- d) the transition to a circular economy;\n- e) pollution prevention and control;\n- f) the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\n## IDENTIFICATION OF ENI'S ELIGIBLE AND TAXONOMY-ALIGNED ACTIVITIES\n\nThe  Taxonomy  Regulation  establishes  technical  screening criteria  'TSC'  for  environmental  sustainability  with  respect  to the  above-mentioned  six  environmental  objectives,  identifying several  economic  activities.  The  technical  screening  criteria ('TSC') for each of the above-mentioned environmental objectives are established by the Commission by means of delegated acts based on the power conferred by the Taxonomy Regulation and subject to the conditions laid down in the Regulation itself.\n\nSo far, criteria have been approved for activities contributing to the  first  two  objectives,  climate  change  mitigation  and  climate\n\nchange adaptation. Criteria for the four remaining objectives are expected to be adopted by the EU in 2023.\n\nAn activity is 'taxonomy-eligible' if it is described in a delegated act  adopted  under  the  Taxonomy  Regulation,  irrespective  of whether it complies with the technical screening criteria. Such an activity could potentially make a substantial contribution to a given environmental objective.\n\nAn activity is 'taxonomy-aligned' if it contributes substantially to one or more environmental objectives, does no significant harm 'DNSH' to any of the other objectives, is carried out in compliance with minimum human and labor rights safeguards, and complies with the relevant technical screening criteria.\n\nEni has assessed the economic activities performed by the Group against  the  economic  activities  qualifying  for  the  taxonomy's climate  mitigation  and  climate  adaptation  objectives,  which have been identified by Delegated Regulation EU 2021/2139 (the 'Climate Delegated Act') and the nuclear and gas-related activities listed in Delegated Regulation EU 2022/1214 (the 'Complementary Climate Delegated Act').\n\nThis  assessment  has  comprised  a  two-step  process:  first,  the Group economic activities have been screened to score those eligible in accordance with the above-mentioned delegated acts. Then, the technical screening criteria have been applied to verify alignment of each of the Group's eligible economic activities with the relevant TSC to verify the substantial contribution criteria and respect of the DNSH criteria. The assessment of compliance with the minimum safeguards provided by art. 3 'c' of the Regulation has been performed at Group level.\n\n## REPORTING OBLIGATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\n\nBased  on  article  8  of  the  Taxonomy  Regulation,  non-financial undertakings which are subject to the obligation to publish a consolidated non-financial statement pursuant to Article 19a or Article 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU of the European Parliament and  of  the  Council  are  required  to  comply  with  a  transparency regime by disclosing in their non-financial statements three key performance indicators (KPI) relating to the proportion of their turnover  derived  from  products  or  services  associated  with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable and the proportion of their capital expenditure and the proportion of  their  operating  expenditure  related  to  assets  or  processes associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable as per the Regulation. The Commission has adopted a  delegated  regulation  (2178/2021)  specifying  the  content  of KPIs and presentation of information concerning environmentally sustainable economic activities and the reporting methodology. Disclosures presented herein by Eni are intended to comply with that regulation.",

KPI related to turnover (turnover KPI)\n\nEni  Group's  consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards 'IFRS' as adopted by Commission Regulation (EC) 1126/2008. In compliance with that, the Group turnover and the turnover relating  to  Taxonomy-aligned  economic  activities  and  to Taxonomy-eligible  economic  activities  (not  TaxonomyAligned  activities)  have  been  recognised  pursuant  to\n\nInternational Accounting Standard (IAS) 1, paragraph 82 a). The 7.5% share of eligible and aligned turnover is calculated as the part of turnover derived from eligible or aligned economic activities (numerator) divided by total turnover (denominator). Eligible  and  aligned  economic  activities  are  described  under paragraph 1.2.2. The denominator comprises the Sales from operations (Revenue) line from the Consolidated Statement of Income.

The markto-market of cash flow hedges relating to a forecast transaction are taken to other comprehensive income.\n\nOther  commodity  derivatives  utilized  by  the  Group  to  manage exposure to the commodity risks, which lack the requirements to be recognized in accordance with the own use exemption or to be qualified as hedges in accordance with IFRS, are marked to market\n\nwith gains or losses recognized through profit and loss in a separate line item from revenues. Such line item comprises the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges.\n\n## 1.1.2. KPI  related  to  capital  expenditure  (CapEx) (CapEx KPI)\n\nCapital expenditure 'CapEx' of the Eni Group and the 'CapEx' relating to eligible economic activities and to aligned economic activities cover costs that are accounted based on:\n\n- (a) IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment, paragraphs 73, e), point i) and point iii);\n- (b) IAS 38 Intangible Assets, paragraph 118, e), point i);\n- (c ) IFRS 16 Leases, paragraph 53, point h).\n\nCapEx also covers additions to tangible and intangible assets resulting from business combinations.\n\nThe Group does not engage in economic activities that are recognized in accordance with IAS 40 and IAS 41.",

Accounting policy\n\nEconomic and financial data relating to Eni's eligible and aligned economic  activities  for  calculating  the  Taxonomy's  KPIs  and proportion  of  eligible  turnover,  capex  and  opex,  have  been extracted from the Group accounting systems, the general ledger and the management accounting systems, which are used to prepare the separate financial statements of each consolidated subsidiary undertakings, mostly of which are in accordance with IFRS.  Data  extracted  from  separate  financial  statements  are adjusted to align with the IFRS utilized in the preparation of the Group consolidated financial statements and for the consolidation transactions (intercompany sales and purchases, elimination of unrealized profit, etc.) to calculate Eni's Taxonomy KPIs and the eligible turnover, capex and opex proportion.\n\nTherefore, data of turnover, OpEx and CapEx relating to Eni Group's\n\naligned and eligible economic activities utilized in calculating the Taxonomy KPIs and the proportion of eligible activities are the same  the  Group  used  in  preparing  the  consolidated  financial statements.\n\nIn case of mono-business consolidated subsidiary undertakings performing a given eligible activity, relevant economic and financial data for the calculation of the Group eligible proportions have been extracted from the general ledger and the financial accounting to retrieve amounts of revenues, operating expenditures, additions to property, plant and equipment (PP&E) and intangible assets, additions to the right-of-use and additions to PP&E and intangibles resulting from business combinations. In case of multi-business subsidiary undertakings, relevant data for calculating the Group eligible proportions have been derived also from the systems of managerial accounting that splits  the  accounts  of  the  financial system and allocates revenues and cost amounts to different reporting  objects:  profit  centers  which  correspond  to  business units,  product  lines  which  can  share  common  costs,  plants, capital projects, cost centers, etcetera, to support management's understanding  of  the  drivers  of  the  financial  performance  and cost control.\n\nSuch  structure  of  accounting  flows,  which  is  employed  in preparing the Group  consolidated  financial  statements,",

Based on those evaluations, the Group concluded that the following activities are environmentally sustainable as per regulation (UE) 2020/852.\n\n## 4.1. Electricity generation using solar photovoltaic technology\n\nSubstantial contribution to climate change mitigation The activity generates electricity using solar PV technology.\n\n## Do no significant harm ('DNSH')\n\nClimate change adaptation\n\nClimate  change  adaptation.  The  management  has  assessed  the risk of exposure of the Group's assets to climate-related acute and chronic hazards, following the guidelines of Appendix A to the Climate Delegated Regulation, setting generic criteria for DNSH to climate change adaptation.\n\nThe Group has put in place management control systems and procedures  to  identify,  evaluate  and  mitigate  physical  climate risks,  which  the  Company  defines  as  the  risk  that  potential perspective  changes  in  meteorological  patterns  and  extreme weather phenomena linked to climate change expected in the long-term  may  have  adverse  and  significant  effects  on  assets' future performance, on the safety of operations and on expected future cash flows, so to significantly harm the objective of climate change adaptation.\n\nThe management regularly reviews the exposure of the Group's assets to the acute and chronic climate-related hazards described in the above-mentioned Appendix A and other natural hazards based on a proprietary methodology to identify physical climate risks over a long-term horizon. The purpose of this risk assesment is to define and execute mitigation plans designated to adapt the Group assets to current or expected risks, considering the already existing barriers at each Company's asset.\n\nEni's  assessment  methodology  of  assets'  exposure  to  natural hazards features the following steps:\n\n- \u00b7 it utilizes input data furnished by an external provider (currently Verisk Maplecroft), which has elaborated geographic maps of prospective climate-related risks ensuring a full coverage of  onshore  and  offshore  areas  where  Eni's  assets  are located.  The  sources  of  such  climate  maps  combine  the most updated climate forecast models, also incorporating historical weather patterns, to provide expected qualitative trends in the evolution of climate-related events;\n- \u00b7  it develops a stress test of the current asset portfolio, without limiting to assets' residual useful lives, to evaluate the potential, perspective exposure to climate-related risks till 2050;\n- \u00b7  it is performed  yearly,  and  it  will  undergo  continuous improvement based on the experience that will be accumulated over time, as well as the evolution in the framework on how to identify and measure climate-related risks;\n- \u00b7  it utilizes the IPCC RPC 8.5 scenario to project the expected future geographical maps of climate-related hazards;\n- \u00b7  it  utilizes  the  geographic  coordinates  of  each  Company's asset (longitude and latitude) to locate it in a given quadrant (each with an area of twenty square kilometers) as defined by the external provider to recognize the climate-related risks, which each asset is potentially exposed to over a thirty-year horizon based on the adopted climate scenario;\n- \u00b7  it considers in the risk-evaluating process also third-party assets and assets of the supply chain, where relevant to a full understanding of the risks which each Eni's asset is exposed.\n\nOnce climate-related hazards have been identified and classified, the management evaluates each asset's existing barriers or factors both physical ones (structural characteristics of an asset design, materials  used  in  its  construction,  distance  from  the  sources of possible hazards, containment walls, etc.) and systems and procedures (early warning systems, procedures to put in safety plants  and  equipment,  existence  of  monitoring  and  verification plans, etc.).\n\nThe outcome of that review informs the management of the residual risk which each assets remains exposed to, and how to define the action plan to achieve the objective of climate change adaptation:\n\n- \u00b7  in case of chronic climate-related hazards, monitoring activities are designed, planned, and carried out leading to the possible implementation and follow-up of remediation measures;\n- \u00b7  in case of acute climate-related hazards, an adaptation plan is assessed,  designed,  and  implemented,  which  can  comprise updates  to  operating  procedures,  the  execution  of  works  to upgrade  or  increase  assets'  safety  and  the  resilience  to  the identified  physical  climate  risks,  or  an  asset  reconfiguration taking into account its useful residual life.",

The rule under Article 18  identifies  the  MS  with  the  procedures  implemented  by  a company to ensure that business conduct complies with the OECD Guidelines  for  Multinational  Enterprises  and  the  United Nations  Guiding  Principles  on  Business  and  Human  Rights. This includes identifying the principles and rights set out in the eight  core  conventions  identified  in  the  International  Labour Organisation's  Declaration  on  Fundamental  Principles  and Rights at Work and the International Bill of Human Rights.\n\nWhen companies implement these procedures, they must comply with  the  'do  no  significant  harm'  principle  outlined  in  Article 2(17)  of  Regulation  (EU)  2019/2088,  the  Sustainable  Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). The SFDR requires financial market participants to assess the ESG risk of the investments within the financial  products  they  intend  to  offer  investors,  measuring  the performance  of  the  investee  companies  against  a  predefined set of key impact indicators in critical 'principal adverse impact' areas. Five of these indicators have a social nature: (i) violations of the UN Global Compact principles and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises; (ii) lack of processes and compliance",

Thus, Eni assumes that in complying with the SFDR principle to 'do no significant harm', it is understood to refer to the five social impact indicators described above, four of which are included in Eni's human rights due diligence processes. Regarding the fifth, Eni confirms that it does not participate in the controversial weapons sector.\n\nThe OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises are principles for responsible business conduct related to eight business areas:\n\n- \u00b7  three  relate  to  the  theme  of  human  rights  (human  rights, consumer protection, employment and industrial relations);\n- \u00b7  Anti-Corruption;\n- \u00b7  fair competition;\n- \u00b7  taxation.\n\nFinally,  the  other  sustainability  criteria  in  article  3  of  the Taxonomy Regulation address the environment, while science/ technology are out of the scope.\n\nThe ILO's eight labour conventions are related as a whole to respect for human rights.\n\nObservance  of  the  fundamental  principles  of  human  rights contained in the International Bill of Human Rights (Universal Declaration  of  Human  Rights,  International  Covenant  on  Civil and  Political  Rights  and  International  Covenant  on  Economic Social and Cultural Rights) is ensured by Eni's compliance with the Italian Constitution and rules intended to implement it, which embody human rights principles. As a company incorporated in Italy, Eni is obliged to observe them.\n\nThe  verification  of  compliance  with  the  safeguard  clause  is based on establishing and maintaining adequate company due diligence processes and systems in the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7  human rights;\n- \u00b7  Anti-corruption;\n- \u00b7  compliance with competition law;\n- \u00b7  business taxation.\n\nFurthermore,  evidence  of  compliance  with  the  MS  is  given by  absence  of  legal  proceedings  against  each  of  the  Group companies or members of its top management for violations of national or international laws relating to such matters that have resulted  in  final  convictions;  or  the  absence  of  complaints  or reports of alleged human rights violations submitted by individual stakeholders  or  groups  of  stakeholders  to  an  OECD  National Contact  Point  or  to  the  Business  and  Human  Rights  Resource Centre, in the wake of which the Company has not demonstrated concrete commitment to addressing and managing the report, failing to cooperate in its resolution and/or to adopt a remediation plan in the event it is responsible for causing and/or contributing to the negative impact of the complaint.\n\nEni's due diligence systems:\n\n- \u00b7 ANTI-CORRUPTION. Within  the  context  of  the  Company's zero tolerance for corruption , Eni has adopted a controlled\n\nenvironment that includes processes and controls designed to minimize the risk of behaviour or transactions that could lead to wilful or negligent acts of corruption. This aims to ensure the constant and punctual compliance of persons working at Eni or on behalf of Eni with the anti-corruption laws in force in the countries where the Company operates. This system also applies to money laundering. The control environment is based on values the organisation shares, starting with top management. It includes establishing a code of ethics inspired by the principles of transparency, honesty, fairness and good faith in conducting business, adherence  to  the  UN  Ten  Principles  of  Corporate Responsibility,  participation  in  the  Global  Compact  and personnel  training  on  ethical  issues.  The  processes  and controls are designed to ensure accurate and transparent recording of corporate transactions, assessment  of economic counterparties in significant transactions (acquisitions/transfers of companies, company branches, mining rights, business combinations, etc.), involvement of certain types of counterparties (business associates, joint venture partners, brokers) or in areas (trading, non-profit initiatives, sponsorships) exposed to corruption risks, as well as compliance of business conduct with internal rules under all circumstances where a breach of the code of ethics might be possible, to prevent any form of corruption in managing the  business.  The  establishment  of  a  whistleblowing mechanism even for managing anonymous reports received by the Company through a well-identified and recognisable channel of alleged violations of anti-corruption and antimoney laundering regulations (this mechanism also applies to the DD on Human Rights) is an integral part of Eni's DD on Anti-Corruption. In 2022, neither the Company nor members of senior management were party to criminal proceedings for violating anti-corruption regulations that resulted in a final verdict of conviction. Please refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the status of the Group's legal proceedings.\n\n- \u00b7 TAXATION. Eni  has  adopted  a  due  diligence  system  for managing relations with the tax authorities of the countries in which it operates. The aim is to minimize the risk that business operations violate applicable tax regulations. The Company's tax guidelines provide for the payment of taxes in  the  countries  where  operations  take  place  according to the merit as well as the letter of local rules and rejects aggressive tax policy choices, including delocalisation of economic activities to so-called tax havens. The Company has  a  Tax  Control  Framework,  i.e.  a  specific  tax  risk control system. Management is responsible for verifying consistency  between  tax  management  choices  and  the Board-approved  strategy.  The  control  environment  and processes/procedures  are  designed  to  mitigate  the  risk of  violations  which  could  trigger  significant  financial  or reputational impact (tax risk). In 2022, no Group company was party to any tax dispute for violations of tax rules or tax fraud resulting in a final verdict of conviction. For more information on the status of the Group's tax litigation, please",

        "page_content": "refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements. These disputes relate to the technical interpretation of local tax  regulations,  which  are  often  very  complex.  They  are managed with a view to reconciliation.\n\n- \u00b7 FAIR COMPETITION. Eni has set up a controlled environment and a set of procedures and controls to minimize the risk that business and corporate activities violate the rules protecting competition in the various countries where it operates. Among the  fundamental values of the Company are the principles of  fair  competition - understood as a market environment that encourages companies to excel in the quality and costeffectiveness of the products and/or services sold/supplied and compliance with antitrust legislation. Eni's control system has three phases: prevention, risk monitoring/mitigation and counteracting unlawful conduct. It is designed to minimize the risk that Eni's business units and subsidiaries engage in anti-competitive conduct, adopt practices that restrict the free market or collude with competing companies. Corporate transactions to increase market share (mergers) are executed after the antitrust authorities of the jurisdictions concerned have  been  informed.  Appropriate  remediation  plans  are formulated in response to any comments received and in compliance  with  standstill  obligations  and  the  prohibition of unlawful exchange of information during the negotiation and due diligence phases. In 2022, no Group company or senior  management  member  was  party  to  disputes  for antitrust legislation violations that resulted in a final verdict of conviction. On the reporting date, there was no pending antitrust disputes.\n- \u00b7 HUMAN RIGHTS. Human rights are at the heart of Eni's vision as a responsible company and integral to the organisation's values, culture and practices. Eni is committed to respecting human rights in all business activities and places similar expectations on business partners operating on behalf of Eni or who are contracted over the course of Eni's industrial activities.  Eni  has  adopted  a  human  rights  due  diligence process  that  complies  with  the  OECD  Guidelines  for Multinational  Enterprises  and  the  United  Nations  Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP), which envisage five steps:\n- i) adoption of a commitment  statement,  by  the  top management, upholding respect for human rights and the integration of human rights into company processes and policies;\n- ii) a  risk-based  process  of  identifying  and  assessing  the adverse  impacts  of  the  company's  activities  on  human rights, including the involvement of stakeholders;\n- iii)  the definition and adoption of measures to prevent, cease or mitigate any adverse impact;\n- iv)  the verification of the effectiveness of the measures taken;\n- v) public  reporting  on  the  processes  undertaken  by  the company to prevent, cease or mitigate the adverse impact and the measures taken.\n\nEni has established a mechanism for collecting and evaluating complaints and concerns brought to the Company's attention through appropriate channels for listening and for the receipt of\n\ncommunications by individuals, communities or associations of  individuals,  including  providing  a  remedy  to  address  the adverse impact on human rights that the company caused or contributed to. Eni actively cooperates with other state and nonstate complaint mechanisms.\n\nIn this respect, Eni's Statement on Respect for Human Rights, approved  by  the  Board  in  December  2018,  in  addition  to reaffirming  the  commitment  to  this  topic,  highlights  salient issues which are subject to in-depth due diligence, according to an approach developed in coherence with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and the UNGPs.\n\nTo  effectively  implement  this  Statement  of  Commitment,  Eni has  gradually  employed  risk-based  models  that  use  context elements (risks specific to the countries in which Eni operates) and characteristics of the business activities that, according to potential risks to human rights, allow the company to identify and adopt appropriate management measures.\n\nEni  is  actively  committed  to  reviewing  complaints  and providing  or  cooperating  to  provide  remedies  for  adverse human rights impacts that it may have caused or contributed to, and to make every effort to promote the achievement of the same objective in cases where the impact is directly related to its operations. Eni has adopted a whistleblowing system and a grievance mechanism for addressing possible cases of violations. This is a dedicated channel for the receipt and the settlement of complaints from communities and stakeholders. Eni cooperates actively and in good faith with other access facilities to reach a judicial or non-judicial resolution to open issues. In no case does Eni prohibit potential claimants access to  remediation  measures.  The  company  is  committed  to preventing reprisals against workers and other stakeholders for  raising  human  rights  concerns.  It  does  not  tolerate  or contribute to threats, intimidation, reprisals or attacks against human rights defenders and stakeholders involved with its operations.\n\nAn  integral  part  of  due  diligence  is  the  communication  of the  obtained  results.  Eni  publishes  a  yearly  report  'Eni  for' sustainability, which includes a human rights report, 'Eni for Human Rights' to inform stakeholders on the progress made to address human rights issues.\n\nIn  conclusion,  in  2022,  Eni  did  not  receive  any  final  verdict  of conviction for violations of laws, regulations or other regulatory institutions relating to human rights, bribery, competition or tax violations.  The  Company  is  cooperating  actively  and  in  good faith with the OECD National Contact Points to resolve pending Specific Instances.\n\nOn the subject of human rights, Eni also maintains an ongoing dialogue with stakeholders. Refer to, for example, the responses to  the  Business  and  Human  Rights  Resource  Centre  and  the assessment  by  the  World  Benchmarking  Alliance,  in  whose latest survey Eni was ranked first (along with a company from another segment) out of all the companies analysed.\n\nConsidering the draft Report 'Minimum Safeguards', Eni believes it  is  in  compliance  with  the  safeguard  clause  of  Article  3, paragraph 'c' of the EU Taxonomy Regulation.",

The material topics are instrumental for defining the Strategic Plan - the origin of the formulation  of  the  sustainability  Managerial  Objectives  (MBO - Management by Objectives) for all managers - and directing reporting. In 2022, the analysis was updated based on the new GRI  Standard  that  provides  for  the  identification  of  material topics as a function of the most significant impacts (positive and negative, actual and potential) generated by the organisation on the economy, environment and people, including impact on human rights (so-called Impact Materiality perspective). Anticipating the entry  into  force  of  the  new  Corporate  Sustainability  Reporting Directive (CSRD), which envisages a dual materiality approach, the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nanalysis considered also the Financial Materiality perspective.

The Consolidated\n\nDisclosure  of  Non-Financial  Information  was  prepared  in accordance with the Legislative Decree 254/2016 implementing the European Directive on Non-Financial Information, and the 'Sustainability  Reporting  Standards',  published  by  the  Global Reporting Initiative (GRI Standards) and has been subject to a  limited  review  by  the  independent  Company,  which  is  also the  auditor  of  Eni's  consolidated  financial  statement  as  of December 31, 2022. All GRI indicators in the Content Index refer to the version of the GRI Standards published in 2016, with the exception of those of: (i) 'Standard 403: Occupational Health and Safety', (ii) 'Standard 303: Water and Effluents' - which refer to the 2018 edition -, (iii) 'Standard 207: Taxes' from 2019 and (iv) 'Standard 306: Waste' in 2020. The update of the new GRI standard Universal and Sector Standard Oil & Gas published in 2021 and mandatory from this year was also considered. In addition, the recommendations reported by ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) on non-financial statements were implemented both within the NFI and in the Management Report, as well as the set of 'core' metrics defined by the WEF in  the  September  2020  White  Paper  'Measuring  Stakeholder Capitalism  Towards  Common  Metrics  and  Consistent Reporting of Sustainable Value Creation' from September 2020. The Declaration includes the information required by article 8 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of June 18, 2020 (the 'Taxonomy Regulation')  and  the  related  Delegated  Regulations  (EU) 2021/2178 and (EU) 2021/2139. The limited examination carried out by the auditing firm (PwC SpA) on the NFI does not extend to the information, provided pursuant to the Taxonomy Regulation, contained in the dedicated paragraph (pp. 198-217).\n\nPerformance indicators . KPIs are selected based on the topics identified as most significant, are collected on an annual basis according  to  the  consolidation  scope  of  the  reference  year and refer to the 2020-2022 period. In general, trends in data and performance indicators are also calculated using decimal places not shown in the document. The data for the year 2022 are the best possible estimate with the data available at the time of preparation of this report. The data are also subject to review and approval by the competent bodies and the BoD. In addition, some data published in previous years may be subject to restatement in this edition for one of the following reasons: refinement/change  in  estimation  or  calculation  methods, significant changes in the consolidation scope, or if significant updated information becomes available, possible errors during the calculation and related to boundary.\n\nIf a restatement is made, the reasons for it are appropriately disclosed in the text. Most of the KPIs presented are collected and  aggregated  automatically  through  the  use  of  Company software specific for the topic area. This data is sent to a platform dedicated to saving and storing all the data published by Eni in the  non-financial  statement.  This  system  also  allows  tracking the control and approval of each data by its Process Owners.\n\nBoundary . The boundary of the key performance indicators is aligned with the objectives set by the company and represents the potential impact of the activities Eni manages. In particular:\n\n- i) for KPIs relating to safety, the environment and climate, the perimeter consists not only of Eni SpA's subsidiaries, but also of the companies in joint operation, jointly controlled or associated companies reported in note 68 ;\n- ii) the  perimeter  relating  to  KPIs  relating  to  health  is  also extended to companies in joint operation, jointly controlled or  associated  companies  in  which  Eni  has  control  of operations (with the sole exception of data relating to reports of occupational illness, included in the OIFR, which refer only to consolidated companies);\n- iii)  with regard to data referring to anti-corruption training, the perimeter includes Eni SpA and its subsidiaries;\n- iv)  with  regard  to  data  referring  to  investments  for  local development, the perimeter includes Eni SpA, subsidiaries and jointly controlled companies;\n- v) the perimeter referring to data relating to whistleblowing files includes Eni SpA and its subsidiaries;\n- vi)  finally, the perimeter of the data related to the audits covering the anti-corruption checks includes subsidiaries controlled directly and indirectly (excluding listed companies that have their own internal audit department), associated companies based on specific agreements and third parties deemed to have a higher risk, as provided for under the contracts entered with Eni.\n\nThe comments on performance refer to these perimeters. In addition, these performance indicators are accompanied by an additional view only relating to 2022 in which the data of fully consolidated companies are presented.

Denominator refers to gross operated production.\n- \u00b7  R&M: indicator focused on emissions related to traditional and biorefineries. Denominator refers to refinery throughputs (raw and semi-finished materials).\n- \u00b7 Enipower: indicator focused on emissions related to electricity and steam production from thermoelectric power plants. The denominator refers to equivalent electricity produced (excluding the Bolgiano cogeneration plant).\n- \u00b7  Upstream methane emission intensity: calculated as the ratio of direct methane emissions expressed in CH 4 m 3 to the natural gas production sold by assets operated upstream.\n\nOperational efficiency expresses the intensity of GHG emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2 in tonCO 2 eq.) of the main industrial activities operated by Eni divided by the production (converted by homogeneity into barrels of oil equivalent using Eni's average conversion factors) of the single businesses of reference, thus measuring their degree of operating efficiency in a decarbonization scenario. In particular, the following specifications apply:\n\n- \u00b7 Upstream: includes the hydrocarbon production and electricity plants;\n- \u00b7  R&M: includes only refineries;\n- \u00b7  Chemicals: includes all plants;\n- \u00b7 Enipower: includes thermoelectric plants except for the Bolgiano cogeneration plant.\n\nUnlike the other emission intensity indices that refer to individual business areas and consider only GHG Scope 1 emissions, the Carbon Efficiency Index summarily measures Eni's commitment to reducing GHG emission intensity, including Scope 2 emissions.\n\nThe refining energy intensity index represents the total amount of energy actually used in the reference year among the various refinery processing plants, divided by the corresponding value of preset standard consumption values for each processing plant. To allow comparison over the years, 2009 data is taken as a reference (100%). For other sectors, the index represents the ratio between significant energy consumption associated to operated plants and the related production.\n\nEni Net Carbon Footprint: the indicator considers GHG Scope 1+2 emissions associated to hydrocarbons development and production activities, operated by Eni and by third parties, accounted for on an equity basis (Revenue Interest), net of offsets mainly deriving from Natural Climate Solutions occurred in the reference reporting year.\n\nNet Carbon Footprint Upstream: the indicator considers the GHG Scope 1+2 emissions associated to hydrocarbon development and production activities operated or not by Eni, accounted for on an equity basis (revenue interest) and net of the offsets mainly deriving from Natural Climate Solutions occurred in the reference year.\n\nThe indicator refers to GHG Scope 1+2+3 emissions associated with the value chain of the energy products sold by Eni, including both those deriving from own productions and those purchased from third parties, accounted for on an equity basis, net of offsets mainly deriving from Natural Climate Solutions. Differently from Scope 3 end-use emissions, which Eni reports based on upstream production, the Net GHG Lifecycle Emissions indicator considers a much wider perimeter, including Scope 1, 2 and Scope 3 emissions referred to the whole value chain of energy products sold by Eni, thus including Scope 3 enduse emissions associated to gas purchased by third parties and petroleum products sold by Eni.\n\nScope 1: direct GHG emissions are those deriving from sources associated to the company's assets (e.g. combustion, flaring, fugitive and venting), and include CO 2 ,  CH 4 and N 2 O; the Global Warming Potential used for conversion to CO 2 equivalent is 25 for CH 4 and 298 for N 2 O. Contributions of biogenic CO 2 emissions are not included.\n\nScope 2: GHG emissions indirectly related to electricity generation, steam and heat purchased from third parties for internal consumption and include CO 2 ,  CH 4 and N 2 O; the Global Warming Potential used for conversion to CO 2 equivalent is 25 for CH 4 and 298 for N 2 O. Contributions of biogenic CO 2 emissions are not included. They are reported according to a 'location-based' approach (specific information on supply contracts is also being collected to construct the 'market-based' view).\n\nScope 3: indirect GHG emissions associated with the value chain of Eni's products, which involve an analysis by category of activity. In the Oil & Gas sector, the most significant category is that related to the use of energy products (end-use), which Eni calculates according to internationally consolidated methodologies (GHG Protocol and IPIECA), based on upstream production. Emissions include CO 2 , CH 4 and N 2 O; the Global Warming Potential used for conversion to equivalent CO 2 is 25 for CH 4 and 298 for N 2 O. Since the indicator refers to equity production O&G Upstream, emissions do not include contributions of biogenic CO 2 emissions are not included.",

The risk may be caused by the processing carried out, or by the environment in which the processing takes place. The main risk agents whose prolonged exposure may lead to an occupational disease are: (i) chemical agents (example of disease: neoplasms, respiratory system diseases, blood diseases); (ii) biological agents (example of disease: malaria); (iii) physical agents (example of disease: hearing loss).\n\nNumber of sites overlapping with protected areas and Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs): operational sites in Italy and abroad, which are located within (or partially within) the boundaries of one or more protected areas or KBAs (December of each reference year).\n\nNumber of sites adjacent to protected areas or Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs): operational sites in Italy and abroad which, although outside the boundaries of protected areas or KBA, are less than 1 km away (December of each reference year).\n\nNumber  of  upstream  concessions  overlapping  protected  areas  and  Key  Biodiversity  Areas  (KBAs) with activities in the overlapping area: active national and international concessions, operated, under development or in production, present in the Company's databases in June of each reference year that overlap one or more protected areas or KBAs, where development/production operations (wells, sealines, pipelines and onshore and offshore installations as documented in the Company's GIS geodatabase) are located within the intersection area.\n\nNumber of upstream concessions overlapping protected areas or Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs), without activities in the overlapping area: active national and international concessions, operated, under development or  in  production,  present in the Company's databases in June of each reference year that overlap one or more protected areas or KBAs, where development/production operations (wells, sealines, pipelines and onshore and offshore installations as documented in the Company's GIS geodatabase) are located outside the intersection area.\n\nThe sources used for the census of protected areas and KBAs are the 'World Database on Protected Areas' and the 'World Database of Key Biodiversity Areas' respectively; the data was made available to Eni in the framework of its membership in the UNEP-WCMC Proteus Partnership (UN Environment Programme - World Conservation Monitoring Center). There are some limitations to consider when interpreting the results of this analysis:\n\n- \u00b7 it is globally recognized that there is an overlap between the different databases of protected areas and KBAs, which may have led to a certain degree of duplication in the analysis (some protected areas/KBAs could be counted several times);\n- \u00b7 the databases of protected or key biodiversity areas used for the analysis, while representing the most up-todate information available at global level, may not be complete for each Country.\n\nSignificant  impact  of  activities,  products  and  services  on  biodiversity: potential impact may vary depending on the complexity of each project, the value of the natural environment and the social context of  the  activities.  Among the most significant impacts for all types of Eni assets are those related to land (or sea) use change due to the physical presence of plants and infrastructure, which may result in the removal, degradation or fragmentation of habitats with consequences for species. Possible impact of  activities  in  the  upstream,  refining  and  petrochemical  sectors  include  the  degradation  of  habitats and loss of biodiversity due to: pressure on fresh water availability; degradation of water, air and soil quality; contamination and pollution due to accidental events (e.g. spills and leakage); climate-altering emissions that contribute to climate change with direct and indirect effects on nature (e.g. anticipation of plant flowering and changes to the reproductive period of some animal species, migration of biomes at different latitudes and altitudes, and coral bleaching). For activities related to renewables, in addition to impact due to the occupation of land and sea, potential impact on birds and bats due to the presence of  turbines  and  distribution  lines  are  mentioned.  Wind  turbines  pose  a  potential  risk  to  particularly vulnerable species groups such as birds of prey.\n\nSpecies listed  on  the  IUCN  Red  List  and  national  lists  that  find  their  habitat  in  the  organisation's areas of operation: the data source is the IUCN Red List Spatial Data database, which contains global assessments of species by taxonomic groups. The spatial data of species distribution are downloaded in ESRI shapefile format in their latest update from the database and uploaded to Eni's ArcGIS systems. The total number of species with habitats inside the organisation's areas of operation is verified. The species are classified according to their level of extinction risk: critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable, near threatened, or least concern. 'Data Deficient' species are those species that lack of data for which it impossible to assign a risk category.\n\nIn interpreting the data, it is essential to note that the analysis is subject to the inherent limitations associated with global species mapping and is sensitive to periodic database updates, as more species are mapped yearly.",

We  refrain  from  misusing  our  company  name  in  personal interactions with political parties, movements, and committees.\n\n## LOCAL DEVELOPMENT\n\nLOCAL DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS\n\nSPENDING TO LOCAL SUPPLIERS\n\nThe indicator refers to the Eni share of spending in local development initiatives carried out by Eni in favour of local communities to promote the improvement of the quality of life and sustainable socio-economic development of communities in operational contexts.\n\nThe potential impact on local communities can vary depending on the type and location of each business project. Those relating to the exploration and business development phase are described below:\n\nNegative impacts related to exploration activities include: socio-economic displacement, negative impacts on fishing, agriculture and tourism, potential damage to buildings and historical heritage, potential violations of subcontractor labour standards, inadequate compensation for the impact, and impact on the human rights of affected populations.\n\nNegative  impacts  related  to  business  development  activities  include: socio-economic  displacement, resettlement, negative impacts on fishing, agriculture and tourism, increased cost of living and services in the areas around the plant, delayed implementation of development projects, distortion of the local market due to remuneration and a general increase in the cost of living, social effects of environmental impacts such as noise, related traffic and landscape modification, impact on the customs and traditions of local populations, lack of involvement of minorities and indigenous people in the approval process, impact on the human rights of affected populations, induction of migration flows caused by business activities, impact on community health, changes in community lifestyles, potential increase in crime, increased pressure on services to the population, changes in the local social-productive structure and potential impact on some essential services or the production of basic goods, and changes to the traditional real estate system. Reduced access to natural resources by communities.\n\nThe indicator refers to the 2022 share of expenditure to local suppliers. 'Spending to local suppliers' has been defined according to the following alternative methods on the basis of the specific characteristics of the Countries analysed in terms of local regulations and local approaches used in the management of local content: 1) 'Equity method' (Ghana): the share of expenditure towards local suppliers is determined based on the percent ownership of the corporate structure (e.g. for a joint venture with a 60% local component, 60% of the total expenditure towards the joint venture is considered as expenditure towards the local supplier); 2) 'Local currency method' (Vietnam, UK, Libya, Kazakhstan): the share paid in local currency  is  identified  as  expenditure  towards  local  suppliers;  3)  'Country  registration  method'  (Iraq, Indonesia, United Arab Emirates, Nigeria, Mozambique, USA, Germany, Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Ivory Coast, Oman, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, Venezuela and Kenya): the expenditure towards suppliers registered in the Country  and  not  belonging  to  international  groups/mega  suppliers  (e.g.  suppliers  of  drilling  services/ auxiliary drilling services) is identified as local; 4) 'Method of registration in the Country + local currency' (Congo, Mexico and Australia): expenditure towards suppliers registered in the Country and not belonging to international groups/mega suppliers (e.g. suppliers of drilling services) is identified as local. For the latter, spending in local currency is considered to be local.\n\nThe Countries selected are those most representative for Eni business from a strategic point of view and in which a relevant procurement plan for the four-year period 2022-2025 has been recorded compared to the total spent by the Eni Group.",

        "page_content": "## Glossary\n\nThe glossary of Oil and Gas terms is available on Eni's web page at the address eni.com. Below is a selection of the most frequently used terms.\n\n2 nd and 3 rd generation feedstock Are feedstocks not in competition with  the  food  supply  chain  as  the  first  generation  feedstock (vegetable oils). Second generation are mostly agricultural nonfood and agro/urban waste (such as animal fats, used cooking oils and agricultural waste) and the third generation feedstocks are non-agricultural high innovation feedstocks (deriving from algae or waste).\n\nAverage reserve life index Ratio between the amount of reserves at the end of the year and total production for the year.\n\nBarrel/bbl Volume unit corresponding to 159 liters. A barrel of oil corresponds to about 0.137 metric tonnes.\n\nBoe  (Barrel  of  Oil  Equivalent) Is  used  as  a  standard  unit measure for oil and natural gas. Effective January 1 st , 2019, Eni has updated the conversion rate of gas produced to 5,263 cubic feet of gas equals 1 barrel of oil.\n\nCompounding Activity specialized in production of semi-finished products in granular form resulting from the combination of two or more chemical products.\n\nConversion Refinery  process  allowing  the  transformation  of heavy fractions into lighter fractions. Conversion processes are cracking, visbreaking, coking, the gasification of refinery residues, etc. The ration of overall treatment capacity of these plants and that of primary crude fractioning plants is the conversion rate of  a  refinery.  Flexible  refineries  have  higher  rates  and  higher profitability.\n\nElastomers (or Rubber) Polymers, either natural or synthetic, which, unlike plastic, when stress is applied, return, to a certain degree, to their original shape, once the stress ceases to be applied.  The  main  synthetic  elastomers  are  polybutadiene (BR),  styrene-butadiene  rubber  (SBR),  ethylenepropylene rubber (EPR), thermoplastic rubber (TPR) and nitrylic rubber (NBR).\n\nEmissions of NO x (Nitrogen Oxides) Total direct emissions of nitrogen oxides deriving from combustion processes in air. They include NO x emissions from flaring activities, sulphur recovery processes,  FCC  regeneration,  etc.  They  include  NO  and  NO 2 emissions and exclude N 2 O emissions.\n\nEmissions of SO x (Sulphur Oxides) Total direct emissions of sulfur oxides including SO 2 and SO 3 emissions. Main sources are combustion plants, diesel engines (including maritime engines), gas flaring (if the gas contains H 2 S), sulphur recovery processes, FCC regeneration, etc.\n\nEnhanced recovery Techniques used to increase or stretch over time the production of wells.\n\nEni  carbon  efficiency  index Ratio  between  GHG  emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2 in tonnes CO 2 eq.) of the main industrial activities operated by Eni divided by the productions (converted by homogeneity into barrels of oil equivalent using Eni's average conversion factors) of the single businesses of reference.\n\nGreen House Gases (GHG) Gases in the atmosphere, transparent to solar radiation, that trap infrared radiation emitted by the earth's surface. The greenhouse gases relevant within Eni's activities are  carbon  dioxide  (CO 2 ),  methane  (CH 4 )  and  nitrous  oxide (N 2 O). GHG emissions are commonly reported in CO 2 equivalent (CO 2 eq.)  according  to  Global  Warming  Potential  values  in  line with IPCC AR4, 4 th Assessment Report.\n\nInfilling wells Infilling wells are wells drilled in a producing area in order to improve the recovery of hydrocarbons from the field and to maintain and/or increase production levels.\n\nLNG Liquefied  Natural  Gas  obtained  through  the  cooling  of natural  gas  to  minus  160\u00b0C  at  normal  pressure.  The  gas  is liquefied to allow transportation from the place of extraction to the sites at which it is transformed and consumed. One ton of LNG corresponds to 1,400 cubic meters of gas.\n\nLPG Liquefied Petroleum Gas, a mix of light petroleum fractions, gaseous  at  normal  pressure  and  easily  liquefied  at  room temperature through limited compression.\n\nMineral  Potential  (potentially  recoverable  hydrocarbon volumes) Estimated recoverable volumes which cannot be defined as reserves due to a number of reasons, such as the temporary lack of viable markets, a possible commercial recovery dependent on the development of new technologies, or for their location in accumulations yet to be developed or where evaluation of known accumulations is still at an early stage.\n\nMoulding Activity  of  moulding  of  expanded  polyolefins  for production of ultra-light products.",

        "page_content": "Natural gas liquids Liquid or liquefied hydrocarbons recovered from  natural  gas  through  separation  equipment  or  natural gas treatment plants. Propane, normal-butane and isobutane, isopentane  and  pentane  plus,  that  used  to  be  defined  natural gasoline, are natural gas liquids.\n\nNet  Carbon  Footprint Overall  Scope  1  and  Scope  2  GHG emissions associated with Eni's operations, accounted for on an equity basis, net of carbon offsets mainly from Natural Climate Solutions.\n\nNet  Carbon  Intensity Ratio  between  the  Net  GHG  lifecycle emissions and the energy products sold, accounted for on an equity basis.\n\nNet  GHG  Lifecycle  Emissions GHG  Scope  1+2+3  emissions associated with the value chain of the energy products sold by Eni, including both those deriving from own productions and those purchased from third parties, accounted for on an equity basis, net of offset mainly from Natural Climate Solutions.\n\nOil spills Discharge of oil or oil products from refining or oil waste occurring in the normal course of operations (when accidental) or  deriving  from  actions  intended  to  hinder  operations  of business units or from sabotage by organized groups (when due to sabotage or terrorism).\n\nOilfield chemicals Innovative solutions for supply of chemicals and related ancillary services for Oil & Gas business.\n\nOlefins (or Alkenes) Hydrocarbons that are particularly active chemically, used for this reason as raw materials in the synthesis of intermediate products and of polymers.\n\nOver/underlifting Agreements  stipulated  between  partners regulate the right of each to its share in the production of a set  period  of  time.  Amounts  different  from  the  agreed  ones determine temporary over/underlifting situations.\n\nPlasmix The  collective  name  for  the  different  plastics  that currently have no use in the market of recycling and can be used as a feedstock in the new circular economy businesses of Eni.\n\nProduction  Sharing  Agreement  (PSA) Contract  in  use  in African,  Middle  Eastern,  Far  Eastern  and  Latin  American Countries,  among  others,  regulating  relationships  between states and oil companies with regard to the exploration and production of hydrocarbons. The mineral right is awarded to the national oil company jointly with the foreign oil company that has an exclusive right to perform exploration, development and production activities and can enter into agreements with other local or international entities. In this type of contract, the national oil company assigns to the international contractor the task of performing exploration and production with the contractor's  equipment  and  financial  resources.  Exploration\n\nrisks are borne by the contractor and production is divided into two portions: 'cost oil' is used to recover costs borne by the contractor  and  'profit  oil'  is  divided  between  the  contractor and the national company according to variable schemes and represents the profit deriving from exploration and production. Further terms and conditions of these contracts may vary from Country to Country.\n\nProved  reserves Proved  oil  and  gas  reserves  are  those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.\n\nRenewable  Installed  Capacity Is  measured  as  the  maximun generating  capacity  of  Eni's  share  of  power  plants  that  use renewable  energy  sources  (wind,  solar  and  wave,  and  any other non-fossil fuel source of generation deriving from natural resources, excluding, from the avoidance of doubt, nuclear energy) to produce electricity. The capacity is considered 'installed' once the power plants are in operation or the mechanical completion phase has been reached. The mechanical completion represents the final construction stage excluding the grid connection.\n\nReserves Quantities  of  oil  and  gas  and  related  substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest  in  the  production,  installed  means  of  delivering  oil and gas or related substances to market, and all permits and financing  required  to  implement  the  project.  Reserves  can  be: (i) developed reserves quantities of oil and gas anticipated to be  through  installed  extraction  equipment  and  infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate; (ii) undeveloped reserves: oil and gas expected to be recovered from new wells, facilities and operating methods.\n\nScope 1 GHG Emissions Direct greenhouse gas emissions from company's operations, produced from sources that are owned or controlled by the company.\n\nScope 2 GHG Emissions Indirect greenhouse gas emissions resulting  from  the  generation  of  electricity,  steam  and  heat purchased from third parties.\n\nScope 3 GHG Emissions Indirect GHG emissions associated with the value chain of Eni's products.\n\nShip-or-pay  Clause  included  in  natural  gas  transportation contracts  according  to  which  the  customer  for  which  the transportation is carried out is bound to pay for the transportation of the gas also in case the gas is not transported.",

The customer has the option of collecting the gas paid and not delivered at a price equal to the residual fraction of the price set in the contract in subsequent contract years.\n\nUN SDGs The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all by 2030. Adopted by all United Nations Member States in 2015, they address the global challenges the world is facing, including those related  to  poverty,  inequality,  climate  change,  environmental degradation, peace and justice.\n\nFor further detail see the website https://unsdg.un.org\n\nUpstream/downstream The  term  upstream  refers  to  all hydrocarbon exploration and production activities.\n\nThe term mid-downstream includes all activities inherent to oil industry subsequent to exploration and production.

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, taking into account, where appropriate, value adjustments, except for certain items that under IFRSs must be measured at fair value as described in the accounting policies that follow. The principles of consolidation and the significant accounting policies that follow have been consistently applied to all years presented, except where otherwise indicated.\n\nThe 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements, approved by the Eni's Board of Directors on March 16, 2023, were audited by the external  auditor  PricewaterhouseCoopers  SpA.  The  external auditor of Eni SpA, as the main external auditor, is wholly in charge of the auditing activities  of  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements.\n\nConsolidated  companies'  financial  statements,  as  well  as  their reporting packages prepared for use by the Group in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, are audited by external auditors; when there  are  other  external  auditors,  PricewaterhouseCoopers SpA takes the responsibility of their work.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in euros and all values are rounded to the nearest million euros (\u20ac million), except where otherwise indicated.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING  ESTIMATES  AND JUDGMENTS\n\nThe  preparation  of  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets,  liabilities,  revenues  and  expenses  recognised  in  the financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. Estimates made are based on complex judgments and past experience of other assumptions deemed reasonable in consideration of the information available at the time. The accounting policies and areas that require the most significant\n\njudgments  and  estimates  to  be  used  in  the  preparation  of the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  are  in  relation  to  the accounting for oil and natural gas activities, specifically in the determination  of  reserves,  impairment  of  financial  and  nonfinancial  assets,  leases,  decommissioning  and  restoration liabilities, environmental  liabilities, business  combinations, employee benefits, revenue from contracts with customers, fair value measurements and income taxes. Although the Company uses its best estimates and judgments, actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. The accounting estimates and judgments relevant for the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statement are described below.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  ESTIMATES  AND  JUDGMENTS MADE IN ASSESSING THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS\n\nSignificant  accounting  estimates  and  judgments  made  by management  for  the  preparation  of  the  2022  Consolidated Financial Statements are affected by the effects of actions to address climate change and by the potential impact of the energy transition. In particular, the global pressure towards a low carbon economy, increasingly restrictive regulatory requirements for Oil & Gas activities and hydrocarbons consumption, carbon pricing schemes,  the  technological  evolution  of  alternative  energy sources for transportation, as well as changes in consumer preferences could imply a structural decline of the demand for hydrocarbons in the medium/long-term, an increase in operating costs and a higher risk of stranded assets for Eni.\n\nThe  Eni  strategy  provides  for  the  achievement  of  carbon neutrality by 2050, in line with the provisions of the scenarios compatible  with  maintaining  global  warming  within  the  1.5\u00b0C threshold; furthermore, this strategy sets intermediate targets for 2030 and 2040 in terms of reduction in absolute emissions and carbon intensity. Scenarios adopted by management take into account policies, regulatory requirements and current and expected developments in technology and set out a development path of the future energy system, on the basis of an economic and demographic framework, analysis of existing and announced policies and technologies, identifying those which can reasonably reach maturity within the considered time horizon. Price variables reflect the best estimate by management of the fundamentals of several energy markets, which incorporates the ongoing and reasonably expected decarbonisation trends, and are subject to continuous benchmarking with the views of market analysts and peers.\n\nSuch  scenarios  represent  the  basis  for  significant  estimates and judgments relating to: (i) the assessment of the intention\n\n(1) IFRSs include also International Accounting Standards (IAS), currently effective, as well as the interpretations developed by the IFRS Interpretations Committee, previously named International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) and initially Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC). (2) As applied to Eni, there are no differences between IFRSs as issued by the IASB and those adopted by the EU, effective for the year 2022.",

Subsidiaries are consolidated, on the basis of consistent accounting policies, from the date on which control is obtained until the date that control ceases.\n\nAssets,  liabilities, income  and  expenses  of  consolidated subsidiaries are fully recognised with those of the parent in the Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  taking  into  account  the appropriate  eliminations  of  intragroup  transactions  (see  the accounting  policy  for  'Intragroup  transactions');  the  parent's investment  in  each  subsidiary  is  eliminated  against  the corresponding parent's portion of equity of each subsidiary.\n\nNon-controlling interests are presented separately on the balance sheet within equity; the profit or loss and comprehensive income attributable to non-controlling interests are presented in specific line items, respectively, in the profit and loss account and in the statement of comprehensive income.\n\nTaking into account the lack of any material 3 impact on the representation  of  the  financial  position  and  performance  of the Group 4 ,  the Consolidated Financial Statements do not fully consolidate:  (i)  some  subsidiaries  that  are  immaterial,  both individually and in the aggregate, and; (ii) subsidiaries acting as sole-operator in the management of oil and gas contracts on behalf of companies participating in a joint project. In the latter\n\ncase, the activities are financed proportionally based on a budget approved  by  the  participating  companies  upon  presentation of  periodical  reports  of  proceeds  and  expenses.  Costs  and revenue and other operating data (production, reserves, etc.) of the project, as well as the related obligations arising from the project, are recognised directly in the financial statements of the companies involved based on their own share.\n\nWhen  the  proportion  of  the  equity  held  by  non-controlling interests  changes,  any  difference  between  the  consideration paid/received  and  the  amount  by  which  the  related  noncontrolling interests are adjusted is attributed to Eni owners' equity.  Conversely,  the  sale  of  equity  interests  with  loss  of control determines the recognition in the profit and loss account of: (i) any gain or loss calculated as the difference between the consideration received and the corresponding transferred net assets; (ii) any gain or loss recognised as a result of the remeasurement  of  any  investment  retained  in  the  former subsidiary at its fair value; and (iii) any amount related to the former subsidiary previously recognised in other comprehensive income which may be reclassified subsequently to the profit and loss account 5 . Any investment retained in the former subsidiary is recognised at its fair value at the date when control is lost and shall be accounted for in accordance with the applicable measurement criteria.\n\n## Interests in joint arrangements\n\nJoint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the  parties  that  have  joint  control  of  the  arrangement  have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method as described in the accounting policy for 'The equity method of accounting'. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have enforceable rights to  the  assets,  and  enforceable  obligations  for  the  liabilities, relating  to  the  arrangement;  in  the  Consolidated  Financial Statements, Eni recognises its share of the assets/liabilities and revenues/expenses of joint operations on the basis of its rights and obligations relating to the arrangements. After the initial recognition, the assets/liabilities and revenues/ expenses of the joint operations are measured in accordance with the applicable measurement  criteria.  Immaterial  joint  operations  structured through a separate vehicle are accounted for using the equity",

Investments  in  joint  ventures  previously classified as joint operations are measured on the date of change in the classification of the joint arrangement at the net amount of the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities that Eni had previously recognised, line by line, on the basis of its rights and obligations relating to the arrangement.\n\n## Investments in associates\n\nAn associate is an entity over which Eni has significant influence, that  is  the  power  to  participate  in  the  financial  and  operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control of those policies.\n\nInvestments in associates are accounted for using the equity method as described in the accounting policy for 'The equity method of accounting'.\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates are presented separately in the annex 'List of companies owned by Eni SpA as of December 31, 2022'. This annex includes also the changes in the scope of consolidation.\n\n## The equity method of accounting\n\nInvestments  in  joint  ventures,  associates  and  immaterial unconsolidated subsidiaries, are accounted for using the equity method 6 .\n\nUnder the equity method, investments are initially recognised at  cost 7 , allocating  it,  similarly  to  business  combinations procedures,  to  the  investee's  identifiable  assets/liabilities;  any excess of the cost of the investment over the share of the net fair  value  of  the  investee's  identifiable  assets  and  liabilities is  accounted  for  as  goodwill,  not  separately  recognised  but included  in  the  carrying  amount  of  the  investment.  If  this allocation is provisionally recognised at initial recognition, it can be retrospectively adjusted within one year from the acquisition date,  to  reflect  new  information  obtained  about  facts  and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. Subsequently, the carrying amount is adjusted to reflect: (i) the investor's share of the profit or loss of the investee after the date of acquisition, adjusted  to  account  for  depreciation,  amortization  and  any impairment  losses  of  the  equity-accounted  entity's  assets based on their fair values at the date of acquisition; and (ii) the investor's share of the investee's other comprehensive income. Distributions received from an equity-accounted investee reduce the carrying amount of the investment. In applying the equity method,  consolidation  adjustments  are  considered  (see  also the accounting policy for 'Subsidiaries'). Losses arising from the application of the equity method in excess of the carrying\n\namount  of  the  investment,  recognised  in  the  profit  and  loss account within 'Income (Expense) from investments', reduce the carrying amount, net of the related expected credit losses (see below), of any financing receivables towards the investee for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future (the so-called long-term interests), which are, in substance, an extension of the investment in the investee. The investor's share of any losses of an equity-accounted investee that exceeds the carrying amount of the investment and any long-term interests (the so-called net investment), is recognised in  a  specific  provision  only  to  the  extent  that  the  investor  has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the investee.\n\nWhenever  there  is  objective  evidence  of  impairment  (e.g. relevant  breaches  of  contracts,  significant  financial  difficulty, probable default of the counterparty, etc.), the carrying amount of  the  net  investment,  resulting  from  the  application  of  the abovementioned measurement criteria, is tested for impairment by comparing it with the related recoverable amount, determined by adopting the criteria indicated in the accounting policy for 'Impairment of non-financial assets'. When an impairment loss no longer exists or has decreased, any reversal of the impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account within 'Income (Expense) from investments'. The impairment reversal of the net  investment  shall  not  exceed  the  previously  recognised impairment losses.\n\nThe sale of equity interests with loss of joint control or significant influence over the investee determines the recognition in the profit  and  loss  account  of:  (i)  any  gain  or  loss  calculated  as the  difference  between  the  consideration  received  and  the corresponding transferred share; (ii) any gain or loss recognised as a result of the remeasurement of any investment retained in  the  former  joint  venture/  associate  at  its  fair  value 8 ;  and (iii) any amount related to the former joint venture/associate previously recognised in other comprehensive income which may be reclassified subsequently to the profit and loss account 9 . Any investment retained in the former joint venture/associate is recognised at its fair value at the date when joint control or  significant  influence  is  lost  and  shall  be  accounted  for  in accordance with the applicable measurement criteria.\n\n## Business combination\n\nBusiness  combinations  are  accounted  for  by  applying  the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in a business combination is the sum of the acquisition-date fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the acquirer. The consideration transferred includes also  the  fair  value  of  any  assets  or  liabilities  resulting  from\n\n(9) Conversely, any amount related to the former joint venture/associate previously recognised in other comprehensive income, which may not be reclassified subsequently to the profit and loss account, are reclassified in another item of equity.",

Acquisition\n\nrelated costs are accounted for as expenses when incurred. The acquirer shall measure the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair values 10 , unless another measurement basis is required by IFRSs. The excess of the consideration transferred over the Group's share of the acquisition-date  fair  values  of  the  identifiable  assets  acquired and liabilities assumed is recognised, on the balance sheet, as goodwill; conversely, a gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in the profit and loss account.\n\nAny non-controlling interests are measured as the proportionate share in the recognised amounts of the acquiree's identifiable net  assets  at  the  acquisition  date  excluding  the  portion  of goodwill  attributable  to  them  (partial  goodwill  method).  In  a business combination achieved in stages, the purchase price is  determined  by  summing  the  acquisition-date  fair  value of  previously  held  equity  interests  in  the  acquiree  and  the consideration transferred for obtaining control; the previously held equity interests are remeasured at their acquisition-date fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognized in the profit and loss account. Furthermore, on obtaining control, any amount recognised in other comprehensive income related to the previously held equity interests is reclassified to the profit and loss account, or in another item of equity when such amount may not be reclassified to the profit and loss account.\n\nIf the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the provisional amounts recognised at the acquisition date shall be retrospectively adjusted within one year from the acquisition date, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date.\n\nThe acquisition of interests in a joint operation whose activity constitutes a business is accounted for applying the principles on business combinations accounting. In this regard, if the entity obtains control over a business that was a joint operation, the previously held interest in the joint operation is remeasured at the acquisition-date fair value and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account 11 .\n\n## SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  ESTIMATES  AND  JUDGMENTS: INVESTMENTS AND BUSINESS\n\nThe  assessment  of  the  existence  of  control,  joint  control, significant  influence  over  an  investee,  as  well  as  for  joint operations,  the  assessment  of  the  existence  of  enforceable rights to the investee's assets and enforceable obligations for the investee's liabilities imply that management makes complex judgments on the basis of the characteristics of the investee's\n\nstructure,  arrangements  between  parties  and  other  relevant facts and circumstances. Significant accounting estimates by management  are  required  also  for  measuring  the  identifiable assets  acquired  and  the  liabilities  assumed  in  a  business combination  at  their  acquisition-date  fair  values.  For  such measurement, to be performed also for the application of the equity method, Eni adopts the valuation techniques generally used by market participants taking into account the available information; for the most significant business combinations, Eni engages external independent evaluators.\n\n## Intragroup transactions\n\nAll balances and transactions between consolidated companies, and not yet realised with third parties, including unrealised profits arising from such transactions, have been eliminated. Unrealised profits  arising  from  transactions  between  the  Group  and  its equity-accounted entities are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the equity-accounted entity; such accounting treatment is applied also for transfer of businesses to equityaccounted  entities  (the  so-called  downstream  transactions). In  both  cases,  unrealised  losses  are  not  eliminated  as  the transaction  provides  evidence  of  an  impairment  loss  of  the asset transferred.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nThe  financial  statements  of  foreign  operations  having  a functional  currency  other  than  the  euro,  that  represents  the parent's functional currency as well as the presentation currency of  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  are  translated  into euros using the spot exchange rates on the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities, historical exchange rates for equity and average exchange rates for the profit and loss account and the statement of cash flows.\n\nThe cumulative resulting exchange differences are presented in  the  separate  component  of  Eni  owners'  equity  'Cumulative currency  translation  differences' 12 . Cumulative  amount  of exchange  differences  relating  to  a  foreign  operation  are reclassified  to  the  profit  and  loss  account  when  the  entity disposes the entire interest in that foreign operation or when the partial disposal involves the loss of control, joint control or significant influence over the foreign operation. On a partial disposal that does not involve loss of control of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the proportionate share of the  cumulative  exchange  differences  is  reattributed  to  the non-controlling interests in that foreign operation. On a partial disposal of interests in joint arrangements or in associates that does not involve loss of joint control or significant influence, the proportionate share of the cumulative exchange differences is",

Unproved exploration rights are not amortised but reviewed to confirm that there is no indication that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. This review is based on the confirmation of the commitment of the Company to continue the exploration activities and on the analysis of facts and circumstances that indicate the absence of uncertainties related to the recoverability of the carrying amount. If no future activity is planned, the carrying amount of the related exploration rights is  recognised in the profit and loss account as write-off. Lower value exploration rights are pooled and amortised on a straightline basis over the estimated period of exploration. In the event of a discovery of proved reserves (i.e. upon recognition of proved reserves  and  internal  approval  for  development),  the  carrying amount of the related unproved exploration rights is reclassified to 'proved exploration rights', within the line item 'Intangible assets'. Upon reclassification, as well as whether there is any indication of impairment, the carrying amount of exploration rights to reclassify as proved is tested for impairment considering the higher of their value in use and their fair value less costs of disposal. From the commencement  of  production,  proved  exploration  rights  are amortised according to the unit of production method (the socalled UOP method, described in the accounting policy for 'UOP depreciation, depletion and amortisation').\n\n## Acquisition of mineral interests\n\nCosts  incurred  for  the  acquisition  of  mineral  interests  are capitalised in connection with the assets acquired (such as exploration  potential,  possible  and  probable  reserves  and proved reserves). When the acquisition is related to a set of exploration potential and reserves, the cost is allocated to the different assets acquired based on their expected discounted cash  flows.  Acquired  exploration  potential  is  measured  in accordance with the criteria illustrated in the accounting policy for  'Acquisition  of  exploration  rights'.  Costs  associated  with proved reserves are amortised according to the UOP method (see  the  accounting  policy  for  'UOP  depreciation,  depletion and amortisation'). Expenditure associated with possible and probable reserves (unproved mineral interests) is not amortised until classified as proved reserves; in case of a negative result of the subsequent appraisal activities, it is written off.\n\n## Exploration and appraisal expenditure\n\nGeological and geophysical exploration costs are recognised as an expense as incurred. Costs directly associated with an exploration well are initially recognised within tangible assets in progress, as 'exploration and appraisal costs - unproved' (exploration wells in progress) until the drilling of the well is completed and can continue to be capitalised in the following 12-month  period  pending  the  evaluation  of  drilling  results (suspended exploration wells). If, at the end of this period, it is ascertained that the result is negative (no hydrocarbon found) or that the discovery is not sufficiently significant to justify the development, the wells are declared dry/unsuccessful and the related costs are written-off. Conversely, these costs continue to be capitalised if and until: (i) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well, and (ii) the entity is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project; on the contrary, the capitalised costs are recognised in the profit and loss account as write-off. Analogous recognition criteria  are  adopted  for  the  costs  related  to  the  appraisal activity.  When  proved  reserves  of  oil  and/or  natural  gas  are determined, the relevant expenditure recognised as unproved is reclassified to proved exploration and appraisal costs within tangible  assets  in  progress.

From the commencement of production, proved  exploration  and  appraisal  costs  are  depreciated according to the UOP method (see the accounting policy for 'UOP depreciation, depletion and amortisation').\n\n## Development costs\n\nDevelopment costs, including the costs related to unsuccessful and damaged development wells, are capitalised as 'Tangible asset in progress - proved'. Development costs are incurred to obtain access to proved reserves and to provide facilities for extracting, treating, gathering and storing the oil and gas. They are amortised, from the commencement of production, generally  on  a  UOP  basis.  When  development  projects  are unfeasible/not carried on, the related costs are written off when it is decided to abandon the project. Development costs are  tested  for  impairment  in  accordance  with  the  criteria described in the accounting policy for 'Property, plant and equipment'.\n\n## UOP depreciation, depletion and amortisation\n\nProved  oil  and  gas  assets  are  depreciated  generally  under the UOP method, as their useful life is closely related to the availability  of  proved  oil  and  gas  reserves,  by  applying,  to the depreciable amounts at the end of each quarter a rate representing the ratio between the volumes extracted during the quarter and the reserves existing at the end of the quarter, increased by the volumes extracted during the quarter. This method is applied with reference to the smallest aggregate representing  a  direct  correlation  between  expenditures  to be depreciated and oil and gas reserves. Proved exploration rights  and  acquired  proved  mineral  interests  are  amortised over proved reserves; proved exploration and appraisal costs and development costs are depreciated over proved developed reserves, while common facilities are depreciated over total proved reserves. Proved reserves are determined according to US SEC rules that require the use of the yearly average oil and gas prices for assessing the economic producibility; material changes in reference prices could result in depreciation charges not reflecting the pattern in which the assets' future economic benefits are expected to be consumed to the extent that, for example, certain non-current assets would be fully depreciated within a short-term. In these cases, the reserves considered in determining the UOP rate are estimated on the basis of economic  viability  parameters,  reasonable  and  consistent with  management's  expectations  of  production,  in  order  to recognise depreciation charges that more appropriately reflect the expected utilization of the assets concerned.\n\n## Production costs\n\nProduction  costs  are  those  costs  incurred  to  operate  and maintain wells and field equipment and are recognised as an expense as incurred.\n\n## Production  sharing  agreements  and  service contracts\n\nOil and gas reserves related to Production Sharing Agreements are determined on the basis of contractual terms related to the recovery  of  the  contractor's  costs  to  undertake  and  finance exploration, development and production activities at its own risk (Cost Oil) and the Company's stipulated share of the production remaining  after  such  cost  recovery  (Profit  Oil).  Revenues  from the sale of the lifted production, against both Cost Oil and Profit Oil, are accounted for on an accrual basis, whilst exploration, development and production costs are accounted for according to the above-mentioned accounting policies. A similar scheme applies to service contracts where the Group is entitled to a share of the production as consideration for the rendered service.\n\nThe  Company's  share  of  production  volumes  and  reserves includes the share of hydrocarbons that corresponds to the taxes  to  be  paid,  according  to  the  contractual  agreement, by the national government on behalf of the Company. As a consequence, the Company has to recognise at the same time an increase in the taxable profit, through the increase of the revenue, and a tax expense.\n\n## Plugging and abandonment of wells\n\nCosts  expected  to  be  incurred  with  respect  to  the  plugging and  abandonment  of  a  well,  dismantlement  and  removal  of production facilities, as well as site restoration, are capitalised, consistent with the accounting policy described under 'Property, plant and equipment', and then depreciated on a UOP basis.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  ESTIMATES  AND  JUDGMENTS: OIL AND NATURAL GAS ACTIVITIES\n\nEngineering estimates of the Company's oil and gas reserves are inherently uncertain. Proved reserves are the estimated volumes of crude oil, natural gas and gas condensates, liquids and associated substances which geological and engineering data demonstrate that can be economically producible with reasonable certainty from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions and operating methods. Although there are authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering and geological criteria that must be met before estimated oil and gas reserves can be categorised as 'proved', the accuracy of reserve estimates depends on a number of factors, assumptions and variables, including: (i) the quality of available geological, technical and economic data and their interpretation and judgment; (ii) projections regarding future rates of production and operating costs and development costs; (iii) changes in the prevailing tax rules, other government regulations and contractual conditions; (iv) results of drilling, testing and the actual  production  performance  of  Company's  reservoirs  after the date of the estimates which may drive substantial upward or downward revisions; and (v) changes in oil and natural gas commodity  prices  which  could  affect  expected  future  cash flows  and  the  quantities  of  Company's  proved  reserves  since the estimates of reserves are based on prices and costs existing as of the date when these estimates are made. Lower oil prices or the projections of higher operating and development costs",

        "page_content": "may impair the ability of the Company to economically produce reserves leading to downward reserve revisions.\n\nMany  of  the  factors,  assumptions  and  variables  involved  in estimating proved reserves are subject to change over time and therefore affect the estimates of oil and natural gas reserves. Similar uncertainties concern unproved reserves.\n\nThe determination of whether potentially economic oil and natural gas  reserves  have  been  discovered  by  an  exploration  well  is made within a year after well completion. The evaluation process of a discovery, which requires performing additional appraisal activities on the potential oil and natural gas field and establishing the optimum development plans, can take longer, in most cases, depending on the complexity of the project and on the size of capital expenditures required. During this period, the costs related to  these  exploration  wells  remain  suspended  on  the  balance sheet. In any case, all such capitalised costs are reviewed, at least, on an annual basis to confirm the continued intent to develop, or otherwise to extract value from the discovery.\n\nField reserves will be categorised as proved only when all the criteria for attribution of proved status have been met. Proved reserves can be classified as developed or undeveloped. Volumes are  classified  into  proved  developed  reserves  as  a  consequence of development activity. Generally, reserves are booked as proved developed at the start of production. Major development projects typically take one to four years from the time of initial booking to the start of production.\n\nEstimated proved reserves are used in determining depreciation, amortisation and depletion charges (see the accounting policy for 'UOP depreciation, depletion and amortisation'). Assuming all other variables are held constant, an increase in estimated proved developed reserves for each field decreases depreciation, amortisation  and  depletion  charge  under  the  UOP  method. Conversely, a decrease in estimated proved developed reserves increases depreciation, amortisation and depletion charge.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, including investment properties, are recognized using the cost model and initially stated at their purchase price or construction cost including any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. For assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, the purchase price or construction cost comprises the borrowing costs incurred in the period to get the asset ready for use that would have been avoided if the expenditure had not been made.\n\nIn the case of a present obligation for dismantling and removal of assets and restoration of sites, the initial carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment includes the estimated\n\n(discounted) costs to be incurred when the removal event occurs; a corresponding amount is recognised as part of a specific provision (see the accounting policy for 'Decommissioning and restoration liabilities'). Analogous approach is adopted for present obligations to realise social projects in oil and gas development areas.\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  not  revalued  for  financial reporting purposes.\n\nExpenditures  on  upgrading,  revamping  and  reconversion  are recognised as items of property, plant and equipment when it is probable that they will increase the expected future economic benefits of the asset. Assets acquired for safety or environmental reasons, although not directly increasing the future economic benefits  of  any  particular  existing  item  of  property,  plant  and equipment,  qualify  for  recognition  as  assets  when  they  are necessary for running the business.\n\nDepreciation of tangible assets begins when they are available for use, i.e. when they are in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating as planned. Property, plant and equipment are depreciated on a systematic basis over their useful life. The useful life is the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use by the Company. When tangible assets are composed of more than one significant part with different useful lives, each part is depreciated separately. The depreciable amount is the asset's carrying amount less its residual value at the end of its useful life, if it is significant and can be reasonably determined. Land is not depreciated, even when acquired together with a building. Tangible assets held for sale are not depreciated (see the accounting policy for 'Assets held for sale and discontinued operations'). Changes in the asset's useful life, in its residual value or in the pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset, are accounted for prospectively.\n\nAssets to be handed over for no consideration are depreciated over the shorter term between the duration of the concession or the asset's useful life.\n\nReplacement  costs  of  identifiable  parts  in  complex  assets  are capitalised  and  depreciated  over  their  useful  life;  the  residual carrying  amount  of  the  part  that  has  been  substituted  is charged to the profit and loss account. Nonremovable leasehold improvements are depreciated over the earlier of the useful life of the improvements and the lease term. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are recognised as an expense as incurred. The  carrying  amount  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal; the arising gain or loss is recognized in the profit and loss account.\n\n## Leasing 13\n\nA contract is, or contains, a lease, if the contract conveys the right  to  control  the  use  of  an  identified  asset  for  a  period  of",

The lease term is the non-cancellable period of a contract, together with, if reasonably certain, periods covered by extension options or by the non-exercise of termination options. In  particular,  the  lease  liability  is  initially  recognised  at  the present value of the following lease payments 16 that are not paid at  the  commencement  date:  (i)  fixed  payments  (including  insubstance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable; (ii) variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate 17 ; (iii) amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees; (iv) the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and (v) payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. The latter is determined considering the term of the lease, the frequency and currency of the contractual lease payments, as well as the features of the lessee's economic environment (reflected in the country risk premium assigned to each country where Eni operates).\n\nAfter the initial recognition, the lease liability is measured on an amortised cost basis and is remeasured, normally, as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the related right-of- use asset, to reflect changes to the lease payments due, essentially, to:  (i)  modifications  in  the  lease  contract  not  accounted  as  a separate lease; (ii) changes in indexes or rates (used to determine the variable lease payments); or (iii) changes in the assessment of contractual options (e.g. options to purchase the underlying asset, extension or termination options).\n\nThe  right-of-use  asset  is  initially  measured  at  cost,  which comprises: (i) the amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability; (ii) any initial direct costs incurred by the lessee 18 ; (iii) any lease payments made at or before the commencement\n\ndate, less any lease incentives received; and (iv) an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease. After the initial recognition, the  right-of-use  asset  is  adjusted  for  any  accumulated depreciation 19 ,  any  accumulated  impairment  losses  (see  the accounting policy for 'Impairment of non-financial assets') and any remeasurement of the lease liability.\n\nThe  depreciation  charges  of  the  right-of-use  asset  and  the interest expenses on the lease liability directly attributable to the construction of an asset are capitalised as part of the cost of such asset and subsequently recognised in the profit and loss account through depreciation/impairments or write-off, mainly in the case of exploration assets.\n\nIn the oil and gas activities, the operator of an unincorporated joint operation which enters into a lease contract as the sole signatory recognises on the balance sheet: (i) the entire lease liability if, based on the contractual provisions and any other relevant facts and circumstances, it has primary responsibility for  the  liability  towards  the  third-party  supplier;  and  (ii)  the entire right-of-use asset, unless, on the basis of the terms and conditions of the contract, there is a sublease with the followers. The followers' share of the right-of-use asset, recognised by the operator, will be recovered according to the joint operation's contractual arrangements by billing the project costs attributable to  the  followers  and  collecting  the  related  cash  calls.  Costs recovered from the followers are recognised as 'Other income and revenues' in the profit and loss account and as net cash provided by operating activities in the statement of cash flows. Differently, if a lease contract is signed by all the partners, Eni recognises its share of the right-of-use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet based on its working interest.\n\nIf Eni does not have primary responsibility for the lease liability and, on the basis of the terms and conditions of the contract, there is not a sublease, it does not recognise any right-of-use asset and lease liability related to the lease contract.\n\nWhen  lease  contracts  are  entered  into  by  companies  other than subsidiaries that act as operators on behalf of the other participating companies (the so-called operating companies), consistent  with  the  provision  to  recover  from  the  followers the costs related to the oil and gas activities, the participating companies  recognise  their  share  of  the  right-of-use  assets and the lease liabilities based on their working interest, defined\n\n- (14) The assessment of whether the contract is, or contains, a lease is performed at the inception date, that is the earlier of the date of a lease agreement and the date of commitment by the parties to the principal terms and conditions of the lease.\n\n- (17) Conversely, the other kinds of variable lease payments (e.g. payments that depend on the use of an underlying leased asset) are not included in the carrying amount of the lease liability, but are recognised in the profit and loss account as operating expenses over the lease term.\n- (18) Initial direct costs are incremental costs of obtaining a lease that would not have been incurred if the lease had not been obtained.",

An  asset  is classified as intangible when management is able to distinguish it clearly from goodwill.\n\nIntangible assets are initially recognized at cost as determined by  the  criteria  used  for  tangible  assets  and  they  are  never revalued for financial reporting purposes.\n\nIntangible  assets  with  finite  useful  lives  are  amortised  on  a systematic basis over their useful life; the amortisation is carried out in accordance with the criteria described in the accounting policy for 'Property, plant and equipment'.\n\nGoodwill  and  intangible  assets  with  indefinite  useful  lives  are not amortised. For the recoverability of the carrying amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets see the accounting policy for 'Impairment of non-financial assets'.\n\nCosts of obtaining a contract with a customer are recognised on the balance sheet if the Company expects to recover those costs. The intangible asset arising from those costs is amortised on a systematic basis, that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates, and is tested for impairment.\n\nCosts  of  technological  development  activities  are  capitalised when: (i) the cost attributable to the development activity can be measured reliably; (ii) there is the intention and the availability of financial and technical resources to make the asset available for use or sale; and (iii) it can be demonstrated that the asset is able to generate probable future economic benefits.\n\nThe carrying amount of intangible assets is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from\n\nits use or disposal; any arising gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account.\n\n## Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nNon-financial  assets  (tangible  assets,  intangible  assets  and right-of-use assets) are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts for those assets may not be recoverable.\n\nThe  recoverability  assessment  is  performed  for  each  cash generating  unit  (hereinafter  also  CGU)  represented  by  the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets.\n\nCGUs may include  corporate  assets  which  do  not  generate  cash inflows independently of other assets or group of assets but which contribute to the future cash flows of more CGUs; the portions of corporate assets are allocated to a specific CGU or, if not possible, to a group of CGUs on a reasonable and consistent basis. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, and whenever there is any indication of impairment, at the lowest level within the entity at which it  is  monitored  for  internal  management  purposes.  Right-of-use assets, which generally do not generate cash inflows independently of other assets or groups of assets, are allocated to the CGU to which they belong; the right-of-use assets which cannot be fully attributed to a CGU are considered as corporate assets. The recoverability of the carrying amount of common facilities within the E&P operating segment is assessed by considering the set of recoverable amounts of the CGUs benefiting from the common facility.\n\nThe  recoverability  of  a  CGU  is  assessed  by  comparing  its carrying  amount  with  the  recoverable  amount,  which  is  the higher of the CGU's fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from continuing use of the CGU and, if significant  and  reliably  measurable,  the  cash  flows  expected to be obtained from its disposal at the end of its useful life, after deducting the costs of disposal. The expected cash flows are  determined  on  the  basis  of  reasonable  and  supportable assumptions that represent management's best estimate of the range of economic conditions that will exist over the remaining useful life of the CGU, giving greater weight to external evidence. The  value  in  use  of  CGUs  which  include  material  right-of-use assets  is  calculated,  normally,  by  ignoring  lease  payments included in the measurement of the lease liabilities.\n\nWith  reference  to  commodity  prices,  management  uses  the price scenario adopted for economic and financial projections and for the evaluation of investments over their entire life. In particular, for the cash flows associated with oil, natural gas and petroleum products prices (and prices derived from them), the price scenario is approved by the Board of Directors (see 'Significant accounting estimates and judgments used to take into account the impacts of climate-related risks').\n\nFor impairment test purposes, cash outflows expected to be incurred to guarantee compliance with laws and regulations",

In  particular,  the  discount  rate  used  is  the  Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) adjusted for the specific country risk of the CGU. These adjustments are measured considering information  from  external  parties.  WACC  differs  considering the  risk  associated  with  each  operating  segment/business where the asset operates. In particular, for the assets belonging to the Global Gas & LNG Portfolio (GGP) operating segment, the  Chemical  business,  the  Power  business  and  Plenitude business, the riskiness is determined on the basis of a sample of comparable companies. For the E&P operating segment and R&M business, the riskiness is determined, on a residual basis, as the difference between the risk of Eni as a whole and the risk of other operating segments/ businesses. Value in use is calculated net of the tax effect as this method results in values similar to those resulting from discounting pre-tax cash flows at a pre-tax discount rate derived, through an iteration process, from a post-tax valuation.\n\nWhen  the  carrying  amount  of  the  CGU,  including  goodwill allocated thereto, determined taking into account any impairment  loss  of  the  non-current  assets  belonging  to  the CGU, exceeds its recoverable amount, the excess is recognised as an impairment loss. The impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill; any remaining excess is allocated to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU, up to the related recoverable amount.\n\nWhen an impairment loss  no  longer  exists  or  has  decreased, a  reversal  of  the  impairment  loss  is  recognised  in  the  profit and loss account. The impairment reversal shall not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the\n\nasset in prior years. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period 21 .\n\n## Grants related to assets\n\nGovernment  grants  related  to  assets  are  recognized  by deducting them in calculating the carrying amount of the related assets when there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions attaching to them and the grants will be received.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories, including compulsory stock, are measured at the lower of purchase or production cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course  of  business  less  the  estimated  costs  of  completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale, or, with reference to inventories of crude oil and petroleum products already  included  in  binding  sale  contracts,  the  contractual selling price. Inventories which are principally acquired with the purpose of selling in the near future and generating a profit from fluctuations in price are measured at fair value less costs to sell and any subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in the profit  and  loss  account.  Materials  and  other  supplies  held  for use in production are not written down below cost if the finished products in which they will be incorporated are expected to be sold at or above cost.\n\nThe cost of inventories of hydrocarbons (crude oil, condensates and  natural  gas)  and  petroleum  products  is  determined  by applying the weighted average cost method on a three-month basis, or on a different time period (e.g. monthly), when it is justified by the use and the turnover of inventories of crude oil and petroleum products; the cost of inventories of the Chemical business is determined by applying the weighted average cost on an annual basis.\n\nWhen take-or-pay clauses are included in long-term gas purchase contracts, pre-paid gas volumes that are not withdrawn to fulfill minimum  annual  take  obligations  are  measured  using  the pricing  formulas  contractually  defined.  They  are  recognised within  'Other  assets'  as  'Deferred  costs',  as  a  contra  to 'Trade  and  other  payables'  or,  after  settlement,  to  'Cash  and cash  equivalents'.  The  allocated  deferred  costs  are  charged to the profit and loss account: (i) when natural gas is actually withdrawn - the related cost is included in the determination of the weighted average cost of inventories; and (ii) for the portion which is not recoverable, when it is not possible to withdraw the  previously  pre-paid  gas  within  the  contractually  defined",

Furthermore, the allocated deferred costs are tested for economic recoverability by comparing the related carrying amount and their net realisable value, determined adopting the same criteria described for inventories.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  ESTIMATES  AND  JUDGMENTS: IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nThe  recoverability of non-financial assets  is assessed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable. Such impairment indicators include changes in the Group's business plans,  changes  in  commodity  prices  leading  to  unprofitable performance,  a  reduced  capacity  utilisation  of  plants  and, for  oil  and  gas  properties,  significant  downward  revisions  of estimated  reserve  quantities  or  significant  increase  of  the estimated development and production costs. Determination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management  estimates  on  highly  uncertain  and  complex matters  such  as  future  commodity  prices,  future  discount rates,  future  development  costs  and  production  costs,  the effects of inflation and technology improvements on operating expenses,  production  profiles  and  the  outlook  for  global  or regional  market  supply-and-demand  conditions  also  with reference to the decarbonization process and the effects of changes  in  regulatory  requirements.  The  definition  of  CGUs and  the  identification  of  their  appropriate  grouping  for  the purpose  of  testing  for  impairment  the  carrying  amount  of goodwill, corporate assets as well as common facilities within the E&P operating segment, require judgment by management. In  particular,  CGUs  are  identified  considering,  inter  alia,  how management  monitors  the  entity's  operations  (such  as  by business lines) or how management makes decisions about continuing or disposing of the entity's assets and operations.\n\nSimilar remarks are valid for assessing the physical recoverability of assets recognised on the balance sheet (deferred costs - see also the accounting policy for 'Inventories') related to natural gas volumes not withdrawn under long-term supply contracts with take-or-pay clauses.\n\nThe determination of the expected future cash flows used for impairment analyses takes into account the energy transition process and is based on judgmental assessments of future production  volumes,  prices  and  costs,  considering  available information at the date of review; the expected future cash flows are discounted using a rate which considers the risks specific to the asset. For oil and natural gas properties, the expected future cash flows are estimated based on proved and probable reserves, including, among other elements, production taxes and the costs to be incurred for the reserves yet to be developed. In limited cases (e.g. for mineral interests acquired from third parties as part of a business combination) the expected cash flows  may  take  into  account  also  the  risk-adjusted  possible reserves, if they are considered to determine the consideration\n\ntransferred. The estimate of the future rates of production is based  on  assumptions  related  to  future  commodity  prices, operating  costs,  lifting  and  development  costs,  field  decline rates, market demand and other factors.\n\nMore  details  on  the  main  assumptions  underlying  the determination of the recoverable amount of tangible, intangible and  right-of-use  assets  are  set  out  in  note  15  -  Reversals (Impairments) of tangible and intangible assets and right-of-use assets. Sensitivity of outcomes to alternative scenarios.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\n## Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are classified, on the basis of both contractual cash flow characteristics and the entity's business model for managing them, in the following categories: (i) financial assets measured at amortised cost; (ii) financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (hereinafter also OCI); (iii) financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss (hereinafter also FVTPL).\n\nAt initial recognition, a financial asset is measured at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable; at initial recognition, trade receivables that do not have a significant financing component are measured at their transaction price.\n\nAfter initial recognition, financial assets whose contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding are measured at amortised cost if they are held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows (the so-called hold to collect business model). For financial  assets  measured  at  amortised  cost,  interest  income determined using the effective interest rate, foreign exchange differences and any impairment losses 22 (see the accounting policy for 'Impairment of financial assets') are recognised in the profit and loss account.\n\nConversely,  financial  assets  that  are  debt  instruments  are measured at fair value through OCI (hereinafter also FVTOCI) if they are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets (the so-called hold to collect and sell business model). In these cases: (i) interest income determined using the effective interest rate, foreign exchange differences and any impairment losses (see the accounting policy for 'Impairment of financial assets') are recognised in the profit and loss account; (ii) changes in fair value of the instruments are recognised in equity, within other comprehensive income. The accumulated changes in fair value, recognised in the equity reserve related to other comprehensive income, is  reclassified  to  the  profit  and  loss  account  when  the financial asset is derecognised. Currently the Group does not have any financial assets measured at fair value through OCI.",

        "page_content": "A financial asset represented by a debt instrument that is neither measured  at  amortised  cost  nor  at  FVTOCI,  is  measured  at FVTPL; financial assets held for trading, as well as the portfolios of  financial  assets  managed  and  evaluated  on  a  fair  value basis,  fall  into  this  category.  Interest  income  on  such  financial assets contributes to the related fair value measurement and is recognised  in  'Finance  income  (expense)',  within  'Net  finance income (expense) from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss'.\n\nWhen  the  purchase  or  sale  of  a  financial  asset  is  under  a contract whose terms require delivery of the asset within the time frame established generally by regulation or convention in the marketplace concerned, the transaction is accounted for on the settlement date.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash  and  cash  equivalents  include  cash  on  hand,  demand deposits, as well as financial assets originally due, generally, up to three months, readily convertible to known amount of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe expected credit loss model is adopted for the impairment of financial assets that are debt instruments, but are not measured at FVTPL 23 .\n\nIn particular, the expected credit losses are generally measured by  multiplying:  (i)  the  exposure  to  the  counterparty's  credit risk net of any collateral held and other credit enhancements (Exposure At Default, EAD); (ii) the probability that the default of the counterparty occurs (Probability of Default, PD); and (iii) the percentage estimate of the exposure that will not be recovered in case of default (Loss Given Default, LGD), considering the past experiences and the range of recovery tools that can be activated (e.g. extrajudicial and/or legal proceedings, etc.).\n\nWith  reference  to  trade  and  other  receivables,  Probabilities of Default of counterparties are determined by adopting the internal credit ratings already used for credit worthiness and are periodically reviewed using, inter alia, backtesting analyses; for government entities (e.g. National Oil Companies), the Probability of Default, represented essentially by the probability of a delayed payment, is determined by using, as input data, the country risk premium adopted to determine WACC for the impairment review of non-financial assets.\n\nFor customers without internal credit ratings, the expected credit losses  are  measured  by  using  a  provision  matrix,  defined  by grouping, where appropriate, receivables into adequate clusters to which apply expected loss rates defined on the basis of their historical credit loss experiences, adjusted, where appropriate, to take into account forward-looking information on credit risk of the counterparty or clusters of counterparties 24 .\n\nConsidering  the  characteristics  of  the  reference  markets,\n\nfinancial  assets  with  more  than  180  days  past  due  or,  in  any case, with counterparties undergoing litigation, restructuring or renegotiation, are considered to be in default. Counterparties are considered undergoing litigation when judicial/legal proceedings aimed to recover a receivable have been activated or are going to be activated. Impairment losses of trade and other receivables are  recognised  in  the  profit  and  loss  account,  net  of  any impairment reversal, within the line item of the profit and loss account 'Net (impairment losses) reversals of trade and other receivables'.\n\nThe financing receivables held for operating purposes, granted to associates and joint ventures, for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future and which in substance form part of the entity's net investment in these investees,  are  tested  for  impairment,  first,  on  the  basis  of  the expected credit loss model and, then, together with the carrying amount  of  the  investment  in  the  associate/joint  venture,  in accordance with the criteria indicated in the accounting policy for 'The equity method of accounting'. In applying the expected credit loss model, any adjustments to the carrying amount of long-term interest that arise from applying the accounting policy for 'The equity method of accounting' are not taken into account.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  ESTIMATES  AND  JUDGMENTS: IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nMeasuring  impairment  losses  of  financial  assets  requires management  evaluation  of  complex  and  highly  uncertain elements  such  as,  for  example,  Probabilities  of  Default  of counterparties, the assessment of any collateral or other credit enhancements, the expected exposure that will not be recovered in case of default, as well as the definition of customers' clusters to be adopted. Further details on the main assumptions underlying the measurement of expected credit losses of financial assets are provided in note 8 - Trade and other receivables.\n\n## Investments in equity instruments\n\nInvestments in equity instruments that are not held for trading are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, without subsequent transfer of fair value changes to profit or loss on derecognition of these investments; conversely, dividends from these investments are recognised in the profit and loss account, within the line item 'Income (Expense) from investments', unless they clearly represent a recovery of part of the cost of the investment. In limited circumstances, an investment in equity instruments can be measured at cost if it is an appropriate estimate of fair value.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nAt  initial  recognition,  financial  liabilities,  other  than  derivative financial  instruments,  are  measured  at  their  fair  value,  minus transaction  costs  that  are  directly  attributable,  and  are subsequently measured at amortised cost.",

        "page_content": "The sustainability-linked bonds, i.e. financial liabilities where the interest rate is periodically adjusted to reflect changes in the borrower's performance relative to certain sustainability targets  (the  so-called  ESG  metrics),  are  measured  at amortised cost.\n\nGenerally, changes in the interest rate result in an update of the effective interest rate to be used for the recognition of interest expense.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS: FINANCIAL LIABILITIES\n\nThe  Group's  companies  can  negotiate  with  suppliers  an extension  of  payment  terms,  without  the  involvement  of  a financial institution. In such cases, management judges whether or  not  payables  towards  suppliers  have  to  be  reclassified  as financial liabilities from trade/investing activity payables. In order to make such judgment, management considers if the payment terms differ from the ones that are customary in the industry, any additional security is provided as part of the arrangement as well as any other facts and circumstances. The classification as a financial liability determines: (i) upon reclassification/initial recognition of the liability,  a  non-monetary change in financial liabilities, with no impacts on the statement of cash flows; (ii) upon  the  settlement  of  the  liability,  the  classification  of  the payment  within  net  cash  used  in  financing  activities.  With reference to sustainability-linked bonds, management assesses whether the non-compliance with an ESG metric could adversely impact  operations  and,  therefore,  revenue  generation  and creditworthiness of the Company.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments  and  hedge accounting\n\nDerivative  financial  instruments,  including  embedded  derivatives (see below) that are separated from the host contract, are assets and liabilities measured at their fair value.\n\nWith  reference  to  the  defined  risk  management  objectives  and strategy, the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting requires: (i) the existence of an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument in order to offset the related value changes and the effects of counterparty credit risk do not dominate the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument;  and  (ii)  the  definition  of  the  relationship  between the quantity of the hedged item and the quantity of the hedging instrument (the so-called hedge ratio) consistent with the entity's risk  management  objectives,  under  a  defined  risk  management strategy; the hedge ratio is adjusted, where appropriate, after taking into account any adequate rebalancing. A hedging relationship is discontinued prospectively, in its entirety or a part of it, when it no longer meets the risk management objectives on the basis of which it qualified for hedge accounting, it ceases to meet the other qualifying criteria or after rebalancing it.\n\nWhen  derivatives  hedge  the  risk  of  changes  in  the  fair value of the hedged items (fair value hedge, e.g. hedging of the variability in the fair value of fixed interest rate assets/ liabilities), the derivatives are measured at fair value through\n\nprofit and loss. Consistently, the carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted to reflect, in the profit and loss account, the changes in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk; this applies even if the hedged item should be otherwise measured.\n\nWhen derivatives hedge the exposure to variability in cash flows of the hedged items (cash flow hedge, e.g. hedging the variability in the cash flows of assets/liabilities as a result of the fluctuations of exchange rate), the effective changes in the fair value of the derivatives are initially recognised in the equity reserve related to other comprehensive income and then reclassified to the profit and loss account in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects the profit and loss account.\n\nIf a hedged forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the accumulated changes in fair value of hedging derivatives, recognised  in  equity,  are  included  directly  in  the  carrying amount of the hedged non-financial asset/liability (commonly referred to as a 'basis adjustment').\n\nThe changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as  hedging  instruments,  including  any  ineffective  portion  of changes in fair value of hedging derivatives, are recognised in the profit and loss account. In particular, the changes in the fair value of non-hedging derivatives on interest rates and exchange rates are recognised in the profit and loss account line item 'Finance income (expense)'; conversely, the changes in the fair value of non-hedging derivatives on commodities are recognised in the profit  and  loss  account  line  item  'Other  operating  (expense) income'.  Derivatives  embedded  in  financial  assets  are  not accounted  for  separately;  in  such  circumstances,  the  entire hybrid instrument is classified depending on the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial instrument and the business model for managing it (see the accounting policy for 'Financial assets'). Derivatives embedded in financial liabilities and/or nonfinancial assets are separated if: (i) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract; (ii) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative; and (iii) the entire hybrid contract is not measured at FVTPL.\n\nEni  assesses  the  existence  of  embedded  derivatives  to be  separated  when  it  becomes  party  to  the  contract  and, afterwards, when a change in the terms of the contract that modifies its cash flows occurs.\n\nContracts  to  buy  or  sell  commodities  entered  into  and continued to be held for the purpose of their receipt or delivery in accordance with the Group's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements are recognised on an accrual basis (the so-called normal sale and normal purchase exemption or own use exemption).\n\n## Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are set off on the balance sheet if the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off and",

Financial liabilities are derecognised when they are extinguished, or when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired.\n\n## Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets\n\nA provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount on the balance sheet date. Provisions are recognised when: (i) there is a present obligation, legal or constructive, as a result of a past event; (ii) it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; and (iii)  the  amount  of  the  obligation  can  be  reliably  estimated. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation or to transfer it to third parties on the balance sheet date. The amount recognised  for  onerous  contracts  is  the  lower  of  the  cost necessary  to  fulfill  the  obligations,  net  of  expected  economic benefits deriving from the contracts, and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfill these obligations. Where the effect of the time value is material, and the payment date of the obligations can be reasonably estimated, provisions to be accrued are the present value of the expected cash outflows determined taking into account the risks associated with the obligation. The change in provisions due to the passage of time is recognised within 'Finance income (expense)' in the profit and loss account.\n\nA provision for restructuring costs is recognised only when the Company has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation in the affected parties that it will carry out the restructuring.\n\nProvisions  are  periodically  reviewed  and  adjusted  to  reflect changes in the estimates of costs, timing and discount rates. Changes in provisions are recognised in the same profit and loss\n\naccount line item where the original provision was charged. Contingent  liabilities  are:  (i)  possible  obligations  arising  from past  events,  whose  existence  will  be  confirmed  only  by  the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events  not  wholly  within  the  control  of  the  Company;  or  (ii) present obligations arising from past events, whose amount cannot be reliably measured or whose settlement will probably not  result  in  an  outflow  of  resources  embodying  economic benefits. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements but are disclosed.\n\nContingent  assets,  that  are  possible  assets  arising  from  past events  and  whose  existence  will  be  confirmed  only  by  the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future\n\nevents  not  wholly  within  the  control  of  the  Company,  are  not recognised  in  financial  statements  unless  the  realisation  of economic  benefits  is  virtually  certain.  Contingent  assets  are disclosed  when  an  inflow  of  economic  benefits  is  probable. Contingent  assets  are  assessed  periodically  to  ensure  that developments  are  appropriately  reflected  in  the  financial statements.\n\n## Decommissioning and restoration liabilities\n\nLiabilities  for  decommissioning  and  restoration  costs  are recognized, together with a corresponding amount as part of the related property, plant and equipment, when the conditions indicated  in  the  accounting  policy  'Provisions,  Contingent Liabilities And Contingent Assets' are met.\n\nConsidering the long-time span between the recognition of the obligation  and  its  settlement,  the  amount  recognised  is  the present value of the future expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation. Any change due to the unwinding of discount on provisions is recognised within 'Finance income (expense)'.\n\nSuch liabilities are reviewed regularly to take into account the changes  in  the  expected  costs  to  be  incurred,  contractual obligations, regulatory requirements and practices in force in the countries where the tangible assets are located.\n\nThe effects of any changes in the estimate of the liability are recognised generally as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the related property, plant and equipment; however, if the resulting decrease in the liability exceeds the carrying amount of the related asset, the excess is recognised in the profit and loss account.\n\nAnalogous approach is adopted for present obligations to realise social projects related to operating activities carried out by the Company.\n\n## Environmental liabilities\n\nEnvironmental liabilities are recognised when the Group has a present obligation, legal or constructive, relating to environmental clean-up  and  remediation  of  soil  and  groundwater  in  areas owned or under concession where the Group performed in the past industrial operations that were progressively divested, shut down, dismantled or restructured. Liabilities for environmental costs  are  recognised  when  a  clean-up  is  probable  and  the associated  costs  can  be  reliably  estimated.  The  liability  is measured on the basis of on the costs expected to be incurred in relation to the existing situation at the balance sheet date, considering virtually certain future developments in technology and legislation that are known.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  ESTIMATES  AND  JUDGMENTS: DECOMMISSIONING AND RESTORATION LIABILITIES, ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND OTHER PROVISIONS\n\nThe Group holds provisions for dismantling and removing items of property, plant and equipment, and restoring land or seabed at the end of the oil and gas production activity.

        "page_content": "obligations to dismantle, remove and restore items of property, plant  and  equipment  is  complex.  It  requires  management to  make  estimates  and  judgments  with  respect  to  removal obligations that will come to term many years into the future and  contracts  and  regulations  are  often  unclear  as  to  what constitutes removal. In addition, the ultimate financial impact of environmental laws and regulations is not always clearly known as asset removal technologies and costs constantly evolve in the countries where Eni operates, as do political, environmental, safety and public expectations.\n\nThe  estimates  about  the  timing  and  amount  of  future  cash outflows, any related update as well as the related discounting are based on complex managerial judgments.\n\nDecommissioning  and  restoration  provisions,  recognised  in the financial statements, include, essentially, the present value of  the  expected  costs  for  decommissioning  oil  and  natural gas  facilities  at  the  end  of  the  economic  lives  of  fields,  wellplugging, abandonment and site restoration of the Exploration &  Production  operating  segment.  Any  decommissioning  and restoration  provisions  associated  with  the  other  operating segments' assets, given their indeterminate settlement dates, also considering the strategy to reconvert plants in order to produce low carbon products, are recognised when it is possible to make a reliable estimate of the discounted abandonment costs.  In  this  regard,  Eni  performs  periodic  reviews  for  any changes  in  facts  and  circumstances  that  might  require recognition of a decommissioning and restoration provision.\n\nEni  is  subject  to  numerous  EU,  national,  regional  and  local environmental  laws  and  regulations  concerning  its  oil  and gas operations, production and other activities. They include legislations that implement  international conventions  or protocols.  Environmental  liabilities  are  recognised  when  it becomes probable that an outflow of resources will be required to  settle  the  obligation  and  such  obligation  can  be  reliably estimated.  On  this  regard,  with  reference  to  groundwater treatment  plants,  during  the  2022,  the  enhancement  of  the know-how gained on water contamination trends, as well as the evolution of the positions of the competent authorities, have allowed the definition of a predictive model for estimating the time horizon within which the operations of those plants will be terminated and, therefore, for estimating the cost of managing and monitoring them.\n\nThe reliable determinability is verified on the basis of the available information such as, for example, the approval or filing of the environmental projects to the relevant administrative authorities or the making of a commitment to the relevant administrative authorities, where supported by adequate estimates.\n\nManagement, considering the actions already taken, insurance policies obtained to cover environmental risks and provisions already recognised, does not expect any material adverse effect on Eni's consolidated results of operations and financial position as a result of such laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that there will not be a material adverse impact on Eni's consolidated results of operations and financial position due to: (i) the possibility of an unknown contamination; (ii) the results\n\nof the ongoing surveys and other possible effects of statements required by applicable laws; (iii) the possible effects of future environmental legislations and rules; (iv) the effects of possible technological changes relating to future remediation; and (v) the possibility of litigation and the difficulty of determining Eni's liability, if any, against other potentially responsible parties with respect to such litigations and the possible reimbursements.\n\nIn addition  to  environmental  and  decommissioning  and restoration liabilities, Eni recognises provisions primarily related to legal and trade proceedings. These provisions are estimated on  the  basis  of  complex  managerial  judgments  related  to the amounts to be recognised and the timing of future cash outflows. After the initial recognition, provisions are periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nEmployee  benefits  are  considerations  given  by  the  Group in  exchange  for  service  rendered  by  employees  or  for  the termination of employment.\n\nPost-employment benefit plans, including informal arrangements, are classified as either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans depending on the economic substance of the plan as derived from its principal terms and conditions. Under  defined  contribution  plans,  the  Company's  obligation, which consists in making payments to the State or to a trust or a fund, is determined on the basis of contributions due.\n\nThe liabilities  related  to  defined  benefit  plans,  net  of  any  plan assets, are determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions and charged on an accrual basis during the employment period required to obtain the benefits.\n\nNet interest includes the return on plan assets and the interest cost. Net interest is measured by applying to the liability, net of any plan assets, the discount rate used to calculate the present value  of  the  liability;  net  interest  of  defined  benefit  plans  is recognised in 'Finance income (expense)'.\n\nRemeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, comprising actuarial gains and losses, resulting from changes in the actuarial assumptions  used  or  from  changes  arising  from  experience adjustments, and the return on plan assets excluding amounts included in net interest, are recognised within the statement of comprehensive  income.  Remeasurements  of  the  net  defined benefit liability, recognised within other comprehensive income, are not reclassified subsequently to the profit and loss account. Obligations for long-term benefits are determined by adopting actuarial  assumptions.  The  effects  of  remeasurements  are taken to profit and loss account in their entirety.\n\nThe  liabilities  for  termination  benefits  are  recognised  at  the earlier of the following dates: (a) when the entity can no longer withdraw  the  offer  of  those  benefits;  and  (b)  when  the  entity recognises costs for a restructuring that involves the payment of termination benefits. Such liabilities are measured in accordance with the nature of the employee benefit. Liabilities for termination benefits are determined applying the requirements: (i) for short-",

The cost of the share-based incentive plan is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted and the estimate of the number of shares that eventually vest; the cost is recognised on an accrual basis pro rata temporis over the vesting period, that is the period between the grant date and the settlement date. The fair value of the shares underlying the incentive plan is measured at the grant date, taking into account the estimate of achievement of market conditions (e.g. Total Shareholder Return), and is not adjusted in subsequent periods; when the achievement is linked also to nonmarket conditions, the number of shares expected to vest is adjusted during the vesting period to reflect the updated estimate of these conditions. If, at the end of the vesting period, the incentive plan does not vest because of failure to satisfy the performance conditions, the portion of cost related to market conditions is not reversed to the profit and loss account.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  ESTIMATES  AND  JUDGMENTS: EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS\n\nDefined benefit plans are evaluated with reference to uncertain events and based upon actuarial assumptions including, among others,  discount  rates,  expected  rates  of  salary  increases, mortality rates, estimated retirement dates and medical cost trends. The significant assumptions used to account for defined benefit plans are determined as follows: (i) discount and inflation rates are based on the market yields on high quality corporate bonds (or, in the absence of a deep market of these bonds, on the market yields on government bonds) and on the expected inflation rates in the reference currency area; (ii) the future salary levels of the individual employees are determined including an estimate of future changes attributed to general price levels (consistent  with  inflation  rate  assumptions),  productivity, seniority and promotion; (iii) healthcare cost trend assumptions reflect an estimate of the actual future changes in the cost of the healthcare related benefits provided to the plan participants and are based on past and current healthcare cost trends, including healthcare inflation, changes in healthcare utilisation, changes in health status of the participants and the contributions paid to health funds; and (iv) demographic assumptions such as mortality, disability and turnover reflect the best estimate of these future events for individual employees involved.\n\nDifferences in the amount of the net defined benefit liability (asset),\n\nderiving from the remeasurements, comprising, among others, changes in the current actuarial assumptions, differences in the previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred and differences in the return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest, usually occur. Similar to the approach followed for the fair value measurement of financial instruments, the  fair  value  of  the  shares  underlying  the  incentive  plans  is measured by using complex valuation techniques and identifying, through structured judgments, the assumptions to be adopted.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury  shares,  including  shares  held  to  meet  the  future requirements of the share-based incentive plans, are recognised as deductions from equity at cost. Any gain or loss resulting from subsequent sales is recognised in equity.\n\n## Hybrid bonds\n\nThe perpetual subordinated hybrid bonds are classified in the financial statements as equity instruments considering that the issuer has the unconditional right to defer, until the date of its own liquidation, the repayment of the principal amount and the payment of accrued interest 25 . Therefore, the issuer recognises the cash received from the bondholders, net of costs incurred in issuing the hybrid bonds, as an increase in Eni owners' equity; differently,  the  repayments  of  the  principal  amount  and  the payments of accrued interest (upon the arising of the related contractual payment obligation) are accounted for as a decrease in Eni owners' equity.\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognised on the basis of the following five steps: (i) identifying the contract with the customer; (ii) identifying the performance obligations, that are promises in a contract to transfer goods and/or services to a customer; (iii) determining the transaction price; (iv) allocating the transaction price to each performance obligation on the basis of the relative stand-alone selling prices of each good or service; and (v) recognising revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, that is when a promised good or service is transferred to a customer. A promised good or service is transferred  when  (or  as)  the  customer  obtains  control  of  it. Control can be transferred over time or at a point in time. With reference to the most important products sold by Eni, revenue is generally recognised for:\n\n- \u00b7 crude oil, upon shipment;\n- \u00b7 natural gas and electricity, upon delivery to the customer;\n- \u00b7 petroleum products sold to retail distribution networks, upon delivery to the service stations, whereas all other sales of petroleum products are recognised upon shipment;\n- \u00b7 chemical products and other products, upon shipment.",

In determining the transaction price, the promised amount of consideration is adjusted for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments agreed to by the parties to the contract provides the customer or the entity with a significant benefit of financing the transfer of goods or services to the customer. The promised amount of consideration is not adjusted for the effect of the significant  financing  component  if,  at  contract  inception,  it  is expected that the period between the transfer of a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, the Company estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods and/or services to a customer; in particular, the amount of consideration can vary because of discounts, refunds, incentives, price concessions, performance bonuses, penalties or if the price is contingent on the occurrence or non-occurrence of future events.\n\nIf, in a contract, the Company grants a customer the option to acquire additional goods or services for free or at a discount (e.g. sales incentives, customer award points, etc.), this option gives rise to a separate performance obligation in the contract only if the option provides a material right to the customer that it  would not receive without entering into that contract. When goods or services are exchanged for goods or services which are of a similar nature and value, the exchange is not regarded as a transaction which generates revenue. The payment of accrued interest is required upon the occurrence of events under the issuer's control such as, for example, a distribution of dividends to shareholders.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  ESTIMATES  AND  JUDGMENTS: REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\n\nRevenue from sales of electricity and gas to retail customers includes the amount accrued for electricity and gas supplied between the date of the last invoiced meter reading (actual or estimated) of volumes consumed and the end of the year. These estimates consider information provided by the grid managers about  the  volumes  allocated  among  the  customers  of  the secondary distribution network, about the actual and estimated volumes consumed by customers, as well as internal estimates about volumes consumed by customers. Therefore, revenue is accrued as a result of a complex estimate based on the volumes\n\ndistributed and allocated, communicated by third parties, likely to be adjusted, according to applicable regulations, within the fifth year following the one in which they are accrued, as well as on estimates about volumes consumed by customers. Considering the contractual obligations on the supply delivery points, revenue from sales of electricity and gas to retail customers includes costs for transportation and dispatching and in these cases the gross amount of consideration to which the Company is entitled is recognised.\n\n## Costs\n\nCosts  are  recognised  when  the  related  goods  and  services are sold or consumed during the year, when they are allocated on a systematic basis or when their future economic benefits cannot  be  identified.  Costs  associated  with  emission  quotas, incurred to meet the compliance requirements (e.g. Emission Trading  Scheme)  and  determined  on  the  basis  of  market prices, are recognised in relation to the amounts of the carbon dioxide  emissions  that  exceed  free  allowances.  Costs  related to the purchase of the emission rights that exceed the amount necessary  to  meet  regulatory  obligations  are  recognised  as intangible  assets.  Revenue  related  to  emission  quotas  is recognised when they are sold. Emission rights held for trading are  recognised  within  inventories.  The  costs  incurred  on  a voluntary  basis  for  the  acquisition  or  production  of  forestry certificates, also taking into account the absence of an active market,  are  recognised  in  the  profit  and  loss  account  when incurred.\n\nThe costs for the acquisition of new knowledge or discoveries, the study of products or alternative processes, new techniques or models, the planning and construction of prototypes or, in any case, costs incurred for other scientific research activities or technological development, which cannot be capitalised (see also the accounting policy for 'Intangible assets'), are included in the profit and loss account when they are incurred.\n\n## Exchange differences\n\nRevenues  and  costs  associated  with  transactions  in  foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency by applying the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date and any resulting exchange differences are included in the profit and loss account within 'Finance income (expense)'  or,  if  designated  as  hedging  instruments  for  the foreign currency risk, in the same line item in which the economic effects of the hedged item are recognised.

Nonmonetary items measured at fair value, recoverable amount or net realisable value are retranslated using the exchange rate at the date when the value is determined.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividends are recognised when the right to receive payment of the dividend is established.\n\nDividends and interim dividends to owners are shown as changes in equity when the dividends are declared by, respectively, the shareholders' meeting and the Board of Directors.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nCurrent income taxes are determined on the basis of estimated taxable  profit.  Current  income  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are measured at the amount expected to be paid to (recovered from) the taxation authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences arising between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities and their tax bases, based on tax rates and tax laws that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax assets are recognised when their recoverability is considered probable, i.e. when it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available in the same year as the reversal of the deductible temporary difference. Similarly, deferred tax assets for the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses are recognised to the extent that their recoverability is probable. The carrying amount of the deferred tax assets is reviewed, at least, on an annual basis.\n\nIf  there  is  uncertainty  over  income  tax  treatments,  if  the company concludes it is probable that the taxation authority will  accept  an  uncertain  tax  treatment,  it  determines  the (current and/or deferred) income taxes to be recognised in the financial  statements  consistent  with  the  tax  treatment  used or planned to be used in its income tax filings. Conversely, if the company concludes it is not probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment, the company reflects the effect of uncertainty in determining the (current and/or deferred) income taxes to be recognised in the financial statements.\n\nRelating to the taxable temporary differences associated with investments  in  subsidiaries  and  associates,  and  interests  in joint arrangements, the related deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if the investor is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented within non-current assets and liabilities and are offset at a single entity\n\nlevel if related to offsettable taxes. The balance of the offset, if positive, is recognised in the line item 'Deferred tax assets' and, if  negative,  in  the  line  item  'Deferred  tax  liabilities'.  When  the results of transactions are recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, the related current and deferred taxes are also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  ESTIMATES  AND  JUDGMENTS: INCOME TAXES\n\nThe computation of income taxes involves the interpretation of  applicable  tax  laws  and  regulations  in  many  jurisdictions throughout  the  world.  Although  Eni  aims  to  maintain  a relationship  with  the  taxation  authorities  characterised  by transparency,  dialogue  and  cooperation  (e.g.  by  not  using aggressive tax planning and by using, if available, procedures intended to eliminate or reduce tax litigations), there can be no assurance that there will not be a tax litigation with the taxation authorities where the legislation could be open to more than one  interpretation.  The  resolution  of  tax  disputes,  through negotiations  with  relevant  taxation  authorities  or  through litigation, could take several years to complete. The estimate of liabilities related to uncertain tax treatments requires complex judgments by management. After the initial recognition, these liabilities are periodically reviewed for any changes in facts and circumstances.\n\nManagement makes complex judgments regarding mainly the assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets, related both to deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses, which requires estimates and evaluations about the amount and the timing of future taxable profits.\n\n## Assets held for sale and discontinued operations\n\nNon-current assets and current and non-current assets included within  disposal  groups  are  classified  as  held  for  sale  if  their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition. When there is a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are classified as held for sale, regardless of whether a non-controlling interest in its former subsidiary will be retained after the sale.\n\nNon-current assets held for sale, current and non-current assets included  within  disposal  groups  that  have  been  classified  as held for sale and the liabilities directly associated with them are recognised on the balance sheet separately from other assets and liabilities.\n\nImmediately  before  the  initial  classification  of  a  noncurrent asset and/or a disposal group as held for sale, the non-current asset and/or the assets and liabilities in the disposal group are",

Subsequently, non-current  assets  held  for  sale  are  not  depreciated  or amortised  and  they  are  measured  at  the  lower  of  the  fair value less costs to sell and their carrying amount. If an equityaccounted investment, or a portion of that investment meets the  criteria  to  be  classified  as  held  for  sale,  it  is  no  longer accounted for using the equity method and it is measured at the lower of its carrying amount at the date the equity method is discontinued, and its fair value less costs to sell. Any retained portion of the equity-accounted investment that has not been classified  as  held  for  sale  is  accounted  for  using  the  equity method until disposal of the portion that is classified as held for sale takes place.\n\nAny difference between the carrying amount of the noncurrent assets and the fair value less costs to sell is taken to the profit and loss account as an impairment loss; any subsequent reversal is recognised up to the cumulative impairment losses, including those recognised prior to qualification of the asset as held for sale. Non-current assets classified as held for sale and disposal groups are considered a discontinued operation if they, alternatively: (i) represent a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; (ii) are part of a disposal program of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations; or (iii) are a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The results of discontinued operations, as well as any gain or loss recognised on the disposal, are indicated in a separate line item of the profit and loss account, net of the related tax effects; the economic figures of discontinued operations are indicated also for prior periods presented in the financial statements.\n\nIf events or circumstances occur that no longer allow to classify a non-current asset or a disposal group as held for sale, the non-current asset or the disposal group is reclassified into the original line items of the balance sheet and measured at the lower  of:  (i)  its  carrying  amount  at  the  date  of  classification as held for sale adjusted for any depreciation, amortisation, impairment  losses  and  reversals  that  would  have  been recognised had the asset or disposal group not been classified as held for sale, and (ii) its recoverable amount at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell.\n\n## Fair value measurements\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants (not in a forced liquidation or a distress sale) at the measurement date (exit price). Fair value measurement is based on the market conditions existing at the measurement date and on the assumptions of market participants (marketbased measurement). A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place in the principal market for the asset or liability, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market to which the entity has access, independently from the entity's intention to sell the asset or transfer the liability to be measured. A  fair  value  measurement  of  a  non-financial  asset  takes  into\n\naccount  a  market  participant's  ability  to  generate  economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. Highest and best use is determined from the perspective of market participants, even if the entity intends a different use; an entity's current use of a non-financial asset is presumed to be its highest and best use, unless market or other factors suggest that a different use by market participants would maximise the value of the asset.\n\nThe fair value of a liability,  both  financial  and  non-financial,  or of  the  Company's own equity instrument, in the absence of a quoted price, is measured from the perspective of a market participant  that  holds  the  identical  item  as  an  asset  at  the measurement date. The fair value of financial instruments takes into account the counterparty's credit risk for a financial asset (Credit  Valuation  Adjustment,  CVA)  and  the  Company's  own credit  risk  for  a  financial  liability  (Debit  Valuation  Adjustment, DVA). In the absence of available market quotation, fair value is measured by using valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value are categorized into  the  fair  value  hierarchy  which  is  defined  on  the  basis  of the  significance  of  the  inputs  used  to  measure  fair  value.  In particular, on the basis of the features of the inputs used in the measurement, the fair value hierarchy provides for the following levels:\n\n- a)  level  1:  quoted  prices  (unadjusted)  in  active  markets  for identical assets or liabilities;\n- b) level 2: measurement based on inputs, other than quoted prices included within the previous point, that are observable for the asset or liability under measurement, either directly or indirectly;\n- c)  level 3: unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT  ACCOUNTING  ESTIMATES  AND  JUDGMENTS: FAIR VALUE\n\nFair value measurement, although based on the best available information and on the use of appropriate valuation techniques, is inherently uncertain, requires the use of professional judgment and could result in expected values other than the actual ones.\n\n## 2  Primary financial statements\n\nAssets  and  liabilities  on  the  balance  sheet  are  classified  as current and non-current. Items in the profit and loss account are presented by nature.\n\nThe  balance  sheet  and  the  profit  and  loss  account  are  the same of the ones used in the previous reporting period, except for the redenomination of the line items 'Financial assets held for  trading'  and  'Net  finance  income  (expense)  from  financial assets held for trading' respectively in 'Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss' and 'Net finance income (expense) from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss'; such line items include, respectively, the carrying amounts and the",

Derecognized receivables in 2022 related to the segments Global Gas & LNG Portfolio for \u20ac970 million, Refining & Marketing and Chemical segment for \u20ac928 million and Plenitude & Power segment for \u20ac314 million.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, a trade receivable for the supply of natural gas to the customer Acciaierie d'Italia (ex-ILVA) was outstanding  for  an  amount  of  \u20ac373  million,  past  due  and subject to a repayment plan. A parent company guarantee has been issued by the shareholders of the debtor, which cover the entire amount of the receivable. A risk provision was accrued to  account  for  the  time  value  of  the  receivable  and  other counterparty risks, reflecting a higher probability of default of commercial partners in the current economic environment.\n\nReceivables from joint ventures in exploration and production activities included amounts past due of \u20ac611 million (\u20ac681 million at December 31, 2021) in connection with Eni's activities in Nigeria. Those receivables were in respect to the share of development costs of the joint operators in oil projects operated by Eni, where the Company was bearing upfront all the costs of the initiative and was billing the partners'share through a cash call mechanism. At the balance sheet date, the overdue amount relating to net receivables due to Eni by the Nigerian state  oil  company  NNPC  was  \u20ac475  million  (\u20ac474  million  at December 31, 2021). Approximately a quarter of this amount related to past receivables covered by a repayment plan which was  awarding  Eni  the  share  of  profit  oil  of  the  state-owned company in low-risk 'rig-less' development initiatives with total collection expected by 2024. The residual credit at the end of the year has been discounted. The remaining amounts relate to the net receivables accrued for 2022 operations.\n\nIn  2022,  a  cash  call  exposure  towards  a  privately  held\n\nNigerian oil company amounted to \u20ac242 million (\u20ac195 million at December 31, 2021), whose amounts were stated net of a provision based on the loss given default (LGD) estimated by Eni for defaulting international oil companies. During 2022, the partner suspended the payments of the cash calls, claiming inaccuracy of the billed amounts. Arbitration procedures have been started for the resolution of the dispute.\n\nReceivables  from  other  counterparties  comprised  several miscellaneous  items.  The  largest  amounts  were:  (i)  the recoverable amount of \u20ac566 million (\u20ac538 million at December 31, 2021) of overdue trade receivables owed to Eni by the stateowned oil company of Venezuela, PDVSA, in relation to equity volumes of natural gas supplied by the joint venture Card\u00f3n IV, equally participated by Eni and Repsol. Those trade receivables were divested by the joint venture to the two shareholders. The receivables were stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, calculated with an expected credit loss rate of about 53% to discount the sovereign default risk assuming a structural delay in collecting natural gas invoices. This risked ratio was applied  to  assess  recoverability  of  the  carrying  amount  of the investment and of the long-term interest in the initiative, as described in note 17 - Other financial assets. During the year, under the approval of US authorities within the context of the sanctions framework against Venezuela, receivable from offsetting-transaction  operations  were  carried  out  by  lifting crude oil volumes of PDVSA for 3.1 million barrels, thus capping the expected increase in overdue amounts; (ii) \u20ac309 million of receivables owed to Eni by Italian local distributors of natural gas and electricity to account for the financial support granted by the Italian State to low-income households by reducing the burden  of  energy  bills,  resulting  in  the  Company  collecting lower amounts than what has been billed to natural gas and electricity customers with the balance due to be reimbursed by distributors; (iii) prepayments for services of \u20ac278 million (\u20ac208 million at December 31, 2021); (iv) \u20ac239 million of the amounts to be received from customers following the triggering of the take-or-pay clause of long-term natural gas supply contracts; (v) \u20ac193 million of receivables from factoring companies. The remaining amount was composed of miscellaneous balances for approximately \u20ac753 million.\n\nTrade and other receivables stated in euro and U.S. dollars amounted to \u20ac13,650 million and \u20ac6,102 million, respectively.",

On the other hand, the significant increase in the prices of natural gas and electricity significantly increased  the  Company's  exposures  towards  large  industrial accounts, requiring an upward revision in the credit loss rate to incorporate an increased economic risk. With regard to customers of the Plenitude business line, the recoverability assessment was based on the most updated information relating the performance in credit collection and the ageing of overdue amounts.",

The main depreciation rates adopted  are  included  in  the  following  ranges  and  have remained unchanged compared to 2021:\n\n## (%)\n\n| Buildings                              | 2 - 10   |\n|----------------------------------------|----------|\n| Refining and chemical plants           | 3 - 17   |\n| Gas pipelines and compression stations | 4 - 12   |\n| Power plants                           | 3 - 5    |\n| Other plant and machinery              | 6 - 12   |\n| Industrial and commercial equipment    | 5 - 25   |\n| Other assets                           | 10 - 20  |\n\nPlants and equipment used in the extraction and treatment of hydrocarbons were depreciated according to the UOP method, where  depreciation  depends  on  production  of  the  estimated proved  reserves  according  to  the  US  Securities  &  Exchange Commission 'SEC' criteria (see note 1 - Accounting standards, accounting  estimates  and  significant  judgements,  section Valuation  criteria  -  Mining  activity  -  UOP  depreciation).  The production  plans  associated  with  the  existing  assets  would gradually  deplete  the  SEC  proved  reserves  recorded  at  the balance sheet date, which are expected to be produced within about ten years.\n\nAsset  impairment  losses  were  recognized  at  petrochemical plants  for  production  of  basic  chemicals  and  intermediates (\u20ac385 million) due to lower future expected cash flows driven by  a  deteriorated  industry  outlook  and  Oil  &  Gas  properties (\u20ac279 million) due to downward reseves and costs revisions. Pre-development costs related to projects considered no longer economical  (\u20ac190  million)  were  written-off,  as  expenditures incurred  for  compliance  and  stay-in-business  at  CGUs  of  the refining  sector,  which  were  impaired  in  previous  reporting periods and continued lacking any profitability prospects (\u20ac330 million). More information about Eni's impairment review and the sensitivity of the outcome to different commodities scenarios is reported in note 15 - Reversals (Impairments) of tangible and intangible assets and right-of-use assets.\n\nCurrency translation differences related to subsidiaries utilizing the U.S. dollar as functional currency (\u20ac2,971 million).\n\nInitial recognition and change in estimates include the decrease in  the  asset  retirement  cost  of  the  tangible  assets  of  the Exploration  &  Production  sector,  mainly  due  to  discounting factors and the derecognition of the activities in Angola, partially offset  by  revised  estimates  of  future  decommissioning  and restoration costs and recognition of social projects costs to be\n\nincurred in relation to the commitments undertaken between Eni SpA and the Basilicata region in relation to the oil development program in the Val d'Agri concession area.\n\nChanges in the scope of consolidation related: (i) for \u20ac4,358 million  to  the  derecognition  of  Eni  Angola  SpA,  Eni  Angola Exploration  BV  and  Eni  Angola  Production  BV  which  were contributed to the joint venture Azule Energy Holdings Ltd; (ii) for \u20ac650 million to the acquisition of the company Export LNG Ltd, owner of the Tango FLNG floating liquefaction vessel that is expected to be deployed in Congo, as part of a natural gas development project in Block Marine XII; (iii) to the acquisition for \u20ac532 million of PLT Energia Srl and SEF Srl engaged in the production of electricity from renewable sources and in the supply of energy to retail customers; (iv) for \u20ac189 million to the  companies acquired as part of the Corazon and Guajillo projects; (iv) for \u20ac100 million to the acquisition of the company Energ\u00eda  E\u00f3lica  Boreas  SLU.  More  information  on  business combinations is provided in note 5 - Business combinations and other significant transactions.\n\nOther changes in other tangible assets related for \u20ac169 million to  the  definitive  allocation  of  the  purchase  price  of  some acquisitions made in previous year for which the allocation of the price was made on a provisional basis.\n\nTransfers from E&P tangible assets in progress to E&P UOP wells,  plant  and  equipment  related  for  \u20ac4,190  million  to  the commissioning of wells, plants and machinery primarily in United States, Mexico, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Congo, Iraq, Italy and Nigeria. In  2022,  exploration  and  appraisal  activities  decreased  by \u20ac365 million due to the write-offs of the capitalized costs of exploration wells in progress and completed pending economic and technical evaluation which were found to be unsuccessful, relating to initiatives in Libya, Egypt, Ivory Coast, Vietnam and Kenya.",

As of December 31, 2022, the net book value of the property was \u20ac1,250 million, including  capitalized  exploration  costs  and  pre-development costs. The management considers that the legal risks due to allegations of international corruption in respect of the Resolution Agreement signed on April 29, 2011 by Eni to acquire the license have significantly declined following a favorable outcome of the judicial proceeding before an Italian court. A proceeding featuring an alleged indirect involvement of Eni's subsidiary operating in Nigeria regarding OPL 245 is still pending before a Nigerian Court as disclosed in note 28 - Guarantees, Commitments and Risks - Legal proceedings. The exploration period of the license OPL 245 expired on May 11, 2021. Eni has applied for the conversion of the license into an Oil Mining Lease (OML) before the relevant Nigerian authorities to start the development of the reserves, having  verified  the  contractual  requirements  and  compliance with all terms and conditions. Given the inaction of the Nigerian authorities and a continuing deadlock, in 2020 Eni started an arbitration  before  an  ICSID  tribunal,  the  International  Centre  for Settlement of Investment Disputes, to preserve the value of the investment,  claiming  compensation  of  the  asset's  fair  value.\n\n## 13  Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| (\u20ac million)                                 | F loating pr oduction storage  and offloading v essels  ( FPS O)   | Drilling  rig   | Na v al  facilities and  r elated logistic  bases for oil  and  gas transpor tation   | Motor wa y concessions  and ser vice stations   | Oil and  gas distribution facilities   | Office  buildings   | V ehicles   | Other   | T otal   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------|---------|----------|\n| 2022                                        |                                                                    |                 |                                                                                       |                                                 |                                        |                     |             |         |          |\n| Net carrying amount -

        "page_content": "The impairment loss of goodwill for 2022 was essentially recorded in relation to the Exploration & Production segment.\n\nChanges in the scope of consolidation of goodwill related: (i) for \u20ac412 million to the acquisition of 100% of PLT Energia Srl and SEF Srl; (ii) for \u20ac52 million to the acquisition of 100% of SKGR Energy Single Member SA (now Eni Plenitude Renewables Hellas Single Member SA); (iii) for \u20ac18 million to the acquisition of 100% of the company Energ\u00eda E\u00f3lica Boreas SLU.\n\nInformation about the allocations of goodwill deriving from business combinations are provided in note 5 - Business combinations and other significant transactions.\n\nGoodwill  acquired  through  business  combinations  has  been allocated  to  the  CGUs  that  are  expected  to  benefit  from  the synergies of the acquisition.\n\nThe Plenitude business line engaged in the retail sale of natural gas and electricity, in the electricity generation from renewable sources and in installing and managing a network of charging point for electric vehicles. Plenitude has closed several acquisitions in past reporting years and in 2022, those latter commented in note 5  -  Business  combinations  and  other  significant  transactions, leading to the recognition of significant amounts of goodwill in each of those activities.\n\nGoodwill allocated to the activity of retail sale of natural gas and electricity amounted to \u20ac1,214 million and to test its recoverability has  been  allocated  to  a  single  CGU  encompassing  all  European retail markets,  where  Plenitude  is  operating,  considering  the significant cross-market synergies and geographic integration. The impairment review performed at the balance sheet date confirmed the recoverability of the carrying amount of this CGU comprising the book value of the allocated goodwill.\n\nThe  impairment  review  of  the  CGU  Retail,  including  goodwill,  was performed by comparing the carrying amount to the value in use of the CGU, which was estimated based on the cash flows of the four-year plan approved by management and on a terminal value calculated as the perpetuity of the cash flow of the last year of the plan by assuming a nominal long-term growth rate equal to zero, unchanged from the previous year. These cash flows were discounted by using the posttax  WACC  of  the  retail  business  adjusted  considering  the  country risks of operation comprised in a range of 4.2% - 4.3%. There are no reasonable assumptions of changes in the discount rate, growth rate, profitability or volumes that would lead to zeroing the headroom\n\namounting to about \u20ac7 billion of the value in use of the CGU Retail with respect to its book value, including the allocated goodwill.\n\nIn the renewable business of Plenitude, the CGUs have been identified at  a  significant  project  level,  in  some  cases  grouped  at  company level  for  projects/plants  characterized  by  relevant  synergies.  Cash flows included both those relating to existing assets (acquired or build internally) and those associated with the repowering process in the case of acquired assets. For the acquisitions of 2022, the impairment was assessed by updating the valuation model used for the acquisition which confirmed the recoverability of the goodwill allocated to the complex of the CGUs.\n\nGoodwill allocated to the business of renewables amounted to \u20ac995 million and related to the business combinations made in Italy and in other European markets where operations are being developed (Spain, France, Greece) in the latest two years. To test its recoverability a single CGU has been defined to which the entire goodwill has been allocated.\n\nThe impairment test was performed based on the discounted cash flows  which  comprised  the  financial  projections  of  the  four-year industrial  plan  approved  by  management  and  subsequently  the cash flows associated with the useful lives of the plants. Cash flows have been discounted at sector and country-specific WACC, which were comprised in a range of 5.2% - 5.8%. This test confirmed the recoverability of the book values of the complex of plants generating renewable electricity, including the allocated goodwill. The headroom of \u20ac250 million is being zeroed in case of a one percentage point increase in the WACC.\n\nGoodwill of the E-mobility business of Plenitude of \u20ac718 million recognized in connection with the acquisition in 2021 of the entire share capital of Be Power SpA, which through the subsidiary Be Charge is the second Italian operator in the segment of charging infrastructures for electric mobility, was assessed by updating the valuation model of the operation. The recoverability of the allocated goodwill was tested based on the discounted cash flows of the activity, which comprised the financial projections of the four-year industrial plan approved by management and subsequently the perpetuity  of  the  final  year  of  the  plan  discounted  at  a  WACC  of 10.7% and a growth rate reflecting forecasts for the adoption of EVs. This test confirmed the recoverability of the allocated goodwill and showed a headroom of about \u20ac1 billion which would go to zero under no reasonable assumption.\n\n## 15  Reversals (Impairments) of tangible and intangible assets and right-of-use assets. Sensitivity of outcomes to alternative scenarios.\n\nThe recoverability test of carrying amounts of Oil & Gas cash genenerating units (CGUs) is the most important of the critical accounting estimates in the preparation of Eni's consolidated financial  statements.  This  owes  to  the  relative  weight  of  the invested capital in the sector on total consolidated assets.\n\nFuture  expected  cash  flows  associated  with  the  use  of  Oil &  Gas  assets  are  based  on  management's  judgment  and subjective evaluation about highly uncertain matters like future hydrocarbons prices, assets' useful lives, projections of future\n\noperating and capital expenditures, including CO 2 emission costs relating to geographies where legal obligations are present, the volumes of reserves that will ultimately be recovered and costs of decommissioning Oil & Gas assets at the end of their useful lives. Forecasts of hydrocarbons prices adopted by Eni are based on the review of the fundamentals of supply and demand in the long term, considering the possible evolution of the global energy mix by 2050 in relation to the decarbonisation commitments of the countries and the EU in view of the achievement of the goals of",

        "page_content": "the Paris Agreement, the pace of the energy transition, global economic and demographic growth, the evolution of technologies and the evolution in consumers' preferences. These assumptions are reflected in the corporate strategies and investment decisions, as well as being used in recoverability assessments of the carrying amount of oil & gas projects.\n\nIn the short term, market forward prices are also considered as well as projections made by investment banks and other market observatories.\n\nEni recognizes and fully endorses the transition of the economy towards a low carbon development model and the goals of the Paris COP21 agreements  and  based  on  this,  has  designed  a  strategy to  achieve  the  decarbonization  of  the  Company's  products  and\n\nindustrial processes targeting carbon neutrality by 2050. Consistent with this long-term path and with the progressive evolution of the Company's  product  portfolio,  management  is  assuming  a  midcycle scenario for the price of the Brent crude oil and other price benchmarks, which assumes a balance between global supply and demand, a moderation in economic growth and inflationary pressures and a gradual reduction in the consumption of crude oil in view of achieving the goals of the Paris agreement. The forecast prices of the mid-cycle scenario represent management's best estimate and form the basis for investment decisions, operational plans and recoverability tests of Eni's Oil & Gas assets.\n\nBelow  are  the  main  price  assumptions  for  assessing  the recoverability of Oil & Gas assets, expressed in 2021 real terms.\n\n|                              |   2023 |   2025 |   2030 |   2040 |   2050 |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Brent $/bbl                  |   73   |   63   |     62 |     53 |   43   |\n| TTF natural gas price $mmBtu |   23.5 |   13.5 |      6 |      6 |    5.3 |\n\nThis scenario does not differ significantly from the one adopted in the previous reporting year.\n\nThe  discount  rate  of  the  future  cash  flows  of  the  CGUs  was estimated as the weighted average cost of equity (Ke) and net borrowings, based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model methodology. Specifically,  the  cost  of  equity  considers  both  a  premium  for  the non-diversifiable  market  risk  measured  on  the  basis  of  the  longterm  returns  of  the  S&P500,  and  an  additional  premium  that considers exposure to operational risks of the countries of activity and the risks of the energy transition. For 2022, a Group cost of capital  ('WAAC') of approximately 7% was estimated unchanged compared to 2021 due to a lower cost of equity as a consequence of the reduction in the company's financial risk as a result of the deleveraging process carried out, which offset the increased yields on risk-free assets. The Group WACC is adjusted to account for the specific operational risks of each geography against the average portfolio, where Oil & Gas activities are conducted, by adding a\n\ncorrective factor (WACC adjusted on a country-by-country basis). The impairment test was performed at all of the Group's Oil & Gas CGUs based on the price scenario of the management and the country WACCs described above, which substantially confirmed the carrying amounts of the properties, with the exception of few assets which were marked to their lower recoverable values due to downward reserves revisions and costs updates, recognizing \u20ac432 million of net impairment losses. The impaired assets were mainly\n\nlocated in Congo, Egypt, USA and Algeria, in this latter case due to the release of a concession. Furthermore, a residual goodwill amount was written-off in UK. The post-tax discount rates were comprised in a 6.2% - 11.1% range.\n\nThe  value  in  use  (VIU)  of  the  Oil  &  Gas  CGUs  under  the management's  scenario  assumptions  displayed  a  headroom (difference between VIU and book values) of approximately 100% of the assets' carrying amounts, also discounting the expected expenses associated with the purchase of carbon credits as part of the Company's strategy to decarbonize its Oil & Gas operations through  participation  in  forestry  conservation  projects,  which belong to the REDD+ framework defined by the United Nations. Considering  the  subjectivity  of  the  assumptions  underlying  the estimates of the VIU, management has elaborated the following sensitivity  analysis  of  the  Oil  &  Gas  CGUs  values  to  different scenarios: (i) a linear cut of -10% of hydrocarbon prices in all the years of the cash flows projections; (ii) the projections of hydrocarbon prices and CO 2 costs of the decarbonization scenario Net Zero Emission 2050 (NZE 2050) elaborated by IEA. Those sensitivity analysis included assets of all consolidated entities, joint ventures and associates, excluding V\u00e5r Energi ASA, Azule Energy Holdings Ltd and an asset under arbitration procedure.

The investment in Novamont SpA was reclassified  from  other  investment  to  associate  following  the agreement reached between Eni and Novamont which settled all pending disputes over the management of the Matr\u00ecca joint venture, engaged in the development of renewable chemical feedstocks,  with  an  increase  in  Eni  equity  investment  in Novamont.\n\nThe results of equity-accounted investments by segment are disclosed in note 35 - Segment information and information by geographical area.\n\nThe carrying amounts of equity-accounted investments included differences between the purchase price of acquired interests and their underlying book value of net assets amounting to \u20ac74 million. As at December 31, 2022, the book and market values of Saipem SpA and V\u00e5r Energi ASA, listed on the Italian and the Norwegian stock exchange, respectively, were as follows:\n\n|                                | Saipem SpA   | V\u00e5r Energi ASA   |\n|--------------------------------|--------------|------------------|\n| Number of ordinary shares held | 622,476,192  | 1,574,616,035    |\n| % of the investment            | 31.20        | 63.08            |\n| Share price (\u20ac)                | 1.12750      | 3.19470          |\n| Market value (\u20ac million)       | 702          | 5,030            |\n| Book value (\u20ac million)         | 645          | 763              |\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the market capitalization of Saipem share is higher than the book value of the investment by \u20ac57 million, in line with the corresponding fraction of the investee's book equity. At December 31, 2022, the market capitalization of the V\u00e5r\n\nEnergi ASA share for Eni's stake is \u20ac4,267 million higher than the book value of the investment.\n\nAdditional information is included in note 37 - Other information about investments.\n\n## Other investments\n\n| (\u20ac million)                                 | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Carrying amount - beginning of the year     | 1,294  | 957    |\n| Additions and subscriptions                 | 68     | 175    |\n| Change in the fair value with effect to OCI | 56     | 105    |\n| Currency translation differences            | 42     | 57     |\n| Other changes                               | (258)  |        |\n| Carrying amount - end of the year           | 1,202  | 1,294  |\n\nThe fair value of the main non-controlling interests in non-listed investees  on  regulated  markets,  classified  within  level  3  of  the fair value hierarchy, was estimated based on a methodology that combines  future  expected  earnings  and  the  sum-of-the-parts methodology (so-called residual income approach) and takes into account, inter alia, the following inputs: (i) expected net profits, as a gauge of the future profitability of the investees, derived from the business plans, but adjusted, where appropriate, to include the assumptions that market participants would incorporate; (ii) the cost of capital, adjusted to include the risk premium of the specific country in which each investee operates. A stress test based on a 1% change in the cost of capital considered in the valuation did not produce significant changes at the fair value valuation.\n\nDividend income from these investments is disclosed in note 32 - Income (expense) from investments.\n\nOther changes comprised the reclassification to associates of Novamont SpA for \u20ac220 million.\n\nThe investment book value as of December 31, 2022 primarily related to Nigeria LNG Ltd for \u20ac668 million (\u20ac637 million at December 31, 2021) and Saudi European Petrochemical Co 'IBN ZAHR' for \u20ac108 million (\u20ac124 million at December 31, 2021).\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates as of December 31, 2022 are presented separately in  the  annex  'List  of  companies  owned  by  Eni  SpA  as  of December 31, 2022'.",

        "page_content": "Provisions for site restoration, abandonment and social projects include: (i) for \u20ac7,757 million the present value of the estimated costs that the Company expects to incur for dismantling oil and natural gas production facilities at the end of the producing lives of fields, well-plugging, site clean-up and restoration; (ii) for \u20ac1,060 million the estimated costs for social projects in the Exploration & Production segment, referring for \u20ac664 million to the estimate of the costs for social projects to be incurred following the commitments between Eni SpA and the Basilicata region in relation to the oil development program in the Val d'Agri concession area; (iii) for \u20ac475 million the estimated abandonment costs of production lines and auxiliary logistics structures of the Refining & Marketing business. In 2022, the site restoration and abandonment provision related to the demolition and removal of production lines and auxiliary refining logistics structures for which management assessed the absence of economic prospects in the current scenario of refined products, as well as the non-feasibility of reconversion or reuse options in decarbonisation processes, in line with Eni's strategy of progressive disengagement from the sector. Initial recognition and change in estimate includes the effect of discounting future decommissioning costs of oil & gas plants, net of cost revision estimates of the initial recognition of new projects. The unwinding of discount recognized through profit and loss was determined based on discount rates ranging from -0.3% to 6.1% (from -0.4% to 3.8% at December 31, 2021). Changes in the scope of consolidation mainly refer to the deconsolidation of the Angolan companies merged into JV Azule Energy Holdings Ltd for \u20ac561 million. Main expenditures associated with decommissioning operations are expected to be incurred over a fifty-year period.\n\nProvisions for environmental risks included the estimated costs for environmental clean-up and remediation of soil and groundwater in areas owned or under concession where the Group performed in the past industrial operations that were progressively divested, shut down, dismantled or restructured. The provision was accrued because at the balance sheet date there is a legal or constructive obligation  for  Eni  to  carry  out  environmental  clean-up  and remediation and the expected costs can be estimated reliably. The  provision  included  the  expected  charges  associated  with strict liability related to obligations of cleaning up and remediating polluted areas that met the parameters set by law at the time when the pollution occurred but presently are no more in compliance with  current  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  or  because\n\nEni  assumed  the  liability  borne  by  other  operators  when  the Company acquired or otherwise took over site operations. Those environmental provisions are recognized when an environmental project  is  approved  by  or  filed  with  the  relevant  administrative authorities or a constructive obligation has arisen whereby the Company  commits  itself  to  performing  certain  cleaning-up  and restoration  projects  and  a  reliable  cost  estimation  is  available. In 2022, a provision of \u20ac1,245 million was recognized relating to current  groundwater  remediation  activities  at  brownfield  sites in Italy, estimated on the basis of management experience and accumulated  know-how  on  the  scope,  extent  and  timing  of implementation of the activities and a more certain regulatory framework which made it possible to reliably determine future charges. At December 31, 2022, environmental provision primarily related to Eni Rewind SpA for \u20ac2,391 million and to the Refining & Marketing business line for \u20ac705 million.\n\nLitigation  provisions  comprised  expected  liabilities  associated with legal proceedings and other matters arising from contractual claims, including arbitrations, fines and penalties due to antitrust proceedings  and  administrative  matters.  The  provision  was allocated on the basis of the best estimate of the existing liability at the balance sheet date and refers to the Global Gas & LNG Portfolio segment for \u20ac371 million and to the Exploration & Production segment for \u20ac315 million.\n\nProvisions for uncertain taxes matters related to the estimated losses that the Company expects to incur to settle tax litigations and tax claims pending with tax authorities in relation to uncertainties in applying rules in force were in respect of the Exploration & Production segment for \u20ac194 million.\n\nLoss  adjustments  and  actuarial  provisions  of  Eni's  insurance company Eni Insurance DAC represented the estimated liabilities accrued on the basis for third party claims. Against such liability was  recorded  receivables  of  \u20ac78  million  recognized  towards insurance companies for reinsurance contracts.\n\nProvisions for losses on investments included provisions relating to investments whose loss exceeds the equity and primarily related to Industria Siciliana Acido Fosforico - ISAF - SpA (in liquidation) for \u20ac154 million.\n\nProvisions  for  Everen  (ex  OIL)  insurance  coverage  included insurance premiums which will be charged to Eni in the next five years by the mutual insurance company in which Eni participates together with other oil companies.\n\n## 22  Provisions for employee benefits\n\n| (\u20ac million)                            |   December 31, 2022 |   December 31, 2021 |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Italian defined benefit plans          |                 177 |                 227 |\n| Foreign defined benefit plans          |                 142 |                 129 |\n| FISDE, foreign medical plans and other |                 126 |                 162 |\n| Defined benefit plans                  |                 445 |                 518 |\n| Other benefit plans                    |                 341 |                 301 |\n| Provision for employee benefits        |                 786 |                 819 |",

Carryforward tax losses were \u20ac14,000 million and \u20ac11,932 million at Italian subsidiaries and foreign subsidiaries, respectively. Deferred  tax  assets  gross  of  accumulated  write-downs recognized on these losses amounted to \u20ac3,360 million and \u20ac3,392 million, respectively.\n\nItalian  taxation  law  allows  the  carry-forward  of  tax  losses indefinitely.  Foreign  taxation  laws  generally  allow  the  carryforward of tax losses over a period longer than five years, and in many cases, indefinitely. A tax rate of 24% was applied to tax\n\nlosses of Italian subsidiaries to determine the portion of the carry-forwards tax losses. The corresponding average rate for foreign subsidiaries was 28.4%.\n\nAccumulated  write-downs  of  deferred  tax  assets  related  to Italian companies for \u20ac3,951 million and non-Italian companies for \u20ac2,219 million.\n\nThe reduction of accumulated write-downs of \u20ac2,434 million was driven by an improved profitability outlook at Italian subsidiaries leading  to  the  recognition  of  higher  deferred  tax  assets  in connection with expected higher taxable earnings.\n\nTaxes are also described in note 33 - Income taxes.",

        "page_content": "Eni is exposed to the market risk, which is the risk that changes in prices of energy commodities, exchange rates and interest rates could reduce the expected cash flows or the fair value of  the  assets.  Eni  enters  into  financial  and  commodities derivatives traded on organized markets (like MTF and OTF) and into commodities derivatives traded over the counter (swaps, forward, contracts for differences and options on commodities) to reduce this risk in relation to the underlying commodities, currencies or interest rates and, to a limited extent, in compliance with internal authorization thresholds, with speculative purposes to profit from expected market trends.\n\nDerivatives  fair  values  were  estimated  based  on  market quotations  provided  by  primary  info-provider  or,  alternatively, appropriate  valuation  techniques  generally  adopted  in  the marketplace.\n\nFair  values  of  non-hedging  derivatives  essentially  comprised forward sale contracts of natural gas for physical delivery which were not entitled to the own use exemption, as well as derivatives for proprietary trading activities.\n\nFair value of cash flow hedge derivatives essentially related to commodity hedges were entered into by the Global Gas & LNG Portfolio segment. These derivatives were entered into to hedge variability in future cash flows associated with highly probable future  trade  transactions  of  gas  or  electricity  or  on  already contracted trades due to different indexation mechanisms of supply costs versus selling prices. A similar scheme applies to  exchange  rate  hedging  derivatives.  The  existence  of  a relationship between the hedged item and the hedging derivative is checked at inception to verify eligibility for hedge accounting\n\nby observing the offset in changes of the fair values at both the  underlying  commodity  and  the  derivative.  The  hedging relationship is also stress-tested against the level of credit risk of the counterparty in the derivative transaction. The hedge ratio is  defined  consistently  with  the  Company's  risk  management objectives,  under  a  defined  risk  management  strategy.  The hedging relationship is discontinued when it ceases to meet the qualifying criteria and the risk management objectives on the basis of which hedge accounting has initially been applied.\n\nThe effects of the measurement at fair value of cash flow hedge derivatives are given in note 26 - Equity. Information on hedged risks and hedging policies is disclosed in note 28 - Guarantees, commitments and risks - Risk factors.\n\nDuring  2021,  Eni  entered  into  sustainability-linked  interest currency swaps with leading banking institutions which provide for a cost adjustment mechanism linked to the achievement of certain sustainability targets. At December 31, 2022, the fair value of these contracts amounted to positive \u20ac39 million.\n\nIn 2022, the exposure to the exchange rate risk deriving from securities denominated in U.S. dollars included in the strategic liquidity portfolio amounting to \u20ac2,723 million was hedged by using,  in  a  fair  value  hedge  relationship,  negative  exchange differences  for  \u20ac107  million  resulting  on  a  portion  of  bonds denominated in U.S. dollars amounting to \u20ac2,684 million.\n\nThe  offsetting  of  financial  derivatives  related  to  Eni  Global Energy Markets SpA.\n\nDuring  2022,  there  were  no  transfers  between  the  different hierarchy levels of fair value.\n\nHedging derivative instruments are disclosed below:\n\n|                              | December 31, 2022                           | December 31, 2022                        | December 31, 2022                          | December 31, 2021                           | December 31, 2021                        | December 31, 2021                          |\n|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| (\u20ac million)                  | Nominal  amount of the  hedging  instrument | Change  in fair value (effective  hedge) | Change in fair  value (ineffective  hedge) | Nominal  amount of the  hedging  instrument | Change  in fair value (effective  hedge) | Change in fair  value (ineffective  hedge) |\n| Cash flow hedge derivatives  |                                             |                                          |                                            |                                             |                                          |                                            |\n| Derivatives on commodity     |                                             |                                          |                                            |                                             |                                          |                                            |\n| - Over the counter           | 83                                          | (4)                                      |                                            | (461)                                       | (2,016)                                  | (46)                                       |\n| - Future                     | 1,350                                       | (3,912)                                  | 275                                        | (364)                                       | 534                                      | (5)                                        |\n| - Other                      |                                             | 9                                        |                                            |                                             |                                          |                                            |\n|                              | 1,433                                       | (3,907)                                  | 275                                        | (825)                                       | (1,482)                                  | (51)                                       |\n| Derivatives on interest rate |                                             |                                          |                                            |                                             |                                          |                                            |\n| - Interest rate swap         | 127                                         | 24                                       |                                            | 84                                          | 3                                        |                                            |\n|                              | 127                                         | 24                                       |                                            | 84                                          | 3                                        |                                            |\n|                              | 1,560                                       | (3,883)                                  | 275                                        | (741)                                       | (1,479)                                  | (51)                                       |",

The obligations of  the  guarantor  towards  the  Government  of  Mozambique are  unlimited  (non-quantifiable  commitments),  whereas  they provide  a  maximum  liability  of  \u20ac1,405  million  in  respect  of third-parties claims. This guarantee will be effective until the completion of any decommissioning activity related to both the development plan of Coral as well as any development plan to be executed within Area 4 (particularly the Mamba project).

The increase was primarily determined by exchange rate differences; (ii) a parent company guarantee of \u20ac3,748 million (\u20ac3,532 million at December 31, 2021) given on behalf of Eni Abu Dhabi Refining & Trading BV following the Share Purchase Agreement to acquire from Abu Dhabi National  Oil  Company  (ADNOC)  a  20%  equity  interest  in  ADNOC Refining and the set-up of ADNOC Global Trading Ltd dedicated to marketing petroleum products. The parent company guarantee still outstanding has been issued to guarantee the obligations set out in the Shareholders Agreements and will remain in force as long as the investment is maintained; (iii) commitments of the Plenitude business line for the purchase of renewable energy projects in Spain, United States and Italy for \u20ac210 million.\n\nRisks relate to potential risks associated with: (i) contractual assurances  given  to  acquirers  of  certain  investments  and businesses of Eni for \u20ac262 million (\u20ac246 million at December 31, 2021); (ii) assets of third parties under the custody of Eni for \u20ac957 million (\u20ac688 million at December 31, 2021).\n\n## Other commitments and risks\n\nA parent company guarantee was issued on behalf of Card\u00f3n IV SA (Eni's interest 50%), a joint venture operating the Perla gas  field  located  in  Venezuela,  for  the  supply  to  PDVSA  GAS of  the  volumes  of  gas  produced  by  the  field  until  the  end  of the concession agreement (2036). In case of failure on part of the operator to deliver the contractual gas volumes out of production, the claim under the guarantee will be determined by applying the local legislation. Eni's share (50%) of the contractual volumes of gas to be delivered to PDVSA GAS amounted to a total of around \u20ac13 billion. Notwithstanding this amount does not  properly  represent  the  guarantee  exposure,  nonetheless such amount represents the maximum financial exposure at risk for Eni. A similar guarantee was issued by PDVSA on behalf of Eni for the fulfillment of the purchase commitments of the gas volumes by PDVSA GAS.\n\nOther commitments include the agreements entered into for forestry initiatives, implemented within the low carbon strategy defined by the Company, concerning the commitments for the purchase, until 2038, of carbon credits produced and certified\n\naccording to international standards by subjects specialized in forest conservation programs.\n\nOn February 5, 2021, EniServizi SpA (EniServizi) signed on behalf of Eni SpA (Eni) an addendum to the lease contract of a property to be built signed between Eni and the management company of the real estate investment fund owner of the new complex under construction in San Donato Milanese (the Property), including the postponement of the delivery date of the property from July 28, 2020 to December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, the real estate complex was not yet available to Eni which, therfore, claimed penalties for late delivery of approximately \u20ac18 million to the landlord, as provided for in the lease agreement and supported by a first demand guarantee. In this context, the landlord complained that the delays would not be entirely attributable to itself because of the following reasons: (i) effects of the pandemic crisis; (ii) alleged defects found in relation to the preparatory works for the sale of the area; (iii) alleged design defects. Also on the basis of these complaints, the landlord expressed its intention to charge EniServizi and/or Eni at least part of the claims made against the owner.  In  this  regard,  confirming  the  complete  impartiality  and neutrality of Eni and EniServizi with respect to the contractual relationships between the landlord and its contractor (confirmed in  several  communications),  the  Company  reaffirmed  that  the delays relating to points (i) and (ii) have already been object of a settlement in the aforementioned agreement of February 5, 2021 and therefore comprised in the updated delivery date of December 31, 2021. With regard to point (iii), the landlord in the purchase contract of the area declared to accept the project without any reservation or exception assuming all the consequent risks and responsibilities, as well as to not to be entitled to any higher payment, compensation or extension of terms for errors, omissions or other defects in the project. The above concerns outof-court communications between the parties, as no litigation has been initiated to date. At the moment, therefore, it is not known what could be the object, the reasons or the probative allegations of a possible legal action brought by the counterparty.\n\nIn  addition,  Eni,  subsequent  to  the  divestiture  of  certain  Eni assets,  including  businesses  and  investments,  is  liable  for certain non-quantifiable risks related to contractual guarantees against certain contingent liabilities deriving from tax, social security contributions, environmental issues and other matters applicable to periods during which such assets were operated by Eni or as a result of the loss of control in subsidiaries. Eni believes such matters will not have a material adverse effect on Eni's results of operations and cash flow.",

        "page_content": "## Risk factors\n\nThe  following  is  the  description  of  financial  risks  and  their management and control. With reference to the issues related to credit risk, the parameters adopted for the determination of expected losses and the estimates of the probability of default and the loss given default have been updated to take into account the impacts associated with the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the current energy crisis.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2022,  the  Company  retains  liquidity reserves that management deems enough to meet the financial obligations due in the next eighteen months.\n\n## Financial risks\n\nFinancial risks are managed in respect of the guidelines issued by the Board of Directors of Eni SpA in its role of directing and setting the risk limits, targeting to align and centrally coordinate Group  companies'  policies  on  financial  risks  ('Guidelines  on financial  risks  management  and  control').  The  'Guidelines' define  for  each  financial  risk  the  key  components  of  the management and control process, such as the target of the risk management, the valuation methodology, the structure of limits, the relationship model and the hedging and mitigation instruments.\n\n## Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the possibility that changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates or commodity prices will adversely affect the value of the Group's financial assets, liabilities or expected future  cash  flows.  The  Company  actively  manages  market risk in accordance with a set of policies and guidelines that provide  a  centralized  model  of  handling  finance,  treasury and  risk  management  transactions  based  on  the  Company's departments  of  operational  finance:  the  parent  company's (Eni  SpA)  finance  department,  Eni  Finance  International  SA and Banque Eni SA, which is subject to certain bank regulatory restrictions preventing the Group's exposure to concentrations of credit risk, and Eni Trade & Biofuels SpA and Eni Global Energy  Markets  SpA  that  are  in  charge  to  execute  certain activities relating to commodity derivatives. In particular, Eni Corporate  finance  department  and  Eni  Finance  International SA manage subsidiaries' financing requirements in and outside Italy,  respectively,  covering  funding  requirements  and  using available surpluses. All transactions concerning currencies and derivative contracts on interest rates and currencies different from commodities of Eni are managed by Eni Corporate finance department, while Eni Trade & Biofuels SpA and Eni Global Energy  Markets  SpA  execute  the  negotiation  of  commodity derivatives  over  the  market.  Eni  SpA,  Eni  Trade  &  Biofuels SpA  and  Eni  Global  Energy  Markets  SpA  (also  through  the subsidiary Eni Trading & Shipping Inc) perform trading activities in  financial  derivatives  on  external  trading  venues,  such  as European  and  non-European  regulated  markets,  Multilateral Trading  Facility  (MTF),  Organized  Trading  Facility  (OTF),  or similar and brokerage platforms (i.e. SEF), and over the counter\n\non a bilateral basis with external counterparties. Other legal entities  belonging  to  Eni  that  require  financial  derivatives enter  into  these  transactions  through  Eni  Trade  &  Biofuels SpA, Eni Global Energy Markets SpA and Eni SpA based on the relevant asset class expertise. Eni uses derivative financial instruments  (derivatives)  in  order  to  minimize  exposure  to market risks related to fluctuations in exchange rates relating to those transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency (the euro) and interest rates, as well as to optimize exposure to commodity prices fluctuations taking into account the currency in which commodities are quoted. Eni monitors every activity in derivatives classified as risk-reducing directly or indirectly related to covered industrial assets, so as to effectively optimize the risk profile to which Eni is exposed or could be exposed. If the result of the monitoring shows those derivatives should not be considered as risk reducing, these derivatives are reclassified in proprietary trading. As proprietary trading is considered separately from the other activities in specific portfolios of Eni Trade & Biofuels SpA and Eni Global Energy  Markets  SpA,  their  exposure  is  subject  to  specific controls, both in terms of Value at Risk (VaR) and Stop Loss and in terms of nominal gross value. For Eni, the gross nominal value of proprietary trading activities is compared with the limits set by the relevant international standards. The framework defined by Eni's policies and guidelines provides that the valuation and control of market risk is performed on the basis of maximum tolerable  levels  of  risk  exposure  defined  in  terms  of  limits  of Stop Loss, which expresses the maximum tolerable amount of losses associated with a certain portfolio of assets over a predefined time horizon; limits of revision strategy, which consist in the triggering of a revision process of the strategy in the event of exceeding the level of profit and loss given and VaR, which measures the maximum potential loss of the portfolio, given a certain confidence level and holding period, assuming adverse changes in market variables and taking into account the correlation among the different positions held in the portfolio. Eni's finance department defines the maximum tolerable levels of risk exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in terms of VaR, pooling Group companies' risk positions maximizing, when possible, the benefits of the netting activity. Eni's calculation and valuation techniques for interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks are in accordance with banking standards, as established by the Basel Committee for bank activities surveillance. Tolerable levels of risk are based on a conservative approach, considering the industrial nature of  the  Company.  Eni's  guidelines  prescribe  that  Eni  Group companies minimize such kinds of market risks by transferring risk exposure to the parent company finance department. Eni's guidelines  define  rules  to  manage  the  commodity  risk  aiming at  optimizing  core  activities  and  pursuing  preset  targets  of stabilizing industrial and commercial margins. The maximum tolerable level of risk exposure is defined in terms of VaR, limits of  revision  strategy,  Stop  Loss  and  volumes  in  connection with exposure deriving from commercial activities, as well as exposure deriving from proprietary trading, exclusively managed",

        "page_content": "by Eni Trade & Biofuels SpA and Eni Global Energy Markets SpA. Internal mandates to manage the commodity risk provide for a mechanism of allocation of the Group maximum tolerable risk level to each business unit. In this framework, Eni Trade & Biofuels SpA and Eni Global Energy Markets SpA, in addition to managing risk exposure associated with their own commercial activity and proprietary trading, pool the requests for negotiating commodity derivatives and execute them in the marketplace.\n\nAccording to the targets of financial structure included in the financial plan approved by the Board of Directors, Eni decided to retain a cash reserve to face any extraordinary requirement. Eni's  finance  department,  with  the  aim  of  optimizing  the efficiency  and  ensuring  maximum  protection  of  capital, manages such reserve and its immediate liquidity within the limits assigned. The management of strategic cash is part of the asset management pursued through transactions on own risk  in  view  of  optimizing  financial  returns,  while  respecting authorized risk levels, safeguarding the Company's assets and retaining quick access to liquidity. The four different market risks, whose management and control have been summarized\n\nabove, are described below.\n\n## Market risk - Exchange rate\n\nExchange rate risk derives from the fact that Eni's operations are conducted in currencies other than euro (mainly U.S. dollar). Revenues  and  expenses  denominated  in  foreign  currencies may  be  significantly  affected  by  exchange  rate  fluctuations due to conversion differences on single transactions arising from the time lag existing between execution and definition of relevant contractual terms (economic risk) and conversion of foreign  currency-denominated  trade  and  financing  payables and receivables (transactional risk). Exchange rate fluctuations affect the Group's reported results and net equity as financial statements of subsidiaries denominated in currencies other than euro are translated from their functional currency into euro.  Generally,  an  appreciation  of  U.S.  dollar  versus  euro has a positive impact on Eni's results of operations, and vice versa. Eni's foreign exchange risk management policy is to minimize transactional exposures arising from foreign currency movements and to optimize exposures arising from commodity risk.  Eni  does  not  undertake  any  hedging  activity  for  risks deriving from the translation of foreign currency denominated profits or assets and liabilities of subsidiaries, which prepare financial statements in a currency other than euro, except for\n\nsingle transactions to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Effective  management  of  exchange  rate  risk  is  performed within Eni's finance departments, which pool Group companies' positions,  hedging  the  Group  net  exposure  by  using  certain derivatives, such as currency swaps, forwards and options. Such derivatives are evaluated at fair value based on market prices provided by specialized info-providers. The VaR techniques are based on variance/covariance simulation models and are used to monitor the risk exposure arising from possible future changes in market values over a 24-hour period within a 99% confidence level and a 20-day holding period.\n\n## Market risk - Interest rate\n\nChanges in  interest  rates  affect  the  market  value  of  financial assets and liabilities  of  the  Company  and  the  level  of  finance charges.\n\nEni's interest rate risk management policy is to minimize risk with  the  aim  to  achieve  financial  structure  objectives  defined and  approved  in  management's  'Finance  plan'.  The  Group's central departments pool borrowing requirements of the Group companies in order to manage net positions and fund portfolio developments  consistent  with  management  plan,  thereby maintaining a level of risk exposure within prescribed limits. Eni enters into interest rate derivative transactions, in particular interest rate swaps, to effectively manage the balance between fixed and floating rate debt. Such derivatives are evaluated at fair value based on market prices provided from specialized sources. VaR deriving from interest rate exposure is measured daily based on a variance/covariance model, with a 99% confidence level and a 20-day holding period.\n\n## Market risk - Commodity\n\nPrice  risk  of  commodities  is  identified  as  the  possibility  that fluctuations in the price of materials and basic products produce significant changes in Eni's operating margins, determining an impact  on  the  economic  result  such  as  to  compromise  the targets  defined  in  the  four-year  plan  and  in  the  budget.  The commodity price risk arises in connection with the following exposures:  (i)  strategic  exposure:  exposures  directly  identified by the Board of Directors as a result of strategic investment decisions or outside the planning horizon of risk management. These exposures include, for example, exposures associated with the program for the production of Oil & Gas reserves, longterm gas supply contracts for the portion not balanced by sales contracts (already stipulated or expected), the margin deriving from the chemical transformation process, the refining margin and  long-term  storage  functional  to  the  logistic-industrial activities;  (ii)  commercial  exposure:  concerns  the  exposures related to components underlying the contractual arrangements of industrial and commercial (contracted exposure) activities normally related to the time horizon of the four-year plan and budget, components not yet under contract but which will be with  reasonable  certainty  (commitment  exposure)  and  the relevant activities of risk management. Commercial exposures are  characterized  by  a  systematic  risk  management  activity conducted based on risk/return assumptions by implementing one  or  more  strategies  and  subjected  to  specific  risk  limits (VaR, revision strategy limits and Stop Loss). In particular, the commercial exposures include exposures subjected to assetbacked hedging activities, arising from the flexibility/optionality of assets;  (iii) proprietary  trading  exposure:  transactions carried out autonomously for speculative purposes in the short term and normally not aimed at delivery with the intention of exploiting favorable price movements, spreads and/or volatility implemented  autonomously  and  carried  out  regardless  of the  exposures  of  the  commercial  portfolio  or  physical  and contractual assets. They are usually carried out in the short-",

Strategic risk  is  not  subject  to  systematic  activity  of  management/ coverage that is eventually carried out only in case of specific market or business conditions. Because of the extraordinary nature, hedging activities related to strategic risks are delegated to  the  top  management,  previously  authorized  by  the  Board of  Directors.  With  prior  authorization  from  the  Board  of Directors, the exposures related to strategic risk can be used in combination with other commercial exposures in order to exploit opportunities  for  natural  compensation  between  the  risks (natural  hedge)  and  consequently  reduce  the  use  of  financial derivatives (by activating logics of internal market). With regard to exposures of a commercial nature, Eni's risk management target is to optimize the 'core' activities and preserve the economic/ financial results. Eni manages the commodity risk through the trading units (Eni Trade & Biofuels SpA and Eni Global Energy Markets SpA) and the exposure to commodity prices through the Group's finance departments by using financial derivatives traded  on  the  regulated  markets  MTF,  OTF  and  financial derivatives traded over the counter (swaps, forward, contracts for differences and options on commodities) with the underlying commodities  being  crude  oil,  gas,  refined  products,  power  or emission  certificates.  Such  financial  derivatives  are  valued  at fair value based on market prices provided from specialized sources or, absent market prices, based on estimates provided by brokers or suitable valuation techniques. VaR deriving from commodity exposure is measured daily based on a historical simulation technique, with a 95% confidence level and a one-day holding period.\n\n## Market risk - Strategic liquidity\n\nMarket risk deriving from liquidity management is identified as  the  possibility  that  changes  in  prices  of  financial\n\ninstruments (bonds, money market instruments and mutual funds)  affect  the  value  of  these  instruments  in  case  of sale or when they are valued at fair value in the financial statements.  The  setting  up  and  maintenance  of  the liquidity  reserve  are  mainly  aimed  to  guarantee  a  proper financial flexibility. Liquidity should allow Eni to fund any extraordinary need (such as difficulty in access to credit, exogenous  shock,  macroeconomic  environment,  as  well as merger and acquisitions) and must be dimensioned to provide a coverage of short-term debts and of medium and long-term  finance  debts  due  within  a  time  horizon  of  24 months. In order to manage the investment activity of the strategic liquidity, Eni defined a specific investment policy with aims and constraints in terms of financial activities and operational  boundaries,  as  well  as  governance  guidelines regulating management and control systems. In particular, strategic liquidity management is regulated in terms of VaR (measured based on a parametrical methodology with a oneday holding period and a 99% confidence level), Stop Loss and other operating limits in terms of concentration, issuing entity,  business  segment,  country  of  emission,  duration, ratings and type of investing instruments in portfolio, aimed to minimize market and liquidity risks. Financial leverage or short selling is not allowed. Activities in terms of strategic liquidity management started in the second half of the year 2013 (Euro portfolio) and throughout the course of the year 2017 (U.S. dollar portfolio). As at 31 December 2022, the rating  of  the  Strategic  liquidity  investment  portfolio  was A/A-, showing a slightly improving compared to 2021.\n\nThe following tables show amounts in terms of VaR, recorded in  2022  (compared  with  2021),  relating  to  interest  rate  and exchange  rate  risks  in  the  first  section  and  commodity  risk (aggregated by type of exposure). Regarding the management of strategic liquidity, the table reports the sensitivity to changes in interest rate.",

Credit  risk  arising  from  financial  counterparties  is  managed by the Eni's operating finance departments, Eni Global Energy Markets SpA (EGEM), Eni Trade & Biofuels SpA (ETB) and Eni Trading  &  Shipping  Inc  (ETS  Inc)  specifically  for  commodity derivatives transactions,  as  well  as  by  companies  and business areas limitedly to physical transactions with financial counterparties, consistently with the Group centralized finance model. Eligible financial counterparties are closely monitored by each counterpart and by group of belonging to check exposures against the limits assigned daily and the expected loss analysis and the concentration periodically.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that suitable sources of funding for the Group may not be available, or the Group is unable to sell its assets in the marketplace in order to meet short-term finance requirements and to settle obligations. Such a situation would negatively affect Group results, as it would result in the Company incurring higher borrowing expenses to meet its obligations or under the worst of conditions the inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.\n\nEni's risk management targets include the maintaining of an adequate level of financial resources readily available to deal with external shocks (drastic changes in the scenario, restrictions on access to capital markets, etc.) or to ensure an adequate level\n\nexperiences and information from specialized primary info providers. The probability of default related to State Entities or  their  closely  related  counterparties  (e.g.  National  Oil Company), essentially represented by the probability of late payments, is determined by using the country risk premiums adopted for the purposes of the determination of the WACCs for the impairment of non-financial assets. Finally, for retail positions  without  specific  ratings,  risk  is  determined  by distinguishing customers in homogeneous risk clusters based on historical series of data relating to payments, periodically updated.\n\nof  operational  flexibility  for  the  development  projects  of  the Company. The strategic liquidity reserve is employed in shortterm marketable financial assets, favoring investments with very low risk profile. At present, the Group believes to have access to more than sufficient funding to meet the current foreseeable borrowing requirements due to available cash on hand financial assets and lines of credit and the access to a wide range of funding opportunities which can be activated through the credit system and capital markets.\n\nDue to the increased volatility of commodity markets and the related  higher  financial  commitment  linked  to  the  margin  of commodity derivatives, Eni has further strengthened its financial flexibility through the activation of new financing lines.\n\nEni has in place a program for the issuance of Euro Medium-Term Notes up to \u20ac20 billion, of which \u20ac15.8 billion were drawn as of December 31, 2022 (\u20ac13.4 billion drawn by Eni SpA). The Group has credit ratings of A- outlook Stable and A-2, respectively, for long and short-term debt, assigned by Standard & Poor's; Baa1 outlook Negative and P-2, respectively, for long and short-term debt, assigned by Moody's; A- outlook Stable and F1, respectively for long and short-term debt, assigned by Fitch. Eni's credit rating is  linked,  in  addition  to  the  Company's  industrial  fundamentals and trends in the trading environment, to the sovereign credit rating of Italy. Based on the methodologies used by the credit rating agencies, a downgrade of Italy's credit rating may trigger a potential knock-on effect on the credit rating of Italian issuers such as Eni. During 2022, Moody's revised Eni's outlook from stable to negative, due to the worsening of the Italian outlook.\n\nDuring  2022  Eni  renegotiated  and  expanded  its  portfolio  of committed credit lines through the stipulation of a sustainabilitylinked bond facility agreed with a pool of banks for \u20ac6.0 billion. At December 31, 2022 the available committed borrowing facility amounted to \u20ac8.1 billion.",

These obligations  will  require  cash  settlements  in  future  reporting periods. These liabilities are valued based on the net cost for the company to fulfill the contract, which consists of the lowest amount between the costs for the fulfillment of the contractual obligation  and  the  contractual  compensation/penalty  in  the event of non-performance.\n\nThe Company's main contractual obligations at the balance sheet date comprise take-or-pay clauses contained in the Company's gas supply contracts or shipping arrangements, whereby the Company obligations consist of off-taking minimum quantities of\n\nproduct or service or, in case of failure, paying the corresponding cash amount that entitles the Company the right to collect the product or the service in future years. The amounts due were calculated on the basis of the assumptions for gas prices and services included in the four-year industrial plan approved by the Company's management and for subsequent years on the basis of management's long-term assumptions.\n\nThe table below summarizes the Group principal contractual obligations  for  the  main  existing  contractual  obligations  as of the balance sheet date, shown on an undiscounted basis. Amounts expected to be paid in 2023 for decommissioning oil & gas assets and for environmental clean-up and remediation are based on management's estimates and do not represent financial obligations at the closing date.\n\n|                                     | Maturity year   | Maturity year   | Maturity year   | Maturity year   | Maturity year   | Maturity year        | Maturity year   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|-----------------|\n| (\u20ac million)                         | 2023            | 2024            | 2025            | 2026            | 2027            | 2028 and  thereafter | Total           |\n| Decommissioning liabilities (a)     | 685             | 440             | 376             | 376             | 485             | 11,622               | 13,984          |\n| Environmental liabilities           | 591             | 507             | 408             | 317             | 306             | 1,388                | 3,517           |\n| Purchase obligations (b)            | 44,715          | 39,516          | 25,737          | 18,980          | 14,056          | 64,976               | 207,980         |\n| - Gas                               |                 |                 |                 |                 |                 |                      |                 |\n| - take-or-pay contracts             | 40,628          | 38,547          | 25,250          | 18,717          | 13,926          | 64,698               | 201,766         |\n| - ship-or-pay contracts             | 915             | 506             | 419             | 250             | 121             | 249                  | 2,460           |\n| - Other purchase obligations        | 3,172           | 463             | 68              | 13              | 9               | 29                   | 3,754           |\n| Other obligations                   | 1               |                 |                 |                 |                 |                      | 1               |\n| - Memorandum of Intent - Val d'Agri | 1               |                 |                 |                 |                 |                      | 1               |\n| Total                               | 45,992          | 40,463          | 26,521          | 19,673          | 14,847          | 77,986               | 225,482         |\n\n- (a) Represents the estimated future costs for the decommissioning of oil and natural gas production facilities at the end of the producing lives of fields, well-plugging, abandonment and site restoration.\n- (b) Represents any agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and that specifies all significant terms.\n\n## Capital investment and capital expenditure commitments\n\nIn  the  next  four  years,  Eni  expects  capital  investments  and capital expenditures of \u20ac37 billion.

        "page_content": "## Legal Proceedings\n\nEni is a party in a number of civil actions and administrative arbitral and other judicial proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Based on information available to date, taking into account the existing risk provisions disclosed in note 21 - Provisions and that in some instances it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of contingency losses, Eni believes that the foregoing will likely not have a material adverse effect on the Group Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn addition to proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business referred to above, Eni is party to other proceedings, and a description of the most significant proceedings currently pending is provided in the following paragraphs. Generally, and unless otherwise indicated, these legal proceedings have not been provisioned because Eni believes a negative outcome to be unlikely or because the amount of the provision cannot be estimated reliably.\n\n## 1. Environment, health and safety\n\n- 1.1 Criminal proceedings in the matters of environment, health and safety\n- i) Eni  Rewind  SpA  (company  incorporating  EniChem Agricoltura  SpA  -  Agricoltura  SpA  in  liquidation  EniChem  Augusta  Industriale  Srl  -  Fosfotec  Srl) -  Proceeding  about  the  industrial  site  of  Crotone. In  2010  a  criminal  proceeding  started  before  the Public  Prosecutor  of  Crotone  relating  to  allegations  of environmental disaster, poisoning of substances used in the food chain and omitted clean-up due to the activity at  a  landfill  site  which  was  taken  over  by  Eni  in  1991. Subsequently to Eni's takeover, any activity for waste conferral was stopped.\n\nThe  defendants  are  certain  managers  of  Eni  Group companies, that have managed the landfill since 1991. The  Municipality  of  Crotone  is  acting  as  plaintiff.  In March  2019,  the  public  prosecutor  requested  the acquittal of all defendants. The proceeding is ongoing. Although the public prosecutor requested the acquittal of  all  the  defendants,  on  January  17,  2020,  the  Court asked the Public Prosecutor to amend the charges in order to clarify the modalities and timing of each alleged conduct. At the preliminary hearing of July 1, 2020, the Court acquitted all the defendants, some for not having committed the alleged crime and others for expiration of the statute of limitations. The Company has decided to appeal the decision to obtain an acquittal on the merits. The decision on the appeal is pending.\n\n## ii)\n\n- Eni Rewind SpA - Crotone omitted clean-up. In April 2017, a new criminal case was opened by the Public Prosecutor of Crotone relating to reclamation activities at the Crotone site. Meanwhile, in the first half of 2018, the new clean-up\n\nproject presented by the Company was deemed feasible by  the  Italian  Ministry  for  the  Environment.  Pending the  decision  of  the  Public  Prosecutor,  a  defense  brief was  filed  to  summarize  the  activity  carried  out  by  the subsidiary Eni Rewind SpA (former Syndial SpA) in terms of  reclamation,  pointing  to  willingness  of  executing  a decisive plan of action, and to obtain the dismissal of the criminal proceedings. On March 3, 2020, the Ministerial Decree approving the POB Phase 2 was issued. The Public Prosecutor has submitted a filing request and the judge for  the  preliminary  investigations  has  set  a  chamber hearing. By a court order of January 10, 2022, the judge of the preliminary hearing of Crotone ordered the execution of  a  CTU  following  which  it  was  ascertained  how  Eni Rewind carried out the environmental activities in its own areas in compliance with the authorizations. A decision of the Public Prosecutor is awaiting following the filing of this supplementary consultancy.\n\n## iii) Eni Rewind SpA and Versalis SpA - Porto Torres dock.\n\n- In 2012, following a request of the Public Prosecutor of Sassari, an Italian court ordered presentation of evidence relating to the functioning of the hydraulic barrier of Porto Torres site (ran by Eni Rewind SpA) and its capacity to avoid the dispersion of contamination released by the site into the nearby sea. Eni Rewind and Versalis were notified that its chief executive officers and certain other managers were  being  investigated.  The  Public  Prosecutor  of  the Municipality of Sassari requested that these individuals stand trial. The plaintiffs, the Ministry for Environment and the Sardinia Region claimed environmental damage in an amount of \u20ac1.5 billion. Other parties referred to the judge's equitable assessment. At a hearing in July 2016, the court acquitted all defendants of Eni Rewind and Versalis with respect to the crimes of environmental disaster. Three Eni Rewind managers were found guilty of environmental disaster relating to the period limited to August 2010 January 2011 and sentenced to one-year prison, with a suspended sentence. Eni Rewind filed an appeal against this  decision.  The  trial  before  the  Second  Instance Court of Cagliari ended on December 14, 2021, with the confirmation of the sentence against the three defendants to one-year prison for the crime of environmental disaster, as well as the consequent civil rulings. Due to the omitted assessment during the sentence of the scientific arguments put forward by the technical consultants of the defense in a technical report filed in court, which demonstrated the total absence of a danger to public safety in the area, an appeal is pending against the Third Instance Court pending the date of the hearing.\n- iv) Eni Rewind SpA - The illegal landfill in Minciaredda area, Porto Torres site. The Court of Sassari, on request of the Public Prosecutor, seized the Minciaredda landfill",

All the indicted have been served a notice of investigation for alleged crimes of carrying out illegal waste disposal and environmental disaster. The seizure order also involved Eni Rewind pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01, whereby companies are liable for the crimes committed by their employees when performing their duties. The court determined that Eni Rewind can be sued for civil liability and resolved that all defendants and the Eni subsidiary be put on trial before the Court of Sassari. Upon start of the trial, the Italian Ministry  for  Energy  Transition  (MITE)  was  allowed  to enter  the  judgment  as  plaintiff  and  the  Court,  partially accepting the grievances of the defense, declared invalid the indictment decree against Eni Rewind as entity liable pursuant  to  Legislative  Decree  No.  231/01,  returning the case to the judge, who subsequently proceeded to celebrate  a  new  preliminary  hearing.  In  the  following hearing  held  on  March  31,  2022,  Eni  Rewind  was acquitted due to the inability to proceed with the action against it pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01 and definitively excluded from the criminal trial.\n\nIn the context of the criminal proceedings against the managers of Eni Rewind, however, on November 13, 2022, the Court of Sassari pronounced an acquittal sentence for the non-existence of the crime of illegal waste and for not having committed the crime of environmental disaster.\n\nDue  to  the  effects  of  the  acquittal,  the  requests  for compensation  made  by  the  civil  parties  against  the defendants  and  Eni  Rewind  were  not  accepted  as plaintiff. Since the public prosecutor and the civil parties have filed an appeal against the first instance sentence, the judgment is still pending against the Second Instance Court.\n\n- Eni Rewind SpA - The Phosphate deposit at Porto Torres site. In 2015, the Court of Sassari, accepting a request of the Public Prosecutor of Sassari, seized - as a preventive measure - the area of 'Palte Fosfatiche' (phosphates  deposit)  located  on  the  territory  of Porto  Torres  site,  in  relation  to  alleged  crimes  of environmental  disaster,  carrying  out  of  unauthorized disposal of hazardous wastes and other environmental crimes. Eni Rewind SpA is being investigated pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01. In November 2019, a request for referral to trial was served on the Eni subsidiary.  The  preliminary  hearing  was  held  on September 9, 2020. At the outcome of the preliminary hearing, during which the municipality of Porto Torres filed a civil action, the Judge pronounced against all the defendants a sentence of no place to proceed due to the statute of limitation in relation to the crimes of unauthorized management of landfills and disposal of\n\nhazardous wastes as well as against Eni Rewind SpA in relation to the liability pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01. The Judge also ordered the indictment of the  defendants  before  the  Court  of  Sassari  in  2021, limited to the alleged crime of environmental disaster. Upon start of the trial, the MITE was allowed to enter the  judgement  as  plaintiff.  The  Court,  accepting  the defense's  objections,  declared  the  indictment  invalid and returned the case that is ongoing to the judge of the  preliminary  hearing  of  Sassari,  identified  as  the competent judge to decide.\n\n- vi) Raffineria di Gela SpA and Eni Mediterranea Idrocarburi SpA  -  Alleged  environmental  disaster. A  criminal proceeding  is  pending  in  relation  to  crimes  allegedly committed  by  the  managers  of  the  Raffineria  di  Gela SpA and Eni Mediterranea Idrocarburi SpA relating to environmental  disaster,  unauthorized  waste  disposal and  unauthorized  spill  of  industrial  wastewater.  The Gela  Refinery  has  been  prosecuted  for  administrative offence  pursuant  to  Legislative  Decree  No.  231/01. This criminal proceeding initially regarded soil pollution allegedly caused by spills from 14 tanks of the refinery storage,  which  had  not  been  provided  with  double bottoms, and pollution of the sea water near the coastal area adjacent to the site due to the failure of the barrier system implemented as part of the clean-up activities conducted at the site. At the closing of the preliminary investigation,  the  Public  Prosecutor  of  Gela  merged into this proceeding the other investigations related to the pollution that occurred at the other sites of the Gela refinery as well as hydrocarbon spills at facilities of Eni Mediterranea  Idrocarburi  SpA.  The  proceeding  is  still ongoing.\n\nvii)\n\n- Eni  SpA  -  Val  d'Agri. In  March  2016,  the  Public Prosecutors of Potenza started a criminal investigation into alleged illegal handling of waste material produced at  the  Viggiano  oil  center  (COVA),  part  of  the  Eni operated  Val  d'Agri  oil  complex.  After  a  two-year investigation, the Prosecutors ordered the house arrest of 5 Eni employees and the seizure of certain plants functional to the production activity of the Val d'Agri complex which, consequently, was shut down. From the commencement of the investigation, Eni has carried out several technical and environmental surveys, with the  support  of  independent  experts  of  international standing,  who  found  a  full  compliance  of  the  plant and  the  industrial  process  with  the  requirements  of the  applicable  laws,  as  well  as  with  best  available technologies  and  international  best  practices.  The Company  implemented  certain  corrective  measures to upgrade plants which were intended to address the claims made by the Public Prosecutor about an alleged",

The Company restarted the plant in August 2016. In relation to  the  criminal  proceeding,  the  Public  Prosecutor's Office requested the indictment of all the defendants for alleged illegal trafficking of waste, violation of the prohibition of mixing waste, unauthorized management of  waste  and  other  violations,  and  the  Company for  administrative  offenses  pursuant  to  Legislative Decree  No.  231/01.  The  trial  started  in  November 2017. At the conclusion of the preliminary hearings, the  Court  of  Potenza,  on  March  10,  2021,  acquitted all the defendants in relation to the allegation of false statements in an administrative deed, while in relation to the alleged administrative offenses, the Court found that there was no need to proceed due to the statute of limitations. Finally, in relation to the alleged crime of illegal trafficking of waste, the Court acquitted two former employees of the Southern District for not having committed  the  crime,  convicted  six  former  officials of the same District with suspension of the sentence and sentenced Eni pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01 to pay a fine of \u20ac700,000, with the contextual confiscation  of  a  sum  of  \u20ac44,248,071  deemed  to constitute the unfair profit obtained from the crime, from which Eni will deduct the amount incurred for the plant upgrade carried out in 2016.\n\nFollowing  the  filing  of  the  merits  of  the  sentence  by the Court, an appeal was promptly filed against all the condemnations.  An  analysis  was  carried  out  on  the profiles  of  the  first  instance  sentence,  concluding,  in agreement with the lawyers in charge, for the reasonable expectation in the subsequent revocation of the sentence itself; the setting of the appeal judgment is pending.\n\nviii) Eni SpA - Health investigation related to the COVA center. Beside  the  criminal  proceeding  for  illegal trafficking of waste, the Public Prosecutor of Potenza started  another  investigation  in  relation  to  alleged health  violations.  The  Public  Prosecutor  requested the formal opening of an investigation with respect to nine people in relation to alleged violations of the rules providing  for  the  preparation  of  a  Risk  Assessment Document of the working conditions at the Val d'Agri Oil Center (COVA). In March 2017, following the request of the consultant of the Prosecutor, the Labor Inspectorate of Potenza issued a fine against the employers of the COVA for omitted and incomplete assessment of the chemical risks for the COVA center. In October 2017, the Prosecutor's  Office  changed  the  criminal  allegations to disaster, murder and negligent personal injury, also alleging breaches of health and safety regulations. The proceeding is ongoing.\n\nix) Proceeding Val d'Agri - Tank spill. In February 2017, the Italian police department of Potenza found a stream of water contaminated by hydrocarbon traces of unknown origin, flowing inside a small shaft located outside the COVA.  Eni  carried  out  activities  at  the  COVA  aimed at  determining  the  origin  of  the  contamination  and identified the cause in a failure of a tank (the 'D' tank) outside of the COVA, that presented a risk of extension of  the  contamination  in  the  downstream  area  of  the plant.  In  executing  these  activities,  Eni  performed  all the communications provided for by Legislative Decree No. 152/06 and started certain emergency safe-keeping operations at the areas subject to potential contamination outside the COVA. Furthermore, the characterization plan of the areas inside and outside the COVA was approved by the relevant authorities, to which the Risk Analysis document was subsequently submitted. Following this event, a criminal investigation was initiated in order to ascertain whether there had been illegal environmental disaster  by  the  former  COVA  officers,  the  Operation Managers in charge since 2011 and the HSE Manager in charge at the time of the accident, and also against Eni in relation to the same offense pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01 and of some public officials belonging to local administrations for official misconduct, false and fraudulent  public  statements  committed  in  2014  and of the crime for environmental disaster and of culpable conduct  committed  in  February  2017.  The  Company has paid damages of an immaterial amount almost to all the landlords of areas close to the COVA, which were affected  by  a  spillover.  Discussions  are  ongoing  with other  claimants.  The  likely  disbursements  relating  to these transactions have been provisioned. Furthermore, Eni is carrying out all the necessary remediation and safety measures.\n\nIn February 2018, Eni contested the reports presented in October and in December 2017 by the Italian Fire Department  stating  that  it  does  not  consider  itself obliged to carry out the integration required, considering that the data acquired in the area affected by the event indicate,  according  to  Eni's  assessments,  that  the loss was promptly and efficiently controlled and there were no situations of serious danger to human health and  the  environment.  In  April  2019,  precautionary measures were ordered against three Eni employees at the COVA which, following an appeal, were canceled by  the  Third  Instance  Court.  In  September  2019,  the Public Prosecutor requested one of those employees to be put on trial with expedited proceeding, accepted by the Judge for preliminary investigations. The judgment is currently pending in the preliminary stages of the hearing.\n\nAs  part  of  the  concomitant  procedure  against  the remaining employees and Eni as the legal entity being",

        "page_content": "held liable pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01, the Public Prosecutor, after issuing a notice of conclusion of  the  preliminary  investigations,  made  a  request  for indictment. At the outcome of the preliminary hearing, with  reference  to  the  imputation  to  Eni  pursuant  to Legislative Decree No. 231/01, the judge of the preliminary issued a sentence not to prosecute the Company for the events up to 2015 because the fact was not envisaged by the law as a crime to claim a legal entity liable for. With reference to the events subsequent to 2015, the judge acknowledged the nullity of the request for indictment, thus returning the documents to the Public Prosecutor. Finally, the judge of the preliminary hearing approved to  put  on  trial  two  Eni  employees  before  the  Court of  Potenza,  with  the  allegation  of  unnamed  disaster, rejecting  the  request  of  the  Public  Prosecutor  for qualifying  the  alleged  crime  as  a  new  type  of  legal offence (environmental disaster).In the context of this proceeding, several parties filed an application to bring a civil action and, pending assessment of the requests for exclusion presented by the defense with respect to the  latter,  the  Court  issued  a  summons  decree  from Eni,  as  civil  liability.  The  proceedings  against  natural persons, both pending in the preliminary stages of the hearing, will be combined by the Court in a single hearing process. With regards to Eni SpA as entity pursuant to Legislative  Decree  No.  231/01,  the  Public  Prosecutor has issued a new notice of conclusion of the preliminary investigations.\n\n- x) Raffineria di Gela SpA and Eni Mediterranea Idrocarburi SpA - Waste management of the landfill Camastra. In June 2018, the Public Prosecutor of Palermo (Sicily) notified Eni's subsidiaries Raffineria di Gela SpA and Eni Mediterranea Idrocarburi SpA of a criminal proceeding relating to allegations of unlawful disposal of industrial waste  resulting  from  the  reclaiming  activities  of  soil, which were discharged at a landfill owned by a third party. The Prosecutor charged the then chief executive officers of the two subsidiaries, and the legal entities have been charged with the liability pursuant to Legislative Decree No.  231/01.  The  alleged  wrongdoing  related  to  the willful falsification of the waste certification for purpose of  discharging  at  the  landfill.  The  charges  against  the CEO of the Refinery of Gela SpA and the company itself were dismissed, while a request to put on trial the CEO of Eni Mediterranea Idrocarburi SpA and the company was approved. The proceeding is in progress before the Court  of  Agrigento,  to  which  the  proceeding  has  been transferred due to territorial jurisdiction.\n- xi) Versalis SpA - Preventive seizure at the Priolo Gargallo plant. In  February  2019,  the  Court  of  Syracuse  at  the request of the Public Prosecutor of Siracusa ordered the\n\nseizure of the Priolo/Gargallo plant as part of an ongoing investigation  concerning  the  offenses  of  dangerous disposal of materials and environmental pollution, by the former plant manager of Versalis, pursuant to Legislative Decree  No.  231/01.  The  Public  Prosecutor's  thesis, according to the consultants, is that the seized plants have points of emissions that do not comply with the Best Available Techniques (BAT), therefore resulting in violation of the applicable legislation. Versalis has already implemented certain plant upgrades designed to comply with measures requested by the Public Prosecutor and its consultants. Based on this, an appeal was filed against the measure of precautionary seizure of the plant, which determined the revocation of the seizure of the plants on March 26, 2019. In March 2021, a notice of conclusion of  the  preliminary  investigations was notified, with the formulation by the Public Prosecutor of the allegations already previously stated.\n\n- xii) Versalis SpA. Seizure of the treatment plant managed by  IAS  SpA-  Priolo  Gargallo. On  3  February  2022, Versalis  was  notified  of  a  request  to  extend  the deadline  for  the  preliminary  investigations  by  the Public Prosecutor of Syracuse which - in relation to the industrial waste discharge system of the Versalis plant in the Priolo treatment plant managed by IAS SpA hypothesized the crimes of environmental disaster and violation of the legislation on discharges, against two former directors of the Versalis plant in Priolo, as well as an employee of Versalis, having then a managerial role in Priolo Servizi.\n\nSimilar  disputes  were  hypothesized  against  other employees of the companies co-located at the industrial site of Priolo Gargallo as well as of IAS SpA, while the legal entities Versalis, Priolo Servizi and the other colocated companies were under investigation pursuant to Legislative Decree 231/01.\n\nOn June 15, 2022, the order for a precautionary measure and  the  preventive  seizure  decree  were  notified  with which the Judge for Preliminary Investigations ordered the  seizure  of  the  purification  plant  and  the  company shares of IAS SpA, with the appointment of a judicial administrator of the assets subject to seizure.\n\nWith the same deed, the interdictive measure of the ban on carrying out duties in the companies involved in the investigations as well as in competing companies or in any case operating in the same production sector was also ordered against various subjects under investigation, including a former Versalis director of the Priolo plant and the former Technical Director of Priolo Servizi, for a 12-month period, subsequently revoked. In the same date, Versalis was also notified of a 'Request for Delivery' issued by the Public Prosecutor's Office in relation to the implementation protocols of the organizational models",

The assignment is ongoing.\n\nOn October 31, 2022, Versalis appealed the AIA issued to IAS before the Regional Administrative Court for the part in which the provision is interpreted as imposing new and different limits on discharges with respect to those contained in the authorizations in head of the company. In the meantime, the AIA issued for the management, by IAS, of the purifier has been suspended by the Region. The judgment is still pending in the investigation stage.\n\n- Eni SpA - Fatal accident Ancona offshore platform. On March 5, 2019, a fatal accident occurred at the Barbara F platform in the offshore of Ancona. During the unloading phase of a tank from the platform to a supply vessel, there was a sudden failure of a part of the structure on which a crane was installed, causing the death of an Eni employee who was inside the control cabin of the crane and injuries to two other workers. Two contract workers and the family of the Eni employee were all fully compensated. The Public Prosecutor  of  Ancona  initially  opened  an  investigation against unknown persons and ordered further technical appraisals relating to the crane. As part of the technical assessment of the incident, the Public Prosecutor resolved to put under investigation two Eni employees who were in charge of safety standards at the involved facility. Also, the Company has been put under investigation as entity liable  pursuant  to  Legislative  Decree  No.  231/01,  and two employees of the contractor company that owned the  boat.  In  May  2021  the  Public  Prosecutor  Office  of Ancona issued a notice of conclusion of the preliminary investigations and, following the subsequent formulation of the request for indictment, a preliminary hearing was set. At the outcome of the preliminary hearing, the Judge ordered the indictment for all the defendants and Eni as an entity pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01 before the Court of Ancona for the hearing on February 6, 2023. The proceeding is currently pending in the preliminary hearing phase.\n\n## xiii)\n\n- xiv) Raffineria  di  Gela  SpA  and  Eni  Rewind  SpA  Groundwater pollution survey and reclamation process of the Gela site. Following complaints made by former contractors, the Public Prosecutor of Gela ordered an\n\nxv)\n\ninspection and seizure of the area called Isola 32 within the  refinery  of  Gela,  where  old  and  new  monitored landfills are located. The proceeding concerns criminal allegations of environmental pollution, omitted clean-up, negligent personal injury and illegal waste management, as part of the execution of clean-up of soil  and  groundwater  as  well  as  decommissioning activities in the area currently managed by Eni Rewind SpA, also on behalf of the companies Raffineria di Gela SpA, ISAF SpA (in liquidation) and Versalis SpA with respect to the efficiency and efficacy of the barrier system. The Public Prosecutor acquired documents and evidence at the Syndial office in Gela and at the refinery of Gela, which, during the period January 1, 2017 - March 20, 2019, managed the facilities involved in cleaning up the groundwater area (TAF Syndial, site TAF-TAS  and  pumping  wells  and  hydraulic  barrier). Subsequently a decree was issued for the seizure of 11 piezometers of the hydraulic barrier system with contextual  guarantee  notice,  issued  by  the  Public Prosecutor of Gela against nine employees of the Gela Refinery  and  four  employees  of  Syndial  SpA.  Upon conclusion  of  unrepeatable  technical  investigations and analyses both on the piezometers placed under seizure, and on the TAF and TAS plants, on October 11, 2021, a preventive seizure order was notified by the  judge  of  the  preliminary  investigations  of  Gela, at the request of the Public Prosecutor's Office, with reference to the plants used for the remediation of the site's underground water (groundwater extraction wells and TAF treatment) managed today by Eni Rewind as well as the plant areas intended for the implementation of  the  groundwater  remediation  project.  A  judicial administrator was  appointed  to  manage  those facilities.  Eni  companies  are  collaborating  with  the Judge  to  continue  the  remediation  activities  and to provide a clear picture of the correctness of their actions.\n\nThe Public Prosecutor's Office of Gela also served the notice of conclusion of the preliminary investigations, challenging the suspects only with the crime of failure to clean up. At the same time, the judicial administrator in charge filed an initial technical report in which he confirms that the clean-up activities are continuing in compliance with the legislation and with a series of implementation improvements by the company in agreement with other parties  in  charge.  The  Public  Prosecutor's  Office  also issued the summons decree and the proceeding is now pending in the hearing phase.\n\n- Eni Rewind SpA and Versalis SpA - Mantua.

Several employees of the Eni's subsidiaries Versalis SpA and Eni Rewind SpA as well as of the third-party company Edison SpA were notified of being under investigation. Furthermore, the abovementioned entities were being investigated pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01. The Public Prosecutor is alleging, with respect to some specific areas related to the Mantua industrial hub, the crimes of unauthorized waste management,  environmental  damage  and pollution,  omitted  communication  of  environmental contamination  and  omitted  clean-up.  Following  the filing of defense briefs addressed to the investigating authority, the case has been dismissed against some individuals  and  archived.  The  Public  Prosecutor's Office then requested the indictment of the remaining defendants. During the Preliminary Hearing, the MITE, the  Province  of  Mantua,  the  Municipality  of  Mantua and Mincio Regional Park were allowed in the trial as plaintiffs,  while  the  companies  Eni  Rewind,  Versalis and  Edison  were  instead  sued  as  civil  parties  and therefore  they  appeared  in  court.  The  Preliminary Hearing Phase ended with the provision of GUP, which ordered  the  indictment  of  all  the  defendants  and  of the  abovementioned  companies,  with  the  exception of a former employee of Versalis and of two Edison employees.

This  circumstance  would  have been reported by officials of a local authority (ARPA), to whom technical feedback has been provided several times over the years. Eni is under investigation pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01. The prosecutor made a request for indictment.\n\nAt  the  preliminary  hearing  a  procedural  defect  was detected, and the documents were again sent to the\n\nPublic  Prosecutor's  Office.  Following  the  renewed preliminary hearing, the judge ordered the indictment of the people involved, setting the hearing for June 2023, and declared the nullity of the request for indictment for legal persons, due to lack of notification committal for  trial,  thus  returning  the  documents  to  the  Public Prosecutor for its renewal.\n\nxvii) Eni SpA R&M Refinery of Livorno - Criminal proceedings for accidents at work. On October 20, 2020, a notice was served at the Livorno refinery for Eni as entity subjected to preliminary investigations in the context of a criminal proceeding pending before the Public Prosecutor's Office of Livorno, in relation to an accident at work occurred in summer of 2019 at an electrical substation of the Refinery and as consequence two employees were injured. The company provided compensation to the employee who suffered  the  greatest  consequences  of  the  accident. The allegation is of aggravated personal injury while the Company is accused of being the entity liable pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01.\n\nThe Judicial Police, delegated by the Public Prosecutor's Office, has made requests for documentary presentation  in  order  to  acquire  useful  elements for assessing whether the company has adopted a suitable 231 model with the related procedures and management and organization systems to prevent the alleged crime.\n\nThe  Company  collected  and  promptly  provided  the required documentation.

The Italian Ministry for the Environment with  various  administrative  acts  required  companies that were operating plants in the petrochemical site of Priolo to perform safety and environmental remediation works  in  the  Augusta  harbor.  Companies  involved include Eni subsidiaries Versalis, Eni Rewind and Eni's Refining  &  Marketing  Division.  Pollution  has  been detected in this area primarily due to a high mercury concentration that is allegedly attributed to the industrial activity  of  the  Priolo  petrochemical  site.  The  abovementioned companies contested these administrative actions,  objecting  in  particular  to  the  nature  of  the remediation works decided and the methods whereby information on the pollutant's concentration has been gathered.  A  number  of  administrative  proceedings started  on  this  matter  were  subsequently  merged before  the  Regional  Administrative  Court.  In  October 2012,  the  Court  ruled  in  favor  of  Eni's  subsidiaries against  the  Ministry's  requirements  for  the  removal of the pollutants and the construction of a physical barrier. In September 2017, the Ministry served all the companies involved with a formal notice for the start of  remediation  and  environmental  restoration  of  the Augusta harbor within 90 days, basing its request on an alleged ascertainment of liability on the basis of the  2012  provision  of  Regional  Administrative  Court. In June 2019, the Italian Ministry for the Environment set up a permanent technical committee to review the matter of the clean-up and reclamation of the Augusta harbor.  The  report,  recalling  the  warning  of  2017, confirmed the thesis of the parties on the responsibility of the companies co-located for the contamination of the Rada and affirmed a breach of the aforementioned warning by the companies, also communicated to the Public Prosecutor's Office. In agreement with all the other companies involved, this report and other parallel internal  technical  investigations  were  challenged  for defensive purposes. Eni's subsidiaries proposed to the Italian Environmental Ministry to start a collaboration with  other  interested  parties  to  find  remediation measures based on new available environmental data collected by independent agencies, without prejudice to the need for the parties to correctly identify the legal entity responsible for the contamination detected. In the meantime, the Company requested, in full compliance with  applicable  environmental  laws,  to  establish  a roadmap for identifying the companies accountable for the environmental pollution and their respective shares of responsibility in order to implement a clean-up and remediation project.\n\n## ii)\n\nIn  September  2020,  the  Company  took  part  in  the Investigation  Services  Conference  convened  by  the Ministry  of  the  Environment  on  the  results  of  the technical investigations and exhibited, together with its consultants, the in-depth analyzes on the environmental state  of  the  Rada  and  its  observations  to  the  report which would lead to the exclusion of any involvement of the Group companies in the contamination detected. On September 23, 2020, the company took part to a preliminary investigation with the Italian MITE and the competent  bodies,  and  presented,  together  with  the technical consultants in charge, important insights on the  issue  of  the  environmental  state  of  the  Augusta harbor. In January 2021, the Company, having received communication of the calling of a second environmental review  of  the  same  subject  to  the  first  scheduled  for February 10, 2021, requested also to take part to this second  review  and  to  be  able  to  view  the  technical documents subject to discussion.\n\nHowever, in February 2021, the General Directorate for Environmental Remediation of the Ministry deemed the request  unacceptable.  Following  a  decision-making conference, in April 2021, the Ministry decided that it could intervene in the procedure aimed at identifying any reclamation and clean-up activities to be carried out  in  the  harbor  which  costs  are  to  be  charged  to the  companies  operating  in  the  area,  on  the  basis of  questionable  assumptions,  such  as  the  alleged non-compliance of those companies with the formal notice of September 7, 2017 which had ordered those companies  to  commence  reclamation  and  clean-up activities. The company filed an appeal and urged the Free Consortium of Syracuse (LCCS) to start the process of identifying the responsible for the pollution, which, in June 2022, was found, postponing the investigation until the conclusion of the technical investigations on the contamination.\n\n- Eni SpA - Eni Rewind SpA - Priolo - Malformation civil lawsuits. In February 2022 Eni Rewind received two writs of summons from two citizens of Augusta, who, stating that they were born with serious malformations due to mercury spills deriving from the mercury cell chlor-alkali plant in Priolo, summoned the company before the Court of Syracuse, asking for the liability of the latter and, as a result, the sentence to pay damages quantified in a total of \u20ac800,000 for each of the plaintiffs.\n\nEni Rewind filed an appearance in court filing a claim and indemnification against Edison, taking into account that the chlor-soda plant was received by Eni group as part of the Enimont transaction, therefore in a period following the alleged exposure to the mercury by the actors, which necessarily occurred between 1972 and 1975 (years of birth of the actors). The proceeding is pending.",

        "page_content": "- iii) Eni  SpA  -  Eni  Rewind  SpA  (former  Syndial  SpA)  Raffineria di Gela SpA - Claim for preventive technical inquiry and judgments on the merits. In February 2012, Eni's subsidiaries Raffineria di Gela SpA and Eni Rewind SpA and the parent company Eni SpA (involved in this matter through the operations of the Refining & Marketing Division) were notified of a claim issued by the parents of children with birth defects in the Municipality of Gela between 1992 and 2007. The claim called for an inquiry aimed at determining any causality between the birth defects suffered by these children and any environmental pollution caused by the Gela site, quantifying the alleged damages suffered and eventually identifying the terms and conditions to settle the claim. The same issue was the subject of previous criminal proceedings, of which one  closed  without  determining  any  illegal  behavior on the part of Eni or its subsidiaries, while a further criminal proceeding is still pending. In December 2015, the three companies involved were sued in relation to a total of 30 cases of compensation for damages in civil proceedings. In May 2018, the Court issued a first instance  judgment  concerning  one  case.  The  Judge rejected  the  claim  for  damages,  acknowledging  the arguments of the defendant companies in relation to the absence of evidence concerning the existence of a causal link between the birth defects and the alleged industrial pollution. The judgment has been appealed by the claimants.\n\nIn  June  2021  the  Civil  Court  of  Gela  issued  a  second judgment rejecting the claim for compensation, recognizing  the  validity  of  the  arguments  of  the defendant companies regarding the lack of evidence on the existence of a cause between the pathology and the alleged industrial pollution. The counterparties filed an appeal and a hearing was set for March 17, 2022, then postponed to April 20, 2022. The trial was postponed to October 31, 2024, for the clarification of the conclusions.\n\n- iv) Environmental  claim  relating  to  the  Municipality  of Cengio. Since 2008 a brought by the Italian Ministry for the Environment and the Delegated Commissioner for  Environmental  Emergency  in  the  territory  of  the Municipality of Cengio is pending before the Court of Genoa.  Those  parties  summoned  Eni  Rewind  before a  Civil  Court  and  demanded  that  Eni's  subsidiary compensate  for  the  environmental  damage  relating to  the  site  of  Cengio.  The  request  for  environmental damage amounted to \u20ac250 million plus an additional amount  for  health  damage  to  be  quantified  during the proceeding. The plaintiffs accused Eni Rewind of negligence in performing the clean-up and remediation of the site.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2021, Eni and the Ministry of the Environment  tried  to  settle  the  proceeding,  without\n\nhowever  reaching  a  definitive  agreement.  The  Judge restarted  the  proceeding  with  the  filing,  on  December 30,  2021,  of  the  definitive  technical  review  from  an appointed consultant. This review is particularly positive for Eni Rewind as it highlighted the story of the contamination, setting the baseline at 1989/1990 (date of Enimont transfer) and considering there was no subsequent deterioration. The appraisal, among other things, highlighted the Ministry's negligence towards the settlement proposals advanced by Eni and which would have  brought  benefits  to  the  territory.  At  the  hearing of  February  24,  2022,  following  a  request  for  filing of  documentation  received  by  the  plaintiff,  the  judge ordered the admission of part of the documentation and withheld the case for decision, allowing the parties 60 days for the filing of final briefs and 20 days for the reply notes.\n\nWith a sentence of June 21, 2022, the Court of Genoa rejected  all  the  plaintiffs'  claims,  fully  accepting  the defense's  arguments  and  ordering  the  plaintiffs  to compensate the company for the costs of the litigation. In particular, the sentence excludes that Eni Rewind can be identified as the successor of Enimont, then owner of the Cengio site.\n\nIn October 2022, the Ministry filed an appeal against the sentence. Eni Rewind will appeal the judgement.\n\n- Val d'Agri - Eni / Vibac. In September 2019 a claim was brought in the Court of Potenza against Eni. The plaintiffs are 80 people, living in different municipalities of the Val d'Agri area, who are complaining of economic, noneconomic,  biological  and  moral  damages,  all  deriving from the presence of Eni's oil facilities in the territory. In particular, the claim refers to certain events which allegedly caused damage to the local community and the territory (such as a 2017 spill, flaring events since 2014, smelly and noisy emissions). The Judge has been asked to ascertain Eni's responsibility for causing emissions of polluting substances into the atmosphere. The plaintiffs have also requested that Eni be ordered to interrupt any polluting activity and be allowed to resume industrial activities on condition that all the necessary remediation measures be implemented to eliminate all of the alleged dangerous situations. Finally, they are asking that Eni compensate all direct and indirect property damages, current and future, to an extent that will be quantified in the course of the case. At the end of the trial phase, the Judge submitted to the parties the proposal for an extrajudicial  settlement,  fixing  a  deadline  to  present  further proposals on the matter.\n\nThe parties did not adhere to the conciliatory proposal. During the last hearing on February 19, 2021, the Judge set the hearing for the clarification of the conclusions on June 30, 2023.\n\nv)",

In  2017  and  2018,  local government authorities and a fishing association brought in the courts of the State of California seven proceedings against  Eni  subsidiary  Eni  Oil  &  Gas  Inc.  and  other companies. These proceedings claim compensation for the damages attributable to the increase in sea level and temperature, as well as to hydrogeological instability. The  cases  have  been  transferred,  by  request  of  the defendants, from the State Courts to the Federal Courts. A specific request has been filed, highlighting the lack of jurisdiction of the State Courts. vii)\n\nIn  2019,  the  Federal  Court  referred  the  cases  to  the State  Courts.  The  defendants  then  appealed  to  the Ninth  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals,  challenging  the  order for  postponement.  All  proceedings  were  suspended pending the appeal before the Ninth Circuit Court. On May 26, 2020, the proceedings resumed in the State Courts. On July 9, 2020, Eni Oil & Gas Inc, together with other defendants, signed a petition for rehearing 'en banc' to request a review of the postponement decision by  the  competent  9th  Circuit  Court.  The  dispute  was suspended until a decision is made on the petition for rehearing. The Court rejected the petition for rehearing en banc but, at the request of the defendants, granted a suspension of the proceedings for 120 days (until January 2021) to allow the defendants to present a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States in order to obtain the revision of the rejection. The petition was then presented in January 2021. The Supreme Court, accepting the petition, ordered the Ninth Circuit Court to reconsider the question of jurisdiction by evaluating all the legal arguments in favor of federal jurisdiction.\n\nIn  June  2021,  defendants  filed  a  motion  ('Consent Motion') in the Ninth Circuit Court setting out arguments in favor of federal jurisdiction in addition to the initial defenses.\n\nIn early July 2021, Consent Motion was rejected by the Ninth Circuit Court which, in April 2022, then confirmed its previous referral order to the Court. Eni Oil & Gas Inc., together with the other defendants, therefore presented another petition for rehearing en banc to the same Ninth Circuit in May 2022, in order to request the revision of the postponement decision. In June 2022, the Ninth Circuit Court  rejected  the  petition.  The  defendants  therefore presented to the Ninth Circuit Court a so-called 'Motion to Stay', trying to suspend the referral order to state courts. With orders of June 30, 2022, and August 31, 2022, a suspension was granted until November 24, 2022, for the purpose of filing a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court  for  further  review  of  the  decision,  which  was followed on February 14, 2023, by the filing of a further brief  in  support  of  their  positions.  The  proceeding  is ongoing.\n\n- Eni  Rewind  SpA  /  Province  of  Vicenza  -  Clean-up process for Trissino site. On May 7, 2019, the Province of Vicenza issued a warning, imposing on certain individuals and companies as MITENI SpA in bankruptcy, Mitsubishi and ICI the obligation to clean-up the Trissino site where MITENI carried out its industrial activity. Based on the analysis carried out by administrative parties, significant concentrations of substances considered highly toxic and carcinogenic were allegedly discovered in groundwater and in surface water at this site. The analysis carried out by the Province of Vicenza with the direct involvement of the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 reported the presence of these substances in the blood of about 53,000 people in the area. The action of health analysis and monitoring by the institutions is expected to increase. The Province warned some individuals, including a former employee who served between 1988 and 1996 as CEO of a company that was subsequently acquired by Eni Rewind.\n\nIn  an  initial  phase  of  the  administrative  procedure, there were no references to former company EniChem Synthesis, which Eni Rewind acquired, therefore the legal assistance and the defense strategy were concentrated supporting  only  the  persons  involved.  However,  Eni Rewind  was  called  into  question  as  the  'successor' of  EniChem  in  several  appeals  before  the  Regional Administrative  Court  as  the  majority  shareholder  of MITENI. In February 2020, the Province extended the proceeding also to Eni Rewind, which filed a counterclaim for having its position taken out of the procedure.\n\nHowever, on October 5, 2020, the Province summoned Eni Rewind to take part in the remediation interventions on the site, including participation in technical meetings and at the conferences that would be convened by the public entities in relation to the site remediation activities. Eni  Rewind  appealed  to  a  Regional  Administrative Court  against  the  Province  claims  and  orders.  Eni Rewind is participating in these meetings, carrying out the  environmental  interventions  and  has  made  itself available to carry out - as part of the project approved by the territorial administrations in charge- further antipollution interventions on a voluntary basis and without giving  any  acquiescence  with  respect  to  the  liability charges for the pollution by chemical agents.\n\n## 2.

The proceeding was commenced following a claim filed by NGO ReCommon relating to alleged corruptive practices which,  according  to  the  Public  Prosecutor,  allegedly involved the Resolution Agreement made on April 29, 2011, relating to the so-called Oil Prospecting License of the offshore oilfield that was discovered in OPL 245. Eni fully cooperated with the Public Prosecutor and promptly filed  the  requested  documentation.  Furthermore,  Eni voluntarily reported the matter to the US Department of  Justice  ('DoJ')  and  the  US  SEC.  In  July  2014,  Eni's Board of Statutory  Auditors  jointly  with  the  Eni  Watch Structure resolved to engage an independent, US-based law firm, expert in anticorruption, to conduct a forensic, independent review of the matter, upon informing the Judicial Authorities. After reviewing the matter, the US lawyers concluded that they detected no evidence of wrongdoing by Eni in relation to the 2011 transaction with the Nigerian government for the acquisition of the OPL 245 license.\n\nIn December 2016, the Public Prosecutor of Milan notified Eni of the conclusion of the preliminary investigation and requested Eni's CEO, the Chief Development, Operations and Technology Officer and the Executive Vice President for  international  negotiations  to  stand  trial,  as  well as  Eni's  former  CEO  and  Eni  SpA,  pursuant  to  Italian Legislative Decree No. 231/01.\n\nUpon  the  notification  to  Eni  of  the  conclusion  of  the preliminary  investigation  by  the  Public  Prosecutor, the  independent  US-based  law  firm  was  requested  to assess whether the new documentation made available from Italian prosecutors could modify the conclusions of the prior review. The US law firm was also provided with the documentation filed in the Nigerian proceeding mentioned  below.  The  independent  US  law  firm concluded  that  the  reappraisal  of  the  matter  in  light of the new documentation available did not alter the outcome of the prior review. In September 2019, the DoJ notified  Eni  that  based  on  the  information  it  currently possessed, the DoJ was closing its investigation of Eni in  connection  with  OPL  245  without  the  filing  of  any charges. In December 2017, the Judge for preliminary investigation ordered the indictment of all the parties mentioned above, and other parties under investigation by the Public Prosecutor, before the Court of Milan. The request of the Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) for admission as a civil claimant in the proceedings was granted in July 2018. The first instance trial of the Milan Prosecutor's OPL 245 charges began before the Court of Milan on June 20, 2018. Following the discussion of the parties, in response to the Milan Prosecutor's request for conviction for all of the individuals and companies\n\ninvolved, at the hearing of March 17, 2021, the judge fully acquitted all the defendants, on the ground that there was no case.\n\nIn  June  2021,  the  Second  Instance  Court  of  Milan also acquitted on the same ground certain third-party defendant unrelated to Eni who had opted for a shortened procedure and had been convicted in the first acquittal. This latter decision has become final.\n\nOn July 29, 2021, the Public Prosecutor of Milan and the plaintiff, Government of Nigeria, filed an appeal against the first-degree acquittal of March 17, 2021.\n\nAt the hearing of July 19, 2022, the Attorney General withdrew  the  appeal  of  the  first  instance  sentence. Consequently, the acquittal due to baseless allegations has become definitive for all the defendants, individuals and  legal  entities.  The  first  instance  judgment  has therefore become final.\n\nOn November 11, 2022, the Second Instance Court confirmed the first instance acquittal, thus rejecting the FGN's appeal of its civil claims. On March 24, 2023, the FGN appealed the abovementioned  sentence  before  a  Third  Instance  Court with a view of pursuing the claim of damage compensation. Furthermore, only pending proceeding against Eni or any of its  affiliates  regarding  OPL  245  that  remains  pending  is  a proceeding in Nigeria which is discussed next.\n\nOn January 20, 2020, Eni's subsidiary in Nigeria ('NAE') was  notified  of  the  beginning  of  a  new  criminal  case before the Federal High Court of Abuja.\n\nThe  proceeding,  mainly  focused  on  the  accusations against Nigerian individuals (including the Minister of Justice in office in 2011, at the time of the disputed facts), has involved NAE and SNEPCO as co-holders of the OPL 245 license. These Nigerian individuals were accused in  2011  of  illicit  corruption,  which  NAE  and  SNEPCO allegedly  unlawfully  facilitated.  The  beginning  of  the trial, originally scheduled for the end of March 2020, was postponed as a result of the closure of judicial offices in Nigeria due to the COVID-19 emergency and resumed at the beginning of 2021 The proceeding is pending.\n\n## 3. Other proceedings concerning criminal matters\n\n## i) Eni SpA (R&M) - Criminal proceedings on fuel excise\n\n- tax. A criminal proceeding is currently pending, relating to alleged evasion of excise taxes in the context of retail sales in the fuel market. In particular, the claim states that the quantity of oil products marketed by Eni was larger than the quantity subjected to the excise tax. This proceeding (No.  7320/2014  RGNR)  concerns  the  combination  of distinct investigations: (i) a first proceeding, opened by the  Public  Prosecutor's  Office  of  Frosinone  involved  a company  (Turrizziani  Petroli)  purchaser  of  Eni's  fuel. This investigation was subsequently extended to Eni. The  Company  fully  cooperated  and  provided  all  data",

Such proceeding referred to quantities of oil products sold by Eni, allegedly larger than the quantity subjected to the excise tax; (ii) a second proceeding  concerning  an  investigation  by  the  Public Prosecutor's  Office  of  Prato,  commenced  in  regard to  the  deposit  of  Calenzano  and  relates  to  abduction of  fuel  through  manipulation  of  the  fuel  dispensers, subsequently  extended  also  to  the  Refinery  of  Stagno (Livorno); (iii) a third proceeding, opened by the Public Prosecutor's Office of Rome, concerns alleged missing payment of excise tax on the surplus of the unloading products, as the quantity of such products was larger than he quantity reported in the supporting fiscal documents. This  proceeding  represents  a  development  of  the  first proceeding mentioned above and substantially concerns similar  facts  presenting,  however,  some  differences with regard to the nature of the alleged crimes and the responsibility.\n\nThe Public Prosecutor's Office of Rome has alleged the existence  of  a  criminal  conspiracy  aimed  at  habitual abduction of oil products at all of the 22 storage sites which are operated by Eni in Italy. Eni is cooperating with the Prosecutor in order to defend the correctness of its operation. In September 2014, a search was conducted at  the  office  of  the  former  chief  of  the  R&M  Division in  Rome.  The  reasons  for  the  search  are  the  same as  the  above-mentioned  proceeding  as  the  ongoing investigations also relate to a period of time when the officer  was  in  charge  at  Eni's  R&M  Division.  In  March 2015, the Prosecutor of Rome ordered a search at all the storage sites of Eni's network in Italy as part of the same proceeding. The search was intended to verify the existence of fraudulent practices aimed at tampering with measuring systems functional to the tax compliance of excise duties in relation to fuel handling at the storage sites. In September 2015, the Public Prosecutor of Rome requested a one-off technical appraisal aimed to verify the  compliance  of  the  software  installed  at  certain metric heads previously seized with those lodged by the manufacturer at the Ministry for Economic Development. The  technical  appraisal  verified  the  compliance  of  the software tested. The proceeding was then extended to a large number of employees and former employees of the Company. Eni has continued to provide full cooperation to the authorities.\n\nDuring 2018, as part of the proceeding no. 7320/2014, the Public Prosecutor of Rome notified the conclusion of the preliminary investigations in relation to the criminal proceeding concerning the Calenzano, Pomezia, Naples, Gaeta  and  Ortona  storage  sites  and  the  Livorno  and Sannazzaro  refineries.  Based  on  the  outcome  of  the investigations, as far as Eni is concerned, the proceeding\n\ninvolves former managers and directors of the logistic sites and refineries indicated above concerning alleged aggravated and continuous non-payment of excise duties, alteration and removal of seals, use and possession of false measures and weights instruments. In addition, for the Calenzano site, three employees and their manager of the storage site were accused of alleged procedural fraud.\n\nIn September 2018, Eni received, as injured party, the notification of the schedule of hearing issued by the Court of Rome, in relation to criminal association and other minor claims, against numerous persons under investigation  -  including  over  forty  Eni  employees - subject of a separated proceeding (No. 22066/17 RGNR), for which, in May 2017, the Public Prosecutor's Office  had  requested  the  dismissal.  At  the  end  of the  hearing  in  December  2018,  the  Judge  accepted the  request  for  dismissal  for  several  persons  under investigation, including 13 Eni employees. The Judge also  initially  rejected  the  request  of  indictment  for criminal  association  relating  to  28  Eni  employees (including the former managers of the R&M Division). Following the preliminary hearing, a sentence not to prosecute was achieved in December 2019 for all the defendants.\n\nDuring 2019, also in relation to tax pending, a definition was reached, and Eni made the payments for the higher excise  duties  and  other  taxes  for  which  it  was  not possible to reconstruct the related justification.\n\nFor the main proceedings (no.7320/2014 RGNR), in 2019 a detailed preliminary hearing was held before the Judge of the preliminary hearing of Rome who, following the outcome of the discussions, ordered the indictment for all the defendants.\n\nSince 2020, the first instance judgment has been held before  the  Monocratic  Court  of  Rome  for  offenses relating to excise duties, forgery, and procedural fraud. At the hearing of November 21, 2022, the Court ordered the early closure of the ongoing hearing, ascertaining the statute of limitations, requesting a ruling not to proceed with an immediate extinction of the offence. For a single position  of  Eni,  while  not  renouncing  the  statute  of limitation, the defense requested acquittal on the merits. At the hearing of January 31, 2023, the Monocratic Court of Rome issued an acquittal sentence, acknowledging the  statute  of  limitations  against  all  employees  and former  employees  of  Eni  accused  in  the  proceeding. At the same time, the judge ordered the release from seizure of all assets still subject to the precautionary bond for probative purposes.\n\n- ii) Eni SpA (R&M) - Taranto Refinery - Criminal proceedings for  breach  of  excise  assessment.

The proceeding is in ongoing.\n\nEni  SpA  -  Public  Prosecutor  of  Milan  -  Criminal proceeding no. 12333/2017. In February 2018, Eni was notified  of  a  search  and  seizure  decree  in  relation  to allegations of associative crime aimed at slander and at reporting false information to a Public Prosecutor. In the decree, the Prosecutor of Milan included, among the other persons under investigation, a former external lawyer and a former Eni manager, at the time of the facts holding a strategic position with the Company. According to the decree, the association was allegedly aimed at interfering with the judicial activity in certain criminal proceedings  involving,  among  others,  Eni  and  some of  its  directors  and  managers.  Eni's  Control  and  Risks Committee,  having  consulted  the  Board  of  Statutory Auditors, and together with the Watch Structure, agreed to engage an auditing firm to perform an internal audit of relevant facts and circumstances and records and documentation relating to the matter with respect to the events of the aforementioned proceeding, including a forensic review. The final report, submitted to the Control and Risks Committee, the Watch Structure and the Board of Statutory Auditors on September 12, 2018, concluded that following the review carried out with respect to the allegations  made  by  the  Public  Prosecutor  of  Milan, there  was  not  sufficient  factual  evidence  to  prove  the involvement of the aforementioned former manager of Eni in the alleged crimes. On April 19, 2018, the Board of Directors appointed two external consultants, a criminal lawyer and a civil lawyer to provide independent legal advice in relation to the facts under investigation. Their report, dated November 22, 2018, did not find facts that could suggest any involvement of any Eni employees in the crimes alleged by the Public Prosecutor. On June 4, 2018, Consob, the Italian markets regulator, requested to be informed about the above-mentioned proceeding. The request was addressed to the Company and to its Board of Statutory Auditors.\n\nSpecifically,  Consob  asked  about  the  outcome  of  the forensic review and to be updated about any other audit action taken in relation to the matter by the Company and by its Board of Statutory Auditors. The Board of Statutory Auditors was also requested to report about the findings of the additional audit program agreed with\n\nan external auditor regarding the matter and to keep Consob updated about any further initiatives  adopted. The Company answered the request on June 11, 2018. Subsequently,  the  Company  finalized  its  response by  sending  further  documentation  including  the  final report of the independent third party and the reports of the consultants of the Board of Directors. The Board of Statutory Auditors has periodically updated Consob on the initiatives taken as part of the Board's monitoring responsibilities with several communications, the last of which was on July 25, 2018. On June 13, 2018, Eni was notified of a request from the Prosecutor's Office to transmit certain documentation in accordance with the Italian Code of Criminal Procedure. The request targeted evidence and documents relating to the internal audit performed  by  the  Company  and  any  possible  external review concerning certain tasks that had been assigned to the former external lawyer with respect to Eni. This lawyer appears to be under investigation as part of this proceeding. The reports of the independent third party and of the consultant of the Board of Directors were also sent to the Public Prosecutor.\n\nIn  May  and  June  2019,  in  the  context  of  the  same proceeding, the Court of Milan notified Eni and three of its subsidiaries (ETS SpA, Versalis SpA, Ecofuel SpA) of various requests for documentation in accordance with the Italian Code of Criminal Procedure. At the same time, on May 23, 2019, Eni was served a notice that the Company  was  being  investigated  for  administrative offences pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 231/01, with reference to the crime sanctioned by the Italian Penal Code concerning 'inducement not to make statements or to make false statements to the judicial authority'.\n\nThe object of the aforementioned requests particularly concerned  the  relations  with  two  business  partners, access  to  Eni  offices  of  certain  third  parties,  also  on behalf of one of the above-mentioned business partners, the mailbox of some employees and former employees, the  documentation  concerning  the  relations  (and  the interruption of those relations) with the former external lawyer investigated in the proceeding, the internal audit reports  and  the  reports  of  the  Company's  bodies  that dealt  with  assessing  these  relationships.  Following internal audits, on June 21, 2019, the Company sued for fraud a former employee at its subsidiary ETS, who was fired on May 28, 2019, and also filed a complaint before the Judicial Authority to ascertain possible complicity in fraud of other third parties. On August 14, 2019, the Italian tax police sent a new request for information to Eni,  concerning  the  economic  relations  between  Eni Group companies and an external professional.\n\nIn November 2019, Eni received a notice of extension of  the  preliminary  investigations.  The  notice  also covered  the  investigations  of  the  alleged  breach  by",

Furthermore,  certain  former Eni employees have been charged with various criminal allegations.  Those  employees  were  a  former  manager of  Eni's  legal  department,  the  former  Chief  Upstream Officer of Eni and an employee that was fired in 2013. A number of third parties have also been indicted, among them, two former legal consultants of Eni. On January 23,  2020,  a  search  decree  and  an  indictment  were notified  to  the  Company's  Chief  Services  &  Stakeholder Relations  Officer,  the  Senior  Vice  President  for  Security and a manager of the legal department. Following the requests for review of the aforementioned decree, the material deposited by the Public Prosecutor's Office was made  available  to  the  Company,  which  requested  its examination by the same consultants appointed in 2018 to examine the documentation. Subsequently, in June, July and September 2020, Eni was notified by the Public Prosecutor of Milan of several requests for documentation concerning,  in  particular:  the  results  of  the  inquiries carried  out  by  the  internal  audit  department  following an anonymous report relating to a hospitality event in 2017; some clarifications regarding an invoice issued by an external law firm; the internal audit report on relations with a commercial third party; work commitments of the Chief Services & Stakeholder Relations Officer relating to certain dates of 2014 and 2016; and the documentation concerning the dismissal of a former Eni employee. All the required documentation has been produced over time to the Judicial Authority.\n\nOn November 9, 2020, the Company was informed that Eni's  CEO  was  notified  about  his  right  to  participate, through  its  technical  consultant,  in  the  scheduled technical review of the content of a telephone device seized from a former Eni employee. In relation to what was  previously  requested  by  the  Judicial  Authorities in July 2020 and to supplement the already produced information, in the period January - March 2021 all the additional documentation concerning an ongoing dispute with a commercial counterpart was delivered over time. On  December  10,  2021,  a  notice  of  conclusion  of  the preliminary investigations was  sent  against  twelve individuals  and  five  companies.  A  former  Eni  executive fired in 2013 and a former external Eni lawyer are accused of  having  slandered  the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  the Human Capital Director & Procurement Coordination of Eni. The Chief Executive Officer, the Human Capital Director & Procurement  Coordination,  the  Senior  Vice  President  for Security and Eni SpA itself, however, do not appear in the request for indictment. The Eni subsidiary ETS SpA (ETS), has been charged as entity liable in connection with the crime of inducement at omitting to provide information and/or  rendering  misleading  information  to  the  judicial authority, for which also the former top manager is being\n\ninvestigated.  ETS  has  already  been  placed  in  voluntary liquidation with a resolution of Eni's Board of Directors of July 2020 which became effective on January 1, 2021. With  respect  to  the  Public  Prosecutor's  allegations against ETS SpA (ETS) of administrative responsibility pursuant  to  Legislative  Decree  No.  231/01,  ETS  and the  Public  Prosecutor  negotiated  a  settlement  of  a penalty and a hearing was set for October 2022 for the\n\nassessment of the settlement terms.\n\nAs a result of the delayed discovery of further investigative documents, not known at the time of the request for a  settlement,  ETS's  counsel  filed  an  application  for revocation of the settlement, in view of the hearing. At the hearing of October 5, 2022, the Judge consequently rejected the plea deal.\n\nOn June 30, 2022, the Public Prosecutor requested the excerpted dismissal of the proceeding, in favor of the Chief  Executive  Officer,  the  Human  Capital  Director  & Procurement  Coordination,  the  Senior  Vice  President for Security and the legal entity Eni SpA, the latter for its alleged liability of legal entities in relation to the crimes committed  by  employees  as  per  Legislative  Decree 231/01.  The  Public  Prosecutor's  confirmed  the  noninvolvement  of  the  above-mentioned  individuals  and entities in the disputes as already stated in the notice of conclusions of the investigations of December 2021. A request of dismissal was filed in relation to the allegations of  corruption  between  private  parties  relating  to  Eni representatives and to some external lawyers who had been registered following Piero Amara's statements.\n\nSubsequently the proceeding was transferred to the Public Prosecutor's  Office  of  Brescia  following  the  decision  of the General Prosecutor at the Third Instance Court on the basis of the request presented by certain suspects' defense counsel. The Public Prosecutor of Brescia, having received the  documents,  ordered  the  dismissal  of  allegations  of slander and defamation and sent the proceeding back to the Milan Public Prosecutor for jurisdiction about the remaining allegations.  The  Public  Prosecutor's  Office  requested  the dismissal in favor of the Chief Executive Officer, the Human Capital Director & Procurement Coordination and the Senior Vice President for Security and also requested the dismissal of the Company, ordering the other plaintiffs to stand trial. The dismissal decree of Eni SpA defined that the alleged inducement  to  make  false  statements  by  Vincenzo Armanna  in  the  context  of  the  criminal  proceeding 'OPL  245'  was  based  solely  on  personal  statements (Mr. Amara, Mr. Armanna and Mr. Calafiore) who lacked independence and whose statements had been proved to be groundless. Therefore, their statements were found to be false, leading to the indictment of the aforementioned natural persons due to the statements made against the Chief Executive Officer and the Human Capital Director & Procurement Coordination of the Company.",

        "page_content": "## 4. Tax proceedings\n\n- i) Dispute for omitted payment of a property tax for some oil offshore platforms located in territorial waters. Tax disputes are pending with some Italian local authorities regarding whether oil&gas offshore platforms located within  territorial  boundaries  should  be  subject  to  a property tax in the period 2016-2019.\n\nIn  2016  the  tax  regulatory  framework  changed  due to enactment of Law No. 208/2015, which excluded from  the  scope  of  the  property  tax  the  value  of plants instrumental to specific production processes. In addition, the Finance  Department  recognized that  offshore  platforms  met  the  requirements  for classification as instrumental plants and consequently are  excluded  from  the  scope  of  the  property  tax (resolution  no.  3  of  June  1,  2016).  Based  on  this interpretation, Eni did not pay any property tax for the years 2016-2019. However, the ruling of the Department of Finance is not binding for local authorities with taxing powers  as  recognized  by  the  Third  Instance  Court and some of these have issued assessment notices for  2016-2019.  The  Company  filed  an  appeal  against these notices. Although Eni believes that oil platforms located in the territorial sea should be excluded from the tax base of the property tax on the base of the interpretation of the law in the light of the resolution of the Department of Finance, having assessed the risks of  losing  in  pending  disputes,  the  Company  accrued a risk provision, the amount of which excludes fines since Eni's conduct was based on the administrative resolution, as well as taking into account the reduction of  the  tax  base  excluding  the  'plant  component'  as provided by the law. The proceeding is still ongoing. Law  Decree  124/19  (enacted  with  Law  157/19)  has established, starting from 2020, that marine platforms are subject to a new property tax that will replace and supersede any other ordinary local property tax eventually levied on these plants up to 2019. This rule has therefore sanctioned, starting from 2020, the existence of the tax requirement for these plants.\n\n## 5. Settled proceedings\n\n- i) Congo. The proceeding concerned investigations by the Public Prosecutor's of Milan into alleged crimes of international corruption in relation to Eni's oil activities in Congo, with reference to the contracts awarded in the years 2013-2015. The proceeding involved some former Eni employees. The Company was investigated pursuant  to  Legislative  Decree  no.231/01.  As  part of the proceedings, the prosecution had also made a  request  for  restrictive  measures  relating  to  the activities covered by oil contracts under investigation.\n\nFollowing  the  reclassification  of  the  hypothesis  of international  corruption  into  the  statute  of  undue induction  to  give  or  promise  benefits,  in  2021  Eni approved a settlement amounting to \u20ac11.8 million and the revocation of the request for restrictive measures. A second investigation related an alleged conflict of interest in the assignment of contracts to third-party suppliers of Eni Congo involving the Chief Executive Officer.\n\nIn March 2023, following the dismissal request presented by the Public Prosecutor's Office, the GUP ordered the dismissal  of  the  proceedings  for  all  natural  persons under  investigation.  The  dismissal  concerned  both the hypothesis of undue induction to give or promise benefits, which had concerned, among others, the former Chief  Development,  Operations  &  Technology  Officer of Eni; and the hypothesis of omitted declaration of a conflict of interest. The Judge excluded any evidence of a potential interest of the CEO with reference to the commercial transactions between (not Eni SpA but) the subsidiaries of Eni SpA and the third-party supplier, since the  CEO  is  not  in  any  position  of  conflict  of  interests which could give rise to the obligation to report at the time he assumed the position of Chief Executive Officer of Eni in May 2014.\n\n- ii) Eni Rewind SpA - Proceeding relating to the asbestos at the Ravenna site. A criminal proceeding is pending before the Tribunal of Ravenna relating to the crimes of culpable manslaughter, injuries and environmental disaster,  which  have  been  allegedly  committed  by former Eni Rewind employees at the site of Ravenna. The site was acquired by Eni Rewind following a number of  corporate  mergers  and  acquisitions.  The  alleged crimes date back to 1991. In the proceeding there are 75 alleged victims. The plaintiffs include relatives of the alleged victims, various local administrations, and other institutional bodies, including local trade unions. Eni  Rewind  asserted  the  statute  of  limitations  as  a defense to the instance of environmental disaster for certain instances of diseases and deaths. The court at Ravenna decided that all defendants would stand trial and held that the statute of limitations only applied with reference to certain instances of crime of culpable injury. Eni Rewind reached some settlements. In November 2016,  the  Judge  acquitted  the  defendants  in  all  the contested cases except for one, an asbestos case, for which a conviction was handed down. The defendants, the Prosecutor and the plaintiffs appealed the decision; the second instance judge ordered a complex inquiry. Eni's defenders recused a member of the expert panel who conducted the inquiry, and the Second Instance Court  rejected  the  request  for  recusal  with  an  order subsequently canceled by the Third Instance Court.

The  Court  also  declared  inadmissible  the  appeal  of several claimants. The Company filed an appeal with the  Third  Instance  Court  against  the  conviction  for asbestosis; some claimants challenged the acquittal for the other pathologies.\n\nOn  November  24,  2021,  the  Third  Instance  Court: (i) annulled,  without  postponement,  the  contested sentence against a defendant for extinction of the crime; (ii) annulled without referral to the criminal effects the sentence contested for the crime of negligent injury in relation to the case of asbestosis because it fell under statute  of  limitations,  rejecting  the  appeals  of  Eni's lawyers for civil purposes; (iii) rejected the appeals of the civil parties. Therefore, the criminal proceeding is closed. At the moment there is no information on the activation of any civil disputes.\n\n## iii) Versalis SpA- Brindisi - criminal proceedings on plant\n\n- factory  flares  and  odor  emissions. On May 18, 2018, the manager of the Versalis plant in Brindisi and two other employees were summoned in order to provide information  regarding  two  episodes  that  occurred  in April 2018 which led to the activation of the plant torches. The company cooperated with the judicial authorities to provide information and exclude that such events had a negative impact on air quality.\n\nAt the end of May 2020, in conjunction with a scheduled shutdown  of  the  plant,  anomalous  concentrations  of benzene and toluene were detected; on that basis, the mayor  of  Brindisi  ordered  the  plant  shutdown.  From these events, a criminal case was instituted, as a result of which the two pro-tempore directors of the plant and the Operations manager for the crimes referred to the disposal of hazardous wastes.\n\nOn  May  19,  2022,  the  judge,  in  acceptance  of  the request made by the Public Prosecutor's Office, ordered the dismissal of the proceeding, highlighting that the lighting of torches that took place starting from 2018 were due to disservices or momentary failures, again in compliance with the AIA requirements and specifying that the consultants' assessments did not reveal any violations of the constraints imposed by the legislation in force.\n\n## Assets under concession arrangements\n\nEni  operates  under  concession  arrangements  mainly  in the  Exploration  &  Production  segment  and  the  Refining  & Marketing  business  line.  In  the  Exploration  &  Production segment, contractual clauses governing mineral concessions, licenses and exploration permits regulate the access of Eni to hydrocarbon reserves. Such clauses can differ in each country. In particular, mineral concessions, licenses and permits are granted by the legal owners and, generally, entered into with government entities, State oil companies and, in some legal contexts,  private  owners.  Pursuant  to  the  assignment  of mineral concessions, Eni sustains all the operational risks and costs related to the exploration and development activities and it is entitled to the productions realized. In respect of the mining concessions received, Eni pays royalties in accordance with the tax legislation in force in the country and is required to pay the income taxes deriving from the exploitation of the concession. In production sharing agreement and service contracts, realized productions  are  defined  based  on  contractual  agreements with State oil companies, which hold the concessions. Such contractual agreements regulate the recovery of costs incurred for the exploration, development and operating activities (Cost Oil) and give entitlement to the own portion of the realized productions (Profit Oil). In the Refining & Marketing business line, several service stations and other auxiliary assets of the distribution service are located in the motorway areas and they are granted by the motorway concession operators following a public tender for the sub-concession of the supplying of oil products distribution service and other auxiliary services. In exchange for the granting of the services described above, Eni  provides  to  the  motorway  companies  fixed  and  variable royalties based on quantities sold. At the end of the concession period, all non-removable assets are transferred to the grantor of the concession for no consideration.\n\n## Environmental regulations\n\nIn  the  future,  Eni  will  sustain  significant  expenses  in  relation to  compliance  with  environmental,  health  and  safety  laws and  regulations  and  for  reclaiming,  safety  and  remediation works of areas previously used for industrial production and dismantled sites. In particular, regarding the environmental risk, management does not currently expect any material adverse effect  upon  Eni's  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  taking account  of  ongoing  remediation  actions,  existing  insurance policies and the environmental risk provision accrued in the Consolidated  Financial  Statements.  However,  management believes that it is possible that Eni may incur material losses and liabilities in future years in connection with environmental matters  due  to:  (i)  the  possibility  of  as  yet  unknown contamination; (ii) the results of ongoing surveys and other possible effects of statements required by Legislative Decree 152/2006; (iii) new developments in environmental regulation (i.e. Law No. 68/2015 on crimes against the environment and European Directive 2015/2193 on medium combustion plants);",

The award of free emission  allowances  is  performed  based  on  emission benchmarks  defined  at  European  level  specific  to  each industrial segment, except for the electric power generation sector that is not eligible for allocations for no consideration.\n\nThis regulatory scheme implies for Eni's plants subject to emission  trading  a  lower  assignment  of  emission  permits compared  to  the  emissions  recorded  in  the  relevant  year and, consequently, the necessity of covering the amounts in excess by purchasing the relevant emission allowances on the open market. In 2022, the emissions of carbon dioxide from Eni's plants were higher than the free allowances assigned to  Eni.  Against  emissions  of  carbon  dioxide  amounting  to approximately  16.73  million  tonnes,  Eni  was  awarded  free emission  allowances  of  4.98  million  tonnes,  determining a  deficit  of  11.75  million  tonnes.  This  deficit  was  entirely covered through the purchase of emission allowances in the open market.",

The Plans provide the granting of Eni shares for no consideration to eligible managers after a three-year vesting period under the condition that they would remain in office until vesting. Considering that these incentives fall within the category of employee compensation, in accordance with IFRS, the cost of the plans is determined based on  the  fair  value  of  the  financial  instruments  awarded  to  the beneficiaries and the number of shares that are granted at the end of the vesting period; the cost is accruing along the vesting period. With reference to the 2017-2019 Plan, the number of shares that will be granted at the end of the vesting period will depend: (i) for 50%, on the market condition in terms of Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of the Eni share compared to the TSR of the FTSE Mib index of the Italian Stock Exchange Market, and to a group of Eni's competitors ('Peer Group') 27 and the TSR of their corresponding stock exchange market 28 ; (ii) for 50%, on the growth in the Net Present Value (NPV) of proved reserves benchmarked against the Peer Group.\n\nWith reference to the 2020-2022 Plan, the number of shares that will be granted at the end of the vesting period will depend on the aiming of the following objectives defined over a three-year performance period, as follows: (i) for 25% on a market objective measured with reference to the the Eni's group of competitors (Peer Group) as the difference between the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of Eni Shares and the TSR of the FTSE Mib Index of  the  Italian  Stock  Exchange,  adjusted  with  Eni's  correlation index, compared with the benchmark stock index; (ii) for 20% on an industrial objective measured with respect to the Peer Group in terms of annual unit value ($/boe) of the Net Present Value of Proven  Reserves  (NPV);  (iii)  for  20%  on  an  economic-financial objective measured as the Organic Free Cash Flow accumulated in the three-year reference period, compared to the value provided for  by  the  Strategic  Plan;  (iv)  for  35%  on  an  environmental sustainability  and  energy  transition  objective  in  a  three-year period consisting of three objectives measured with respect to the Strategic Plan as follows: (a) for 15% to Upstream Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO 2 eq. equity emissions (tCO 2 eq./kboe); (b) for 10%\n\n## Compensation of key management personnel\n\nCompensation, including contributions and collateral expenses, of personnel holding key positions in planning, directing and controlling the Eni Group subsidiaries, including executive and\n\nnon-executive  officers,  general  managers  and  managers  with strategic responsibilities in office during the year consisted of the following:\n\n| (\u20ac million)                                |   2022 | 2021   |   2020 |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Wages and salaries                         |     37 | 29     |     30 |\n| Post-employment benefits                   |      3 | 3      |      2 |\n| Other long-term benefits                   |     17 | 15     |     12 |\n| Indemnities upon termination of employment |      9 |        |     21 |\n|                                            |     66 | 47     |     65 |\n\non the installed capacity of power generation from renewable sources; (c) for 10% from the progress of three projects of circular economy.\n\nDepending  on  the  performance  of  the  parameters  mentioned above, the number of shares that will vest free of charge after three years may range between 0% and 180% of the initial award. Furthermore, a 50% of these is subject to a lock-up clause of one year after the vesting date.\n\nThe number of shares awarded at the grant date was: (i) 2,069,685 shares in 2022; with a weighted average fair value of \u20ac9.20 per share; (ii) 2,365,581 shares in 2021, with a weighted average fair value of \u20ac8.15 per share; (iii) 2,922,749 shares in 2020, with a weighted average fair value of \u20ac4.67 per share.\n\nThe  estimation  of  the  fair  value  was  calculated  by  adopting specific valuation techniques regarding the different performance parameters provided by the plan (the stochastic method for the component related to the TSR and the Black-Scholes model for the component related to the NPV of the reserves, for the 2017-2019 Plan; the stochastic method for the 2020-2022 Plan), taking into account the fair value of the Eni share at the grant date (between \u20ac12.918 and \u20ac14.324 depending on the grant date in relation to the 2022 award; between \u20ac11.642 and \u20ac12.164 depending on the grant date in relation to the 2021 award; between \u20ac5.885 and \u20ac8.303 depending on the grant date in relation to the 2020 award), reduced by dividends expected along the vesting period (between 6.1% and 6.8% of the share price at vesting date in 2022; 7.1% and 7.4% of the share price at vesting date in 2021; 7.1% and 10% of the share price at vesting date in 2020), considering the volatility of the stock (between 30% and 31% in relation to the 2022 award; between 44% and 45% in relation to the 2021 award; 41% and 44% in relation to the 2020 award), the forecasts for the performance parameters, as well as the lower value attributable to the shares considering the lock-up period at the end of the vesting period. In 2022, the costs related to the Long-Term Monetary Incentive Plan, recognized as a component of the payroll cost, amounted to \u20ac18 million (\u20ac16 million and \u20ac7 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively) with a contra-entry to equity reserves.",

In 2020, the Group incurred income taxes, despite a pre-tax loss of \u20ac5,978 million, due to the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 having an enduring impact on the hydrocarbons\n\ndemand and by the revision of the long-term prices and of future cash flows in Eni's activities. The lower projections of future taxable income had two impacts: the recognition of tax charges due to a write-down of deferred tax assets and a reduced capacity to recognize deferred taxes on the losses of the period.\n\n## 34 Earnings (loss) per share\n\nBasic earnings (loss) per ordinary share are calculated by dividing net profit  (loss)  for  the  period  attributable  to  Eni's  shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares issued and outstanding during the period, excluding treasury shares.\n\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing the net profit (loss) of the period attributable to Eni's shareholders by the weighted average number of shares fully-diluted, excluding treasury shares, and including the number of potential shares to be issued. As of December 31, 2022, the shares that could be potentially issued\n\nrelated the estimation of new shares that will vest in connection with the 2020-2022 Long-Term Monetary Incentive Plans. In determining basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share, the net profit (loss) for the period attributable to Eni is adjusted to take into account the remuneration of perpetual subordinated bonds, net of tax effect, calculated by using the amortized cost method. Reconciliation of the weighted average number of shares used for the calculation for both basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share was as follows:\n\n|                                                                              |               | 2022          | 2021          | 2020          |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Weighted average number of shares used for basic earnings (loss) per share   |               | 3,483,633,816 | 3,565,973,883 | 3,572,549,651 |\n| Potential shares to be issued for ILT incentive plan                         |               | 6,319,989     | 7,598,593     |               |\n| Weighted average number of shares used for diluted earnings (loss) per share |               | 3,489,953,805 | 3,573,572,476 | 3,572,549,651 |\n| Eni's profit (loss)                                                          | (\u20ac million)   | 13,887        | 5,821         | (8,635)       |\n| Remuneration of subordinated perpetual bonds net of tax effect               | (\u20ac million)   | (109)         | (95)          |               |\n| Eni's profit (loss) for basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share          | (\u20ac million)   | 13,778        | 5,726         | (8,635)       |\n| Basic earnings (loss) per share                                              | (\u20ac per share) | 3.96          | 1.61          | (2.42)        |\n| Diluted earnings (loss) per share                                            | (\u20ac per share) | 3.95          | 1.60          | (2.42)        |",

Furthermore, it will focus its actions on the development of carbon capture and compensation projects. The General Department incorporates the Company's Oil & Gas exploration,  development  and  production  activities,  natural gas  wholesale  via  pipeline  and  LNG,  forests  conservation (REDD+) and CO 2 storage projects;\n\n\u00b7 Energy Evolution, focused on the evolution of the businesses of power  generation,  transformation  and  marketing  of products from fossil to bio and blue. The responsibility of this Department  include  the  growth  of  power  generation  from renewable energy and biomethane, the coordination of the bio and circular evolution of the Company's refining system and chemical business, and the development of Eni's retail portfolio, providing increasingly more decarbonized products for mobility, household consumption and small enterprises. The General Department incorporates the activities of power generation  from  natural  gas  and  renewables,  the  refining and chemicals businesses, Retail Gas & Power and mobility Marketing. The companies Versalis (chemical products), Eni Rewind (environmental activities) and Eni Plenitude, in their current structure, are consolidated in this General Department. In relation to financial reporting  purposes,  management evaluated  that  the  components  of  the  Company  whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision  Maker  (CEO)  to  make  decisions  about  the  allocation of  resources  and  to  assess  performances  would  continue being  the  single  business  units  which  are  comprised  in  the\n\ntwo  newly-established  General  Departments,  rather  than  the two groups themselves. Therefore, in order to comply with the provisions of the international reporting standard that regulates the segment reporting (IFRS 8), the new reportable segments of Eni, substantially confirming the pre-existing setup, are identified as follows:\n\nExploration & Production : research, development and production of  oil,  condensates  and  natural  gas,  forestry  conservation (REDD+) and CO 2 capture and storage projects;\n\nGlobal Gas & LNG Portfolio (GGP) : supply and sale of wholesale natural gas via pipeline, international transport and purchase and marketing of LNG. It includes gas trading activities finalized to hedging and stabilizing the trade margins, as well as optimising the gas asset portfolio;\n\nRefining  &  Marketing  and  Chemicals : supply,  processing, distribution and marketing of fuels and chemicals. The results of the Chemicals segment were aggregated with the Refining & Marketing performance in a single reportable segment, because these two operating segments have similar economic returns. It comprises the activities of trading oil and products with the aim to execute the transactions on the market in order to balance the supply and stabilize and cover the commercial margins;\n\nPlenitude & Power : retail sales of gas, electricity and related services,  production  and  wholesale  sales  of  electricity  from thermoelectric  and  renewable  plants,  services  for  E-mobility. It  includes  trading  activities  of  CO 2 emission  certificates  and forward sale of electricity with a view to hedging/optimising the margins of the electricity;\n\nCorporate  and  Other  activities :  includes  the  main  business support  functions,  in  particular  holding,  central  treasury,  IT, human  resources,  real  estate  services,  captive  insurance activities, research and  development,  new  technologies, business digitalization and the environmental activity developed by the subsidiary Eni Rewind.\n\nSegment  information  presented  to  the  CEO  (i.e.  the  Chief Operating  Decision  Maker,  ex  IFRS  8)  includes:  revenues, operating profit and directly attributable assets and liabilities.",

The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that  it  will  commence  the  project  within  a  reasonable  time. Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as  an  un-weighted  arithmetic  average  of  the  first-day-of-themonth price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.\n\nIn 2022, the average price for the marker Brent crude oil was $101  per  barrel.  Net  proved  reserves  exclude  interests  and royalties owned by others.\n\nProved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage,  or  from  existing  wells  where  a  relatively  major expenditure  is  required  for  recompletion.  Eni  has  its  proved reserves  evaluted  on  a  rotational  basis  by  independent  oil engineering companies 35 . The description of qualifications of the person primarily responsible of the reserves audit is included in the third-party audit report 36 . In the preparation of their reports, independent  evaluators  rely,  without  independent  verification, upon data furnished by Eni with respect to property interest, production, current costs of operation and development, sale agreements, prices and other factual information and data that were accepted as represented by the independent evaluators.\n\nThese data, equally used by Eni in its internal process, include logs,  directional  surveys,  core  and  PVT  (Pressure  Volume Temperature) analysis, maps, oil/gas/water production/injection data of wells, reservoir studies and technical analysis relevant to field performance, long-term development plans, future capital and operating costs.\n\nIn order to calculate the economic value of Eni equity reserves, actual prices applicable to hydrocarbon sales, price adjustments required  by  applicable  contractual  arrangements,  and  other pertinent  information  are  provided.  In  2022,  Ryder  Scott Company and Sproule  provided  an  independent  evaluation  of about 27% of Eni's total proved reserves as of December 31, 2022,  confirming,  as  in  previous  years,  the  reasonableness  of Eni's internal evaluations 37 .\n\nIn the three-year period from 2020 to 2022, 90% of Eni's total proved reserves were subject to independent evaluation. As of December 31, 2022, the principal assets which did not undergo an independent evaluation in the last three years were Nen\u00e9 e Litchendjli in Congo.\n\nEni operates under production sharing agreements in several of the foreign jurisdictions where it has oil and gas exploration and production activities. Reserves of oil and natural gas to which Eni is entitled under PSA arrangements are shown in accordance with Eni's economic interest in the volumes of oil and natural gas estimated to be recoverable in future years. Such reserves include estimated quantities allocated to Eni for recovery of costs, income taxes owed by Eni but settled by its joint venture partners (which are state-owned entities) out of Eni's share of production and Eni's net equity share after cost recovery. Proved oil and gas reserves associated with PSAs represented 54%, 58% and 57% of total proved reserves as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 respectively, on an oil-equivalent basis. Similar effects as PSAs apply to service contracts; proved reserves associated with such contracts represented 2%, 3%, and 4% of total proved reserves on an oil-equivalent basis as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nOil and gas reserves quantities include: (i) oil and natural gas quantities in excess of cost recovery which the company has an obligation to purchase under certain PSAs with governments or authorities, whereby the company serves as producer of reserves. Reserves volumes associated with oil and gas deriving from such obligation represent 3%, 4% and 3% of total proved reserves as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, on an oil equivalent basis; (ii) volumes of proved reserves of natural gas to be consumed in operations amounted to approximately 2,389 BCF at 2022 year-end (2,335 BCF and 2,337 BCF respectively",

Proved\n\ntesting and production after the date of the estimate may require substantial upward or downward revisions. In addition, changes in oil and natural gas prices have an effect on the quantities of Eni's proved reserves since estimates of reserves are based on prices and costs relevant to the date when such estimates are made. Consequently, the evaluation of reserves could also significantly differ from actual oil and natural gas volumes that will be produced.\n\nundeveloped reserves of consolidated subsidiaries amounted to 727 mmbbl of liquids and 4,759 BCF of natural gas.

In Egypt, 65 BCF of negative revisions were recorded at the Tuna due to performance revision and at Zohr field due to price effect. In America, 33 BCF of negative revision were due to price effects at various US gas fields (-78 BCF), mainly Alliance fields, partially offset by Area 1 in Mexico (46 BCF ). Revisions were positive for 356 BCF in the Rest of Asia driven by a better performance at the Merakes projects in Indonesia (227 BCF) and at the Zubair field in Iraq (97 BCF) due to improved production expectations. In Kazakhstan, positive revisions of 138 BCF were reported at the Karachaganak project due to technical appraisal and higher entitlements.\n\nIn  2021, total revisions were 172 BCF as follows: Italy (661 BCF) mainly due to recovery of non-economic cutoffs; Rest of Europe (78 BCF) in the United Kingdom mainly due to recovery of  non-economic  cutoffs;  Rest  of  North  Africa  (321  BCF) mainly in Libya due to price effect; Egypt (-2 BCF), consisting of positive revisions of 110 BCF meters mainly in Baltim SW and negative revisions 112 BCF mainly in Port Fouad; SubSaharan  Africa  total  revisions  of  -903  BCF,  primarily  linked to  the  reclassification  of  the  Mozambique  project  from  a consolidated company to a equity-accounted company (-993 BCF) and positive revisions of 274 BCF, primarily in Nigeria.

Future price changes are considered only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements. Estimated future development and  production  costs  are  determined  by  estimating  the expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves at the end of the year. Neither the effects of price  and  cost  escalations  nor  expected  future  changes  in\n\ntechnology and operating practices have been considered.\n\nThe  standardized  measure  is  calculated  as  the  excess  of future cash inflows from proved reserves less future costs of producing and developing the reserves, future income taxes and a yearly 10% discount factor.\n\nFuture production costs include the estimated expenditures related  to  the  production  of  proved  reserves  plus  any production  taxes  without  consideration  of  future  inflation. Future  development  costs  include  the  estimated  costs  of drilling  development  wells  and  installation  of  production facilities, plus the net costs associated with dismantlement and abandonment of wells and facilities, under the assumption that  year-end  costs  continue  without  considering  future inflation. Future income taxes were calculated in accordance with the tax laws of the countries in which Eni operates.\n\nThe  standardized  measure  of  discounted  future  net  cash flows, related to the preceding proved oil and gas reserves, is calculated  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of FASB  Extractive  Activities  -  Oil  and  Gas  (Topic  932).  The standardized measure does not purport to reflect realizable values  or  fair  market  value  of  Eni's  proved  reserves.  An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other  things,  hydrocarbon  resources  other  than  proved reserves, anticipated changes in future prices and costs and a discount factor representative of the risks inherent in the oil and gas exploration and production activity.\n\nThe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows by geographical area consists of the following:",

December 22, 1986, No. 917. Following the aforementioned amendments and the amendments to art. 167 of the D.P.R. December 22, 1986, No. 917, the provisions regarding foreign subsidiaries, CFC, are applied if the nonresident  controlled  entities  jointly  present  the  following conditions: a) they are subject to an effective taxation of\n\nless than half to which they would have been subject if they were resident in Italy; b) more than one third of the proceeds fall into one or more of the following categories: interests, royalties, dividends, financial leasing income, income from insurance  and  banking  activities,  income  and  sale  from intra-group services with low or zero added economic value. As of December 31, 2022, Eni controls 6 companies that benefit from a privileged tax regime.\n\nThese 6 companies are subject to taxation in Italy because they are included in Eni's tax return.\n\nNo subsidiary that benefits from a privileged tax regime has issued financial instruments. All the financial statements for 2022 are subject to external audit.",

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate Eni SpA or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe board of statutory auditors is responsible for overseeing, in the terms prescribed by law, the Group's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs part of our audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA Italia), we exercised professional judgement and maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit. Furthermore:\n\n- \u25cf We identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error; we designed and performed audit procedures responsive to those risks; we obtained audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- \u25cf We obtained an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control;\n- \u25cf We evaluated the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors;\n- \u25cf We concluded on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required",

We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe communicated with those charged with governance, identified at an appropriate level as required by ISA Italia regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identified during our audit.\n\nWe also provided those charged with governance with a statement that we complied with the regulations and standards on ethics and independence applicable under Italian law and communicated with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate the related risks, or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determined those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters.
