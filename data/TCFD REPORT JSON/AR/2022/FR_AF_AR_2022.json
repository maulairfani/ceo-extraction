In addition, the Covid-19 crisis remained very present.\n\nOur ambitious strategy enabled us to adapt to these simultaneous crises and prepare for recovery. To that end, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group deployed a major capacity increase for its customers. As a result, in 2022, more than 83/uni00A0million passengers chose Air/uni00A0France, KLM or Transavia for their travel needs.\n\n## AIR/uni00A0FRANCE/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM IN 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n83/hairspacem\n\nPASSENGERS\n\n522\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAIRCRAFT\n\nIn parallel, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group accelerated its major transformation e/fforts, demonstrating our solidity, agility and resilience. The Group's recapitalization plan moved ahead successfully, notably with the Apollo agreement worth over 500/uni00A0million euros. To strengthen our cargo activities, we signed a major strategic air freight partnership with CMA CGM and placed orders for four Airbus A350F Cargo aircraft in April/uni00A02022, followed by another four in January/uni00A02023.\n\n931k TONS OF CARGO\n\n3,000\n\nAIRCRAFT MAINTAINED FOR 200 AIRLINE CUSTOMERS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n120\n\nCOUNTRIES SERVED\n\n300\n\nDESTINATIONS",

These measures were essential to successfully weather the crisis, but it was just as necessary to emerge from them as quickly as possible.\n\nGoing forward, we will be able make new strategic choices as freely as possible. Thanks to the confidence of our investors and the Group's strengths, we have been able to convince the markets. In 2022, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group succeeded in producing a positive net result of 738/uni00A0million euros. We also increased our operating margin, strengthened competitiveness and improved profitability. These important and positive steps are all essential to meet the challenges ahead and achieve our strategic ambitions.\n\nAs you know, our Group is deeply committed to furthering its position as an industry leader in sustainable aviation. Our trajectory is ambitious, with a target of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity per RTK (1) by 30% by 2030, relative to 2019. To that end, we have accelerated the renewal of our fleet (including an order for 100/uni00A0Airbus A320neo family aircraft in December of 2021) and aim to achieve at least 10% integration of sustainable aviation fuels by 2030. To meet these targets, we have signed contracts and memorandums of understanding with several partners (Neste, DG Fuels and TotalEnergies) over the next ten years. We will play an active role in decarbonization, not just for our own operations, but for the entire aviation industry.\n\nBy way of example, the Group has financed an A350-900 in an unprecedented way: with a long-term loan indexed to Air/uni00A0France's environmental performance.\n\nThis is the only way forward. Our vision will become a reality thanks to your invaluable support, the loyalty of our customers and the shared commitment of our employees. The unity of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is an incredible strength that will enable us to be the leader we all strive to be.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBenjamin Smith Chief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM\n\n'Our vision will become a reality thanks to our shareholders' invaluable support, the loyalty of our customers, and the shared commitment of our employees.

The financing transaction is the first sustainability-linked aircraft-secured term loan provided to an airline.\n\nAircraft financing conditions are linked to the achievement by Air/uni00A0France of Sustainability Performance Targets (SPTs) in respect of sustainability-linked key performance indicators. The SPTs selected for the transaction are focusing on the proportion of new-generation and fuel-e/fficient aircraft in Air/uni00A0France's fleet and the future usage of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as part of Air/uni00A0France's daily operations.\n\nThe transaction is supported by a Balthazar non-payment insurance policy provided by a consortium of leading private insurance companies through insurance broker Marsh France.\n\nBy arranging this landmark aircraft financing transaction, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale supports Air/uni00A0France's fleet renewal e/fforts, which are central to the airline's sustainability trajectory.\n\nBy 2050, Air/uni00A0France and Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM aim to reach net zero emissions by using all levers, notably fleet renewal with the introduction of Airbus A220s and A350s at Air/uni00A0France, respectively o/ffering a 20 and 25% reduction in/uni00A0CO2 emissions compared to previous generation aircraft, and the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), which have the potential to reduce/uni00A0CO2 emissions by up to 80% over the entire life cycle.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's ambitious environmental framework and targets have been recognized by the recent ESG Evaluation performed by S&P, rating Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM as leader within the airline industry, and supporting the Group's overall strategy.\n\n## On February/uni00A04, 2022 - Airbus, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, ATR, Dassault Aviation, Groupe ADP, Safran and Thales welcome the Declaration of Toulouse on future sustainability and decarbonisation of aviation alongside European institutions\n\nAirbus, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, ATR, Dassault Aviation, ADP Group, Safran and Thales are supporting the Toulouse Declaration on sustainable development and decarbonization of aviation alongside the European institutions.\n\n- > With this historic declaration, Europe becomes the first region in the world to have reached an agreement between public authorities and private stakeholders on a broad platform for decarbonizing aviation.\n- > Airbus, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, ATR, Dassault Aviation, ADP Group, Safran and Thales confirm their commitment to a collective approach to meet the challenges of the transition to sustainable aviation.\n\n## On March/uni00A030, 2022 - Appeal against the European Commission's decision in the air cargo sector rejected\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has taken Note of the EU General Court's judgement on the appeal filed against the decision of the European Commission of 17/uni00A0March/uni00A02017 for practices considered to be anti-competitive in the air cargo sector.\n\nThe practices in question date back more than twenty years ago and had already been condemned in a decision of the European Commission in 2010 but annulled by the General Court of the European Union in 2015 due to a contradiction between the grounds and the operative part of the decision.\n\nThe Group will immediately analyse this decision in view of an appeal before the Court of Justice.\n\nProvisions of EUR/uni00A0350.6/uni00A0million including interest have been made in respect of these fines in the accounts on 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02021.\n\nThe Group Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM confirms its commitment to comply strictly with competition rules while constantly ensuring the e/ffectiveness of the prevention system that it implements within Group divisions in the framework of its general compliance policy.",

Even at the height of the Covid crisis, we could see the attractiveness of such an o/ffer for our customers, particularly on the North Atlantic route, where load factors in the La Premi\u00e8re cabin are currently higher than they were back in 2019. We look forward to unveiling this new cabin, which is set to meet the highest global standards,' said Benjamin Smith, CEO of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM.\n\nThis large-scale project is part of Air/uni00A0France's strategy to move upmarket, which also covers fleet renewal, lounge renovation and the development of a more sustainable catering offer, signed by Michelin-starred chefs in the airline's Business and La Premi\u00e8re cabins.\n\nIntroduced in 2014, Air/uni00A0France's La Premi\u00e8re suites are currently available on board select Boeing 777-300s serving top destinations in North America, South America, Africa and the Middle East.\n\n## May/uni00A024, 2022 - Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM launches a \u20ac2.256/uni00A0billion rights issue to be subscribed in cash and/or by o/ffsetting claims\n\nThe Company is continuing to strengthen its balance sheet and accelerates the repayment of state aids, increasing its strategic flexibility.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM/uni00A0 S.A.

As announced at full-year results on February/uni00A017 th /uni00A02 022, the Company intends to free itself from the conditions set by the European Commission's temporary framework and will therefore allocate circa 1.7/uni00A0billion euros to the repayment of the 'Covid-19 recapitalization aid' granted in the form of undated subordinated notes (the ' TSS \u00c9tat ') issued in April/uni00A02021. The remainder will be allocated to reduce the Company's net indebtedness.\n- b) This operation, together with the other contemplated measures to strengthen the balance sheet and the expected EBITDA recovery, will enable the Company to strengthen its financial trajectory. The Company's sound financial liquidity position (\u20ac10.8/uni00A0billion of cash at hand as of March/uni00A031 st /uni00A02 0 2 2 ) in a better oriented operational context for the Company, will enable the Company to further repay the French State Aid over the next quarters.

In order to receive these necessary approvals in a timely manner, the Dutch State is also dependent on the timetable of the Dutch Parliament.\n- f) The transaction will enable CMA CGM to become a new reference shareholder and an exclusive strategic partner for the cargo business, as announced on May/uni00A018 th . CMA CGM has committed to subscribe to the transaction for a maximum amount of \u20ac400/uni00A0million (including the acquisition of Rights) and in such a way that its total shareholding does not exceed 9% of the Company's resulting share capital.\n- g) China Eastern Airlines and Delta Air Lines have committed to participate in the Rights Issue on a cash neutral basis by subscribing to new shares through the sale of part of their Rights, using the net proceeds from selling Rights to CMA CGM.\n\nBenjamin Smith, CEO of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, has stated that 'The operation we are launching today is the result of the work we have been doing for several months to consolidate our balance sheet, strengthen our financial autonomy and regain strategic and operational flexibility.

In a context of strong demand for travel, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM will continue to implement its roadmap focused on increased profitability and sustainability, while meeting its customers' expectations, fulfilling its CSR commitments and seizing the opportunities that will arise as the airline industry recovers.'\n\n## Allocation of the share capital following the transaction\n\nFollowing the settlement and delivery of the Rights Issue, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's share capital will amount to 2,570,536,136/uni00A0shares with a nominal value of \u20ac1/uni00A0each.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's shareholding structure following the settlement and delivery of the rights Issue would be as per the table below:\n\n|                                | % of the capital  (post rights Issue)   | % voting rights  (post rights Issue)   | % of the capital  (as of April/uni00A030,  2022)   | % voting rights  (as of April/uni00A030,  2022)   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Number of shares/voting rights | 2,570,536,136                           | 2,798,982,387                          | 642,634,034                                        | 871,080,285                                       |\n| French State                   | 28.6%                                   | 28.5%                                  | 28.6%                                              | 28.1%                                             |\n| Dutch State                    | 9.3%                                    | 10.7%                                  | 9.3%                                               | 13.8%                                             |\n| CMA CGM                        | 9%                                      | 8.3%                                   | 0%                                                 | 0%                                                |\n| China Eastern Airlines         | 4.7%                                    | 5.6%                                   | 9.6%                                               | 11.4%                                             |\n| Delta Air Lines, Inc           | 2.9%                                    | 4%                                     | 5.8%                                               | 8.6%                                              |\n| Treasury stock                 | 0.05%                                   | 0.1%                                   | 0.2%                                               | 0.3%                                              |\n| Others                         | 45.5%                                   | 42.9%                                  | 46.5%                                              | 37.8%                                             |\n\n## Rationale for the Rights Issue\n\nAs announced on February/uni00A017 and detailed in the press release dated May/uni00A024, 2022, this transaction implements new recapitalization measures, following the initial capital increase in 2021.\n\n- a) The net proceeds of the issue will be partly allocated to repaying the deeply subordinated bonds issued in April/uni00A02021 and held by the French State as well as strengthening the Company's equity. As announced during its full-year results presentation on February/uni00A017, 2022, the Company intends to free itself from the conditions set by the European Commission's Covid-19 temporary framework and will therefore allocate about \u20ac1.7/uni00A0billion to the repayment of the 'Covid-19 recapitalization aid' granted in the form of\n\nundated subordinated notes (the ' TSS \u00c9tat ') issued in April/uni00A02021, through o/ffset and repayment. The remainder (about \u20ac0.6/uni00A0billion) will come to reduce net debt.\n\n- b) This operation marks a significant step in the execution of the up to \u20ac4/uni00A0billion equity and quasi-equity issuance program designed to strengthen the balance sheet, as announced on February/uni00A017 th . In the context of the Company's expected performance recovery, with a 7% to 8% operating margin targeted in 2024, the Company is confident that no further dilutive measures will be needed. The Company's sound financial liquidity position (\u20ac10.8/uni00A0billion of cash at hand as of March/uni00A031, 2022) and promising outlook will allow Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM to repay additional outstanding State Aid, which will further improve the financing costs of the Company.",

Its shareholding after the completion of the Rights Issue remains unchanged. This subscription was carried out by way of o/ffsetting a portion of the deeply subordinated notes (TSS \u00c9tat) issued in April/uni00A02021.\n\nThe Dutch State participated on an irreducible basis to the full extent of its Rights, corresponding to a subscription of 180,000,000/uni00A0New Shares. Its shareholding after the completion of the Rights Issue remains unchanged.\n\nCMA CGM, exclusive strategic partner for the cargo business, becomes a new reference shareholder, with a total shareholding amounting to 231,348,252/uni00A0New Shares, corresponding to 9.0% of the Company's share capital after the Rights Issue.\n\nChina Eastern Airlines and Delta Air Lines participated in the Rights Issue on a cash-neutral basis, for an aggregate amount of approximately \u20ac110.7/uni00A0million by subscribing to 58,763,343 and 35,873,772/uni00A0New Shares respectively by using the net proceeds from selling part of their Rights to CMA CGM. This brings their respective shareholdings to 4.7% and 2.9% of the Company's share capital after the Rights Issue.\n\nThe FCPEs ('Fond Commun de Placement Entreprise') participated in the Rights Issue on a cash-neutral basis through the sale of part of their Rights to the benefit of CMA CGM in a proportion allowing them to partially finance the exercise of the balance of their Rights by using the net proceeds of this sale.\n\nThe SPAAK (Stichting Piloten Aandelen Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM) participated in the Rights Issue on a cash-neutral basis by subscribing to new shares through the sale of part of their Rights.\n\n## Timetable\n\nSettlement and delivery of the New Shares and commencement of trading on Euronext Paris and Euronext Amsterdam are expected to take place on June/uni00A016, 2022. The New Shares will immediately entitle their holders to receive dividends declared by the Company as from the date of issuance. They will be fully fungible with existing shares of the Company and will be traded on the same trading line under the same ISIN code FR0000031122.\n\n## Lock-up commitments\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has agreed to a lock-up period starting on the date of the signing of the underwriting agreement and expiring 180/uni00A0calendar days following the settlement and delivery date of the New Shares, subject to certain exceptions.\n\nThe French State, the Dutch State, China Eastern Airlines and Delta Air Lines have entered into a lock-up agreement from the approval of the Prospectus by the French Autorit\u00e9 des Marches Financiers (the 'AMF') and until the expiration of a period of 90/uni00A0calendar days following the date of settlement and delivery of the New Shares, subject to certain exceptions.\n\nCMA CGM has agreed with the Company on a lock-up commitment as from the settlement-delivery of the New Shares until the expiry of a three-year period following this date, it being specified that CMA CGM may sell a maximum of 50% of the shares acquired in the context of the Rights Issue during an additional three-year period. This lock-up commitment will be terminated early if a firm and complete cooperation agreement in relation to air cargo is not concluded before December/uni00A01, 2022 or if such an agreement is terminated.\n\nIn addition, CMA CGM committed to a 10-year period to not acquire or subscribe to any shares issued by the Company, unless such acquisition does not lead to an increase of its stake in the share capital of the Company, subject to certain exceptions. The undertaking specifies that at the end of a period of 5/uni00A0years from the settlement-delivery of the New Shares, the Board of Directors of the Company may modify this undertaking in order to allow CMA CGM to increase its shareholding in the Company.\n\nThe appointment of Rodolphe Saad\u00e9 as a Board Director for a four-year term of o/ffice was approved by the General Shareholders' Meeting held on May/uni00A024, 2022 and will be e/ffective on July/uni00A015, 2022, after all regulatory approvals have been received.\n\nThe Rights Issue was conducted by Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Natixis, Cr\u00e9dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale acting as Joint Global Coordinators, Lead Managers and Joint Bookrunners, ABN AMRO Bank N.V., Banco Santander,/uni00A0S.A., Citigroup and Co\u00f6peratieve Rabobank U.A acting as Joint Bookrunners; and Cr\u00e9dit Industriel et Commercial/uni00A0S.A., MUFG Securities (Europe) N.V. and SMBC Bank EU AG acting as co-lead managers.\n\n## Risk factors\n\nPotential investors are also advised to consider carefully the risk factors described in chapter/uni00A03.1 'Risk factors' of the 2021 Universal Registration Document, chapter/uni00A02 'Risk factors' of the amendment to the 2021 Universal Registration Document and chapter/uni00A02 'Risk factors' of the Securities Note.

At the same time, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM presents 'Destination Sustainability', a program bringing together the Group's ambitions on the environment and climate change on the one hand, and the human factor on the other, by bringing the values of respect, equality and tolerance to the fore.\n\nIn a context still marked by the aftermath of the pandemic and international tensions, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM intends to strengthen its commitment towards sustainable air transport. It is doing so by following a scientific approach based on rigorous criteria, which has been validated by SBTi, an independent reference organization. In addition to achieving zero net/uni00A0CO2 emissions by 2050, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM aims to reduce its emissions per passenger-km by 30% compared to 2019. The Group is also committed to using 10% of Sustainable Aviation Fuel by 2030, well beyond the regulatory mandate envisioned in Refuel EU for flights departing from Europe.\n\nTo illustrate their strong commitment to more responsible air transport, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group airlines are mobilizing for the 'Connecting Europe Days', held from 28/uni00A0to 30/uni00A0June in Lyon by the European Commission to discuss transport policies and promote sustainable mobility. Five flights operated by Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Transavia will fly to their destinations carrying at least 30% of sustainable aviation fuel.\n\nSocial and societal responsibility is the second pillar of the Destination Sustainability strategy. With more than 71,000/uni00A0employees, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is a leading employer, determined to foster an ever more inclusive culture and to fight against all forms of discrimination and inequality at work. For example, a third of the positions on the Group's Executive Committee should be held by women and women should represent 40% of management positions by 2030.\n\n'In 2021, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group was able to count on its 71,000/uni00A0employees and their unfailing commitment. The report we are publishing today is the result of their actions and e/fforts to place our Group at the forefront of a sector that is reinventing itself. Our Destination Sustainability program embodies our willingness to position ourselves as leaders in sustainable aviation' said Benjamin Smith, CEO of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group.\n\n## June/uni00A030, 2022 - KLM repays remainder of loan to the Dutch government\n\nKLM Royal Dutch Airlines will be repaying the final portion of \u20ac277/uni00A0million of the loans secured from the Dutch government and the banks in 2020. KLM borrowed a total of \u20ac942/uni00A0million from the credit facility of \u20ac3.4/uni00A0billion. This repayment means that two years on, KLM will have redeemed all the portions it used of the loan package received to deal with the Covid-19 crisis and to safeguard its future.\n\nVarious factors including the departure of 6,000/uni00A0KLM sta/ff members, a sharp reduction in costs, the removal of travel restrictions and the rising demand for airline tickets made it possible for KLM to make two repayments earlier this year against the total loan amount of \u20ac942/uni00A0million.\n\nIn three steps, the total amount has now been redeemed. KLM paid \u20ac311/uni00A0million to the banks on May/uni00A03 and another \u20ac354/uni00A0million on June/uni00A03, paying o/ff the entire sum in bank loans of \u20ac665/uni00A0million. By now repaying the remaining \u20ac277/uni00A0million, KLM has also redeemed the portion of the loan issued by the Dutch government.\n\nKLM is incredibly grateful to the Dutch government and the banks for their support during the pandemic. By repaying its loans as quickly as possible, KLM shows that it takes its responsibilities seriously and that it keeps its promises to its financial stakeholders, government and society.\n\n## July/uni00A05, 2022 - Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM signs an agreement with CFM International for the engine configuration of its future Airbus A320neo family fleet\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM announces today the signing of an agreement with CFM International for the acquisition of 200/uni00A0LEAP-1A engines to power its new fleet of Airbus A320neo and A321neo.",

Latest generation aircraft like our upcoming A320neo and A321neo enable a 10% unit cost reduction, emit 15% less/uni00A0CO2 and generate 50% less noise, in part thanks to their advanced engines. Through this agreement, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and CFM International are building on their longstanding relationship to make aviation more sustainable.'\n\nGa\u00ebl M\u00e9heust, President and CEO of CFM International said 'We are honored to further expand our partnership with one of the largest groups in the industry and to be an integral part of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's sustainability strategy. Air-France-KLM's renewed trust is a valuable recognition of the LEAP engine performances in terms of sustainability and fuel e/fficiency. We are looking forward to introducing the LEAP into their new fleet and to supporting KLM, Transavia Netherlands and Transavia France operations.'\n\n## July/uni00A013, 2022 - Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and Apollo sign a definitive agreement for a EUR/uni00A0500/uni00A0million investment into an ad hoc operating a/ffiliate of Air/uni00A0France owning spare engines\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and Apollo Global Management (NYSE: APO) today announced the signing of a definitive agreement for Apollo-managed funds and entities to make a EUR/uni00A0500/uni00A0million investment into an ad hoc operating affiliate of Air/uni00A0France that will own a pool of spare engines dedicated to the airline's Engineering and Maintenance activities.\n\nUnder this agreement, Apollo a/ffiliated entities will subscribe to perpetual bonds issued by the ad hoc operating a/ffiliate, which will be accounted as equity under IFRS. The proceeds of the transaction will enable Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and Air/uni00A0France to further redeem the French State perpetual bonds, in accordance with article 77/uni00A0bis of the European Commission's 'Temporary Framework for State Aid measures to support the economy in the current Covid-19 outbreak', hence pursuing the redemption of the French State Aid.\n\nAs a result of the transaction, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM will benefit from lower financing costs. The perpetual bonds will bear an interest rate of 6% for the first 3/uni00A0years, and gradual step ups and caps will be applied thereafter. Air/uni00A0France will have the ability to redeem the bonds at any time after year 3.\n\nThis structure will incur no change of ownership, operational and social aspects of Air/uni00A0France Engineering and Maintenance activity. In the future, it could also help finance the acquisition of additional spare engines to support Air/uni00A0France's fleet renewal program. There will be no change in the way Air/uni00A0France uses the spare engines, and no impact on Air/uni00A0France or Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM employees' contracts.\n\nThe transaction, expected to close later in July, is a part of the recapitalization measures announced on February/uni00A017 th , 2022.\n\n## On August, 31 2022 - Pieter Bootsma appointed Executive Vice-President and Chief Strategy O/fficer and Angus Clarke appointed Executive Vice-President and Chief Commercial O/fficer\n\nPieter Bootsma, currently Executive Vice-President and Chief Revenue O/fficer, is appointed Executive Vice-President and Chief Strategy O/fficer.\n\nPieter Bootsma will be responsible for defining and implementing Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's long-term strategy, in coordination with all the Group's stakeholders, as well as business development opportunities in its di/fferent entities.\n\nAngus Clarke is appointed Executive Vice-President and Chief Commercial O/fficer.

Its decarbonisation trajectory factors in the incorporation of 10% SAF by 2030, alongside fleet renewal and eco-piloting. These contracts represent a first step by the Group towards achieving its 10% SAF incorporation targets by 2030 and will cover approximately 3/uni00A0of the 10% SAF requirements.\n\nBy committing to long-term fuel purchases now, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM supports the development of the SAF production industry, which is still in its infancy worldwide (in 2021, SAF production represented 0.01% of the jet fuel consumed worldwide), resulting in prices 3/uni00A0to 4/uni00A0times higher compared to conventional kerosene. By increasing use and demand, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM aims to play its part in increasing the scale of commercial SAF production for wider adoption by 2030.\n\nThese significant o/ff-take agreements made by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM are key to the Group's decarbonisation commitments. The e/fforts will be reinforced by additional environmental commitments in the coming years (new SAF contracts, R&D on e-fuels or hydrogens, Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS),/uni00A0etc.). However, the global objective of zero net emissions by 2050 can\n\nonly be achieved if all public and private parties work together to make this transition a success. This could involve incentive mechanisms, such as those already in place in the United States and notably in the state of California.\n\n'Decarbonisation is the biggest challenge the aviation industry has ever faced. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is activating all available levers to reduce its environmental impact: fleet renewal, eco-piloting, and the increased use of certified Sustainable Aviation Fuels', said Benjamin Smith, CEO of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM. 'The contracts we have signed embody our long-term commitment to the development of SAF production capabilities around the world, to the benefit of the industry as a whole. We look forward to working with Neste and DG Fuels, with whom we have established solid partnerships which will pave the way to the creation of a global network of providers capable of meeting our future needs.'\n\n## Sustainable aviation fuel, an essential lever to reduce the environmental impact of the airline industry\n\nSustainable aviation fuels are one of the most promising ways of r e d u c i n g /uni00A0C O 2 emissions in the aviation industry, next to reducing fuel use. SAF can reduce/uni00A0CO2 emissions by an average of 80% compared to conventional fuel on a life cycle basis and does not require any engine modifications. The current generation of SAF can be made from used cooking oil, waste, and agricultural and forestry residues. In the future, synthetic sustainable aviation fuels will also become available, made from hydrogen and captured carbon.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has established a strict sourcing policy under which it commits itself only to purchase SAF that does not compete with human food or animal feed supply, that are RSB or ISCC+ certified for their sustainability, and that are not derived from palm oil.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is also incorporating up to 1% SAF on a one-year overall for its flights from France and the Netherlands, in order for instance to comply with the French legislation in force since January/uni00A02022.\n\n## Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, a leader in the use of sustainable aviation fuel\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has been investing in the testing and use of sustainable aviation fuel for more than 15/uni00A0years. In 2011, KLM conducted the world's first commercial flight partially fuelled with SAF, while Air/uni00A0France launched the 'Lab Line for the Future' in 2014, a two-year experiment during which 78/uni00A0flights between Paris-Orly and Toulouse and between Paris-Orly and Nice were partially fuelled with sustainable aviation fuel.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM also supports the development of a production chain in France and the Netherlands. In 2020, Air/uni00A0France worked together with Airbus, Safran, Suez and Total to promote the growth of the SAF production chain in France. The following year, Air/uni00A0France operated its first long-haul flight fuelled by SAF produced entirely in France, while KLM operated the world's first commercial flight with synthetic fuel produced in the Netherlands.",

In that context, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, Air/uni00A0France Group and KLM have submitted their/uni00A0CO2 emissions reduction targets, and they have recently been approved by the SBTi's Target Validation Team. The SBTi has approved the Group's scope/uni00A01 and scope/uni00A03/uni00A0emissions reduction targets and has confirmed that they are in line with a well-below 2\u00b0C objective, as determined by the Paris Agreement signed in 2015.\n\n'The Group designed a consistent approach, developed within its Destination Sustainability strategy, with the goal of/uni00A0CO2 emissions reduction based on three main pillars: fleet renewal, sustainable aviation fuel and operational measures,' said Benjamin Smith, CEO of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group. 'The SBTi targets approval is a key element for the Group to ensure that Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's decarbonization strategy is consistent with scientific objectives.'\n\n'Faced with the climate emergency, alongside all airlines in the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, Air/uni00A0France is taking responsibility and is fully committed to reducing its carbon footprint,' said Anne Rigail, CEO of Air/uni00A0France. 'This year, we created a tailor-made strategy called Air/uni00A0France ACT, based on four pillars: the accelerated renewal of our fleet, the progressive utilization of SAF beyond French and European mandates, the development of eco-responsible piloting and the deployment of intermodality through our reinforced cooperation with train operators. The approval of our 2030/uni00A0CO2 emissions reduction by the SBTi confirms the robustness of our decarbonization roadmap, and we will continue to transparently share our actions and results with our customers and the general public.'\n\n'Together with Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and Air/uni00A0France, KLM has strong ambitions when it comes to making aviation more sustainable and balancing the development of our network with the environment,' said Marjan Rintel, CEO KLM. 'This requires fundamental decisions regarding our fleet, our operations, and our fuel use. The Science Based Targets and the associated/uni00A0CO2 reduction direction provides clarity and, at the same time, entails major challenges. To make them feasible, we work closely with each other and with our sector partners to develop technical solutions and innovations that support the energy transition in aviation.'",

To do so, the Group has established a decarbonization objective based on three main levers aggregated within the 'Destination Sustainability' program.\n\nThese levers are as follows:\n\n- > an ambitious plan to modernize and renew the fleets of Group airlines with latest-generation aircraft, emitting 20-25% less/uni00A0CO2 compared to their predecessors. With the objective of having 64% of new generation aircraft in the Group's fleet by 2028, the Group is currently investing over \u20ac2/uni00A0billion annually for the acquisition of Airbus A220s, Airbus A320neos and A321neos, Airbus A350s, Boeing 787s and Embraer 195-E2s, which are amongst the most e/fficient aircraft in their respective categories;\n- > the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF). These non-fossil fuels can be produced from industrial or domestic waste in a circular economy, and the SAF sourced by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM does not compete with the human food chain or with animal feed. Air/uni00A0France and KLM have been pioneers in the use of these alternative fuels, which will play a key role in the decarbonization of air transport, as they can reduce/uni00A0CO2 emissions by up to 80% over their life cycle. In that respect, two o/ff-take agreements were signed in November/uni00A02022 enabling the Group to secure 3% out of the 10% 2030 SAF incorporation objective;\n- > the improvement of operational e/fficiency, by favouring more direct objectives and applying procedures that limit fuel consumption (single-engine taxi, continuous descent,/uni00A0etc.).\n\nIn addition, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is working with the broader aviation sector to accelerate the development of innovative solutions for aircraft design and maintenance, engines, and synthetic fuels, which are required to reach net zero emissions in aviation.\n\n## SBTi, a scientific approach in line with the Paris agreement\n\nThe Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) is a global body enabling businesses to set ambitious emissions reductions targets in line with the latest climate science.\n\nThe initiative is a collaboration between the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the United Nations Global Compact, the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The SBTi independently assesses and validates companies'/uni00A0CO2 emissions targets based on a scientific approach and criteria.\n\n## On December/uni00A05, 2022 - Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and TotalEnergies sign Memorandum of Understanding to supply sustainable aviation fuel for 10/uni00A0years\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and TotalEnergies have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that will see TotalEnergies deliver more than one million cubic metres or 800,000/uni00A0tonnes of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group airlines over a 10-year period, starting in 2023.\n\nThis SAF will be produced by TotalEnergies at its biorefineries and will be made available to the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's airlines, mainly for flights departing from France (in accordance with French legislation) and the Netherlands.\n\nSAF fuels reduce/uni00A0CO2 emissions by an average of at least 80% over their entire lifecycle, compared to their fossil equivalent.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has implemented a strict sourcing policy and is committed to procuring only SAF fuels that do not compete with human food or animal feed, that are RSB or ISCC certified for sustainability, and that are not derived from palm oil.\n\nWith the signing of this MoU, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and TotalEnergies confirm their collaboration and their goal of furthering the development of a more responsible aviation sector.\n\n## A long-standing partnership in support of the aviation sector's decarbonization\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group and TotalEnergies have been collaborating on the use of sustainable aviation fuel for nearly 10/uni00A0 years. Their partnership began in 2014 with 'Lab Line for the Future,' a two-year experiment during which 78/uni00A0Air/uni00A0France flights between Paris-Orly and Toulouse, and between Paris-Orly and Nice were fuelled with 10% SAF supplied by TotalEnergies.\n\nIn January/uni00A02020, Air/uni00A0France and TotalEnergies participated, alongside Safran and Suez, in the call for Expression of Interest initiated by the French government with the aim of developing sustainable aviation fuel production in France.\n\nOver the last two years, TotalEnergies has also supplied SAF for a number of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's commercial flights:\n\n- a) in May/uni00A02021, the first Air/uni00A0France long-haul flight, between Paris and Montreal, powered with a blend that included 16% SAF produced in France;\n- b) in October/uni00A02021, an Air/uni00A0France flight between Paris and Nice was powered with 30% SAF;\n- c) in May/uni00A02022, an Air/uni00A0France flight operated as part of the SkyTeam Sustainable Flight Challenge, between Paris and Montreal, with 16% SAF;\n- d) in June/uni00A02022, several flights, planned by all of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's airlines as part of the Connecting Europe Days, were powered with 30% SAF.",

They will be based at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport.\n\nIn December/uni00A02021, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM had placed an order for 4/uni00A0Airbus A350F full freighter aircraft for Air/uni00A0France.\n\nDeliveries to Martinair and Air/uni00A0France are expected as of the second half of 2026, meaning both airlines will be among the launch operators of the A350F full freighter.\n\nBenefiting from the latest technological innovations and powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97/uni00A0engines, the Airbus A350F delivers significantly improved environmental performance with an over 40% reduction in/uni00A0CO2 emissions compared to the Boeing 747F. Its noise footprint is also 50% lower.\n\n## b) a firm order for 3/uni00A0additional A350-900/uni00A0passenger aircraft for Air/uni00A0France, bringing the total number of A350-900/uni00A0expected by Air/uni00A0France to 41.\n\nThese Airbus A350s will replace previous-generation aircraft and be based at Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport.\n\nThey will feature a three-class configuration (Business, Premium Economy, Economy).\n\nDeliveries are expected in 2024.\n\nFleet renewal is the key driver to cutting/uni00A0CO2 emissions, with immediate e/ffect. Alongside the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) and eco-piloting, it is one of the pillars of the Group's decarbonization trajectory, which aims for a 30% reduction of/uni00A0CO2 emissions per passenger/km by 2030 compared to 2019. These targets have recently been approved by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi).\n\n'Investing in the renewal of our fleet means investing in the future of our Group,' said Benjamin Smith, CEO of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM. 'I am delighted to announce that KLM and Air/uni00A0France's cargo divisions will soon operate the quietest and most advanced full freighter aircraft available on the market, the Airbus A350F. This investment is evidence of our confidence in the sustainable growth of the cargo market in the coming years, as well as our commitment to reducing our environmental footprint. I am also very happy to announce that Air/uni00A0France will continue to accelerate the renewal of its fleet with the addition of 3/uni00A0A350 passenger aircraft. Since its entry into service at Air/uni00A0France, the A350-900/uni00A0has proved to be a reliable and e/fficient aircraft, as well as a game changer in terms of reduction of/uni00A0CO2 and noise emissions. We will continue our efforts to renew our fleet as quickly as possible to provide our customers with the best customer experience possible and to meet our ambitious decarbonization targets.'\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2022, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM operated a fleet of 506/uni00A0aircraft, including 6/uni00A0full freighters.\n\n## On March/uni00A015, 2023 - Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM announces the full repayment of its bank loan guaranteed by the French State ('PGE'), making a final step towards the full repayment of States support liquidity measures\n\n- a) Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has fully repaid the remaining \u20ac2.5/uni00A0billion from its initial \u20ac4/uni00A0billion Bank loan guaranteed by the French State, granted during the Covid-19 crisis.\n- b) The Group's solid cash position combined with the \u20ac1/uni00A0billion proceeds of the Sustainability-Linked Bond issued in January/uni00A02023, has enabled to accelerate and close the repayment in full of the outstanding 'PGE'.\n- c) This full repayment will contribute to smoothing the Group's debt profile, reduce financial costs and limit residual exposure to floating rates.\n\nIn 2022, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM recorded a strong rebound of its revenues, an improved operating result and a positive net income resulting in a strong cash position of \u20ac10.6/uni00A0billion by the end of 2022. On the back of this robust operational performance, the Group successfully issued in January/uni00A02023 an inaugural Sustainability-Linked Bond for a total aggregate amount of \u20ac1.0/uni00A0billion.\n\nGiven this context, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has now reached an agreement with the French State and the syndicate of nine banks participating in the 'PGE' to proceed with the full repayment of the outstanding \u20ac2.5/uni00A0billion, as announced during the FY 2022 results presentation on February/uni00A017 th , 2023. To do so, the Group used the \u20ac1.0/uni00A0billion proceeds of the Sustainability-Linked Bond and \u20ac1.5/uni00A0billion of its available cash. This full repayment will contribute to smoothing the Group's debt profile, reduce financial costs and limit residual exposure to floating rates, and marks a final step towards the full repayment of the current French State liquidity support measures.",

This transaction allows the Group to fully exit the Covid-19 recapitalization State Aid as well as its related restrictions and without any change of the capital ownership.\n\nThe Group has now refinanced these repayment and compensation, for a total of \u20ac407/uni00A0million through the issuance of new French State hybrid perpetual bonds, in compliance with the European Commission decision on February/uni00A016, 2023 (1) . These new hybrid perpetual bonds with no restriction attached contain similar financial conditions as the one repaid and will be assimilated to the \u20ac320/uni00A0million hybrid perpetual bonds issued on 17/uni00A0March/uni00A02023, with non-call date and interest rate step-up postponed by an additional two years (March/uni00A02029).\n\nMr. Benjamin Smith, Group CEO, stated: 'Today marks an important milestone for Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM. I am pleased that we have now fully repaid all State Aid, which releases us from the associated conditions. I want to thank the French and Dutch States again for their invaluable support during this unprecedented Covid-19 crisis, and I also wish to express my gratitude to our sta/ff around the world for their unwavering commitment in these di/fficult times. I am confident that we will be able to continue the successful turnaround we have begun thanks to our continued and accelerated transformation, and that we will emerge stronger out of this trying period, as a leader with a strong sustainability focus'.",

This slowdown in growth was explained by the fact that 2021 saw a pick-up in activity. However, the growth of the world economy only returned to its pre-Covid growth rate (2.6% in 2019). Many factors impacted the global economy this year: the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, inflationary pressures, the e/ffects of Covid and the supply chains disruption.\n\nThe war in Ukraine is weakening the Ukrainian and Russian economies, with spill-over e/ffects on the rest of the world such as higher oil and gas prices and, in the short term, a decrease in the global supply of key materials, adding to the existing bottlenecks due to China's zero-Covid policy. The increase in energy costs has significantly reduced household incomes and increased business' costs. In 2022, the Eurozone saw the same GDP growth trend with 3.2% (compared to 5.5% in 2021).\n\nForecasts show the growth in economic activity continuing to slow before turning negative in 2023, with a decline of -0.12%.\n\nFrance also experienced slower GDP growth in 2022, at 2.5% GDP (compared to 7.2% in 2021). As with the global economy, this was mainly due to a return to a pre-Covid level (1.9% in 2019). Over the same period, the GDP growth in the Netherlands was 4.3%, close to its 2021 level of 5%, and well above the 2019 level of 1.9%. The forecasts for 2023 foresee respective growth of 0.1% and 0.4% for France and the Netherlands./thinspace (2)\n\nChina's economic growth was 3.1% in 2022 (compared to 8.8% in 2021), mainly due to the zero-Covid policy in addition to numerous successive lockdowns confinements. robust measures were implemented to control the spread of the virus, and sporadic outbreaks were suppressed by strict, localized lockdowns, mass testing and mass isolation measures. the 2022 growth was mainly driven by household consumption./thinspace (3) /thinspace\n\n## Oil price\n\n| Brent  (US$/bbl)       |   2021 Q3 |   2021 Q4 |   2022 Q1 |   2022 Q2 |   2022 Q3 |   2022 Q4 |\n|------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Average Brent price    |      73.5 |      79.6 |     100.3 |     113.5 |     100.7 |      88.5 |\n| Average Jet fuel price |      79.9 |      92.3 |     120.8 |     167   |     141.1 |     136.8 |\n\nSource/thinspace (4) /thinspace (5)",

Since then, the price of oil has declined and returned to its pre-war levels.

The depreciation of the euro has added to the build-up of inflationary pressures./thinspace (2) This depreciation reflects the di/fferent macroeconomic outlooks for the Eurozone compared to the United States: a higher growth forecast for the United States, political uncertainty in several large European economies during 2022 and the impact of the war in Ukraine.\n\nAnnual inflation in the Euro zone is expected to have been 10.0% in November/uni00A02022, down from 10.6% in October. This is leading\n\nto further increases in all component prices: energy is expected to have posted the highest annual price inscrease in November (34.9%, compared with 41.5% in October), followed by food, alcohol and tobacco (13.6%, compared with 13.1% in October), non-energy industrial goods (6.1%, stable compared with October) and services (4.2%, compared with 4.3% in October).\n\nDespite the considerable uncertainty regarding the post-Brexit relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, Pound-Sterling (GBP) held up well versus the Euro (EUR), trading at around GBP/EUR/uni00A00.86-0.85.\n\n## 1.1.2/emspace The industry context and competition\n\n## Worldwide capacity\n\nIn 2022, worldwide capacity reached an average of 77% (all figures are relative to the same period of 2019), marking a significant progress from 68% in January/uni00A02022 to 84% in December/uni00A02022/thinspace (3) .\n\nIn 2022 airlines su/ffered from multiple bottlenecks at airports due to the stronger-than-expected recovery. Airlines that were unable to deal with the already-sold program were forced to adjust their schedules and cancel up to 10% of their scheduled flights./thinspace (4) Due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the world also experienced geopolitical tensions, resulting in economic and operational impacts.\n\nDomestic and intra-regional flights continue to lead the recovery. Amongst the largest domestic markets, US internal capacity almost fully recovered its pre-pandemic level, maintaining 96% on average throughout 2022 (vs. 83% in 2021).\n\nChinese domestic capacity fluctuated greatly over the course of 2022 due to the strict zero-Covid policies imposed by the local authorities, dropping from 105% at the beginning of the year to a low of 74% in April, before returning to 91% at the year end. Capacity maintained a 92% average for the full year 2022 (versus 107% in 2021; note that Chinese domestic capacity was the first to recover having already reached 100% in the second half of 2020).\n\nDespite some operational challenges, intra-European flows continued their steady recovery in 2022, starting the year with 72% in January and reaching a high of 94% in October, before finishing the year at 89% in December. Intra-European capacity averaged 87% for the 2022 full year (versus 54% in 2021).",

Air cargo capacity, measured in available cargo ton-kilometers (ACTKs), also experienced a remarkable rebound after the pandemic shock but nevertheless remained below its pre-crisis level, with the load factor still slightly above its level in 2019./thinspace (1) /thinspace\n\nPrior to the pandemic, the transportation of air cargo had been evenly divided between passenger aircraft bellies and dedicated freighters. However, comparing July/uni00A02019 with July/uni00A02022, the share of international CTKs transported by dedicated freighters increased by 12/uni00A0ppts from 49.6% to 61.7%./thinspace (2) /thinspace\n\nAt the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, airlines were temporarily allowed by civil aviation authorities to use cabin space for cargo transportation in passenger aircraft, known as 'preighter flights'. The share of international CTKs transported by 'preighters' became quite significant, but was to disappear with the return to\n\nservice of passenger aircraft and the ending of the fire-exemptions by the aviation authorities./thinspace (3) /thinspace\n\n## Maintenance\n\nThe aeronautics maintenance or MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Operations) market is mostly driven by the age, cycles and flight hours of the worldwide fleet. The trends in this business closely follow those of the commercial airline fleets globally and their utilization.\n\nIn October/uni00A02022, MRO spending was estimated to amount to just under $74/uni00A0billion for the 2022 financial year down from $79/uni00A0billion in early 2022 (versus $89bn for the 2019 financial year), the recovery having been negatively impacted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the slowdown of activity in China with the reimposition of lockdowns.\n\nAs MRO recovery and growth rates usually closely follow fleet growth rates, they are expected to be slower for areas where fleet growth is more moderate (Africa, Latin America, Western Europe and, recently, Eastern Europe), with more rapid growth for the Indian and Chinese zones.\n\n## 1.2/emspace STRATEGY\n\n## 1.2.1/emspace The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's ambitions\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's purpose is: ' At the forefront of a more responsible European aviation, we unite people for the world of tomorrow .'\n\nThe Group's business brings people, economies and cultures together, and drives economic growth and social progress.

As such, flight safety, whether airline safety or health security, is both an absolute imperative that the Group owes to its customers and sta/ff, and a daily commitment.\n\n## 1.2.2/emspace Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM: core assets and unique competitive advantages\n\nAs one of the European leaders for intercontinental traffic on departure from Europe, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is a major global air transport player. Its main businesses are passenger and cargo transportation through its network activities, low-cost transportation and aeronautical maintenance.\n\nThe Group takes action to reconcile growth with environmental protection, social value and local development at its hubs and destinations. By developing state-of-the-art technologies, investing in R&D and innovation, and partnering with stakeholders, the Group strives to optimize the use of its di/fferent forms of\n\ncapital and resources.

The common frequent flyer program, 'Flying Blue' contributes to reinforcing the attractiveness of the brands.\n\nFlying Blue will be further leveraged as a margin generator with the ambition to double its contribution to the Group by 2024 versus 2019, Flying Blue currently numbers 17/uni00A0million members, with one new member enrolling every 20/uni00A0seconds). It has an extensive and growing network of partners (airlines, banking and consumer firms) and contributes positively to the Group margin through sales of miles, which proved resilient during the crisis.\n\n## Partnership: a solid network of suppliers and partners\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is pursuing its commercial integration strategy with its principal partners worldwide, like Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and China Eastern Airlines, and through the SkyTeam alliance, to o/ffer value-added services and innovations, whilst reinforcing its network and building mutual trust.

In 2022, it served more than 300/uni00A0destinations in 120/uni00A0countries.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM confirmed its commitment and ambition of maintaining a leading position in terms of tra/ffic and capacity with over 83/uni00A0million passengers carried in 2022 (versus 45/uni00A0million in 2021) between Europe and the rest of the world, as well as intra-European and domestic routes on departure from the Group's natural markets.\n\nThe Group diversifies its portfolios by being present in all the large markets with no one market representing more than a third of network revenues. Its global footprint, together with optimized fleet, enables the Group to capture the opportunities ahead, while persuading its long-term goals.\n\n## Capital structure: a stable shareholding structure with the French and Dutch States, CMA CGM, Delta Air Lines and China Eastern\n\nIn June/uni00A02022, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM increased its capital for a total amount of \u20ac2,256/uni00A0million, enabling the partial redemption of the subordinated notes held by the French State for a nominal amount of \u20ac1,631/uni00A0million. The French and Dutch State shareholdings remained unchanged at 28.6% and 9.3% respectively, while CMA CGM became a new shareholder with 9% of the Company's share capital, and China Eastern Airlines and Delta Air Lines, Inc holding respectively4.7% and 2.9%.\n\nIn early 2023, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM successfully placed its first sustainability-linked bonds, for a nominal amount of \u20ac1.0/uni00A0billion.

Full year Capex spending was \u20ac2.3/uni00A0billion with 80% being fleet and fleet related and 20% IT and Ground related expenditure.\n\nDuring the first half of 2022, the Dutch State Aid was repaid in full, for a total amount of \u20ac942/uni00A0million, while the capital increase in June/uni00A02022 enabled the partial redemption of the subordinated notes held by the French State for a nominal amount of \u20ac1,631/uni00A0million. These transactions contributed to strengthening the Group's balance sheet and equity.\n\nIn addition, the agreement between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and Apollo made it possible to partially reimburse the subordinated notes held by the French State for a nominal amount of \u20ac487/uni00A0million./thinspace (1)\n\nEarly 2023, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has successfully placed its first sustainability-linked bonds, for a nominal amount of \u20ac1.0bn.\n\nAt the same time, the Group is continuing to work on various additional options to restore its equity, with current Group's total liquidity amounted to \u20ac12.3/uni00A0billion.\n\n## The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is set to accelerate the transformation and deliver on our decarbonization roadmap\n\nSince 2019, more than 100/uni00A0agreements have been signed with employees aimed at achieving a significant transformation and maintaining social stability: adapting ways of working during the crisis, supporting the strategic transformation such as the French Domestic turnaround and the removal of the cap on the Transavia fleet.\n\nIn the post-Covid-19 world, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group needs to balance its medium-term focus on managing liquidity risk and optimizing capex with the long-term focus on achieving increased competitiveness and its sustainability targets.

This includes a commitment by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM to reducing its well-to-wake scope/uni00A01 and 3/uni00A0jet fuel greenhouse gas protocol emissions by 30% per revenue ton-kilometer (RTK) by 2030 compared to 2019. In that context, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, Air/uni00A0France and KLM submitted their/uni00A0CO2 emissions reduction targets to SBTi which have been approved in November 2022 by SBTi's Target Validation Team confirming that they are in line with a well-below 2\u00b0C objective, as determined by the Paris Agreement signed in 2015./thinspace (2) /thinspace\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's levers are as follows:\n\n- > an ambitious plan to modernize and renew the fleets of the Group's airlines with latest-generation aircraft, emitting 20%-25% less/uni00A0CO2 compared to their predecessors.

The SAF projects selected directly by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM do not compete with the human food chain or with animal feed. Air/uni00A0France and KLM have been pioneers in the use of these alternative fuels, which will play a key role in the decarbonization of air transportation, as they can reduce/uni00A0CO2 emissions by up to 80% over their life cycle.

        "page_content": "## 1.3/emspace ACTIVITIES IN 2022\n\n## 1.3.1/emspace Network business (passenger and cargo)\n\n## A year of recovery even if Covid-19 and the Russo Ukraine war significantly impacted our activity\n\nThe Network business corresponds to passenger and cargo transportation services on the scheduled flights of the network airlines, Air/uni00A0France and KLM. The Network business is Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's principal activity, contributing slighlty above 86% of the Group's revenues.\n\nFor Air/uni00A0France, 2022 proved to be a year of recovery relative to 2020 and 2021 although activity remained below its level in 2019 owing to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, particularly in the first quarter with the Omicron strain but also throughout the year with the maintained closure of most Asian countries. The outbreak of the Russo-Ukraine war in February/uni00A02022 also had a significant impact on 2022 activity, in both medium- and long-haul. The total capacity in the Air/uni00A0France network was down by 17% relative to 2019 but saw a net overall increase of 30/uni00A0points relative to 2021. The Scheduling teams continued to react with agility and proactiveness to adjust capacity throughout 2022 to respond to developments on a month-by-month basis. The first quarter was the most impacted due to the Omicron strain, with capacity down by 25% relative to 2019 for Air/uni00A0France. Capacity then progressively increased as the year unfolded to reach a level of 82% in ASK relative to 2019.\n\n## 1.3.1.1/emspace Short and medium-haul operations\n\n## Continuous adjustments due to Covid-19 and the Russo Ukraine war; finalization of the domestic restructuring plan\n\nFaced with the Covid-19 crisis and more particularly the Omicron impact in 2022, then despite the Russo-Ukraine war, the short and medium-haul network maintained its agility in terms of capacity adjustments. At the end of the Winter 2022 season, the restructuring of the short-haul network was 90% finalized. The Short and medium-haul network is also pursuing its fleet renewal with the ongoing deliveries of the A220 aircraft across the network.\n\nOn the French short-haul network , activity was down by 48% relative to 2019. The first and second quarters of 2022 were characterized by a very weak level of short-haul activity (-54%), mainly due to the Omicron strain. Faced with the growth in demand and changes in the flight slot regulation (end of the moratorium), short-haul activity rebounded to average of 43% in the second half of 2022 relative to 2019.\n\nInitiated in 2020 to contend with the magnitude of the Covid crisis but also the growing competition from the low-cost carriers, high speed rail and the Ouigo o/ffer dating back several years, in 2022 the Group continued to restructure its short-haul network. After the closure of 27/uni00A0routes in this network during 2020 followed by seven in 2021, Air/uni00A0France pursued its restructuring by closing another 13/uni00A0routes in 2022 including Orly-Perpignan, Orly-Pau and Lille-Marseille, with the slots being transferred to Transavia. Air/uni00A0France has also undertaken to reduce the/uni00A0CO2 emissions on its domestic network by 50% by 2024 and confirmed the closure, as of Summer 2020, of routes for which there is a rail alternative in under two and a half hours from Paris (Orly-Bordeaux, OrlyNantes, Orly-Lyons). Lastly, to adapt our capacity to leisure destinations during the Summer season, 73/uni00A0routes were launched in 2022, of which 15/uni00A0international routes on departure from Orly and the French provinces.\n\nThe medium-haul network also saw its capacity progressively increased over the course of 2022. On average, for the whole year, capacity was down by 15% relative to 2019; the first quarter was more impacted by the Omicron strain with capacity averaging -30% relative to 2019. Capacity then gradually increased over the year to reach a maximum level of 94% in Q3 of 82% in ASK compared to 2019, supported by leisure and Friends and Family demand during the Summer season and by the reopening of Algeria. The main impact of the Russo-Ukraine war was the closure of all our services to these two countries for the whole of the year.\n\nBuilt around the Paris-CDG and Amsterdam-Schiphol hubs, the medium-haul network was also supported by the recovery in the long-haul network. The strong leisure demand during the Summer season enabled us to maintain numerous seasonal routes over the summer and there have also been seven structural openings since 2019: Krakow, Seville, Helsinki, Tangiers, Las Palmas and Tenerife.\n\nWithin a still-extremely-volatile public health context, the Group thus showed its ability very rapidly to adapt to the changes in the geopolitical and health situation. Agility and reactivity have become the principles for the construction of the commercial proposition, in terms of adapting both capacity and the destinations to respond to the more leisure-oriented demand.\n\nIn medium-haul, KLM was still very much affected on the demand side by the Omicron strain in the first quarter of the year. Demand was strong and rapidly ramped up as the other quarters unfolded. From an operational perspective, KLM had to deal with a shortage of manpower in KLM ground services and SPL security during the last three quarters. This strongly a/ffected operational reliability and the ability to operate the desired production volumes. Furthermore, there was also a significant impact on the passenger demand side in terms of connectivity and reliability with an impact on revenues and costs.",

        "page_content": "In 2022, compared to 2019, KLM's European network was at the index of 84% in ASK and the long-haul network at the index of 80%. The trends are fairly comparable on the long-haul.\n\nOn KLM's medium-haul network, the capacity index per quarter was:\n\n| Q1   | Q2   | Q3   | Q4   |\n|------|------|------|------|\n| 83%  | 86%  | 86%  | 80%  |\n\n## 1.3.1.2/emspace Long-haul  operations\n\n## KLM long-haul operations\n\nIn long-haul, KLM's average 2022 capacity stood at 80% with di/fferences between the quarters, respectively at 75%, 79%, 84% and 81% for the first to the fourth quarter. Although the Cargo performance was not as strong as in 2021, it was still markedly higher than in 2019 and made a substantial contribution to the 2022 long-haul results.\n\nTo maintain the global network, KLM maximized the number of destinations, albeit at reduced frequencies. KLM succeeded in adding new destinations, like Austin (USA), Aarhus (Denmark), Katowice (Poland) and Rovaniemi (Finland).\n\n## Air/uni00A0France long-haul operations\n\nFor Air/uni00A0France, 2022 was marked by a significant recovery in activity compared with its level in 2020 and 2021. This recovery was however more moderate during the first quarter in view of the Omicron wave. The long-haul ASK capacity index thus stood at 85% of its 2019 level during 2022, with the following breakdown by quarter:\n\n| Q1 Q2   | Q3   | Q4   |\n|---------|------|------|\n| 77% 84% | 87%  | 93%  |\n\nCapacity was progressively introduced in line with the recovery in demand and was based on the re-opening of borders. There were, however, considerable variations between regions.\n\nAfrica : an index of 98% versus 2019. This region proved resilient during the Covid public health crisis and returned to a level of capacity similar to that of 2019. The main developments included the continuation of the Zanzibar service launched in 2021 throughout the year, the relaunch of Cape Town and increased frequencies on all the historic points of the network.\n\nAsia : an index of 32% versus 2019. Asia was the region whose capacity remained the lowest relative to 2019. This was linked to the travel constraints that remained tighter than in the other regions. Note however that Japan saw its capacity increase via the re-opening of Tokyo Haneda in September and that the CDG-Singapore service also saw strong growth with the move to nine flights a week as of the Winter 2022 season. Lastly, routes like Seoul, Ho Chi Minh Ville and Bangkok also saw considerable\n\ncapacity growth over the year given the gradual re-opening of borders and the return of demand. Note that North East Asia was strongly impacted by the inability to overfly Russian air space as of February/uni00A02022, with an impact on the flight times to the relevant destinations.\n\nNorth America : an index of 102% versus 2019: After a 2021 during which capacity had stood at around half its pre-crisis level, there was a considerable recovery on North America which ended 2022 with capacity slightly up on its 2019 level. The main developments included the reinforcement of the New York service with up to six daily flights between CDG and JFK, scheduled like a shuttle-type product, and the launch of CDGNewark. Air/uni00A0France also pursued its growth in Canada with the opening of a new service to Quebec in Summer 2022 while the Dallas service was reintroduced having been suspended since the beginning of the Covid-19 public health crisis. Lastly, all the 'core network' routes saw their frequencies significantly increased in 2022 relative to 2021.\n\nCaribbean/Indian Ocean : an index of 111% versus 2019: Capacity to the French West Indies was maintained at a high level in 2022, in line with what was done in 2021. It was on the 'international' routes that capacity saw particular growth in 2022 with the recovery in activity on routes like CDG-Mauritius, Antananarivo, Havana and the growth on Punta Cana/Santo Domingo over the summer. The Caribbean regional network also continued its growth with the relaunch of Pointe \u00e0 Pitre-Montreal in Summer 2022.\n\nCentral/South America : an index of 75% versus 2019: While capacity in this region remained lower than its 2019 level, there was a real recovery relative to 2021 (Index 39). Substantial capacity was progressively reintroduced on the core network over the course of the year. The last quarter thus ended with a capacity index of 88% versus 2019 and even 95% without counting Caracas and Quito which remained suspended.\n\nIndia/Middle East : an index of 103% versus 2019: The ending of capacity restrictions on India was a very strong contributor to the recovery in this network, with a daily flight operated to Delhi, Bombay and Bangalore as of the end of 2022 and three flights a week to Chennai. Dubai maintained capacity at above its 2019 level with two daily flights over the Winter, and a second CDG-Tel Aviv flight was introduced as of Summer 2022.\n\n## Air/uni00A0France Protect, the promise of a safe trip\n\nAir/uni00A0France has implemented health measures guaranteeing the highest level of safety at every step of the journey: at the airport; on board; on arrival.\n\nIn the context of a global health crisis, Air/uni00A0France made the health and safety of its customers and sta/ff its top priority. As of the emergence of the Covid-19 virus, Air/uni00A0France introduced exceptional measures, regrouped under the Air/uni00A0France Protect label, to ensure a serene journey: the strictest health conditions at every stage, tickets that are 100% changeable and refundable tickets, pandemic-related insurance coverage and a dedicated website to verify travel conditions.",

Amongst these initiatives,\n\nthe focus was put on expanding self-service rebooking and enabling self-service refunds.\n\nThe emphasis was also put on facilitating customer preparation ahead of their departure with the introduction of the 'Where can I Fly?' pages and continued e/fforts directed at O/ff-Airport automation. E/fforts in this particular area include the expansion of Upload@Home/Ready2Fly and the introduction of the broader Clearance Preparation hub concept, enabling customers to check regulatory travel requirement and pre fill their document details.\n\nStill in 2022, our hybrid model of agent servicing, supported by tooling and bots, proved that it played essential role by leveraging the best of humans and bots to assist our customers. the Digital teams adapted the existing bots and expanded the available communication channels (WhatsApp for Air/uni00A0France) so as to able to handle the high servicing volumes, in a context of complex travel conditions for our customers.\n\nIn a nutshell, we supported our operational sta/ff in contact centers and at the airport, while o/ffering customers an overall smoother experience.\n\n- e) 69% self-perceived success rate of self-service Period: January-December/uni00A02022, source: Qualtrics.",

We have thus invested time and resources in customer research to better understand their views and make sure we are developing the most appropriate o/ffers from both a sustainability perspective and aligned with customer expectations.\n\nTo support the Group's ambition to become the sustainability leader in the aviation industry, Digital has expanded the availability and reach of the SAF o/ffer. Customers on the website and App are able to opt for SAF at various steps of their online journey. Flying Blue customers also have the possibility to pay for SAF in miles and earn Experience Points ('XP').\n\nIn addition, a new AirRail product between Brussels and Amsterdam has been launched, meaning that our customers can combine their KLM flights departing from or arriving at Schiphol with a Thalys train ticket to or from Brussels. In the event of of rebooking or voluntary changes of the train or flight, the total itinerary will be adapted.

Our 'Next Best Action' dedicated algorithm is able to make suggestions based on historical bookings and the customer profile.\n\nFor Air/uni00A0France, we have managed to personalize 80% of our email campaigns in the French market, meaning that our customers received tailor-made emails focused on their perceived needs and preferences.\n\n## -A pioneer on the social media\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM maintain their role as pioneers. They were the first airline brands to propose direct conversations with customers and the sending of travel documents on five social messaging platforms, 24/24 and 7/7, in ten languages. And we have evolved our capabilities since then.\n\nCustomers can choose to receive their travel documents and notifications directly on their preferred social media.\n\nThe strategy of combining artificial intelligence (bots) and 500/uni00A0advisors around the world at the service of our customers has enabled the successful management of more than 58,000/uni00A0cases a week.\n\n## Key figures for Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM on the social media:\n\n- > over 500/uni00A0advisors (based in ten call centers worldwide) answer questions, making this the largest dedicated social media team in the world;\n- > 24/24 and 7/7/uni00A0service on WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger, Twitter, WeChat and KakaoTalk;\n- > messages in ten languages (French, Dutch, English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Japanese, Simplified Chinese and Korean);\n- > over 50% of agent replies on social media are supported by artificial intelligence (the agents use suggested answers or fully-automated replies);\n- > over 50% of incoming Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM customers conversations are assisted by a chatbot and around 15% for Air/uni00A0France and 20% for KLM are fully handled by chatbots;\n- > speed of reply (KLM): On average almost 70% of the high priority cases within 30/uni00A0minutes and 35% of the low priority cases within 2/uni00A0hours;\n- > furthermore, Air/uni00A0France launched TikTok, Douyin and WhatsApp accounts in its key markets in 2022.

Yields remained strong during 2022 although the gap between industry capacity and demand narrowed further. The global demand for air cargo volumes declined in 2022, owing to a slowdown in global trade due to the geopolitical situation and increased inflation.\n\nThe Group's cargo business continued to perform strongly. The growth in activity and the yield partly o/ffset the drop in tra/ffic resulting in cargo revenues coming in close to their level of the previous year and well above their pre Covid-19 level. During the 2022 financial year, the Group carried 931/uni00A0million kilograms, down by 26.9%, of which 79% in the bellies of passenger aircraft and 21% in the full freighter fleet.\n\nCompared to 2021, capacity increased by 15.6%, mainly due to the increase in belly capacity, while tra/ffic decreased by 14.5% resulting in a decline in the load factor. This reduction in load factor was partly compensated by the increased yield and led to a unit revenue decrease of 19.5% at constant currency.\n\nCargo capacity in 2022 was still 9.3% below its 2019 level while demand remained high, resulting in total revenues that were 62.7% higher than in 2019. This increase in revenues was driven by a higher yield while the load factor was below its 2019 level.\n\nIn 2022, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Cargo announced the conclusion of a strategic partnership with CMA CGM and a close working relationship has started with CMA CGM teams.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Cargo won the ACW Achievement Award for its sustainability e/fforts and several new contracts were signed in 2022 with our forwarders on sustainable aviation fuel.\n\nLastly, the Group ordered eight Airbus 350/uni00A0full freighters to strengthen its presence on the cargo market and reduce its carbon footprint.\n\n## 1.3.1.5/emspace Airline partnerships and alliances: expanding the Group's commercial presence to respond to global air transport\n\nAir transport demand is global and, to respond to this demand, Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is pursuing an ambitious strategy aimed at expanding its commercial presence in every region of the world.\n\nAirline alliances and partnerships are an integral part of this strategy. They contribute to meeting customer expectations and thus creating value for both the Group and its customers. They reinforce the Group's market positioning thanks to an expanded and more diversified network, which supplements the Group's own o/ffer. They may also enable the generation of operational synergies.",

        "page_content": "## Strategic partnerships\n\nIn July/uni00A02017, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM announced a further major step in the reinforcement of its strategic partnerships with, on one hand, the creation of a single global joint-venture between Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and Virgin Atlantic and, on the other hand, the intensification of its partnership with China Eastern Airlines. These two commercial alliances were consolidated by equity links with Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and China Eastern Airlines each then acquiring an 8.8% equity interest in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM within the framework of reserved capital increases carried out during 2017, for a total of \u20ac751/uni00A0million.\n\nThe strategic, commercial and capitalistic reinforcement of these partnership positions Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM as the European pillar of the leading global airline network.\n\n## Transatlantic joint-venture with Delta Air Lines and Virgin Atlantic\n\nOn January/uni00A01, 2020, following approval by the US authorities on November/uni00A021, 2019, the Group launched a new transatlantic joint-venture with Delta and Virgin Atlantic. As a result, as of December/uni00A031, 2019, a decade after its creation, the Group ended the existing joint-venture between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta and Alitalia. As with most joint-ventures in the industry, it did not lead to the creation of a common company but rather the signature of a contract defining both the mechanism of a common income statement, and governance and organizations to manage all aspects of the partnership. The existence of an internal common income statement ensures that the partners implement all the actions contributing to an improved operating result for the activity, to their mutual benefit. Each company member of the joint-venture recognizes the revenues and costs relating to the joint-venture scope in their respective income statements. If necessary, a settlement mechanism between joint-venture members will compensate the imbalances in value creation based on a mechanism agreed between the parties. This mechanism contributes to 'metal neutrality', enabling the di/fferent members to jointly manage capacity and look for overall optimization rather than the individual interests of each airline, ultimately increasing value for both the partners and customers.\n\nThe governance bodies comprise a CEO Committee, a monthly JV Leadership Team meeting and Working Groups.\n\nThe scope of this joint-venture is very wide, covering all the flights between North America (including Canada and Mexico) and Europe through integrated cooperation and all the flights between North America to and from Africa, the Middle East and India together with the flights from Europe to and from Central America, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru and Ecuador through close coordination.\n\nPrior to the public health crisis this new joint-venture had revenues exceeding US$13/uni00A0billion and a market share of 23%, making it a major player on the transatlantic, the leading market for international air transportation. More than 340/uni00A0daily flights linked the nine principal hubs: Paris, Amsterdam, London, Atlanta, New York, Detroit, Minneapolis, Cincinnati and Salt Lake City. Pricing and revenue management are centralized within a 60-strong team based in Amsterdam.\n\nThe coordination of the network is reflected in the strengthening of the hub-to-hub services, the optimization of aircraft types assigned to each route and an increase in the number of destinations served by non-stop flights on both sides of the Atlantic and the English Channel. The sales forces have been regrouped in each region.\n\nThis extended scope marks the expansion and strengthening of one of the most advanced partnership models in the airline industry.\n\n## Partnership in China - a consolidated presence in the Chinese market\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM benefit from a historic presence in China, bolstered by a strong partnership with one of the three largest Chinese carriers, through a joint-venture agreement concluded ten years ago.\n\nIn 2012, Air/uni00A0France signed a joint-venture agreement involving the Paris and Shanghai routes with China Eastern Airlines, a major player in Chinese air transportation, operating a vast domestic network and internationally mainly out of its base in Shanghai, China's economic lung. This agreement was extended to KLM in 2016, when China Eastern Airlines inaugurated the Shanghai-Amsterdam service. The partnership was further reinforced in 2017 when China Eastern Airlines acquired an 8.8% equity interest in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM via a reserved capital increase. In November/uni00A02018, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and China Eastern Airlines signed an agreement extending their joint-venture to two additional routes, Paris-Wuhan and Paris-Kunming, as of January/uni00A01, 2019, thereby o/ffering their respective customers new routes under code share and new connecting opportunities between Europe and China. In April/uni00A02021, China Eastern Airlines participated in the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM share capital increase; within this context, both airline groups decided to extend the scope of their partnership through an intensified commercial cooperation and an increased footprint on the Beijing market, with the Paris-Beijing and Amsterdam-Beijing routes joining the current existing Joint Venture between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and China Eastern Airlines once the conditions had been satisfied. In May/uni00A02022, China Eastern Airlines participated, through a neutral operation, in the Rights Issue launched by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, taking its equity interest to 4.7% of the Company's share capital after the Rights Issue.\n\nThanks to this partnership, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM can o/ffer its customers access to a total of some forty destinations in China.\n\nIn total, the revenues from routes operated between Europe and China by airlines participating in the joint-venture agreement represented more than \u20ac600/uni00A0million in 2019.\n\n## Strategic partnership with GOL\n\nIn 2014, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and GOL Linhas A\u00e9reas Inteligentes signed an exclusive five-year strategic partnership, reinforcing their commercial cooperation between Brazil and Europe. The partnership notably foresees the optimization of synergies between the two groups and, in particular, connecting opportunities in the major Brazilian cities served by the Group. The partnership proved to be a great success, with almost 25% of Air/uni00A0France passengers, flying to Brazil, transferring to GOL flights. Since April/uni00A02015, GOL has used its code on Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM flights between Europe",

The two partners cooperate on promoting sales in their home markets and, since November/uni00A02017, Air/uni00A0France has been GOL's GSA for the French market. This GSA agreement is currently being deployed across the European market.\n\nOn October/uni00A030, 2019, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and GOL renewed this strategic partnership agreement for a five-year period, thereby reinforcing this cooperation. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM remains GOL's exclusive European partner and reciprocally, with some exceptions granted.\n\n## Other joint-ventures and code shares\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM implements various forms of partnership agreements, the choice depending on the balance between value creation for its customers and the Group, and the necessary level of interaction between the o/ffers of the partners, together with the regulatory requirements framing the scope of the agreement.\n\nThe first levels of interline cooperation are Tra/ffic and Special Prorate Agreements (SPA) between the partner airlines, enabling the combination of their networks while maintaining their respective IATA codes and setting their own fares.\n\nCooperating further within the framework of a code-sharing agreement, two partner airlines sell tickets on the same flight, each under their own code and setting their own fares. The operating carrier has operational control over the aircraft while the marketing partner, for sales purposes, uses its own flight number on its partner's flights. Any such agreement must comply with the safety and regulatory requirements set forth by the competent authorities.\n\nThere are two types of code sharing. In the first, under a block seat agreement, the marketing partner purchases a fixed amount of capacity from the operating carrier. The marketing partner has inventory control over the seat block. In the second, known as free flow, no division of capacity is set, the two partners potentially selling all the seats on the relevant flights although inventory control remains the prerogative of the operating carrier. Access to capacity on the relevant flights is through negotiated fares for each booking class.\n\nJoint-ventures are the next level in alliances and participate in the trend towards consolidation when the partners are seeking a higher level of joint optimization on a sub-scope of their network without, however, considering a merger.\n\nA joint-venture enables value creation for customers in the markets where it is implemented and, as a result for the partners who organize coordination of the commercial activities:\n\n- > for customers, they enable access to an expanded o/ffer of flights and improved connectivity, loyalty program benefits across a wider perimeter, a harmonized travel experience and integrated commercial propositions;\n- > the partners thus improve their market positioning, serving a higher number of customers and enabling them to capture market growth.\n\nThe partners define the governance principles and financial sharing mechanisms, enabling decision-making and execution across the whole value chain, thus responding to the commercial objectives of the joint-venture.\n\nThe final stages in cooperation consolidation and integration are mergers or equity interests, anchoring the development of a common strategy over the long term.\n\nJoint-ventures, equity interests and mergers must be approved in the light of the regulations in force in the jurisdictions covering the scopes of the agreements, particularly with respect to the competition rules (e.g. Anti-trust Immunity).\n\n## 1.3.1.6/emspace SkyTeam  alliance\n\nThe three large alliances, SkyTeam (to which Air/uni00A0France and KLM belong), Star Alliance and oneworld, represent some 55% of worldwide tra/ffic. Around two thirds of the top 50/uni00A0airline carriers in the world belong to a global alliance.\n\nSince the inception of the global alliances, their capacity in terms of the available seats o/ffered by member airlines has grown by more than the industry average, with SkyTeam now being the second largest global alliance, behind Star Alliance and ahead of oneworld.\n\n## SkyTeam: a global alliance\n\nSkyTeam, created in 2000, is a global alliance which numbered 19/uni00A0airline members at December/uni00A031, 2022: Aeroflot (suspended), Aerolineas Argentinas, Aeromexico, Air Europa, Air/uni00A0France, China Airlines, China Eastern Airlines, Czech Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Garuda Indonesia, ITA Airways, Kenya Airways, KLM, Korean Air, Middle East Airlines, Saudi Arabian Airlines, Tarom, Vietnam Airlines and XiamenAir.\n\nBelonging to SkyTeam enables its members to strengthen their brand awareness and extend their o/ffer around the globe, thereby bolstering their commercial presence. As members of the SkyTeam alliance, Air/uni00A0France and KLM thus have access to a global network of some 10,062/uni00A0daily flights to 1,062/uni00A0destinations in more than 170/uni00A0countries in 2022.\n\nIn 2022, its 341/uni00A0million passengers benefited from a seamless travel experience on the flights of member airlines and had access to more than 750/uni00A0airport lounges around the world. The passengers who are members of frequent flyer programs can earn and burn air miles on all SkyTeam partner flights.",

        "page_content": "## 1.3.2/emspace Low-cost business (Transavia)\n\nTransavia France and Transavia Netherlands (collectively 'Transavia'), the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's low-cost business, operate point-to-point flights to/from the Netherlands and France. Transavia's cost structure is strictly aligned with the low-cost business model: optimizing the utilization of aircraft, simple products and fares, a strong focus on ancillary revenues, a light organizational structure and the outsourcing of a significant portion of the activities.\n\nIn 2022, Transavia France celebrated its 15 th /uni00A0 anniversary. It is now the leading low-cost carrier on departure from Orly and the number two on departure from Paris (CDG, Orly and Beauvais).\n\nTransavia Netherlands is the leading low-cost carrier in the Netherlands, operating from its bases in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Eindhoven.\n\n## Growth trajectory\n\nTransavia Netherlands made a strong recovery from the pandemic, retaining its position as the leading low-cost carrier in the Netherlands and achieving load factors above preCovid-19 levels during the peak Summer season. Spain was the strongest market, with more than 40/uni00A0per cent of capacity. Transavia Netherlands enjoyed high yields and revenues per available seat, while bookings with Transavia Holidays, through which Transavia Netherlands o/ffers complete holiday packages, rose as well. Like other airlines, Transavia Netherlands had to contend with a tight labor market, supply chain issues with components and severe operational constraints at Schiphol airport, necessitating a considerable reduction in the number of scheduled flights impacting the operational performance in the peak months. Employee engagement returned to the 2019 level. Costs rose on the back of high inflation, the war in Ukraine and non-performance costs related to delays and flight cancellations, while Transavia Netherlands continued to invest in its employees.\n\nIn 2022, Transavia France accelerated its growth within the framework of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM transformation plan. After two years marked by the Covid-19 pandemic and with customers again keen to travel, Transavia pursued its growth in its flagship markets with a substantial increase in its fleet from 50/uni00A0aircraft at the beginning of the year to 61 in Summer 2022.\n\nOnce again, the Company needed to demonstrate significant agility to permanently adapt its ASK capacity to the public health situation. Thanks to the progressive re-opening of Morocco and Algeria, two key markets for the airline, Transavia France operated an ambitious flight schedule.\n\nTo respond to the demand and satisfy customer expectations, capacity was added in these main markets in the Mediterranean basin. In total, the Company launched 50/uni00A0new routes in 2022 to various destinations in Europe and beyond: Egypt, Turkey, Armenia,/uni00A0etc.\n\nDuring the summer of 2022, the airline passed the threshold of 100/uni00A0destinations on departure from Paris-Orly and developed its o/ffering of flights on departure from its bases in Nantes, Lyons and Montpellier to reach 200/uni00A0routes across its whole network. It was a record summer in terms of activity for Transavia France which operated up to 279/uni00A0flights a day during some weekends. With 2.4/uni00A0million passengers carried, Transavia France exceeded its pre-crisis level (+45% relative to 2019), with a load factor of 86% in August.\n\nIn 2022, Transavia Netherlands operated to 97/uni00A0destinations including flying from Brussels Airport to four destinations, these flights having exceeded expectations in terms of performance. In total, 7.8/uni00A0million passengers were carried, a number which remained below the 2019 result. It also introduced flights to new destinations like Bastia and Milan/Bergamo from Rotterdam The Hague Airport and Riga from Schiphol airport. To make flying more sustainable and optimize its available seats in the slot constrained Dutch market, Transavia is pursuing an up-gauging strategy with the introduction of the A320neo aircraft family. This enables Transavia Netherlands to serve its customers and retain the number one low-cost airline in the Netherlands.\n\n## Renewal of the fleet\n\nIn December/uni00A02021, KLM and the two Transavia business units signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Airbus for the delivery of new medium-haul aircraft starting in 2023, involving a combination of Airbus A321neo and A320neo aircraft.\n\nFor Transavia France, fleet renewal is a totally unique event and a major challenge. The first aircraft for Transavia France, an A320neo, will arrive in the fourth quarter of 2023. The teams are already working on the planning of this transition and the reception of the new aircraft. The Airbus A320neo will be the driver of its growth and of its economic and environmental competitiveness. It will give the Company the ability to attain the ambitious targets that have been set for it.\n\nThe first aircraft for Transavia Netherlands, an A321neo, will also arrive in the fourth quarter of 2023. The entry into service program is fully embedded in the organization and working towards the milestone for the first flight of the new Airbus A321neo aircraft. The A321 family will be the driver of growth by virtue of its increased gauge size and will enable Transavia Netherlands to achieve its sustainability goals.",

        "page_content": "## Adaptation of the domestic network\n\nThe domestic network represents around 12% of the Transavia France flight schedule. The airline is confident in its ability to succeed in this market as the product is aligned with customer expectations. Transavia France is focusing on high-potential routes (Orly-Toulon, Orly-Biarritz, Nantes-Marseilles,/uni00A0etc.) and opened two new routes in 2022 (Orly-Pau and Orly-Perpignan).\n\nIn 2022, Transavia France operated a total of 22/uni00A0domestic routes linking di/fferent airports in France. The Company permanently monitors the performance of its routes. Its agility enables the continuous adaptation of its flight capacity to demand.\n\n## Customer experience\n\nIn 2022, Transavia France became the first low-cost carrier to o/ffer free cabin baggage to its passengers. This is a major advantage for the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM group subsidiary within a context of intense competition.\n\nWith some 2,300/uni00A0employees, Transavia France puts the quality of its services, the proximity of its crews and innovation at the center of its commitments. This stance has led to the Company regularly winning awards. For the third time, Transavia France was voted 'Customer Service of the Year 2023' in the Collective Passenger Transport (ESCDA) category and obtained, for the sixth consecutive year, the Capital label 'Best Brand Quality of Service' in the Transport category, awarded by Capital magazine. The Company was also awarded the Qualiweb 2022 trophy for the quality of its online service in the Tourism and Transport category.\n\nLastly, Transavia France joined bluebiz, the frequent flyer program aimed at small and medium-sized companies. French members of the program can now earn blue credits for every flight with the airline and exchange them for free tickets, subscription cards and services linked to flights. Transavia France is thus responding to the needs of its growing business customer base.\n\nTransavia Netherlands maintained its position as the low-cost carrier of choice for customers in the Netherlands, despite the challenging Covid-19 situation and forthcoming capacity challenges. In the low-cost and leisure market, we witnessed late booking behavior throughout the year, leading to a higher yield and RASK. Transavia Holidays (o/ffering complete holiday packages) was further expanded, and bookings increased.\n\nTransavia Netherlands also initiated a collaboration with Luggo to improve the customer experience and reduce check-in queues. Luggo is a door-to-door luggage service and was introduced at the perfect time in view of the longer queues due to the operational challenges at the Dutch airports. It started as a pilot in Amsterdam but due to its success, it has been expanded to Rotterdam and Eindhoven. Transavia is therefore continuously improving its onboard experience. One of the best examples is the success of a new food service proposition o/ffering customers a broad range of fresh food in collaboration with Takeaway.com.\n\n## Sta/ff, a move to a new head o/ffice and flex o/ffice\n\nTo accompany its strong growth, in November/uni00A02022 Transavia France moved into its new head office located at C\u0153ur d'Orly, right next door to its operations. The Company took advantage of this move to adapt its o/ffices to its workplace organization. Having introduced up to 100/uni00A0days per year of remote working, the Company then opted for the flex o/ffice and numerous collaborative spaces, enabling everyone to work in the best-possible conditions.\n\nIn terms of sta/ffing, to support the early-summer growth in activity, Transavia France recruited 500/uni00A0cabin crew members (hostesses and stewards, of whom 97/uni00A0pursers) and 203/uni00A0pilots (including flight captains and co-pilots). For the ground sta/ff, 2022 was to see 122/uni00A0new recruits, i.e. a 60% increase relative to the recruitment during the previous year.\n\n## Sustainable development and CSR\n\nAs a subsidiary of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, Transavia France has been committed to reducing its carbon footprint for several years. It is now looking to accelerate its environmental transition by activating all the levers at its disposal and fostering the emergence of innovative solutions.\n\nIn the shorter term, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group including Transavia has committed to a 30% reduction in its/uni00A0CO2eg emissions per revenue ton-kilometer (RTK) by 2030 relative to the 2019 baseline.\n\nIn June, on the occasion of the Connecting Europe Days, Transavia France operated its first flight powered by a 30% blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). These fuels enable an average 80% reduction in/uni00A0CO2 emissions over the entire life cycle and are destined to play a key role in the decarbonization of air transportation. In 2022, the French regulation made it mandatory for fuel suppliers to incorporate 1% SAF in their sales of kerosene.\n\nTransavia Netherlands realized a SAF blending on 1% of its outbound flights in 2022. In doing so, Transavia testified its commitment to meeting industry sustainability targets ahead of the legal obligations. This makes it a front-runner in the low-cost market. Transavia Netherlands took responsibility for reducing it footprint by stopping economic tankering. In its procurement processes, it initiated an Ecovadis certification trajectory where Transavia aligns with KLM to audit suppliers on their sustainability targets.\n\nTransavia France is a pioneer in the implementation of eco-pilot programs, which is another level to reduce its environmental footprint. The pursuit of its partnerships with start-ups Safety Line (SITA) and OpenAirlines has enabled a 3% to 5% reduction in/uni00A0CO2 emissions per flight.\n\nThe three OptiFlight solutions (combined) of its partner Safety Line can save more than 80/uni00A0tons of fuel per aircraft per year, i.e. the equivalent of one aircraft flying neutrally in the Transavia France fleet.",

        "page_content": "Additionally, this year Transavia France again reinforced its commitment to associations like Magie \u00e0 Bord, Personn'ailes, Les Hommes de l'Air and the Carlesimo association, with awareness-raising initiatives for passengers and ground sta/ff.\n\nTransavia Ventures, which funds innovative entrepreneurs, has invested in Dutch start-up FlyWithLucy, which aims to take a five-seater electric airplane to the skies by 2025, and MuTech, which develops noise-reduction technology for aircraft.\n\nTransavia France has replaced single use plastics with renewable materials, introduced sustainable uniforms for crew and begun to recycle waste. KLM and Transavia Netherlands also initiated a process of procurement certification, which will hold suppliers to higher sustainability standards.\n\nTogether with KLM, Transavia Netherlands have signed an IATA declaration calling for smarter regulation of international catering waste. While waste from within the EU is e/fficiently\n\n## 1.3.3/emspace Maintenance  business\n\nAircraft maintenance is the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's third business with third-party revenues of \u20ac1.4/uni00A0billion. These revenues generated with external clients represent 38.7% of the total revenues in this business. In 2022, despite lingering uncertainties over the Covid-19 crisis (especially in Asia), a turbulent geopolitical climate with the war in Ukraine, and the destabilization of global logistics chains, the AFI KLM E&M order book remained at a high level with a total value of US$9.2/uni00A0billion.\n\nIn the aircraft maintenance or MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul) market, Air/uni00A0France Industries KLM Engineering & Maintenance (AFI KLM E&M) ranks number two globally amongst the multi-product players. AFI KLM E&M's mission is to supply competitive support for the Group's fleet, while consolidating its position as a leader in the MRO market.\n\nThe Group operates in three major maintenance segments: airframe maintenance, engine maintenance and component support (electronic, mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic,/uni00A0etc.).\n\nAirframe maintenance covers three sub- segments: line operations support which aims to verify the proper day-to-day functioning of systems and the integrity of the aircraft structure, heavy maintenance for in-depth checks involving the disassembly of cabins, equipment and some structural elements, and the realization of modification programs, particularly the retrofitting of cabins.\n\nprocessed, recycled and reused, waste generated on flights coming from outside the EU has to be incinerated or buried to meet EU regulations. While these regulations intend to prevent the outbreak of animal diseases, research commissioned by IATA shows there is no evidence catering waste increases this risk.\n\nIn 2022, Transavia Netherlands took further steps to promote Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) within the organization. A new D&I team was set up and a company-wide survey was sent out to gauge feedback. One key element of this strategy is to empower colleagues to make greater social impact, for example through the internal crowd sourcing platform WeCare, through which several social NGOs receive financial support, and the Peter J. Legro Award, which earmarks financial support for a good cause. Fleet renewal constitutes another pillar in the trajectory to achieve the Group's targets. The Airbus A320neo emits 15% less/uni00A0CO2 than the current Boeing 737-800.\n\n## 1.3.3.1/emspace Business  environment\n\n## An attractive market despite the growing constraints\n\nThe aeronautics maintenance or MRO (Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul) market is mostly driven by the age, cycles and flight hours of the worldwide fleet. According to estimates, the global MRO market, which comprises the maintenance and modification spending by aircraft operators either directly or through sub-contractors, first collapsed in 2020 before recovering further in 2021 and 2022. For 2022, the MRO market is forecast to amount to $73.8/uni00A0billion (83% versus 2019), rising to $91.8/uni00A0billion in 2023 (source: Oliver Wyman, June/uni00A02021).\n\nThe trends in this business closely follow those of the commercial airline fleets globally and their utilization. First of all, the public health crisis and a strong emphasis on sustainability have accelerated fleet adjustment decisions for airlines worldwide, to gain e/fficiency and reduce/uni00A0CO2 emissions. this implies that the maintenance of next generation aircraft represents a significant part of the market. This benefits MRO providers like AFI KLM E&M which are well positioned on the next-generation segments. Another trend strongly apparent in the MRO business is the digitalization of engineering and support services, which are expected to be increasingly used by airlines in an e/ffort to optimize their ground time and operations. lastly, high inflation combined with disrupted and heavily pressurized supply chains imply that the availability and cost of spare parts are being scrutinized. This is challenging performance levels world-wide and putting upwards pressure on maintenance costs.",

They are now being accelerated for certain older models such as the Boeing 747, A340 and A380. The latest generation of aircraft such as the A350, 787 or A320neo are equipped with new e/fficient engines, burning less fuel and emitting significantly less/uni00A0CO2. For the engine products (much like other MRO products), the recovery remains di/fficult to predict. In 2022, AFI KLM E&M joined the Pratt & Whitney GTF\u2122 engine network providing support for new-generation engines designed for A220 fleets. AFI KLM E&M also signed a CFM Branded Service Agreement (CBSA) for the LEAP-1A and LEAP-1B engines. Under the terms of this CBSA, AFI KLM E&M will provide the full scope of LEAP Maintenance, Repair & Overhaul (MRO) services for operators worldwide.\n\nThe Group provides engine support on the following engines:\n\n- > CFM56 : the Group's workshops support one of the world's largest fleets of CFM56 engines, handling some 400/uni00A0engines operated by various airlines.

The environmental benefits of PROGNOS stem from reducing flight cancellations leading to extra flights to recover grounded passengers, as well as reducing the number of Quick Return Flights (return of the aircraft to its departure airport) following technical alerts, which require fuel tanks to be emptied prior to landing. It also optimizes overall aircraft fuel consumption by monitoring the status of equipment more precisely.\n\n## Key figures\n\n| Maintenance                                    | Year   | Year           | Year                          |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|----------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                                | 2022   | Change         | Change at  constant  currency |\n| Total revenues  (in \u20acm)                        | 3,586  | +28,0%         |                               |\n| Third-party revenues  (in \u20acm)                  | 1,389  | +35,8%         | +23,5%                        |\n| Income/(loss) from current operations  (in \u20acm) | 163    | +85,2%         | +27,3%                        |\n| Operating margin  (%)                          | 4.6%   | +1.5/uni00A0pt | +0.2/uni00A0pt                |\n\nDuring 2022, external revenues strongly increased by 35.8% with the beginning of a recovery for customers following Covid-19.

For its part, Transavia (France and the Netherlands) will see its fleet renewed with A320neso and A321neos to adapt to the growing market in the leisure sector.\n\nThe Group will continue to invest substantial sums in the renewal of its cabins, as is currently for its B777-300ERs and the introduction of the Premium Economy class for KLM's long-haul fleet, as well as the on-board satellite connectivity, to o/ffer a WiFi connection to its customers during flights.\n\nIn 2022, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group finalized the firm order for one hundred A320/A321neos, together with an additional purchase right for sixty aircraft to modernize the medium-haul fleet of Transavia and KLM. The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has also placed an order for eight A350Fs for its cargo operations. These very large orders are an integral part of the Group's ambitious commitment to modernizing its fleet so as to reduce its environmental footprint by operating the most e/fficient aircraft in terms of/uni00A0CO2 emissions and noise footprint.",

The return of our customers and the progressive reinforcement of our flight schedule were the significant markers of the year.\n\nDespite a difficult economic situation, Air/uni00A0France and KLM maintained their major investment program which is key to rebuilding the pre-crisis fundamentals and pursued their move upmarket to prepare for the future and o/ffer their customers an unparalleled travel experience.\n\n## 1.5.1/emspace Air/uni00A0France is maintaining its investment for its customers\n\nAir/uni00A0France continued the move up market for its products and services, With cabin renovation, the deployment of in-flight connectivity and the refurbishment of its lounges, the Company is pursuing its premiumization strategy and is committed to more responsible travel.\n\nBy 2030, the Airbus A220 and A350 latest-generation aircraft, which are more fuel-e/fficient and respectful of the environment, will compose 70% of the Air/uni00A0France fleet thanks to an ambitious investment plan amounting to an annual \u20ac1/uni00A0billion.\n\n## 15/uni00A0Airbus A220-300s in the Air/uni00A0France fleet\n\nIn 2022, Air/uni00A0France numbered 15/uni00A0A220-300/uni00A0aircraft in its fleet. Back in September/uni00A02021, Air/uni00A0France took delivery of its first Airbus A220-300, the jewel of its short and medium-haul network. The airline continues to renew its fleet and, by the end of 2025, will receive the 60/uni00A0A220-300s ordered in 2019 to progressively replace its A318s and A319s, as well as several A320s. A very high-performance aircraft at both financial and environmental level, the Airbus A220-300/uni00A0is perfectly suited to Air/uni00A0France's short and medium-haul network. It o/ffers a 10% per seat cost saving compared with the A318s and A319s and stands out for its energy e/fficiency. It consumes 20% less fuel than the aircraft it replaces while its/uni00A0CO2 emissions are also reduced by 20%. its noise footprint is also 34% lower. These characteristics will play a decisive role in reducing Air/uni00A0France's environmental footprint and the achievement of its sustainable development objectives. The Air/uni00A0France Airbus A220-300/uni00A0o/ffers the highest level of in-flight comfort. It has 148/uni00A0seats in a 3-2/uni00A0seat configuration (i.e. five seats per row) o/ffering 80% of customers a window or aisle seat. It proposes two travel cabins, Business and Economy, and access to Air/uni00A0France Connect, the airline's inflight Wi-Fi service. The seat is the widest on the market (48/uni00A0cm), reclines to 118/uni00A0degrees and has an adjustable headrest, leather upholstery and an ergonomic seat cushion for enhanced comfort. The seat back features a symmetrical stitching pattern accentuated in the center with grey embroidery thread, creating an upholstered e/ffect for optimum comfort. The accent, the Company's brand symbol, adorns the front and rear cabin walls of the aircraft. It is embroidered on each seat, highlighting the Company's identity. The cabin, which is the brightest and most spacious in its category, is decorated in the Air/uni00A0France signature colors. It features shades of blue, a strong presence of white providing\n\nlight and contrast, and a hint of red to symbolize the airline's excellence and know-how. The carpet revisits the traditional ornamental herringbone pattern, symbolizing the emblematic Haussmann-inspired world of Parisian apartments. It also plays an important role in the cabin signage, welcoming customers and giving them an overall perspective. Large panoramic windows provide natural light throughout the flight. From boarding to landing, eight specially-adapted cabin mood lighting settings create bright, dynamic lighting for the welcome and disembarkation phases and softer lighting for a more relaxed, serene atmosphere during the flight. The spacious baggage racks are easy to access, and the central aisle is particularly wide, facilitating movement around the cabin.\n\n## 20/uni00A0Airbus A350s in the Air/uni00A0France fleet\n\nOn November/uni00A025, 2022, Air/uni00A0France took delivery of its twentieth A350 of the 38/uni00A0on order. As a next-generation aircraft, the A350 is the new spearhead for Air/uni00A0France long-haul. With a 25% reduction in/uni00A0CO2 emissions compared with previous-generation aircraft, it is a major lever in reducing the airline's environmental footprint. Its noise footprint is also reduced by 40%. Its 324/uni00A0seats are divided between three travel cabins - 34 in Business, 24 in Premium Economy and 266 in Economy cabin - where customers discover a spacious and quiet cabin, windows some 30% larger, an optimized air pressure system providing a more comfortable cabin atmosphere with regularly-renewed cabin air and ambient lighting adapted to the di/fferent flight phases. In the Business cabin, the seat turns into a real two-meter-long lie-flat bed, guaranteeing restful sleep. In Premium Economy, the new 'Recliner'-style seat is 48cm wide and reclines to 124\u00b0. In Economy, the seat has been redesigned for even more comfort, with a reinforced ergonomic seat cushion, a 118\u00b0/uni00A0seat recline and 79-cm of leg room. Every cabin o/ffers large individual HighDefinition touch screens.

        "page_content": "In the Business cabin, customers find a new seat which transforms into a fully-flat two-meter-long bed. A sliding door allows passengers to create a totally private space, out of sight from the other passengers in the cabin. Additionnaly, for two passengers travelling together, these seats are now equipped with a central panel that can be lowered by pressing it down, thus creating a convivial space and, for a quieter space, there is the 'do not disturb' functionality. Every seat has a 17.3-inch 4K Bluetooth high-definition anti-glare screen. Thanks to this new major phase in the move up-market, all Air/uni00A0France Business seats will benefit from fully-flat beds by the autumn of 2023 compared with 90% currently. In Premium Economy customers benefit from an exclusive cabin at the front of the aircraft with the number of seats limited to 48. These seats recline to 124/uni00A0degrees with a wider back for more privacy. The seat foams have been revisited and the navy-blue herringbone fabric provides more softness.

Air/uni00A0France is the first airline in the world to have chosen the new ECOS baggage stowage system from Safran Cabin to equip its medium-haul Airbus A320s. At the end of 2022, ten A320 euros of the 24 in revenue service had been equipped, with the end of the deployment scheduled by late 2023.\n\n## La Premi\u00e8re from Air/uni00A0France\n\n## -A bespoke travel experience and an exceptional journey\n\nWith La Premi\u00e8re, Air/uni00A0France o/ffers a unique and bespoke travel experience for customers attentive to the smallest details.

As a member of the program, Air/uni00A0France adheres to a progress-based approach covering 15/uni00A0commitments and now includes three elements of self-regulation in its advertising with regard to content, the di/ffusion environment and limiting the environmental impact of its advertising. As of 2021, Air/uni00A0France rolled out a number of actions on the responsible drafting of messaging (eliminate gender, sexual and ethnical stereotyping, communicate on Air +Train transport inter-modality, avoid behavior pushing people to travel,/uni00A0etc.) and the eco-socio-design of communication materials (apply recycled paper certifications\n\n- FSC or PEFC, Ecovadis Gold -, contain carbon emissions reduced crews, limited duration - during the filming and shooting of Air/uni00A0France communication, undertake to recycle elements of the d\u00e9cor and/or donate the design to associations and select digital partners who are themselves committed to increasing their environmental responsibility,/uni00A0etc.). A first evaluation of the 15/uni00A0criteria was published in February/uni00A02022. Beyond this, Air/uni00A0France envisages a powerful advertising initiative to include awareness-raising for all its advertising spokespersons. Its aim is to make clear information available to consumers to guide their choices and actions at the environmental level. Air/uni00A0France is looking into the possibility of applying a statement in all its advertising guaranteeing its eco-responsible commitment in addition to the systematic integration of all these initiatives for ever-more responsible communication.\n\n## 1.5.3/emspace Air/uni00A0France Act, participate in more responsible travel\n\nAfter flight safety and reassurance on health, the number three expectation of our customers covers the commitments to sustainability. Air/uni00A0France's environmental footprint is mainly linked to the/uni00A0CO2 emissions generated by our flight operations. Our priority is to reduce these emissions as rapidly as possible through fleet renewal, eco-piloting and the use of more sustainable aviation fuels. These are the three founding principles of our Air/uni00A0France Act program.\n\nWe are also working on building a more responsible catering experience based on three pillars: more responsible catering, combating waste, and reducing the utilization of single-use plastics.\n\nOn all our flights on departure from Paris, with Servair, we propose meat, poultry, dairy products and eggs of 100% French origin, and all our fish are from sustainable fisheries, in all our travel cabins and Paris airport lounges. A vegetarian option is also systematically o/ffered to our customers in all travel classes. The infant and baby menus available on board our long-haul flights are 100% organic.\n\n## a) To combat waste\n\nIn order to finetune consumption and thus reduce food waste, since last summer customers in our long-haul Business cabins have been able to pre-select their hot dishes up to 24/uni00A0hours prior to departure and, of course. This intiative also guarantees the availability of their choice on board.\n\n## b) Elimination of single-use plastics\n\nBy the end of March/uni00A02023, we will have eliminated 90% of the single-use plastics on board our flights. After the introduction of wooden cutlery and cardboard cups, we are deploying containers in bio-sourced materials, like wood cellulose trays\n\nand small baking dishes made of bagasse. Sustainable catering is part of the Air/uni00A0France route map for a more responsible journey.\n\nThe Company is deploying its initiative under the Air/uni00A0France Act label. Learn more about these actions at airfranceact,airfrance. com.\n\n## c) The development of inter-modality so as to propose low-carbon travel alternatives for short journeys\n\nAir/uni00A0 France and SNCF are reinforcing their partnership and expanding the Train+Air product, a service deployed across all journeys: a digitalized pathway which now enables train e-tickets to be downloaded, representing significant progress for customers. Since November/uni00A016, 2022, customers on combined 'Train+Air' trips have been able to use a train e-ticket for a fully-digitalized journey. As of 30/uni00A0hours before the departure of their Air/uni00A0France flight (or 24/uni00A0hours for the USA), in addition to the boarding card for their flights, passengers can now print and/or download to their smartphone their train e-tickets on the Air/uni00A0France App or at the Air/uni00A0France website and board their train directly. This partnership with the SNCF thus enables Air/uni00A0France to propose 18/uni00A0TGV high-speed train stations in France via CDG and 16 via Orly. Customers purchase an Air/uni00A0France ticket, combining a domestic journey by train and an international flight, to Europe or the French territories and dominions, on departure or arrival from/at CDG and/or Orly. The 'Train+Air' product o/ffers customers numerous advantages: a single booking and one fare for their whole journey, a guaranteed seat at no extra charge on the next available flight or train service in the event of a delay to the train or aircraft, Flying Blue Miles also earned on the rail journey, first-class travel on the TGV if the flight is in the Air/uni00A0France La Premi\u00e8re or Business cabin and a complimentary taxi transfer o/ffered by Air/uni00A0France between the Massy TGV station and Paris-Orly airport.",

The carpet revisits the traditional ornamental herringbone pattern, invoking the emblematic Haussmann-inspired world of Parisian apartments. It also plays an important signage role, by welcoming customers and giving them an overall perspective. Large panoramic windows provide natural light for the duration of the trip. From boarding to landing, eight specially-adapted cabin mood lighting settings create bright, dynamic lighting for the welcome and disembarkation phases and softer lighting for a more relaxed, serene atmosphere during the flight.",

They also determine the powers of each of the advisory Committees established within the Board.\n\nThe last update to the Internal Rules took place on February/uni00A016, 2023. It concerned (i)/uni00A0the adjustment of the evaluation process for the Board of Directors and its Committees, (ii)/uni00A0additional details on the management of conflicts of interests, and (iii)/uni00A0the creation of an Article 15/uni00A0to include a recommendation concerning the minimum number of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM shares to be held by Board directors. Note that the Internal Rules had been amended on July/uni00A028, 2022 to provide for modalities concerning the written consultation of the Board directors and to replace the term 'directors' fees' by 'compensation'.\n\nThe Internal Rules of the Board of Directors are available on the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM website at http://www.airfranceklm.com (Governance section).\n\n## 2.2.2/emspace Separation of the functions of Chair of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive O/fficer\n\nDuring its meeting of May/uni00A015, 2018, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors decided to separate the functions of Chair of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive O/fficer. This decision followed Mr. Jean-Marc Janaillac stepping down as Chair and Chief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, and the implementation of a transitional governance to, notably, enable the Chair of the Board of Directors, Ms./uni00A0Anne-Marie Couderc, to focus on the e/ffective functioning of the Board and on the search for candidates for the position of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's Chief Executive O/fficer.\n\nOn August/uni00A016, 2018, the Board of Directors confirmed the separation of the functions of Chair of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive O/fficer within the framework of the implementation of the long-term governance with the appointment of Mr. Benjamin Smith as the new Chief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM. The Board of Directors considered that this was the best governance option for the Company at this stage in its development in that it enables the Company to benefit from a new dynamic with a Chair of the Board of Directors who is dedicated to governance matters and a Chief Executive O/fficer with recognized.\n\nexpertise in the air transport industry, who is focused on the Group's operations. The complementarity of their profiles and roles optimizes the Group's governance and ensures a balanced and respectful division of their respective missions. It also enables\n\nthe e/ffective coordination of the Board of Directors thanks to the presence of a Chair of the Board of Directors who is exclusively devoted to its functioning and guarantees a more e/ffective separation between the control and management functions.\n\nOn May/uni00A026, 2021, the Shareholders' Meeting adopted a resolution setting the age limit for the Chair of the Board of Directors at 72/uni00A0years (previously 70/uni00A0years), when the functions of Chair of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive O/fficer are separate, and as applied by a number of French listed companies.\n\nOn December/uni00A08, 2022, the Board of Directors decided to submit to the Shareholders' Meeting of June/uni00A07, 2023, convened to approve the financial statements for the financial year ended on December/uni00A031, 2022, a resolution aimed at amending the Articles of, Incorporation to stipulate that when the age limit for the Chair of the Board of Directors is reached during the course of his or her mandate, the latter will continue to exercise his or her functions as Chair of the Board until the end of the term of his or her Board director mandate. The Board of Directors also decided, subject to approval of the aforementioned resolution by the Shareholders' Meeting of June/uni00A07, 2023, that the functions of Ms./uni00A0Anne-Marie Couderc, in her capacity as Chair of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors, will continue until the end of her Board director mandate, i.e. until the end",

Ms./uni00A0 Boeren and Mr. Wynaendts have no special interest (significant shareholder, employee, other) in the Company or its Group. Ms./uni00A0Boeren and Mr. Wynaendts have been independent directors of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM since, respectively, May/uni00A02017 (first appointed as a Board director) and May/uni00A02020 (re-appointment date following a first appointment as a Board director in May/uni00A02016);\n- > the other non-independent Board directors are:\n- -  a representative of the French State appointed by ministerial order: Ms.Besnier/thinspace (2) ,\n- -  Board directors appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting as proposed by the French State: Mr. Comolli and Mr. Bouchiat/thinspace (3) ,\n- -  a Board director appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting as proposed by the Dutch State: Mr. Dirk Jan van den Berg/thinspace (4) ,\n- -  a Board director appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting as proposed by China Eastern Airlines: Mr. Wang/thinspace (6) ,\n- -  a Board director whose candidature was proposed to the Shareholders' Meeting by the Company CMA CGM/thinspace (7) : Mr. Saad\u00e9,\n- -  representatives of the employee shareholders: Mr. Delli-Zotti and Mr. Robardet,\n- -  representatives of the employees: Mr. Belabbas/thinspace (8) and Mr. Tilgenkamp, and\n- -  executive officers of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group: Mr. Smith, Chief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and a Board director of Air/uni00A0France, and Mr. 't Hart, Chair of the KLM Supervisory Board.\n\nGiven the above, and pursuant to the provision of the AFEPMEDEF Code by which Board directors representing employee shareholders and Board directors representing the employees are not counted in the calculation of the percentages of independent shareholders within the Board of Directors and its Committees (\u00a710.3 and 16.1/uni00A0of the AFEP-MEDEF Code), the percentages of independent directors as of December/uni00A031, 2022 are:\n\n- > 44% in the Board of Directors;\n- > 80% in the Audit Committee (chaired by an Independent director);\n- > 67% in the Appointments and Governance Committee (chaired by an Independent director);\n- > 60% in the Remuneration Committee (chaired by an Independent director); and\n- > 40% in the Sustainable Development and Compliance Committee (chaired by an Independent director).\n\nThe proportion of independent directors at December/uni00A031, 2022 (44%) is thus below the 50% threshold recommended by the AFEP-MEDEF Code for non-controlled companies.\n\nThis divergence has emerged following the latest capital transactions.\n\nIn effect, on March/uni00A025, 2019, the Board of Directors of Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM considered, based on a report from the Appointments and Governance Committee, that in view of the Dutch State's acquisition of a shareholding in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM on February/uni00A026, 2019, the Board director appointed as proposed by the Dutch State, could no longer qualify as an Independent director as of that same date.\n\n- -  Delta  Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc./thinspace (5) , whose permanent representative is Mr. Bellemare;",

        "page_content": "Furthermore, on May/uni00A022, 2022, the Company entered into an investment agreement within the framework of the conclusion of a long-term strategic partnership in air cargo wherein Mr. Rodolphe Saad\u00e9, Chair and Chief Executive O/fficer of CMA CGM, was appointed as an Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board director by the Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A024, 2022. Mr. Saad\u00e9 is not an Independent director.\n\nThis divergence is thus due to the specificity of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's shareholder structure, the latter numbering the French (28.6%) and Dutch States (9.3%) amongst its shareholders, along with three major commercial partners, namely CMA CGM (9%), China Eastern Airlines (4.7%) and Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. (2.9%). Collectively these shareholders represented 54.5% of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's share capital as of December/uni00A031, 2022. The Board directors appointed\n\nas proposed by these shareholders may not be considered to be independent.\n\nIn addition, the 28.6% shareholding held by the French State enables the latter, pursuant to the provisions of Ordinance No.2014-948/uni00A0of August/uni00A020, 2014, to benefit from a seat on the Board reserved for a Board director representing the French State, appointed by ministerial order, and to propose two Board directors to the Shareholders' Meeting. Two Board directors have been proposed by the French State. They represent the interests of the French State in its capacity as a shareholder (Article 6/uni00A0III of the aforementioned Ordinance).\n\nIn that it is aware of the interest of having a significant proportion of independent Board directors, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is steadily increasing the proportion of independent directors within its Board of Directors.\n\n## Independence of the Board directors\n\n| Criteria to be evaluated   pursuant to paragraphs 10.5/uni00A0to  10.7/uni00A0of the AFEP-MEDEF Code   | Criterion  1/thinspace (1)   | Criterion  2/thinspace (2)   | Criterion  3/thinspace (3)   | Criterion  4/thinspace (4)   | Criterion  5/thinspace (5)   | Criterion  6/thinspace (6)   | Criterion  7/thinspace (7)   | Criterion  8/thinspace (8)   | Independent  director   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Gwena\u00eblle AVICE-HUET                                                                                   | \u221a                            | \u221a                            | \u221a                            | \u221a                            | \u221a                            | \u221a                            | \u221a                            | \u221a                            | Yes                     |\n| Karim BELABBAS                                                                                         | X                            | \u221a                            | \u221a                            | \u221a                            | \u221a                            | \u221a                            | \u221a                            | \u221a                            | No                      |\n| St\u00e9phanie BESNIER                                                                                      | \u221a                            | \u221a                            | \u221a                            | \u221a                            | \u221a                            | \u221a                            | \u221a                            | X                            | No                      |\n| Leni M.T.

        "page_content": "## Training for Board directors\n\nNewly appointed Board directors are encouraged to meet with the Company's principal executives and are o/ffered site visits to increase their understanding of the Group's business environment and activities. On their appointment, they are also sent a dossier including, notably, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Articles of Incorporation, the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors, the Universal Registration Document, the latest press releases issued by the Company and a reminder of the stock market Compliance Rules.\n\nPursuant to Article 4/uni00A0of the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors, on their appointment and during their terms of o/ffice, every Board director (including the Board directors representing the employees and the employee shareholders) can benefit from the training that they deem necessary for the exercise of their mandate. This training is proposed and organized by the Company.\n\nThis training, which is paid for by the Company, is mostly carried out via a program designed by a professional body, supplemented by in-house training o/ffered by the Company, and is aimed at gaining a better understanding of the functioning of the Board of Directors and their roles as Board directors. Accounting and financing modules are also proposed to enable them to improve their financial know-how. A portion of this training time is carried out within the Company. Pursuant to the applicable regulation, during its meeting of July/uni00A028, 2022, the Board of Directors decided to update the training program in French and English o/ffered to the Board directors representing the employee shareholders and the employees. Specific modules related to climate issues or, in connection with the deployment of the anti-corruption plan, will also be o/ffered to the Board directors in 2023.\n\n## 2.2.5/emspace Other rules applicable to Board directors\n\n## Situation of conflict of interests\n\nPursuant to the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code and Article 11/uni00A0of the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors (as amended by a decision of the Board of Directors of February/uni00A016, 2023), Board directors are bound to report to the Board of Directors any situation of a conflict of interests, whether actual or potential, owing to positions they hold in another company, and must abstain from taking part in the deliberation and voting on the related resolution. Every year, the Company sends the Board directors a questionnaire enabling confirmation that there are no conflicts of interest and the Company to be informed of any potential conflicts.\n\nTo the Company's knowledge, none of the Board directors are related and there are no conflicts of interest between the duties of the Board directors with regard to the Company and their private interests and other duties.\n\nWith the exception of the agreements listed below, there are no arrangements or agreements between the main shareholders, customers, suppliers or other parties, in accordance with which a member of the Board of Directors has been selected:\n\n- (i) the agreements signed on October/uni00A016, 2003 between Air/uni00A0France, KLM and the Dutch government pursuant to which four Board directors are appointed to the Board of Directors as proposed by KLM and the Dutch government (see section/uni00A02.2.3 'Rules applicable to the appointment and replacement of the Board directors');\n- (ii) the agreements signed on July/uni00A027, 2017 between, firstly, Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and, secondly, between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and China Eastern Airlines pursuant to which Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and Mr. Wang were appointed to the Board of Directors (see section/uni00A02.7.4 'Strategic partnerships with Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and China Eastern Airlines, and conclusion of a new partnership with CMA CGM'); and\n\n- (iii) the investment agreement signed on May/uni00A022, 2022 between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and CMA CGM pursuant to which Mr. Saad\u00e9 was appointed as a Board director and the commercial cooperation agreement in air cargo entered into on December/uni00A09, 2022 between, firstly, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Air/uni00A0France and KLM and, secondly, CMA CGM and CMA CGM Air Cargo (see section/uni00A02.7.4 'Strategic partnerships with Delta Air Lines, Inc. and China Eastern Airlines, and conclusion of a new partnership with CMA CGM').\n\nFurthermore, pursuant to the provisions of Ordinance No. 2014-948/uni00A0of August/uni00A020, 2014 concerning the governance and transactions involving the share capital of public sector companies and the application decree-law No. 2014-949/uni00A0of August/uni00A020, 2014, a Board director representing the French State is appointed by ministerial order and two Board directors are appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting as proposed by the French State. In addition, pursuant to Articles L./uni00A0225-23 and L./uni00A022-10.5/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce (French Code of Commerce), L./uni00A06411-9/uni00A0of the Code des Transports (French Transport Code) and 17.2/uni00A0of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Articles of Incorporation, as proposed by the employee (and former employee) shareholders referred to in Article L./uni00A0225-102/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, two Board directors representing the employee and former-employee shareholders are appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting. Lastly, in that the Board of Directors is composed of more than eight directors, two Board directors representing the employees have seats on the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Article L./uni00A022-10-7/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce and Article 17-3/uni00A0of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Articles of Incorporation (see section/uni00A02.2.3 'Rules applicable to the appointment and replacement of Board directors').\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2022, there were no service level contracts binding any member of the Board of Directors to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM or to one of its subsidiaries and foreseeing the granting of benefits under the terms of the contract.",

The aim of the parties is to be able to initiate the commercial cooperation in the 2023 second quarter, subject to obtaining the required authorizations from the competent legal and regulatory authorities.\n\nMr. Rodolphe Saad\u00e9, a Board director appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A024, 2022 as proposed by CMA CGM, could be considered to be directly interested in the conclusion of the Cooperation Agreement, due in particular to (i)/uni00A0his position as a Board director of the Company, (ii)/uni00A0his position as Chair and Chief Executive O/fficer of CMA CGM, and (iii)/uni00A0in his capacity as a shareholder of CMA CGM.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of Article L./uni00A0225-38/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the conclusion of the Cooperation Agreement during its meeting of December/uni00A08, 2022. Mr. Rodolphe Saad\u00e9 did not take part in the deliberation and the vote with respect to the Cooperation Agreement.\n\nThe Cooperation Agreement is expected to generate revenue synergies for the Company, notably through the joint design of the all-cargo networks and enhanced transportation products and services opportunities.\n\nThe Cooperation Agreement will build on the strength of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM brand, experience and capabilities in air\n\nfreight, supported by its global cargo network. CMA CGM will mobilize its extensive commercial network and global logistics platform, and complement this o/ffer with innovative logistics and multimodal solutions.\n\nThe Cooperation Agreement is a commercial agreement whose costs and benefits for the Company are not quantifiable at this stage.\n\n## Agreements and commitments authorized and signed in previous financial years whose execution remained in force in 2022\n\n## Agreements entered into with the French State in April/uni00A02021\n\nAs mentioned above, on April/uni00A020, 2021 as part of the Group's recapitalization plan announced on April/uni00A06, 2021, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM entered into a Subscription Agreement with the French State relating to the issuance by the Company and the subscription by the French Republic to undated deeply subordinated notes (accounted as equity under IFRS in the Company's consolidated financial statements) in the total amount of \u20ac3/uni00A0billion. This agreement remained in force during the 2022 financial year and gave rise to the partial Repurchases outlined in the agreements and commitments authorized and signed during the financial year section above.\n\n## Expansion of the cooperation agreement entered into between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Air/uni00A0France, KLM and China Eastern Airlines\n\nIn the context of the Group's recapitalization plan announced on April/uni00A06, 2021, on June/uni00A023, 2021 Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM entered into an agreement with China Eastern Airlines to accelerate their e/fforts to deepen and broaden the existing and future cooperation, and further strengthen their partnership for transportation services between China and Europe (the 'CEA Commercial Agreement').\n\nThe CEA Commercial Agreement sets out the ambitions for the expansion of the cooperation between China Eastern Airlines, Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Air/uni00A0France and KLM. The parties intend to intensify their commercial cooperation (exclusive joint-venture partnership from January/uni00A01, 2022 for passenger air transportation between Europe and China (improved code share o/ffer, closer alignment of fares and sales policy,/uni00A0etc.) and extend cooperation.\n\nIn particular, the parties in the CEA Commercial Agreement undertook to:\n\n- a) add the Paris-Beijing and Amsterdam-Beijing routes to the CEA Commercial Agreement, upon satisfaction of the agreed conditions;\n- b) accelerate their e/fforts to deepen the existing cooperation on business, operational, marketing and innovation policies, including through sta/ff exchanges;\n- c) explore new opportunities for cooperation in the area of passenger transportation in particular in the domains of competition rules, alliances and technologies;\n- d) explore synergies in areas such as ground services, catering, maintenance and non-aviation-related areas such as tourism, hotels and car rental; and",

The maturity of the loan, initially scheduled at one year and renewable once for a period of one or two years at the borrower's option, is now contractually set for May/uni00A07, 2023 after the exercise of the two-year extension option by the Company in February/uni00A02021. the State Guaranteed Loan as follows:\n\n- > the final maturity date of the State Guaranteed Loan was extended by two additional years and is therefore set at May/uni00A06, 2025;\n- > the State Guaranteed Loan will now be repaid by amortization based on the following schedule:\n- -  \u20ac500/uni00A0million on the signature date of the Amendment. The funds required for this early repayment came from the proceeds of the bond issues of June/uni00A024, 2021,\n- -  \u20ac800/uni00A0million on May/uni00A06, 2023,\n- -  \u20ac1.35/uni00A0billion on May/uni00A06, 2024,\n- -  \u20ac1.35/uni00A0billion on May/uni00A06, 2025;\n- > the State Guaranteed Loan bears interest at the rate of: 3-month Euribor (with a floor at zero) with an annual margin of between 0.75% and 2.75%, it being specified that this margin henceforth applies to the following schedule: 1.50% from May/uni00A06, 2021 (inclusive) until May/uni00A06, 2022 (exclusive) and 2.75% from May/uni00A06, 2022;\n\n- > the guarantee fee will apply according to the following schedule: 1.0% from May/uni00A06, 2021 (inclusive) until May/uni00A06, 2023 (exclusive) and 2.0% from May/uni00A06, 2023. Until May/uni00A06, 2023 (exclusive) it will be calculated based on the initial amount of \u20ac4/uni00A0billion. Thereafter, the calculation basis will be reduced by the scheduled repayments mentioned above.\n\nMandatory prepayment clauses ('Mandatory Prepayments') are foreseen in the contract, in particular in the event of debt issues resulting from capital market transactions in the bond market, up to a limit of 75% of the amounts raised, excluding hybrid instruments, convertible bonds or quasi-equity repayments to be made under bonds and convertible lines existing on the signature date of the Amendment and with maturity dates falling during the term of the extended State Guaranteed Loan.\n\nIt is however stipulated that, within the framework of the early repayment realized on November/uni00A07, 2022 in the amount of \u20ac1/uni00A0billion, the total outstanding amount of the State Guaranteed Loan was thus reduced to \u20ac2.5/uni00A0billion with the following redemption schedule:\n\n- > May 2024: partial redemption of \u20ac1.15/uni00A0billion, i.e. an outstanding amount of \u20ac1.35/uni00A0billion;\n- > May 2025: final redemption of \u20ac1.35/uni00A0billion (no outstanding amount remaining due after this date).\n\nThe financial costs incurred by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM in 2022 in respect of the State Guaranteed Loan amounted to around \u20ac125/uni00A0million.\n\n## Finalization of a Framework Agreement between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, KLM and the Dutch State\n\nOn August/uni00A07, 2020, within the framework of the financial support package granted by the Dutch State to KLM, a subsidiary of Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM entered into a Framework Agreement with KLM and the Dutch State, a shareholder in the Company with 14% of its share capital, to enable KLM to meet its urgent need for liquidity following the crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic and prepare for the future.\n\nThis financial support package, approved on June/uni00A025, 2020 by the Company's Board of Directors in the total amount of \u20ac3.4/uni00A0billion, was structured as follows:\n\n- > a revolving credit facility in the amount of \u20ac2.4/uni00A0billion, granted to KLM by eleven banks and up to 90% guaranteed by the Dutch State; and\n- > a direct loan in the amount of \u20ac1/uni00A0billion, granted by the Dutch State to KLM, with subordination to the revolving credit facility.\n\nA number of conditions were associated with the granting of these loans, including respect by the Company of the commitments on sustainability and the restored performance and competitiveness of KLM, including a comprehensive restructuring plan and a contribution made by employees. KLM also undertook to suspend dividend payments to its shareholders until such time as these two loans have been repaid in full.",

In this respect, each party waives all rights it may have with respect to the amounts due to it under the joint-venture agreement for the calendar year 2020, and agrees to waive them permanently. This waiver will be able to be extended to the to 2021 and 2022 financial years given the duration of the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on the joint-venture operations; and\n- 2) the suspension of the provisions relating to the financial settlement mechanism (to share the revenues generated by the joint-venture) in the joint-venture agreement entered into with China Eastern Airlines on November/uni00A026, 2018. In this respect, each party agrees to waive all payments under the joint-venture agreement as of February/uni00A01, 2020 for a period to be mutually agreed between the parties depending on the duration of the e/ffects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the joint-venture.\n\nThis waiver was decided to avoid uncertain and potentially material financial exposure for each party given the context linked to the public health crisis. It was maintained during the 2022 financial year.\n\nGiven the amendment to the financial settlement mechanism foreseen in the joint-venture agreements, there has been no need to calculate the impact that would have resulted from the application of these provisions.\n\nFor more information concerning the agreements between, firstly, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and Virgin Atlantic and, secondly, between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and China Eastern Airlines, see section/uni00A02.7.4 'Strategic partnerships with Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and China Eastern Airlines, and conclusion of a new partnership with CMA CGM',\n\n## Transatlantic partnership between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and Virgin Atlantic\n\nOn October/uni00A030, 2019, the Board of Directors mandated the Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM management to finalize the discussions and negotiate amendments to the agreements authorized during the Board meetings of March/uni00A014 and May/uni00A015, 2018 (see section/uni00A02.7.4 'Strategic partnerships with Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and China Eastern Airlines, and conclusion of a new partnership with\n\nCMA CGM'), so as not to proceed with the planned acquisition by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM of a 31% equity interest in Virgin Atlantic Limited.

The Board will assess the achievement of these performance criteria.\n\nFor more information, see section/uni00A02.5.2 'Compensation of the Company o/fficers in 2022'.\n\nThere were no agreements or commitments authorized and signed over the course of previous financial years whose execution continued during the last financial year.\n\n## Procedure for the qualification and regular evaluation of the current agreements signed in normal conditions\n\nDuring its meeting of December/uni00A011, 2019, as recommended by the Audit Committee, the Board of Directors established a procedure enabling the qualification and regular evaluation of the agreements relating to current operations entered into under normal terms and conditions pursuant to the provisions of Article L./uni00A022-10-12/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce. The current and normal nature of an agreement is evaluated on a case-by-case basis during the signature, renewal or amendment of the said agreement, on the basis of objective criteria defined in the procedure.\n\nWithin the framework of this annual evaluation procedure, the Company:\n\n- > compiles an inventory of all the agreements referred to in Article L./uni00A022-10-12/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce;\n- > reviews all the elements and documents having enabled the qualification of the agreements; and\n- > as necessary, reviews the qualification of any agreements with interested parties (regulated agreement or free agreement, depending on the case).\n\nPersons with an interest in one of these agreements, entered into either directly or through an intermediary, do not participate in their evaluation.\n\nA presentation on the result of the inventory of the agreements referred to in Article L./uni00A022-10-12/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, in respect of the financial year ended December/uni00A031, 2022, was made to the Audit Committee on February/uni00A015, 2023 and was reviewed by the Board of Directors within the framework of the corporate governance report.\n\n## Evaluation of the functioning of the Board of Directors and its Committees\n\nAt least once a year, pursuant to the provisions of Article 11/uni00A0of the AFEP-MEDEF Code and Article 2/uni00A0of the Internal Rules of the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors discusses its functioning and organization. To inform this discussion, a formalized evaluation is conducted via a questionnaire. This evaluation is steered by the Appointments and Governance Committee. Furthermore, a formal evaluation with the help of an external consultant is realized every three years, in accordance with the provisions\n\nof the internal rules as amended by a decision of the Board of Directors on February/uni00A016, 2023.\n\nIn respect of the 2022 financial year, the Board of Directors realized an evaluation in the form of a questionnaire submitted to each Board director. The following topics were addressed through the evaluation questionnaire:\n\n- > the composition, organization, functioning and dynamic of the Board of Directors and its Committees;\n- > the relationship between the Board of Directors and the General Management;\n- > the e/ffectiveness of the Board of Directors and its Committees;\n- > the articulation of the work of the Board of Directors with that of the Group's two main subsidiaries: Air/uni00A0France and KLM;\n- > the individual contributions of the Board directors to the work of the Board of Directors and the areas of expertise to be developed within the Board;\n- > the main changes and areas requiring improvement.\n\nThe results of the evaluation were handled under the seal of anonymity and gave rise to a presentation and discussion during the Board of Directors meeting of March/uni00A016, 2023.\n\nIn 2022, the Board of Directors was again very active (number of meetings: 8/uni00A0ordinary, 5/uni00A0extraordinary and 2/uni00A0written consultations). It focused on managing the exit from the crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic and working on the resulting recapitalization and financing measures. The Board of Directors also had to deal with issues related to the war in Ukraine, the inflationary situation and the operational disruption at major international airports occurring over the summer.\n\nAs a general rule, the Board directors considered that the functioning of the Board of Directors had improved over the course of 2022 since the previous evaluation. The evaluation revealed the following positive points:\n\n- > good performance of the Board in terms of its functioning and organization, promoting quality exchanges between the Board directors;\n- > e/ffective role played by the Board in defining and monitoring the Group's strategy;\n- > the composition of the Board and its committees meets the needs of the Board, with a good complementarity in terms of the experience and skill profiles of the Board directors;\n- > clear division of roles between the Board and the Committees, allowing for the e/ffective handling of the issues discussed; and\n- > the information sent to the Board directors is adapted to the e/ffective execution of the Board's work.\n\nThe results of the 2022 evaluation enabled the identification of a number of areas for improvement to be monitored during 2023, notably:\n\n- > summarize more the documents sent to the Board and reduce the average length of meetings;\n- > continue to open up the Board to younger and/or independent Board directors;",

On July/uni00A01, 2021, the Board of Directors decided to appoint Ms./uni00A0Bouillot as Chair of the Audit Committee, in that she has the academic background and professional experience to fulfill this requirement for specific financial competence, and she has no relationships with the Company, its Group or management that are such as to color her judgment. The six other Committee members also have financial and/or accounting skills.\n\nThe principal executives responsible for accounting, legal a/ffairs, finance, internal control and Internal Audit of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM also attend meetings in an advisory capacity.\n\nThe Statutory Auditors attended all the meetings of the Audit Committee. At the request of the Chair of the Committee and pursuant to Article 17.3/uni00A0of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, they were able to consult with Committee members outside the presence of the Group's senior executives on the occasion of the review of the annual financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nt\n\n## Missions\n\nThe Audit Committee's principal missions are to review the interim and annual consolidated financial statements to inform the Board of Directors of their content, ensure that they are reliable and exhaustive, and that the information they contain, including the forward-looking information provided to shareholders and the market, meets high standards of quality. The Committee also oversees the auditing of the annual financial statements. In particular, the Audit Committee reviews the:\n\n- > consolidation  scope;\n- > relevance and consistency of the accounting methods used to draw up the financial statements;\n- > principal estimates made by the General Management of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM;\n- > principal financial risks with the General Management of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and the material off-balance-sheet commitments;\n- > comments and recommendations made by the Statutory Auditors and, if applicable, any significant adjustments resulting from audits.\n\nAs necessary, the Audit Committee formulates recommendations to guarantee the integrity of the process to establish the financial information.\n\nThe Audit Committee monitors the e/ffectiveness of the Internal Control and risk management procedures and, as necessary, Internal Audit, in terms of the processes relating to the establishment and treatment of the accounting and financial information, with no compromise to its independence. In this capacity, it reviews in particular the program and results of Internal Audit to ensure, notably, that, in the event of any malfunctioning, the appropriate action plans and follow-up monitoring have been implemented. The Committee discusses with the Statutory Auditors and reviews their conclusions on the half-year and annual financial statements. It also pays particular attention to the audit points identified by the Statutory Auditors and\n\n6\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n7\n\nmembers\n\n3/thinspaceh/thinspace30 average duration per meeting\n\n80% independent Board directors\n\n98% average Board director attendance",

Following the report from the Appointments and Governance Committee, on March/uni00A025, 2019 the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors considered that, in view of the Dutch State's acquisition of a shareholding in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM on February/uni00A026, 2019, the Board director appointed as proposed by the Dutch State, could no longer be considered an independent Board director as of that same date.\n\nFurthermore, on May/uni00A022, 2022, the Company entered into an investment agreement within the framework of the conclusion of a long-term strategic partnership in air cargo wherein, Mr. Rodolphe Saad\u00e9, Chair and Chief Executive Officer of CMA CGM was appointed an Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board director by the Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A024, 2022. Mr. Rodolphe Saad\u00e9 is not an independent Board director.\n\nThis divergence is thus due to the specificity of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's shareholder structure, the latter numbering the French (28.6%) and Dutch States (9.3%) amongst its shareholders, along with three major commercial partners, namely CMA CGM (9%), China Eastern Airlines (4.7%) and Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. (2.9%). Collectively these shareholders represented 54.5% of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's share capital at December/uni00A031, 2022. The Board directors appointed as proposed by these shareholders may not be considered to be independent.\n\nIn addition, the 28.6% shareholding held by the French State enables the latter, pursuant to the provisions of Ordinance No.2014-948/uni00A0of August/uni00A020, 2014, to benefit from a seat on the Board reserved for a Board director representing the French State, appointed by ministerial order, and to propose two Board directors to the Shareholders' Meeting. These two Board directors have been proposed by the French State and represent the interests of the French State in its capacity as a shareholder (Article 6/uni00A0III of the aforementioned Ordinance).\n\nIn that it is aware of the interest of having a significant proportion of independent Board directors, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is steadily increasing the proportion of independent members within its Board of Directors.",

The Company's Board of Directors thus establishes a compensation policy which complies with the Company's corporate interest (int\u00e9r\u00eat social), is aligned with its commercial strategy, and which contributes to its long-term sustainability. It outlines all the components of the fixed and variable compensation for the Company o/fficers, and explains the decision-making process followed for its establishment, revision and implementation. This compensation policy is the subject of a draft resolution submitted for approval by the Shareholders' Meeting, under the conditions provided for in Article L./uni00A022-10-32/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, on an annual basis and on any significant amendment to the compensation policy.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of Articles L./uni00A022-10-9 and L./uni00A022-10-34/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, the Shareholders' Meeting must also approve on an annual basis, firstly, the information referred to in Article L./uni00A022-10-9/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, including notably the total compensation and benefits of any kind paid to all the Company o/fficers in respect of their mandates during the previous financial year or granted in respect of their mandates for the same financial year and, secondly, the total compensation and benefits of any kind paid during the previous financial year or granted for the same financial year to each executive o/fficer.\n\nThe Shareholders' Meeting of June/uni00A07, 2023 is thus convened to approve:\n\n- > the information relating to the compensation for each of the Company o/fficers, pursuant to Articles L./uni00A022-10-9 and\n\n- L./uni00A022-10-34/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce.

Presentation of the 2022 compensation structure for the Chief Executive O/fficer\n\nAs proposed by the Remuneration Committee, the framework of the compensation policy for the Chief Executive O/fficer was set by the Board of Directors during its meeting of August/uni00A016, 2018. It stipulates that the compensation of the Chief Executive O/fficer shall be composed of the following three elements:\n\n- 1) a fixed amount of annual compensation;\n- 2) an annual variable amount of compensation linked to the performance during the previous financial year potentially reaching 122% of the fixed compensation at targets achieved and up to 150% in the event that the targets are exceeded; and\n- 3) a variable amount of long-term compensation.\n\nThis compensation structure has remained unchanged since 2018 as regards both the amount of fixed compensation and the amounts of annual and long-term compensation at targets achieved and the maximum amounts in the event that these targets are exceeded. Within the framework of this policy, the Chief Executive O/fficer receives benefits in kind whose scope has remained unchanged since 2018.\n\nThe compensation policy for the Chief Executive O/fficer in respect of the 2022 financial year was set pursuant to the framework for the policy set in 2018. Within the context of crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic being traversed by the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, it stipulates, in particular, that the Board of Directors, following the recommendation from the Remuneration Committee, may use its judgement in determining any variable compensation for the Chief Executive O/fficer. As a result, the Board of Directors may determine the modalities for the variable compensation of the Chief Executive O/fficer (i)/uni00A0in accordance with (a) the performance of the Group and its financial situation at the end of the financial year (b) the compensation policy applied to the Group's employees and (c) the preservation of the Group's",

Pursuant to this decision, no variable compensation will be able to be paid to the Chief Executive O/fficer until such time as at least 75% of the recapitalization measures has been repaid. Lastly, by way of reminder, on April/uni00A023, 2020, Mr. Benjamin Smith announced that he was waiving his annual variable compensation in respect of the 2020 financial year. As a result, no variable compensation has been paid to Mr. Benjamin Smith since 2021.\n\nThe 2022 compensation policy for the Chief Executive O/fficer was approved by the Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A024, 2022.\n\nFor more details on the compensation policy for the Chief Executive O/fficer in respect of the 2022 financial year, see section/uni00A02.5.3.2/uni00A0of the 2021 Universal Registration Document.\n\nA summary of the compensation elements of the Chief Executive O/fficer since 2018 is presented in section/uni00A02.5.2.6/uni00A0of the 2022 Universal Registration Document.\n\n## Elements of compensation paid during or granted in respect of the 2022 financial year\n\nThe elements of compensation paid during the 2022 financial year or granted in respect of this financial year to the Chief Executive O/fficer were set by the Board of Directors at its meeting on February/uni00A016, 2023 as recommended by the Remuneration Committee.

A coe/fficient (between 0% and 100%) will be applied to this  amount on the basis of the performance of the interested party,  measured with reference to the attainment of the performance  criteria for the annual variable component of his compensation  over the preceding two financial years of his mandate (or since  his appointment, in the event of termination during the first two  years). The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors is responsible  for evaluating the achievement of these performance criteria. The Chief Executive O/fficer does not benefit from a non-compete  indemnity. |",

The value of the share price retained after the detachment of the preferential subscription right corresponds to the value of the share price calculated by Euronext on May/uni00A024, 2022, the day the launch of the capital increase was announced, i.e. \u20ac1.740. As a result, the coe/fficient to be applied for the adjustment of the long-term incentive plans is 2.5 (4.296/1.740 = 2.5).\n\nIt is also stipulated that:\n\n- > Concerning the Long-Term Incentive Plan ('phantom shares'), in respect of the 2020 financial year, 200,400/uni00A0performance units were granted to the Chief Executive O/fficer valued at \u20ac1,000,000, payable in cash in 2023 subject to the realization of the performance conditions and a three-year presence condition, excepting exercise by the Chief Executive O/fficer of his right to defer payment for a maximum of three years.\n\nIt is stipulated that, in application of the Board of Directors' resolution of October/uni00A027, 2022, the number of performance units granted in 2020 has been multiplied by 2.5. As a result, the number of performance units acquired in respect of the 2020 financial year is: 501,000.\n\nAt its meeting of February/uni00A016, 2023, the Board of Directors decided, as proposed by the Remuneration Committee, to set the level of achievement of the performance conditions\n\nof the plan at an overall 59.3%, this overall figure including the achievement at:\n\n- -  57.66% of the condition linked to the Total shareholder Return (TSR) of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM share price compared with the weighted TSR of the companies in the sector,\n- -  80.0% of the condition linked to the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM ROCE index realized relative to the budget, and\n- -  33.33% of the condition linked to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for airlines.\n\nAs a result, as proposed by the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors set the number of performance units acquired by the Chief Executive O/fficer in respect of this plan for the 2020 financial year at 297,093.\n\nPursuant to Article L./uni00A022-10-34/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, the payment of these 297,093/uni00A0performance units is subject to the prior approval of the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nIt is specified that, in 2023, the Chief Executive Officer exercised his right to defer payment of these performance units for a maximum of three years. The amount to be paid in respect of these performance units will be calculated with reference to the share price following the announcement of the results for the financial year preceding the year in which the payment must in principle take place in application of the applicable plan.\n\n- > Concerning the Specific Long-Term Incentive Plan: in respect of the 2020 financial year: 200,400/uni00A0performance units were granted to the Chief Executive O/fficer valued at \u20ac1,000,000, payable in shares in 2023 subject to the attainment of the performance conditions and a three-year presence condition.\n\nIt is stipulated that, in application of the Board of Directors' resolution of October/uni00A027, 2022, the number of performance units granted in 2020 has been multiplied by 2.5. As a result, the number of performance units acquired in respect of the 2020 financial year is: 501,000.\n\nAs proposed by the Remuneration Committee, during its meeting of February/uni00A016, 2023 the Board of Directors noted the level of achievement of the performance conditions of the plan which stood at an overall 86,67% this overall figure including the achievement at:\n\n- -  100.00% of the condition linked to the relative COI of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, and\n- -  33.33% of the condition linked to the CSR targets.\n\nAs a result, as proposed by the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors set the number of performance units payable in shares to the Chief Executive O/fficer at 434.216.\n\nPursuant to Article L./uni00A022-10-34/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, the payment of these 434.216/uni00A0performance units is subject to prior approval by the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThe following table summarizes the characteristics of the elements of long-term variable compensation granted to the Chief Executive O/fficer in respect of the 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 financial years.",

It sets forth, for the Company's last five financial years, the ratios between the level of compensation for the executive o/fficers and, firstly, the average compensation on a full-time equivalent base for employees of the Company other than the Company o/fficers and, secondly, the median compensation on a full-time equivalent base for employees of the Company other than the Company o/fficers.\n\nThe following ratios have been calculated based on the annualized fixed and variable compensation paid during the relevant financial years.\n\nSince the Company Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM does not include a representative number of employees during the relevant period (fewer than 20% of the sta/ff in France), a broader scope has been used ('relevant scope') consisting of Air/uni00A0France employees on permanent contracts (except expatriate and seconded sta/ff) in France, present and paid throughout the year on a full-time basis, representing more than 80% of the headcount in France.",

These elements have been annualized for the purposes of comparison.\n- (3)  Note that the Chair of the Board of Directors submitted her fixed compensation of \u20ac200,000/uni00A0paid during the 2020 financial year to the same modalities as those applied to all the Air/uni00A0France and Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM/uni00A0SA employees (notably its reduction pro rata temporis for the period of partial activity applied to all the employees).\n\n- (5)  Note that the Chief Executive O/fficer informed the Board of Directors of his decision to submit his fixed compensation, paid during the 2020 financial year, to the same modalities as those applied to all the Air/uni00A0France and Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM employees (notably its reduction pro rata temporis for the periods of partial activity applied to all the employees).\n- (6) Note that, on April/uni00A023, 2020, in view of the crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic being traversed by the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, the Chief Executive O/fficer announced that he was waiving his annual variable compensation in respect of the 2020 financial year.\n- (7)  The amount of annual variable compensation for the Chief Executive O/fficer in respect of the 2021 financial year was set at 121.11% of the annual fixed compensation, i.e. \u20ac1,098,984, by the Board of Directors during its meeting of February/uni00A016, 2022. This amount will be able to be paid to the Chief Executive O/fficer once 75% of the recapitalization measures has been repaid.\n- (8)  Note that, during its meeting of December/uni00A011, 2019, the Board of Directors decided to introduce a variable portion of compensation based on attendance, allocated to the Board directors in respect of their functions within the advisory Committees. Audit Committee:\n- - the Chair now receives a fixed portion of \u20ac4,500 and a variable portion of \u20ac7,500/uni00A0based on attendance at Committee meetings; and\n- -  the members now receive a fixed portion of \u20ac3,000 and a variable portion of \u20ac5,000/uni00A0based on attendance at Committee meetings. Other Committees:\n- - the Chair now receives a fixed portion of \u20ac3,000 and a variable portion of \u20ac4,500/uni00A0based on attendance at Committee meetings; and\n- - the members now receive a fixed portion of \u20ac2,000 and a variable portion of \u20ac3,000/uni00A0based on attendance at Committee meetings.\n- (9) In view of the very high number of extraordinary meetings of the Board of Directors taking place during the 2018 financial year within the framework of the transitional governance period and the investment made by the di/fferent Board directors in attending these meetings, during its meeting of October/uni00A029, 2018, the Board of Directors granted an exceptional additional element of compensation (within the framework of the budget approved by the Shareholders' Meeting) to each Board director. These elements are set forth in section/uni00A02.5.2.1.\n- (10)  On April/uni00A03, 2020, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board directors decided to reduce by 25% their compensation paid in 2020 pro rata temporis for the periods of partial activity applied to all the employees of Air/uni00A0France and Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM/uni00A0SA, i.e. from April/uni00A01/uni00A0to December/uni00A031, 2020.\n- (11)  On February/uni00A017, 2021, in view of the context of crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM directors decided to reduce by 25% their compensation paid in 2021 until such time as the Group's current operating income (COI) has returned to a positive figure.\n- (12)  Following the deliberation of the Board of Directors of December/uni00A08, 2022, having noted that the first half financial statements at June/uni00A030, 2022 and the third quarter financial statements had indicated that the Group's Current Operating Income would be positive at December/uni00A031, 2022, it was decided to remove the 25% reduction in the compensation for Board directors paid in respect of the 2022 financial year.\n- (13)  Since the Company Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM/uni00A0SA does not include a representative number of employees during the relevant period (less than 20% of the employees in France), a broader scope has been used ('relevant scope') consisting of Air/uni00A0France employees on permanent contracts (except expatriate and seconded sta/ff) in France, present and paid throughout the year on a full-time basis, representing more than 80% of the headcount in France.\n- (14)  The increase in the compensation of employees within the relevant scope is explained by the recovery in activity at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Air/uni00A0France with notably the reduction in partial activity.\n- (15)  The restated figures include the change in accounting principles for pensions (interpretation of IAS/uni00A019).",

The work of the Remuneration Committee takes into account the examination of benchmarking studies carried out with the help of external consultants to compare this policy with the practices in comparable companies. The Committee also ensures that the compensation policy is aligned with the Company's strategy. On the basis of this work, the Committee formulates recommendations for the Board which then sets the compensation policy on an annual basis. The Remuneration Committee also formulates recommendations for the Board regarding its implementation.\n\nAs recommended by the Remuneration Committee, during the establishment of the compensation policy for company o/fficers, the Board of Directors takes into account the remuneration and employment conditions of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's employees. As for all the employees of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, the Board of Directors ensures the implementation of a simple, understandable and consistent compensation policy in a fair manner. The Board of Directors takes particular care that, at their individual level, all the employees and company o/fficers have the material resources required for the fulfilment of their respective duties.\n\nThe Internal Rules of the Board of Directors, as amended by the Board of Directors resolution of February/uni00A016, 2023, stipulate that any Board director in a situation of conflict of interests, even potential, must inform the Board of Directors and abstain from attending the debate or participating in the vote for the corresponding deliberation. The executive officers are not present during the discussions of the Board of Directors and the Remuneration Committee regarding their own compensation.\n\nShould a new Chair of the Board of Directors or a new Chief Executive O/fficer be appointed, the elements of compensation foreseen in the compensation policy for company o/fficers would also apply to them. As recommended by the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors will then determine, while adapting them to the situation of the interested parties, the targets, levels of performance, parameters, structure and maximum percentages relative to their annual fixed compensation which may not be higher than those approved by the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThe 2023 compensation policy for the Company o/fficers outlines all the components of the fixed and, as necessary, variable compensation for Board directors (section/uni00A02.5.3.1/uni00A0hereinafter); the Chair of the Board of Directors (section/uni00A02.5.3.2/uni00A0a. hereinafter); and the Chief Executive O/fficer (section/uni00A02.5.3.2/uni00A0b. hereinafter), and explains the decision-making process for its establishment, review and implementation.\n\nThis 2023 compensation policy for the Company o/fficers will be the subject of a draft resolution submitted for approval by the Shareholders' Meeting of June/uni00A07, 2023 under the conditions provided for in Article L./uni00A022-10-8/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce and on any material amendment to the compensation policy.\n\n## 2.5.3.1/emspace Compensation for the Board directors in respect of 2023\n\nSubject to approval of the 2023 compensation policy for the Company o/fficers by the Shareholders' Meeting of June/uni00A07, 2023, the Board directors of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM will receive, in respect of their Board directors' mandates, compensation (formerly directors' fees) amounting to a maximum amount which was set at \u20ac950,000 for the entire Board of Directors.\n\nThe compensation for Board directors shall be composed of a flat-rate amount of compensation, with an additional portion calculated as a function of their respective attendance records, whose modalities for distribution and granting are set by the Board of Directors, as proposed by the Remuneration Committee.\n\nThese allocation rules have been unchanged since the Board of Directors' resolution of February/uni00A019, 2014, and are as follows:\n\n- > \u20ac15,000 in flat-rate compensation;\n- > \u20ac25,000/uni00A0of compensation based on their individual attendance records at meetings of the Board of Directors and at Shareholders' Meetings; and\n- > a sum of additional compensation is also granted to non-resident Board directors (\u20ac7,000).\n\nAs its meeting of December/uni00A011, 2019, the Board of Directors also decided that a portion of the compensation for Board directors in respect of their functions within the Committees would be based on their attendance records:\n\n- > for the Audit Committee:\n- -  the Chair will receive flat-rate compensation of \u20ac4,500/uni00A0plus a maximum of \u20ac7,500/uni00A0based on their attendance record at Committee meetings, and",

Her Board director mandate was renewed during the Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A026, 2020 for a four year term of o/ffice, i.e. until the end of the Shareholders' Meeting convened to approve the financial statements for the financial year ending December/uni00A031, 2023. Ms./uni00A0Anne-Marie Couderc was appointed Chair of the Board of Directors from May/uni00A015, 2018 and until June/uni00A07, 2023. Her mandate as Chair of the Board of Directors was renewed for one additional year by a resolution adopted by the Board of Directors during its meeting of December/uni00A08, 2022, subject to approval by the shareholders during the Shareholders' Meeting of June/uni00A07, 2023 of the amendment to Article 26/uni00A0of the Company's Articles of Incorporation stipulating that, when the age limit for the Chair of the Board of Directors is reached during the course of his or her Board director mandate, the latter will continue to exercise his or her duties as Chair of the Board of Directors until the end of his or her Board director mandate. The Chair of the Board of Directors may be dismissed at any time by the Board of Directors. Ms./uni00A0Anne-Marie Couderc has no employment contract binding her to the Company or another company within the Group.\n\nDuring its meeting of February/uni00A016, 2023, the Board of Directors defined, as proposed by the Remuneration Committee, the structure of the compensation to be granted to the Chair of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors in respect of the 2023 financial year.\n\n## -Annual compensation (fixed and variable)\n\n## Description of the annual fixed and variable elements\n\nDuring its meeting of February/uni00A016, 2023, the Board of Directors decided, as recommended by the Remuneration Committee and at the request of the Chair of the Board of Directors, to set the annual gross fixed compensation for the Chair of the Board of Directors at \u20ac200,000 in respect of her duties. Note that a revised amount of annual fixed compensation for the Chair of the Board of Directors had been set at \u20ac220,000/uni00A0by the Board of Directors on February/uni00A019, 2020 but the Chair of the Board of Directors had waived this increase in respect of the 2020 and 2021 financial years and this increase was not applied in respect of the 2022 financial year in compliance with the European Commission's decision of April/uni00A05, 2021 on case No. SA59913 relating to the recapitalization of Air/uni00A0France and Air-France-KLM which stipulates that the compensation of the Chair of the Board of Directors may not exceed the fixed portion of her compensation at December/uni00A031, 2019. The Chair of the Board of Directors will not benefit from variable or multi-year compensation.\n\n## -Annual extraordinary compensation\n\nThe Chair of the Board of Directors will not benefit from annual extraordinary compensation.\n\n## -Long-term incentive plan or specific long-term incentive plan\n\nThe Chair of the Board of Directors will not benefit from a long-term incentive plan or a specific long-term incentive plan.\n\n## -Compensation in the capacity of Board director\n\nThe Chair of the Board of Directors will not receive compensation in respect of her Board director duties.\n\n## -Severance  payment\n\nThe Chair of the Board of Directors will not benefit from a severance payment.\n\n## -Benefits in kind\n\nThe Chair of the Board of Directors will dispose of material resources (chau/ffeur-driven company car) that cannot, in practice, be separated from the performance of her duties.\n\n## -Others\n\nThe Chair of the Board of Directors will not benefit from an employment contract, nor from a top-up pension plan, non-compete indemnity, stock options or free shares.\n\n## b) 2023 compensation policy for the Chief Executive O/fficer\n\nMr. Benjamin Smith was appointed Chief Executive O/fficer as of September/uni00A017, 2018 and a Board director as of December/uni00A05, 2018. His Board director mandate was submitted for ratification by the shareholders during the Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A028, 2019 then renewed during this same Shareholders' Meeting for a four-year term of o/ffice, i.e. until the end of the Shareholders' Meeting convened to approve the financial statements for the financial year ending December/uni00A031, 2022. The renewal of his Board director mandate for a term of four years, i.e. until the end of the Shareholders' Meeting convened to approve the financial statements for the financial year ending December/uni00A031, 2026, will be submitted to the vote by shareholders at the Shareholders' Meeting on June/uni00A07, 2023. The term of his mandate as Chief Executive O/fficer is five years. It was renewed early on March/uni00A030, 2022, i.e. until the end of the Shareholders' Meeting convened to approve the financial statements for the financial year ending December/uni00A031, 2026. The Chief Executive O/fficer may, however, be dismissed at any time by the Board of Directors. Mr. Benjamin Smith has no employment contract with the Company or any other company within the Group.\n\nNote that, given the adoption of the Group's new governance during 2018, and in view of the profile and international experience of Mr. Benjamin Smith, Chief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM as of September/uni00A017, 2018, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors considered it necessary to modify the framework for the compensation of the Group's Chief Executive O/fficer which had been approved by the Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A015, 2018 and which had de facto become inapplicable.\n\nWithin this context, the Board of Directors had reviewed the compensation practices for similar functions at competitor airline companies internationally and taken into account the compensation paid to Mr. Benjamin Smith in respect of his duties at Air Canada, as well as his residency of Canada which required him to relocate to France.\n\nIt is specified that, to determine the elements of compensation for the Chief Executive O/fficer, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors referred to a sample of compensation in place in comparable international groups.",

        "page_content": "The compensation structure set by the Board of Directors in August/uni00A02018 remained unchanged for the 2019 to 2022 financial years. It is also within this framework that the compensation policy has been set for the 2023 financial year. It is however stipulated that, in 2022, the two long-term incentive plans (one payable in cash and the other payable in shares) were replaced by a single long-term incentive plan (payable in shares) without changing the overall amount of the long-term compensation for the Chief Executive O/fficer. This adaptation was aimed at simplifying the plans in place and making them consistent with the market practices and reinforcing the link with shareholders' interests based on the Group's strategic goals.\n\nDuring the Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A024, 2022, the resolution on the fixed, variable and extraordinary elements of the total compensation and the benefits in kind of any nature paid during the 2021 financial year to the Chief Executive O/fficer (14 th /uni00A0 resolution) was 75.06% approved while the 2022 compensation policy for the Chief Executive O/fficer was approved at 74.71% (17 th /uni00A0resolution). These approval levels are explained, firstly, by the governance rules applicable to certain reference shareholders and, secondly, by the influence of some consulting firms over votes cast at the 2022 Shareholders' Meeting, their disapproval notably concerning the replacement of the two long-term incentive plans (one payable in cash and the other in shares) by a sole long-term incentive plan (payable in shares).\n\nDuring its meeting of February/uni00A016, 2023, as proposed by the Remuneration Committee, the Board of Directors set the compensation structure for the Chief Executive Officer of Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM in respect of the 2023 financial year. This compensation structure is composed of an amount of fixed compensation representing 22.5% of Mr. Benjamin Smith's total compensation, annual variable compensation representing 27.5% of his total compensation and long-term variable compensation representing 50% of his total compensation. More than 75% of Mr. Benjamin Smith's total annual compensation thus depends on the achievement of demanding performance conditions.\n\nThe performance criteria linked to the variable compensation within the framework of the 2023 compensation were set pursuant to the Board resolutions of February/uni00A016, 2023. During its meeting of March/uni00A016, 2023, the Board of Directors specified the levels of performance and the achievement percentages for these criteria.\n\nIt is specified that, pursuant to the European Commission's decision of April/uni00A05, 2021 on case No./uni00A0SA.59913/uni00A0relating to the recapitalization of Air/uni00A0France and Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, an amount of variable compensation will be granted to the Chief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM in respect of the 2023 financial year subject to the repayment of at least 75% of the recapitalization measures. In this regard, on February/uni00A016, 2023, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM announced that the repayment of at least 75% of the State Aid should take place in March, 2023.\n\n## Structure of the compensation for the Chief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM in respect of the 2023 financial year\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (1) 122% of the fixed compensation on achievement of the targets potentially rising to 150% should the targets be exceeded.\n- (2) A long-term incentive plan conferring the right to the granting of performance units corresponding to an amount of \u20ac2/uni00A0million.\n- (3)  Amount of \u20ac900,000.\n\n## -Annual compensation (fixed and variable)\n\n## Description of the annual fixed and variable elements\n\nThe Chief Executive O/fficer will continue to benefit from annual gross fixed compensation of \u20ac900,000 and annual gross variable compensation potentially varying between 0% and 122% of the annual gross fixed compensation at targets partially achieved (calculated on a linear basis), and potentially reaching a maximum of 150% in the event the targets are exceeded (calculated on a linear basis). It is stipulated that the structure of the annual fixed and variable compensation has been unchanged since 2019.\n\nThe performance criteria which were set by the Board of Directors during its meeting of February/uni00A016, 2023, are 60% quantitative\n\ncriteria linked to the Group's financial performance and targets, and 40% qualitative criteria linked to non-financial targets (but measurable, with the exception of the 'Individual & Leadership Performance' criterion which is subject to qualitative evaluation). The Board of Directors has set ambitious levels of performance and achievement percentages for the 2023 financial year.\n\nThe quantitative criteria linked to performance and the Group's financial targets set by the Board of Directors during its meeting of March/uni00A016, 2023 were established in a context of the Group's exit from the crisis linked to the Covid-19 pandemic and are an integral part of an ambitious business redevelopment strategy for the Group.",

Accordingly, a new long-term incentive plan applicable to the Chief Executive O/fficer and to a number of the Group's other managers and employees has been established pursuant to the resolutions of the Board of Directors of February/uni00A016, 2022. During its meeting of February/uni00A016, 2023, the Board of Directors decided to establish a long-term incentive plan appliable to the Chief Executive O/fficer with the same characteristics as the long-term incentive plan established in 2022. This decision is aimed at the stability of the conditions applicable to the compensation of the Chief Executive O/fficer and consistency with market practices.\n\nIn respect of this plan, the Chief Executive O/fficer is thus granted performance units on an annual basis corresponding to an amount of \u20ac2/uni00A0million, payable in shares at the end of a three-year vesting period following the grant, subject to the attainment of specific performance conditions, evaluated over the whole of this period, and with a maximum of 100% over three years. The payment of the performance units is also subject to a three-year presence condition, except in the event of death or disability (without performance conditions), or retirement departure or in some cases of forced termination (the performance conditions remaining applicable). It is specified that one performance unit will confer the right to one Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM share.",

The payment of these performance units (subject to performance and presence conditions) is made in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM shares (one performance unit conferring the right to one share). The Board of Directors reserves the option, instead of the granting of units, to grant an equivalent number of performance shares with the same performance and presence conditions.\n\nAt its meeting of February/uni00A016, 2023, the Board of Directors thus set demanding performance conditions for the evaluation, as necessary, of the Chief Executive O/fficer's long-term performance for the eventual granting of this long-term variable compensation as described below.

Payment of these performance units, subject to performance and presence conditions, will be made in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM shares (one performance unit conferring the right to one share).\n\nIt is stipulated that the Chief Executive O/fficer has not used and has given a formal undertaking not to use risk hedging transactions within the framework of this plan until payment of the performance units.\n\n## d) 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 long-term incentive plans\n\nIn 2023, the Chief Executive O/fficer will continue to benefit from the long-term incentive plans granted in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 (granted subject to the condition precedent of the repayment of at least 75% of the State Aid) with the option to defer payment of these performance units for a maximum of three years (already exercised for the 2018 plan, the 2019 plans and the 2020 'phantom shares' plan).\n\nFor more details on the long-term incentive plans, see section 2.5.2.2 b of the 2022 Universal Registration Document.\n\n## e) Severance payment and benefits in kind\n\nThe Chief Executive O/fficer will continue to benefit from the severance payment granted by the Board of Directors in its meeting of August/uni00A016, 2018, as approved by the Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A028, 2019.\n\nDuring its meeting of August/uni00A016, 2018, the Board of Directors authorized the granting to the Chief Executive O/fficer of a severance payment in some instances of forced termination, including dismissal, non-renewal of his mandate as Chief Executive Officer or resignation following a change of control (other than in relation to a gross misconduct). It is specified that the instance of forced termination enabling the implementation of this severance pay excludes any situation of serious misconduct on the part of the Chief Executive O/fficer.\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Code, the basis of the severance payment is equivalent to two years of his annual fixed and variable compensation (based on specific calculation methods referring, as applicable, to the target variable in the event of a termination during the first 24/uni00A0months).\n\nA coe/fficient (between 0 and 100% inclusive) will be applied to the basis of the severance payment based on the performance of the interested party with reference to the level of the achievement of the performance criteria relating to the annual variable component of his compensation over the two last financial years of his mandate (or since his appointment, in the event of termination during the first 24/uni00A0months). The Board of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM will be responsible for evaluating the achievement of these performance criteria.\n\nThe Chief Executive O/fficer will also benefit from the usual benefits in kind (chau/ffeur-driven company car, supplementary pension scheme benefiting all Group employees, supplementary health insurance and disability coverage, provision of free airline tickets, Group CEO civil liability insurance - D&O) and benefits consistent with the policy applied within the Group for senior executive expatriation and mobility.\n\n## f) Others\n\nThe Chief Executive O/fficer will not benefit from an employment contract, nor from a top-up pension scheme, non-compete indemnity, stock options or free shares.",

Furthermore, medium-term targets of a minimum of 40% women within the Group Executive Committee by 2030 and 40% women within the top 10% of the positions with the highest level of responsibility (ground sta/ff, representing at Air/uni00A0France the Non-Management (NHC),\n\n## 2.6.2/emspace CEO  Committee\n\nThe CEO Committee is chaired by Mr. Benjamin Smith, Chief Executive Officer of Air France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, and has three other members : Ms. Anne Rigail (Chief Executive O/fficer of Air France), Ms. Marjan Rintel (President & Chief Executive O/fficer of KLM) and Mr. Steven Zaat, Chief Financial O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM.\n\nN3,/uni00A0N2 and N1.2/uni00A0populations and the equivalent positions within KLM) also by 2030 have been set by the Board of Directors, it being understood that the Group's French entities will attain their diversity targets in the respect of the time limits set by French legislation.\n\nConcretely, in the event of the recruitment and/or appointment of new members, and candidates with equal skills, expertise and management qualities, preference is given to female candidates. An action plan has been deployed to accelerate the taking into account of female profiles at all levels of management. During its meeting of February/uni00A016, 2023, the Board of Directors was informed of the results achieved during the 2022 financial year. This information is detailed in section/uni00A04.2.4 'Diversity, equity and inclusion'.\n\nThe CEO Committee defines the strategic direction of all of the Group's airlines and operational entities.\n\n## 2.7/emspace SHARE CAPITAL AND SHAREHOLDER STRUCTURE\n\n## 2.7.1/emspace  Share  capital\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2022, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM share capital comprised 2,570,536,136/uni00A0fully paid-up shares with a nominal value of one euro, held in registered or bearer form according to shareholder preference. Until April/uni00A02, 2016, each share had one voting right attached.

        "page_content": "Share capital and shareholder structure\n\nThese measures were authorized by the European Commission on April/uni00A05, 2021, as State Aid.\n\nIn this context, on April/uni00A013, 2021, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM announced the launch of a capital increase without shareholders' preferential subscription rights by way of a public offering and with a priority subscription period for shareholders, for a gross amount (including issue premium) of \u20ac900,660,867.04/uni00A0which could, in the event of the exercise in full of the increase option, be increased to a maximum gross amount (including issue premium) of \u20ac1,035,759,995.16. The capital increase, decided in accordance with the nineteenth resolution of the Company's Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A026, 2020, was the subject of a prospectus approved by the Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers on April/uni00A013, 2021 under number 21-0270. The subscription period for the capital increase closed on April/uni00A016, 2021.\n\nOn April/uni00A019, 2021, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM announced the final results of the capital increase, namely 213,999,999/uni00A0new shares issued at a unit price of \u20ac4.84, i.e. a total of around \u20ac1,036/uni00A0million (after the exercise in full of the increase option). The settlement-delivery of the newly-issued shares took place on April/uni00A022, 2021.\n\n## Capital increase during the financial year ended December 31, 2022\n\nSubsequently, on May/uni00A024, 2022, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM announced the launch of a capital increase with maintained preferential subscription rights ('DFS') to raise a gross amount of \u20ac2.256/uni00A0billion through the issuance of 1,928/uni00A0million new Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM shares. This transaction, aimed at reinforcing the Company's equity and balance sheet, followed the announcement of new recapitalization measures on February/uni00A017, 2022. The capital increase, decided pursuant to the Combined Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A026, 2021 was the subject of a prospectus filed with the AMF under number D./uni00A0 22-0236-A01 on May/uni00A023, 2022. The trading period for the preferential subscription rights (DFS) was between May/uni00A025, 2022 and June/uni00A07, 2022 and the subscription period for the capital increase closed on June/uni00A09, 2022.\n\nOn June/uni00A014, 2022, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM announced the final results of the capital increase, namely 1,928/uni00A0million new shares at a unit subscription price of \u20ac1,17, representing \u20ac2.256/uni00A0billion. The capital increase attracted strong demand from both the existing shareholders and new investors.\n\nOn June/uni00A09, 2022 at the end of the subscription period, the total demand stood at approaching \u20ac2.240/uni00A0million shares, i.e. close to \u20ac2.261/uni00A0billion. The transaction was thus oversubscribed with a subscription rate of around 116%:\n\n- > 1,831,278,510/uni00A0new shares were subscribed on an irreducible basis (\u00e0 titre irr\u00e9ductible), representing approximately 95% of the new shares to be issued;\n- > orders submitted on a reducible basis (\u00e0 titre r\u00e9ductible) represented 409,004,428/uni00A0new shares and were therefore only partially allocated for a number of 96,623,592/uni00A0new shares.\n\nThe gross proceeds of the capital increase, including the issue premium, amounted to \u20ac2,256/uni00A0million (of which \u20ac1,611/uni00A0million subscribed in cash) corresponding to the issuance of 1,928/uni00A0million new shares (the 'New Shares') at a unit subscription price of \u20ac1.17/uni00A0per share.\n\n## Impact of the capital increase on the breakdown of the share capital\n\nFollowing the settlement and delivery for the capital increase, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's share capital amounts to 2,570,536,136/uni00A0shares, each with a nominal value of one euro.\n\n## Rationale for the capital increase\n\nAs announced on February/uni00A017 and detailed in the press release dated May/uni00A024, 2022, this transaction concerned the implementation of new recapitalization measures, following the capital increase realized in 2021.\n\n- > The net proceeds of the issue were used to redeem the deeply subordinated bonds issued in April/uni00A02021 and held by the French State, as well as to strengthen the Company's equity. As announced during its full-year results presentation on February/uni00A017, 2022, the Company wishes to free itself from the conditions set by the European Commission's Covid-19 temporary framework and thus allocated around \u20ac1.7/uni00A0billion to the repayment of the 'Covid-19 recapitalization aid' granted in the form of undated deeply subordinated notes (the 'TSS \u00c9tat') issued in April/uni00A02021, through o/ffset and repayment. The remainder (about \u20ac0.6/uni00A0billion) enabled a reduction in net debt.\n- > This operation marks a significant step in the execution of the equity and quasi-equity issuance program for a maximum of \u20ac4/uni00A0billion destined to strengthen the balance sheet, as announced on February/uni00A017, 2022. In the context of the Company's expected performance recovery, with a 7% to 8% operating margin targeted by 2024, the Company is confident that no further dilutive measures will be necessary. The Company's sound financial liquidity position and promising outlook will allow Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM to repay additional outstanding State Aid, which will also contribute to further improving the financing costs of the Company.\n\n## Subscription by the main shareholders and partners\n\nThe French State, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's largest shareholder (with 28.6% of the Company's share capital and 28.2% of the theoretical voting rights), participated on an irreducible basis to the full extent of its DPS rights, corresponding to a subscription to 551,404,728/uni00A0New Shares. Its shareholding after the completion of the capital increase remains unchanged. This subscription was carried out by way of o/ffsetting a portion of the deeply subordinated notes (TSS \u00c9tat) issued in April/uni00A02021.\n\nThe Dutch State participated on an irreducible basis to the full extent of its DPS rights, corresponding to a subscription to 180,000,000/uni00A0New Shares. Its shareholding after the completion of the capital increase remains unchanged.",

        "page_content": "CMA CGM, the exclusive strategic partner in the cargo business, became a new reference shareholder, with a total shareholding amounting to 231,348,252/uni00A0New Shares, subscribed on an irreducible basis (via the exercise of the preferential subscription rights acquired from China Eastern Airlines, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and the FCPE employee mutual funds as well as in the market) corresponding to 9.0% of the Company's share capital after the rights Issue.\n\nChina Eastern Airlines/thinspace (1) and Delta Air Lines participated in the capital increase on a cash-neutral basis, for an aggregate amount of approximately \u20ac110.7/uni00A0million by subscribing to a respective 58,763,343 and 35,873,772/uni00A0New Shares by using the net proceeds from selling a portion of their preferential subscription rights to CMA CGM. Their respective shareholdings thus stood at 4.7% and 2.9% of the Company's share capital after the capital increase.\n\nThe FCPEs ('Fond Commun de Placement Entreprise') participated in the capital increase on a cash-neutral basis through the sale of a portion of their preferential subscription rights to the benefit of CMA CGM, in a proportion allowing them to partially finance the exercise of the balance of their DPS rights by using the net proceeds of this sale.\n\nThe SPAAK (Stichting Piloten Aandelen Air France - KLM) participated in the capital increase on a cash-neutral basis by subscribing to new shares through the sale of a portion of its DPS rights.\n\n## Lock-up commitments\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM agreed to a lock-up period starting on the signature date of the Underwriting Agreement and expiring 180/uni00A0calendar days following the settlement-delivery date of the New Shares, subject to certain exceptions.\n\nThe French State, the Dutch State, China Eastern Airlines and Delta Air Lines/thinspace (2) entered into a lock-up agreement as of the approval of the Prospectus by the French Financial Market Authority (Autorit\u00e9 des Marches Financiers - 'AMF') and until the expiry of a period of 90/uni00A0calendar days following the date of settlement-delivery of the New Shares, subject to certain exceptions.\n\nCMA CGM agreed with the Company a lock-up commitment as from the settlement-delivery of the New Shares until the expiry of a three-year period following this date, it being specified that CMA CGM may sell a maximum of 50% of the shares acquired within the context of the capital increase during an additional three-year period. This lock-up commitment will automatically end in the event that the commercial cooperation agreement is terminated.\n\nIn addition, CMA CGM committed to a 10-year period during which it will not acquire or subscribe to any shares issued by the Company, unless such an acquisition does not lead to an increase of its equity interest in the share capital of the Company, subject to certain exceptions. The undertaking specifies that, at\n\nthe end of a period of five years as of the settlement-delivery of the New Shares, the Board of Directors of the Company may modify this undertaking in order to allow CMA CGM to increase its shareholding in the Company.\n\n## Authorizations granted to the Board of Directors to increase the share capital\n\nTo give the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group the flexibility and agility required to implement additional capital-strengthening measures, which are essential for the continuation of the Group's activities in the current context of public health crisis, while taking into account the diversity of interests and expectations of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's shareholders, whose shareholdings could be significantly diluted if they do not subscribe to the additional measures envisaged, a number of financial resolutions were adopted by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A026, 2021 (resolutions 20/uni00A0to 35).\n\nFurthermore, during the Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A024, 2022 (resolution 19), the nominal cap of \u20ac129/uni00A0million, provided for in the 23 rd /uni00A0resolution of the Combined Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A026, 2021, was increased to \u20ac200/uni00A0million, without being charged to the nominal cap for the capital increase indicated in the 22 nd /uni00A0 resolution of the Combined Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A026, 2021.\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2022, the Company had used (i)/uni00A0the authorization for a capital increase (outside the context of a public tender o/ffer) with maintained preferential subscription rights for shareholders within the limit of a nominal amount of \u20ac1,930/uni00A0million, authorized in respect of the 20 th /uni00A0resolution of the Combined Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A026, 2021 and (ii)/uni00A0the authorization (outside the context of a public tender o/ffer) to issue securities conferring access to the capital via an o/ffering to qualified investors, within the limit of a nominal amount of \u20ac200/uni00A0million, authorized in respect of the 23 rd /uni00A0 resolution of the Combined Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A026, 2021 as amended by the 19 th /uni00A0 resolution of the Shareholders' Meeting of May/uni00A024, 2022, in the proportions detailed hereinafter. The other authorizations had not been used.\n\nThese authorizations enable the Board of Directors, in compliance with the legal and regulatory provisions and under certain conditions, to increase the capital of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM by various means (issuance of shares and/or securities conferring access to the capital and/or giving the right to the allocation of debt securities, with or without shareholders' preferential subscription rights, as the case may be, with or without a priority subscription period, as the case may be, during or outside the period of a public o/ffering with specific caps) and depending on the market opportunities at the time of the issue and the financing needs of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, in particular with regard to the additional measures envisaged to strengthen the equity capital.

Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM issued bonds convertible and/or exchangeable into new or existing shares (OCEANEs), maturing in 2026, for an amount of \u20ac500/uni00A0million, initially representing 27,901,785/uni00A0underlying shares. The initial conversion ratio was one share for one OCEANE. However, pursuant to the legal and regulatory provisions, the conversion ratio was adjusted following the realization of the capital increase with maintained preferential subscription rights of June/uni00A014, 2022 (see edition No.72/uni00A0of the Bulletin des Annonces L\u00e9gales Obligatoires dated June/uni00A017, 2022) such that, since June/uni00A016, 2022 the new parity has been 1.783/uni00A0Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM shares for one OCEANE.\n\nThe nominal unit value of the bonds is \u20ac17.92. The bonds bear a coupon of 0.125%, payable annually in arrears on March/uni00A025/uni00A0of each year.\n\nThe conversation period runs from May/uni00A04, 2019 until the seventh business day preceding the early redemption date or the maturity date.\n\nRedemption at par, plus the corresponding accrued interest may be requested by the bond holders as of March/uni00A025, 2024.\n\nThe bonds may be the subject of early redemption at the Company's discretion, subject to certain conditions, and at the discretion of the bond holders, in particular in the event of a change of control for the Company (as this expression is defined in the terms and conditions for the bonds).\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has had the option to impose the early redemption in cash of these securities since April/uni00A015, 2022 if the arithmetic average, calculated over any period of ten consecutive trading days chosen by the Company falling within the 20/uni00A0day period preceding the publication of the early redemption notice, of the daily products of the average weighted Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM share prices recorded on Euronext Paris on each trading day and the conversion/exchange ratio in e/ffect on this same day exceeds 130% of the nominal value of the bonds.\n\n## Issue of undated deeply subordinated unsecured bonds convertible into new shares and/or exchangeable for existing shares in the nominal amount of \u20ac305.3/uni00A0million\n\nOn November/uni00A016, 2022, the Company issued undated deeply subordinated unsecured bonds convertible into new shares and/ or exchangeable for existing shares (the 'Hybrid Convertible Bonds'), for a nominal amount of \u20ac305.3/uni00A0million representing around 200/uni00A0million underlying shares by way of a placement limited to qualified investors (the 'O/ffering').\n\nThe net proceeds of the O/ffering were allocated in full to the redemption of the deeply subordinated bonds held by the French State (see above), issued in April/uni00A02021. The Hybrid Convertible Bonds will be accounted as quasi-equity under IFRS.\n\nThe Hybrid Convertible Bonds were issued at par and have a nominal value per Hybrid Convertible Bond of \u20ac100,000/uni00A0with a conversion/exchange premium of 22.5% over the Company's reference share price, i.e. \u20ac1.2464 (corresponding to the Company's average volume-weighted share price on the Euronext Paris regulated market ('Euronext Paris') on November/uni00A016, 2022).\n\nFrom the issue date until November/uni00A023, 2025 (exclusive), the Hybrid Convertible Bonds will bear interest at a nominal annual rate of 6.5% payable quarterly in arrears on November/uni00A023, February/uni00A023, May/uni00A023 and August/uni00A023/uni00A0of each year (or the next business day if any of these dates are not business days) (each, an 'Interest Payment Date'), and for the first time on February/uni00A023, 2023, subject to any interest payment suspension by the Company.\n\nFrom November/uni00A023, 2025, the Hybrid Convertible Bonds will bear interest at a rate equal to 1,300/uni00A0basis points above the applicable 3/uni00A0year-Mid-swap Rate in Euro as a reference rate. The reference rate will be subject to a reset every three years thereafter. Interest will be payable quarterly in arrears on each Interest Payment Date and, as the case may be, for the first time on February/uni00A023, 2026, subject to any interest payment suspension.\n\nIn the event of a change of control, the annual rate for the fixed coupon or the reset reference rate coupon, as the case may be, will be increased by 500/uni00A0basis points.\n\nOn each Interest Payment Date, the Company may decide, subject to certain conditions, to suspend payment of interest in respect of the Hybrid Convertible Bonds for the relevant interest period, subject to having notified the holders of the Hybrid Convertible Bonds at least 15/uni00A0business days prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date. All interest in respect of the Hybrid Convertible Bonds that is not paid at an optional Interest Payment Date will constitute 'Deferred Interest'. Any amount of Deferred Interest will bear interest (to the full extent permitted by law) from the interest payment suspension date for any period exceeding 12/uni00A0months at the interest rate applicable to the Hybrid Convertible Bonds over the relevant period. The amount of accrued interest (the 'Additional Interest') in respect of Deferred Interest will become due and payable in the same manner as Deferred Interest. Deferred Interest (as well as the corresponding amount of Additional Interest) may be paid in full or in part at any time at the Company's discretion, but all Deferred Interest (as well as the corresponding amount of Additional Interest) in respect of all the Hybrid Convertible Bonds will become payable in full in specific cases, including if the Company decides to pay a dividend or an interim dividend or on the repurchase of any equity securities or upon redemption of all the outstanding Bonds.",

This authorization will be proposed again at the 2023 annual Shareholders' Meeting, following the full exit of the Covid-19 recapitalization state aid as well as its related restrictions on April 19, 2023.\n\nDuring the 2022 financial year, the Group neither purchased nor sold Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM shares within the framework of these authorizations.\n\nWithin the framework of the collective labor agreement reached in August/uni00A02015 between KLM and the VNV pilots' union, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and KLM signed an agreement on December/uni00A08, 2016 with the VNV and an independent foundation established by the VNV for KLM pilots. Under this agreement, and in consideration for the gains resulting from the August/uni00A02015 agreement, on December/uni00A012, 2016 KLM financed the acquisition by the foundation of 3/uni00A0million Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM treasury shares at the market price.\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2022, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM held 1,208,005/uni00A0of its own shares, i.e. 0.05% of the share capital, of which 1,116,420/uni00A0shares held by KLM in respect of its various stock option plans.

(Delta) and China Eastern Airlines (CEA).\n\nOn July/uni00A027, 2017, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM had announced, firstly, the planned creation of a joint-venture between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta and Virgin Atlantic and, secondly, the intensification of its partnership with CEA. These two commercial alliances were consolidated, in 2017, by equity links: on October/uni00A03, 2017, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and China Eastern each acquired equity interests in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM within the framework of reserved capital increases authorized by the Combined Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of September/uni00A04, 2017 for\n\na total of \u20ac751/uni00A0million.

In addition, following the expiry of the above-mentioned five-year lock-up undertaking, in the event of a trade sale of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM shares to a third party via an over-the-counter transaction, both CEA and Delta have undertaken to first give Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM the option of purchasing these shares, at the same pricing conditions.\n\nOn October/uni00A03, 2017, Eastern Airlines Industry Investment (Luxembourg) Company Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CEA Global Holdings (Hong Kong) Limited, and Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. both subscribed in cash to capital increases without shareholders' preferential subscription rights, each for a total (including issue premium) of \u20ac375,274,100, at a subscription price of \u20ac10/uni00A0per share (including issue premium). The acquisition of these shareholdings was accompanied by the appointment of two Board directors to the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors designated, firstly, by China Eastern Airlines and, secondly, by Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc.\n\nLastly, on March/uni00A014 and May/uni00A015, 2018, within the framework of the implementation of the future single joint-venture between Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta and Virgin Atlantic, and following authorization by the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors (see section/uni00A02.3.1 'Activities and functioning of the Board of Directors') the following agreements were signed:\n\n- > a Share Purchase Agreement (the 'SPA') between Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Finance/uni00A0SAS and Virgin Investments Limited, allowing Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, through its 100%-owned subsidiary Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Finance/uni00A0SAS, to purchase a 31% equity interest in Virgin Atlantic for \u00a3220.1/uni00A0million.

This regulatory step enabled the airlines to move forward with their transatlantic partnership.\n\nIn parallel, the partners finalized the expanded joint-venture's governance, agreeing on simplified decision-making processes enabling the joint-venture to deliver its full synergy potential. Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and Virgin thus finally considered that Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's acquisition of an equity interest in Virgin Atlantic was no longer necessary and negotiated an agreement whereby Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM would not acquire an equity interest in Virgin Atlantic with no impact on Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's position",

The Virgin Group was to retain its 51% majority shareholding in the capital of Virgin Atlantic while Delta was to retain the remaining 49%. This partnership is considered to be key to reinforcing the Group's leadership position between Europe and North America, and will o/ffer customers a seamless travel experience across the Atlantic.\n\nAs a result, on October/uni00A030, 2019, the Board of Directors mandated the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM management to finalize the discussions and negotiate amendments to the relevant agreements so as to no longer proceed with the planned investment in a 31% equity interest in Virgin Atlantic. This decision led to the following amendments to the agreements, whose signature had been authorized by the Board meetings of March/uni00A014 and May/uni00A015, 2018:\n\n- > termination of the Share Purchase Agreement ('SPA') for the acquisition of a 31% equity interest in Virgin Atlantic, and termination of agreements ancillary to the SPA;\n- > amendment and updating of the joint-venture Agreement to reflect the termination of the SPA. This agreement was signed on January/uni00A030, 2020, e/ffective as from January/uni00A01, 2020;\n- > amendment (reflecting the termination of the SPA) and the updating of the Implementation Agreement. This agreement was signed on January/uni00A09, 2020 e/ffective as from January/uni00A01, 2020;\n- > signature of the agreement between Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Delta and Virgin Group (signed and e/ffective as from January/uni00A030, 2020) giving Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, subject to certain conditions, the right to acquire Virgin Atlantic Limited shares in the event of sale by Virgin Group of Virgin Atlantic Limited shares to a third party.\n\nThe overall joint-venture between Air/uni00A0France, KLM, Delta and Virgin Atlantic was launched in early February/uni00A02020, o/ffering customers a wider choice of routes and loyalty options for travel between Europe, the United Kingdom and North America.\n\nWithin the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, restrictive border regulations and constantly-changing health measures led to a drastic reduction in airline capacity and created a highly uncertain environment regarding the management of networks by joint-venture partners. In view of the impact on the implementation of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's existing joint-ventures, in December/uni00A02020, the partners reviewed the financial conditions of their agreements and amended the provisions relating to the financial 'settlement' mechanisms provided in the Group's joint-venture agreements signed, on one hand, with Delta and Virgin Atlantic Airways Limited and, on the other, with CEA.\n\nOn December/uni00A04, 2020, pursuant to the provisions of Article L./uni00A0225-38/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors thus authorized the amendment of the provisions concerning the financial settlement mechanism (to share the revenues and costs generated by the joint-venture) in the Blue Skies joint-venture agreement (entered into on May/uni00A015, 2018 and amended in October/uni00A02019) for the calendar year 2020. In this respect, the parties waive all rights they may have with respect to\n\nthe amounts due to them under the joint-venture agreement for the calendar year 2020, and agree to waive them permanently. This waiver avoids uncertain and potentially material financial exposure for all the partners given the context linked to the public health crisis. The duration of this waiver will be able to be extended in 2021 by mutual agreement of the parties based on the duration of the impacts on the joint-venture operations of the Covid-19 pandemic. The other provisions of the joint-venture agreement remain unchanged.\n\nOn December/uni00A04, 2020, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors also authorized the suspension of the provisions concerning the financial settlement mechanism (to share the revenues generated by the joint-venture) in the joint-venture agreement entered into with CEA on November/uni00A026, 2018. In this respect, the parties agree to waive all payments under the joint-venture agreement as of February/uni00A01, 2020 for a period to be mutually agreed between the parties depending on the duration of the e/ffects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the joint-venture. This waiver avoids uncertain and potentially material financial exposure for either party given the context linked to the public health crisis. The other provisions of the joint-venture agreement remain unchanged.\n\nLastly, within the framework of the Group's recapitalization plan announced on April/uni00A06, 2021, on June/uni00A023, 2021, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM entered into an agreement with China Eastern Airlines aimed at accelerating their e/fforts to deepen and expand the existing and future cooperation, and further reinforce their partnership for air transport services between China and Europe. This agreement enables the Group to reinforce its commercial cooperation with China Eastern Airlines and its position in the Chinese market (see section/uni00A02.3.1 'Activities and functioning of the Board of Directors'; 'Agreements referred to in Article L./uni00A0225-38/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce'). China Eastern Airlines also subscribed to the Company's capital increase realized on April/uni00A019, 2021 and, following this participation, held 9.6% of the Company's share capital.\n\nChina Eastern Airlines and Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. also participated in the capital increase with maintained preferential subscription rights realized on June/uni00A014, 2022 on a cash-neutral basis, for an aggregate amount of approximately \u20ac110.7/uni00A0million, by subscribing to a respective 58,763,343 and 35,873,772/uni00A0new shares by using the net proceeds from selling part of their DPS Rights to CMA CGM (see hereinafter). This took their respective shareholdings to 4.7% and 2.9% of the Company's share capital.\n\n## Conclusion of a major long-term strategic partnership in air cargo with CMA CGM on May/uni00A018, 2022\n\nIn a press release dated May/uni00A018, 2022, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and CMA CGM Groups announced the signature of a long-term strategic partnership in the air cargo sector. This exclusive partnership will enable the two groups to pool their cargo networks, all-cargo aircraft capacities and dedicated services, to build an ever-more competitive o/ffer thanks to the unparalleled expertise and global presence of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and CMA CGM.",

Its members were renewed in March/uni00A02023.\n\n## 2.7.7/emspace Legal and statutory investment thresholds\n\nPursuant to the option provided in Article L./uni00A0233-7/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce (French Code of Commerce), Article 13/uni00A0of the Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Articles of Incorporation stipulates that any private individual or corporate body, acting alone or in concert, acquiring directly or indirectly at least 0.5% of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's capital or voting rights or any multiple thereof, must notify Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM by registered mail with acknowledgement of receipt no later than four stock market trading days as of the date on which this threshold is crossed. The declaration must include all the information required to be submitted to the French Financial Market Authority (Autorit\u00e9 des March\u00e9s Financiers) in the event of the crossing of a legal threshold, as well the information referred to in Article 10/uni00A0of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Articles of Incorporation.\n\nNotice must again be given under the same conditions each time a further 0.5% of the capital or voting rights threshold is crossed, up to 50%.\n\nThese declarations are made in the event of the crossing of the thresholds mentioned above, involving either an increase or a reduction in the shareholding.\n\nTo determine these thresholds, the shares and voting rights defined by the provisions of Article L./uni00A0233-9/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce and those of the relevant AMF General Regulation are assimilated in the share capital and voting rights.\n\nIn the event of failure to comply with this notification obligation and at the request of one or more shareholders holding at least 0.5% of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM capital or voting rights, the shares exceeding the reporting thresholds will be stripped of their voting rights at all Shareholders' Meetings for a period of two years following compliance with the notification procedures.\n\nFurthermore, any shareholder, whether acting alone or in concert, acquiring more than 5% of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's share capital or voting rights is required to transfer these securities to registered form within the legal limit of no more than four stock market trading days as of the date on which the threshold is crossed (Article 9.2/uni00A0of the Articles of Incorporation).\n\nThe above requirements under the Articles of Incorporation do not prejudice the legal obligation to inform Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and the AMF within four stock market trading days following the crossing of the legal thresholds of 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 33 1/3 %, 50%, 66 2/3 %, 90% and 95% of the share capital or voting rights.\n\nFurthermore, if the 10%, 15%, 20% and 25% thresholds of the share capital or voting rights are exceeded by a person, the shareholder must notify Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and the AMF within five stock market trading days of the crossing of the capital and voting right thresholds of their intentions for the next six months. Any failure to comply with this declaration requirement will incur the sanctions set forth in Article L./uni00A0233-14/uni00A0of the Code de Commerce.",

This is because, over time, changes in the shareholder structure of an air transport company whose shares are listed for trading on a regulated market could jeopardize its operating license as an EU air transport carrier, the retention thereof being conditional on EU interests holding a majority of the shares and maintaining e/ffective control, or the tra/ffic rights held by the Company as a French air transport company, pursuant to bilateral international agreements concluded between France and other States outside the European Union.\n\n## Identification and monitoring of shareholders\n\nArticles 9 and following of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Articles of Incorporation set the conditions under which the Board of Directors can or must decide either to reduce the 5% threshold above which shares must be held in registered form to 10,000/uni00A0shares, or to require all shares in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM to be held in registered form. Thus, when the 40% share capital or voting right threshold has been passed by non-French shareholders, the Board of Directors can decide to reduce this 5% threshold to 10,000/uni00A0shares.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM publishes a notice informing the shareholders and the public that non-French shareholders as defined by Article 14/uni00A0of the Articles of Incorporation own, directly or indirectly, 45% of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's share capital or voting rights. If it appears\n\nthat non-French shareholders as defined by Article 14/uni00A0of the Articles of Incorporation represent, directly or indirectly, more than 45% of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's capital or voting rights on a long-term basis, the Board of Directors must decide to make it mandatory for all Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM shares to be held in registered form. Following an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation in 2014, within the meaning of Article 14/uni00A0of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's Articles of Incorporation, citizens of the European Union Member States and States party to the European Economic Area Agreement are considered to be French nationals.\n\nArticle 10/uni00A0of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Articles of Incorporation specifies the information that must be provided to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM by shareholders, whether they are private individuals or corporate bodies, subject to the obligation to hold their shares in registered form. This information includes the nationality of the shareholder. Article 11/uni00A0of the Articles of Incorporation specifies the conditions under which the Board of Directors may exercise its right to approve new shareholders.\n\n## Formal notice to sell and mandatory sale of shares\n\nArticle 14/uni00A0of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Articles of Incorporation stipulates the information that Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM must publish and circulate to inform the public that over 45% of the capital or voting rights is held by shareholders who are not of French nationality. Based on this threshold, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM will be entitled to launch procedures requiring the sale of shares in order to safeguard its nationality. Articles 15 and 16/uni00A0of the Articles of Incorporation, respectively, concern formal notices to sell and the mandatory sale of shares held in breach of regulations pursuant to the Code de l'Aviation Civile (French Civil Aviation Code) and the Code des Transports (French Transport Code). The terms for setting the sale price (market price) are foreseen by the Code des Transports.",

Several factors weigh on the outlook: monetary policy tightening inflation rate, increase and volatility compounded by di/fferent market dynamics in the key economic regions (North America, Europe, Asia) and international tensions described in the following risks.\n\nGrowth forecasts are highly variable and could impact the airline industry.\n\nThis risk could reduce international trade with a high probability of lower disposable income for airline industry customers.\n\n## Impact\n\nOne direct impact will be rising prices of basic goods and services, leading to lower purchasing power, putting external pressure on budgets and reducing demand for air transportation (both leisure and business purposes) and for air freight. Internal procurement could be faced with increasing pressure from external stakeholders and suppliers, ending up in contracts and rates renegotiation.\n\nThese factors could lead to higher operational and infrastructure costs, coupled with lower revenue and profitability.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nAgility to adapt our capacity, fleet, network and resources allocation; reviewing our prices and marketing o/ffer; strengthening procurement policies.\n\n## 3.1.1.2/emspace International tensions: closed borders, wars, terroris attacks, political and social unrest, health crises\u2026*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nMultiple geopolitical factors can a/ffect airspace access/closure and borders control: wars, including trade wars; crisis responses including to public health; protectionism and nationalism on the part of local authorities; terrorist attacks and regional instability.\n\nIn addition, a flagship carrier (its employees and stakeholders) representing nation, can also experience specific tensions with worldwide and local communities and authorities.\n\n## Impact\n\nAirspaces/borders closures could have a direct impact on airlines operations and networks. Operations may need to be stopped or modified, as a function of rapidly changing rules and conditions. That could create additional complexity for operations and processes to ensure safe operations leading to higher operating costs, a reduction in purchasing power and demand for travel, a risk on the overall perception and brand image.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nCapacity and network adjustments; internal coordination working group; crisis management; resources reallocation; lobbying for international (industry-wide) policies, standards and regulations; securing minimum service levels; securing internal processes and procedures for cash management (capex, costs: internal and external) in response to liquidity issues; internal tools and procedures, informing, securing and protecting employees in the event of an emergency. The Group has no coverage in place for air transportation operating losses but Air/uni00A0France and KLM are insured for the consequences of an attack on one of their aircrafts and have subscribed to war and assimilated risks insurance.\n\n## 3.1.1.3/emspace Risks relations to oil and fuel price evolution* Description of the risk\n\nThe fuel bill is one of the largest cost items for airlines, making oil price volatility a risk for the air transportation industry:\n\n- > a sharp increase in the oil price can have a very material negative impact on the profitability of airlines, particularly if the economic environment does not enable them to adjust their pricing strategies;\n- > similarly, a sharp decline in fuel prices is generally favorable for airline profitability. However, the way in which airlines pass on a sharp fall in the fuel price in their fares is a factor of significant uncertainty.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the Russo-Ukrainian war, fuel prices increased significantly, reaching a peak in early March/uni00A02022. Prices have remained highly volatile throughout the year, fluctuating in response to the announcements of various international sanctions. Fuel prices are still being supported by potential additional demand from China following the abandonment of the zero-Covid policy in place since the onset of the pandemic. However, the significant increase in infections as a result of these measures and the possibility of a recession are limiting the upward trend in prices.\n\nThe adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a key solution in the aviation sector's decarbonization road map and SAF mandates are gradually being introduced throughout Europe. SAF availability will become a critical risk in the coming years as it a/ffects the ability to reduce carbon emissions and meet sustainability goals.",

        "page_content": "## Impact\n\nFor the financial year ended December/uni00A031, 2022, the fuel bill amounted to \u20ac7,241/uni00A0million, up by 133.1% at constant currency compared to the previous year due, in particular to:\n\n- > the increase in activity in 2022 compared to 2021 following the ongoing tra/ffic recovery;\n- > the significant increase in fuel prices, supported by a strong demand and a shortage of supply due to the Russo-Ukrainian crisis.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has hedged its exposure to fuel price risk. As of March/uni00A024, 2023, the 2023 Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's fuel price exposure was of US$7,165/uni00A0million, based on futures prices at March/uni00A024, 2023 (US$76/uni00A0a barrel for 2023).\n\nBased on the forward curve at March/uni00A024, 2023:\n\n- > an increase of US$10/uni00A0per barrel over 2023 would give an average price of US$83/uni00A0per barrel and would lead to a US$458/uni00A0million increase in the fuel bill after hedging, i.e. a total fuel bill of US$7,844/uni00A0million for the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group in 2023;\n- > symmetrically, a fall of US$10/uni00A0per barrel over 2023 would give an average price of US$68/uni00A0per barrel and would lead to a US$414/uni00A0million reduction in the fuel bill after hedging, i.e. a total expense of US$6,972/uni00A0million in 2023.\n\nA potential lack of widespread SAF production and distribution from 2025 and 2030 and competition with other sectors working on their energy transition, could result in higher costs. In addition, a shortage of SAF can impact an airline's reputation and undermine customer confidence in its commitment to sustainability. The availability of SAF is therefore essential to support the growth of the aviation industry while reducing its impact on the environment.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nInsofar as possible, the Group seeks to protect itself from any further increases in oil prices, whilst remaining protected against downwards risks, and adapts its fares when necessary to reduce the impact of rising fuel prices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition to fare adjustments and permanent e/fforts to reduce fuel consumption, the Group has implemented a policy of systematically hedging the fuel price risk defined by the Risk Management Committee (the 'RMC'), presented to the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors of the Company.\n\nThe hedging strategy:\n\n- > sets the time span of the hedges;\n- > sets the target hedging ratios to be reached for the coming quarters;\n- > defines the instruments (swap, forwards or option based), eligible for hedging pursuant to the accounting standards in force.\n\nIn respect of the application of IFRS/uni00A09, hedging by component has been applied since January/uni00A01, 2018. Since the Group's fuel procurement is strongly correlated to the Jet Kerosene Cargoes CIF NWE Index, components specific to this fuel risk are used (Brent ICE, Gasoil ICE, Jet CIF NWE) to align the fuel hedging accounting and the Group's risk management policy more e/ffectively. Within the framework of a dynamic risk monitoring approach, the Group tracks the following indicators:\n\n- > maximum loss: capping the potential maximum loss; and\n- > maximum gain: value of the portfolio prompting its restructuring;\n- > value at Risk: enabling the measurement and monitoring of extreme risk scenarios. The level of this indicator is calculated and regularly analyzed, and may also trigger a restructuring of the portfolio.\n\nIn a context of high volatility and tension in the commodity market due to the geopolitical events of 2022, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has incorporated new hedging instruments on crack spreads so as to better cover the risk associated with the decoupling between indices reflecting the price of crude oil (Brent ICE) and indices reflecting the price of refined products (Gasoil ICE and Jet CIF NWE).\n\nThe revised fuel hedging policy, approved by the Board of Directors on February/uni00A017, 2021, remains in e/ffect. It is characterized by a rolling 12-month coverage representing 50% of annual consumption.\n\n| (in US$ million)                 | 2022   | 2023   | 2024   |\n|----------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Gross expenditure before hedging | 8,486  | 8,060  | 7,654  |\n| Hedge percentage                 | 73%    | 51%    | 4%     |\n| Gain/(loss) on hedging           | 969    | (54)   | (1)    |\n| Net expenditure after hedging    | 7,517  | 8,114  | 7,655  |",

In 2022, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM incorporated 0.6% of SAF into its fuel mix compared to a 0.01% global production. The Group manages a portfolio of consortia, projects and initiatives, leading to long-term o/fftake agreements with various optional conditions to secure the volumes of SAF to meet its 2030 ambition for a minimum of 10% of SAF, while contending with the uncertainties that still prevail in this domain.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM works with governments and industry organizations to increase the availability and stability of SAF supply chains. It was a founding member of ACT Aviation Climate Taskforce, which aims to accelerate the development of synthetic fuel, and at the European level, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has joined the RLCF alliance, bringing together the aviation and sea transportation sectors to jointly boost the production and supply of renewable and low-carbon fuels.\n\nFinally, the Group support the development of industry-wide standards and certification processes for SAF to increase confidence and reduce uncertainty to help this new industry to emerge. To ensure that the SAF projects selected directly have a minimal impact on the environment, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM maintain a strict due diligence on the sustainability of SAF sources, and this SAF is RSB or ISCC certified.\n\n## 3.1.1.4/emspace Competition and trends in the aeronautics maintenance market*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nCompetition and trends in the aeronautics maintenance market (Maintenance, Repair, overhaul also MRO):\n\n- > airframers, engine manufacturers and aircraft component manufacturers (OEMs) are rapidly expanding their after-sales services based on a long-term strategy, leveraging intellectual property and licensing mechanisms;\n- > more aggressive competition and pressure on the revenues of the maintenance business.\n\nOn the cost side:\n\n- > OEMs are leading an aggressive price escalation policy;\n- > the maintenance industry is facing labor scarcity, leading to the risk of a labor shortage and wages inflation;\n- > the Supply-chain is under significant pressure due to the lack of raw materials, piece parts and poor performance of OEMs.\n\nThis trend is accelerating, especially with the arrival of new aircraft (A220, A350, B787, E2-195/uni00A0etc.). Ultimately, if it were to\n\nresult in reduced competition in the aeronautics maintenance market, this trend could have a material adverse impact on airline maintenance costs.\n\n## Impact\n\nRevenues in the maintenance business represented 5% of the Group's revenues for the financial year ended December/uni00A031, 2022 versus 7% in 2021.\n\nThe margin in the maintenance business was 4.6% for the financial year ended December/uni00A031, 2022 versus 3.1% in 2021.\n\nDespite the consequences of Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM maintenance business has been able to maintain its market shares and profitability. Currently:\n\n- > The MRO market is showing healthy growth, forecast at an annual 2.8%/thinspace (1) * over the next decade;\n- > amongst the rapidly-growing markets, Asia is the main one with annual growth forecast at 3.8%. This market is a keypart of AFI KLM E&M's positioning thanks to a global portfolio and its regional industrial footprint;\n- > several airlines which are also customers of the Group for engineering and maintenance services have incurred losses due to the crisis or are under embargo. Although the risk of bankruptcy and the associated loss of business is now mostly behind us, the Group is still exposed to the risk of delayed payment of its receivables.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is working on a number of initiatives to limit the impacts inherent to this risk:\n\n- > close coordination through fleet renewal campaigns: procurement of licenses and the securing of industrial cooperation with OEMs as well as Original Aircraft Manufacturers;\n- > a partnership strategy leveraging on AFI KLM E&M's current strong market position and technology;\n- > repair solutions and the use of Used Serviceable Materials, thereby reducing the dependence on certain OEMs;\n- > supply-chain optimization leveraging on digital initiatives, worldwide industrial footprint and alternative sourcing;\n- > structural and anticipatory management of recruitment and labor availability;\n- > strict Receivables management. For airlines under financial administration, the Group continues its services subject to a payment commitment from the administrators and a payment plan of previous receivables.",

This, together with large scale consolidation, could cause a shift in the capacity/demand ratio. A brand and its product could also become outdated and commoditized, leading to a loss of business value, decrease in market share and the marginalization of a company.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nSupport for R&D and innovation initiatives; commercial and competitive partnerships; industry-wide consortiums; market screening; participating in governmental policies and industry standards.\n\n## 3.1.2/emspace Risks relating to the air transportation activity\n\n## 3.1.2.1/emspace Risks related to airline safety*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nAccident risk, with the possibility of damage to people and property, is inherent to air transportation which is why airline activities - passenger and cargo transportation, aircraft maintenance - are regulated by a series of European regulatory provisions directly applicable or for some of them transposed into French and Dutch law. Compliance with these regulations is governed by whether an airline is awarded the AOC (Air Operator Certificate).\n\nThe national Civil Aviation Authority carries out a series of checks on the proper application of these rules covering notably the:\n\n- > designation of a senior executive and managers responsible for the principal operational functions;\n- > appropriate organization of the flight, ground, cargo and maintenance operations;\n- > deployment of a Safety Management System (SMS); and\n- > implementation of a quality assurance system.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe materialization of this risk could have a significant negative impact on the Group's reputation and legal or financial consequences.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nFor the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, Flight Safety is the absolute priority. Safety is fundamental to maintaining the confidence of customers and sta/ff and is a day-to-day imperative which determines the Group's activity and the long-term future of the air transportation industry.\n\nAll of the Group's businesses are subject to numerous checks and certifications, and meet extremely strict standards and the highest level of regulations in the industry, both at European\n\nlevel with the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), and globally with the International Air Transport Association (IATA), whose IOSA Operational Safety Audit is a benchmark within the industry and leads to certification which must be renewed every two years.\n\nThe IOSA audits were carried out between November and December/uni00A02022. The Air/uni00A0France and KLM IOSA certifications will be renewed in early 2023 following the on-site audit.\n\nTo reach the highest possible level of Flight Safety, each airline updates and reinforces its SMS which defines in concrete terms the conditions for the implementation of its risk management system. The SMS, which is an integral part of the organization, procedures and corporate culture, is supported by a commitment made at the highest level of management, and by training and awareness-raising programs for all sta/ff (see section/uni00A04.4.1 'Operational safety for stakeholders').\n\nThis risk is covered by the aviation insurance policies.\n\nFollowing the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions, the Group's airlines had to manage the tra/ffic growth in 2022. All the anticipatory measures taken enabled the individual airlines to maintain their safety levels by adding some margin in particular for the summer period.\n\n## 3.1.2.2/emspace Risks related to the environment\n\n## Climate change and other environmental risks*\n\n## Risk description\n\nThe Group's activities are exposed to physical and transitional risks linked to climate change and these are a major concern for Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM. If the Group does not su/fficiently anticipate these impacts and does not engage in a voluntary process of adaptation to climate change and other environmental risks, its financial performance and reputation could be a/ffected.\n\n3",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Impact\n\n- > Physical : climate change is expected to continue with ramifications, like rising sea levels (already a/ffecting some coastal and island destinations) and the increased occurrence and intensity of adverse weather events such as storms, heat waves, fires and droughts. This is leading to an increase in operational disruption, such as flight cancellations or delays and diversions. Such events may have significant operational and financial repercussions for the Group's activity.\n- > Reputational : Air transportation has to contend with ever-increasing public pressure at both local and global level, focussing on the industry's impacts on the environment. It could affect Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's reputation among its customers and policy makers and could then directly influence the Group's ability to manage and develop its activities ('license to grow') in all regions of the world and over the long-term.\n- > Current and emerging regulation : The air transportation industry is subject to a significant level of environmental legislation governing areas such as the exposure of people to aircraft noise and local emissions, air quality, the treatment of waste product and regulations to ensure a reduction in the climate impact, including greenhouse gas emissions. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is subject to the European Union emission quota system (EU-ETS or European Union Emission Trading Scheme) as well as CORSIA, the global market-based measure applying to/uni00A0CO2 emissions from international aviation (please see 'carbon credit risk' for more information). A 1% SAF mandate was introduced in France in 2022, increasing to 1.5% in 2024, while the EU intend to introduce progressive SAF mandates from 2025 as part of its 'Fit for 55' package. An increasing number of countries are introducing ticket taxes, including France and The Netherlands. In France, under the Climate and Resilience Act, airline services are now banned on domestic routes under 2h30 (under certain conditions). In The Netherlands, a reduction of the number of flight movements at Schiphol Airport for noise reasons is currently under consideration. All such legislation could have a significant negative impact on the Group's operations and growth as a substantial increase in cost, especially when applied solely to a specific geographical area, could lead to competitive distortions between airlines. In future, the regulation might also take into account the 'non-CO2 climate impact of aviation', such as condensation trails and nitrogen oxide emissions, as well as introduce new biodiversity targets, which could a/ffect aviation activities.\n\n- > Market : Changes in consumer habits and behavior could include the use of videoconferencing, thereby reducing air travel in terms of frequency or distance, combining business and leisure travel, or preferences for services with a reduced carbon footprint, such as travel by train on shorter distances. Climate degradation at the local level will have repercussions for travel demand patterns and over time, tourists from temperate countries, who currently dominate international travel may adapt their travel plans to take advantage of new climate conditions closer to home.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group and its airlines are continuing their e/fforts to reduce their environmental footprint as part of a transparent and responsible approach to the challenges of global warming. The Group chose to have its 2030 CO2eq emission reduction target validated by the independent reference organization SBTi, with an ambition in line with the Paris Agreement's 'well below 2\u00b0C scenario'.\n\nThe Group's decarbonization strategy has the objective of net zero emissions by 2050. It stipulates the Group's priorities in terms of reducing its environmental impacts and means to achieve it like fleet modernization which contributes to reduce both fuel consumption and noise hindrance, improved fuel management and optimizing operational procedures such as eco-piloting, the accelerated introduction of sustainable aviation fuels and improving the use of combined modes of transport such as trains (also known as 'intermodality'). While implementing these measures, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM aims not to compromise the accessibility of air travel.\n\nIn addition, to addressing all the issues relating to the e/ffects of air transportation activity around airports, regular discussion meetings take place with residents' associations, local elected representatives and the public authorities.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM also plays a front-runner role in the airline industry, mobilizing the sector to accelerate its decarbonization commitments. At the 77 th /uni00A0IATA Annual General Meeting in 2021, IATA member airlines passed a resolution committing them to achieving Net Zero carbon emissions from their operations by 2050. In 2022, ICAO Member States adopted the same long-term aspirational goal (LTAG) of Net Zero carbon emissions by 2050 during its 41 st /uni00A0I CAO Assembly.\n\nTo adapt to the already-visible consequences of climate change such as more frequent extreme weather events, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has a policy in place to ensure safe operational and passenger handling conditions, and regularly conducts comprehensive risk analyses to optimize these arrangements. The operation of a network balanced between the di/fferent continents and the flexibility related to the composition of the fleet enable the financial consequences of these impacts to be minimized.",

        "page_content": "Finally, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM constantly analyses changing attitudes to travel and responds through regular adjustments of its network, services and o/ffers. In the event of climatic events, the Group's various partnerships enable the rapid deployment of commercial measures so that passengers can postpone their journey or change their destination if they so wish.\n\n## Carbon credit risk\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nAs an air transport operator, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group emits carbon dioxide. As such, it fully complies with regulatory measures to reduce carbon emissions (see section/uni00A04.3.1 -/uni00A0CO2 emissions). These include the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which has been in force at European level since 2012 for aviation. In December/uni00A02022, the European institutions defined the modalities for the reform of the EU-ETS through the revision of Directive 2003/87/EC.\n\nThey have confirmed the intra-European scope of the EU-ETS, thus reinforcing CORSIA's future role in defining compensation solutions for international flights. They have also programmed the progressive ending of allowances allocated free of charge to air operators. From 2026 onwards, this new measure will require the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group to purchase emission rights (credits) for all its flights to and from the European Union (intraEuropean flights). The clarification of the reduction trajectory for the allocation of free allowances nevertheless makes it possible to anticipate and control the risk associated with this regulatory change. The regulatory changes and expectation of changes in terms of ambition are leading to significant volatility and an overall increase in ETS prices.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe cost of emissions allowances and the potential for price volatility could increase operating costs. For the year ending December/uni00A031, 2022, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's/uni00A0CO2 emissions reached 22.9/uni00A0million tons (13.7/uni00A0million tons for Air/uni00A0France and 9.2/uni00A0million tons for KLM), of which 5/uni00A0million tons were subject to the EU ETS requirement. In the light of the European arbitration in December/uni00A02023 (end of free allowances in 2026), the scenario adopted by the Air/uni00A0France group foresees the acquisition of 3.8/uni00A0million additional carbon credits on the market between 2023 and 2027.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nTo minimize the consequences of the necessary strengthening of the European carbon market and the gradual increase in the price of credits, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has taken two types of measures.\n\n- > on the one hand, the Group is responding through a proactive financial policy based on the purchase of forward credits. This carbon risk hedging measure is subject to regular review and validation by the Risk Management Committee;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- > on the other hand, the Group is looking for every opportunity to reduce its fuel consumption and carbon emissions on its own initiative within the framework of its decarbonization strategy or in conjunction with the authorities (SESAR project, Single European Sky, air tra/ffic control optimization).\n\nIn addition, the Group uses an internal carbon price (price range) in its investment and project decision-making to factor the carbon risk in its decision-making scenarios (see section/uni00A04.3 'Environmental impacts'). In view of these developments, the Group would also like to draw attention to the need to design a mechanism to adjust carbon emissions at the European Union's borders.\n\n## 3.1.2.3/emspace Loss of flight slots or lack of access to flight slots*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nGiven their saturation, serving major European airports is subject to obtaining slots which are allocated under the conditions defined by EU Regulation No. 95/93. In application of this text and by virtue of a historical precedence, the series of slots held by an aircraft operator is reserved for it from one season to the next if the latter operates at least 80% of the slots over the period in question. Below this threshold, unused slots are lost by the carrier and placed in a pool. Each year, the coordinator in charge of slot management is assigned the task of allocating the released slots to operators who request them. In addition to the potential loss of slots due to a poorly anticipated market development, there is also the risk of a major crisis making it impossible to use the allocated rights. This was notably the case during the Covid-19 crisis, when air carriers had to drastically reduce their frequencies.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe loss of slots or no access to slots due to volume limitations or saturation could have an impact on companies' results or their development. As a slot lost to a competitor is inherently di/fficult to recover, a lack of anticipation and adaptation could lead to a reduction in market share over time. In this context, it should be noted that on June/uni00A024, 2022, the Dutch government announced its intention to reduce the maximum capacity of Schiphol airport to 440,000/uni00A0flight movements per year, i.e. a reduction of 12% compared to the current 500,000. This measure will enter a transition period from November/uni00A01 st , 2023, and final implementation as of November/uni00A01 st , 2024. The potential impact and the measures to be taken by KLM following the Dutch government's announcement are currently being investigated (in this respect, please also view section 'Highlights of the 2023 Financial Year'). In view of this clearly identified risk, the whole group is trying to protect itself and is implementing the necessary means of preservation.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nThe Group is carefully implementing the provisions of the European Regulation on the allocation of slots, which guarantees that a carrier will be able to retain the use of these slots from one season to the next once they have been used 80% of the time, except in exceptional circumstances (see below for the specific case of post Covid-19 recovery). To this end, a particular e/ffort is made to monitor changes in demand and to anticipate new customer expectations. The Group is thus able to adapt its o/ffer flexibly to the variables specific to each airport, thanks to the diversity of the brands in its portfolio. In addition, all the airlines are working with their national authorities to ensure that the capacity they need for growth is regularly available at their main hubs.\n\nSpecific case of major crises: the case of post Covid-19 recovery:\n\nAs they were not in a position to operate many flights during the Covid-19 crisis due to the health measures taken by the authorities, the Group's airlines worked to ensure that specific provisions were made to preserve their slot portfolios. For example, from February/uni00A02021 to October/uni00A02022, an exceptional measure taken by the European Commission allowed the slot utilization threshold to be lowered to 60% without involving the redistribution of unused slots. While the Group welcomed this pragmatic measure, it was also in favor of a gradual increase in the utilization threshold (see section/uni00A06.4.2) proportional to the recovery in tra/ffic. Vigilance remains necessary with regard to a potential new wave of the pandemic.\n\n## 3.1.2.4/emspace Reinforcement of passenger compensation rights\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nMany states have adopted legislation on passenger rights to determine rules for compensation and assistance in the event of irregularities (cancellation, delay, denied boarding, downgrading). The European Union has a Community regulation (RE261/2004) which applies to all flights departing from an airport located on its territory, regardless of the nationality of the airline operating the flight. It also applies to flights arriving on its territory, only when they are operated by an airline from one of its member states.\n\nNumerous rulings by the European Court of Justice have reduced the possibilities for air carriers to invoke 'extraordinary circumstances' to exempt themselves from paying the compensation provided for in Regulation 261/2004. Where geographic specificities apply, as is the case in the United States following the adoption of the Passenger Protection Improvement Act, the Group's airlines operating from these territories comply with the relevant obligations.\n\n## Impact\n\nPassenger rights requirements help shape the Group's operational and commercial policy. Increasing the number of assistance rules could have a significant impact on its financial balance. The increase in costs will then add to the already existing distortions of competition with companies from third countries, most of whose activities are not subject to the same obligations. In addition, the use of specialized companies to collect passenger compensation has become almost systematic, making the processing of claims more complex and time-consuming. The 2022 financial year was marked by the still perceptible consequences of Covid-19 and the imponderables linked to the Ukrainian conflict. Despite a net recovery in tra/ffic, the Group was forced to cancel a significant number of flights, resulting in ticket refunds and the issue of vouchers.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nThe Group has adapted its organization and procedures to improve its ability to handle passenger complaints. The aim is to prevent disputes and to be able to comply with regulatory deadlines in all circumstances, including in the event of major disruptions. At organizational level, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has adopted several measures to strengthen cooperation between all the departments involved. This overhaul of operational processes has ensured optimized decision-making. From the point of view of customers and partners, this has resulted in extended communication and priority processing of requests. In terms of regulations, the Group has opted for a pro-active approach to the collection and use of information. Access to databases updated by the IATA trade association enables the Group to take into account the constant changes in regulations worldwide and to adopt measures it deems necessary to ensure compliance.\n\nSpecific case of major crises: feedback on the Covid crisis:\n\nThe Covid-19 crisis highlighted the fact that the regulations were not adapted to major disturbances. The Group supports the revision of the European Regulation RE261/2004, in particular with regard to defining exonerating circumstances that would make the obligations of airlines more reasonable. In this respect, it participates in the studies regularly carried out by the authorities.\n\n## 3.1.2.5/emspace Regulatory authorities' inquiry into the commercial cooperation agreements between carriers\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nAlliance operations and commercial cooperation are required to comply with the competition laws in force. In certain jurisdictions, the implementation of such agreements is subject to prior review and clearance by the competition authorities. In other jurisdictions, particularly in Europe, airlines are required to ensure that their operations are compliant with the applicable competition rules. At any time, the European Commission has the right to open investigations into any cases of cooperation it considers of interest to the European Community (following a complaint or self-referrals). For example, just like any other major transatlantic cooperation, the joint-venture between Air/uni00A0France, KLM, Delta and Alitalia was the subject of such an investigation (resulting in a positive decision in 2015).",

In this regard, each joint-venture between Air/uni00A0France/KLM, Delta Air Lines and their transatlantic partners has benefited from anti-trust immunity (ATI) on departure from the United States since 2008.\n\n## 3.1.2.6/emspace Commitments vis-\u00e0-vis the European Commission\n\n## Description of the risk\n\n## a) Merger regulation and cooperation agreements\n\nIn 2004, for the European Commission to authorize the business combination between Air/uni00A0France and KLM, the latter two companies made a number of commitments, notably with regard to the possibility of making landing and takeo/ff slots available to competitors at certain airports. Other remedies were introduced following the May/uni00A02015 decision on the transatlantic joint-venture.\n\n## b) State  Aid\n\nIn 2020, the implementation of the measures to reinforce the Group's liquidity (a loan guaranteed by the French State (PGE) in the amount of \u20ac4/uni00A0billion and a \u20ac3/uni00A0billion loan from the French State, together with a revolving credit facility of \u20ac2.4/uni00A0billion guaranteed by the Dutch State and a \u20ac1/uni00A0billion loan from the Dutch State), were submitted for prior approval by the European Commission in accordance with State Aid regulations (decisions of May/uni00A04, 2020 and July/uni00A016, 2021).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn April/uni00A06, 2021, the Group announced the first part of its overall recapitalization plan. Certain measures in this plan contained State Aid, which were accordingly notified by the French authorities to the European Commission, the latter approving them in its decision of April/uni00A05, 2021 pursuant to the rules pertaining to State Aid. This decision made the approval of the measures subject to a number of commitments undertaken by the French State and leading notably to the allocation by Air/uni00A0France of landing and take-o/ff slots to a designated third-party carrier at Orly airport. Other undertakings by the French State were also imposed to the Group companies (to the exception of KLM and its subsidiaries) within the framework of the European Commission's Temporary Framework for State Aid (such as restrictions on acquisitions, share buybacks and dividend payments) and could have an impact on the Group's activities.\n\nLike for all airlines receiving State support in the context of the Covid-19 crisis, the European Commission's decisions granting support measures to Air/uni00A0France and KLM have been subject to annulment proceedings brought by Ryanair. The written proceedings in the three cases concerning the Group (which, together with Air/uni00A0France and KLM, is intervening in support of the European Commission, as are the French and Dutch governments) are closed and oral hearings are expected to be held before the General Court of the European Union during 2023.\n\n## Impact\n\n## a) Merger regulation and cooperation agreements\n\nFailure to comply with merger control or antitrust commitments entails financial, reputational, and structural risk for the Group.\n\n## b) State  Aid\n\nFailure to comply with the commitments made for the approval of State Aid by the European Commission would entail a risk of corrective measures or even the cancellation of the Commission's decision. In the latter case, the State Aid would be considered illegal, resulting in the obligation for Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM to repay the aid in question. This situation also entails a reputational risk for the Group.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\n## a) Merger regulation and cooperation agreements\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has ascertained that the eventual consequences of slot availability under the 2004 and 2015 remedies remain admissible and do not a/ffect the economics of the lines in question. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM also regularly contacts the Commission to discuss the need to maintain these commitments adopted more than sixteen years ago. In this respect, the European Commission lifted on 24/uni00A0February/uni00A02023 the commitments taken by Air/uni00A0France and KLM in 2004 on the Paris-Amsterdam route.",

Pursuant to the European Commission's decision of April/uni00A05, 2021, a Monitoring Trustee responsible for monitoring respect of the commitments undertaken by the French State and the Group has been appointed. A State Agent has also been appointed by the Dutch State, responsible for verifying the application of the measures set forth into the agreement concerning State Aid entered into with the Dutch State.\n\nIt should also be noted that in the course of 2022 and 2023, the Group repaid part of the loans guaranteed by the French State (PGE) made available to it in order to strengthen its cash and liquidity position. During the same period, the Group has already partially repaid the Covid-19 recapitalisation aid granted in the form of quasi-equity in April/uni00A02021 following the conversion of the French State's direct loan of \u20ac3/uni00A0billion.\n\nFinally, on 17/uni00A0March/uni00A02023 and again on 19/uni00A0April/uni00A02023, the Group repaid and refinanced, through the use, approved by the European Commission on 17/uni00A0February/uni00A02023, of part of the \u20ac1.4/uni00A0billion compensation aid for the Covid-19 damage suffered from March to June/uni00A02020, the full balance of the April/uni00A02021 Covid-19 recapitalisation aid that was subject to the aforementioned commitments and constraints. In addition, under the terms of the Covid-19 Temporary Framework, the French State was able to retain the shares subscribed in April/uni00A02021, the latter Covid-19 recapitalisation aid being deemed to have been repaid after two years had elapsed since it was granted and the payment of its specific remuneration. As a result, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM holding and Air/uni00A0France are no longer liable for any Covid-19 recapitalisation aid and are therefore fully released from the aforementioned undertakings and constraints which were linked to this Covid-19 recapitalisation aid, thus lifting the aforementioned restrictions imposed by the European Commission.\n\n## 3.1.3/emspace Risks relating to the Group's processes\n\n## 3.1.3.1/emspace Operational performance and customer risks*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nFor customers, our operational performance is a cornerstone of the product. Growing congestion in airports, increasingly complex regulations (e.g. security and health measures), potential social unrest or sta/ff shortages within the airline industry, but also externally (air tra/ffic control and ground handler strikes), fleet unavailability (due to e.g. delays in deliveries, technical quality issues) and weather-related disturbance incur a risk of sub-optimal operational performance or a lower standard of customer service.\n\n## Impact\n\nThis risk could lead to an increase in the operational performance costs and a reduction in levels of customer satisfaction, which could result in a negative impact on the Group's reputation.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nFor both Air/uni00A0France and KLM, the Operations Control Center is at the heart of operations and any disruption is managed in an integrated manner. Numerous action plans are deployed\n\non operational excellence, service disruption management and recovery, security, network agility, fleet management, the compensation procedure (EU 261), crew management and other critical internal and external resources, and coordination with key stakeholders like the authorities and airports. The goal is to reduce the number of service disruptions, reduce the impact on customers, improve customer satisfaction and reduce the costs of sub-optimal performance.\n\n## 3.1.3.2/emspace Failure of a critical IT system, IT risks and cyber criminality\n\n## Cybercriminality*\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nAs with any business making extensive use of modern communication and IT data processing technologies, including revenue management systems and booking systems (including Altea), the Group is exposed to threats of cyber-criminality.\n\nTheir heavy dependence on IT and communication technologies makes airlines vulnerable to cyber-criminality.",

These risks have diverse origins both inside and outside the Group.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe materialization of one of these risks could have an impact on the Group's activity, reputation, revenues and costs, and thus its results.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM monitors the secure functioning of the IT systems on a permanent basis. Dedicated help centers and redundant networks guarantee the availability and accessibility of data and IT processing in the event of major incidents.\n\nThe infrastructures of the back-up operating centers and business continuity plans are tested regularly. The access controls to the IT systems and to the data exchanged within the Company are governed by rules which comply with international laws and standards.\n\nCompanies specializing in IT security, Internal Audit and Internal Control all regularly evaluate the relevance and e/ffectiveness of the solutions in place.\n\nThe risk of damage to the IT facilities is covered by insurance policies.\n\n3",

Regarding the consequences of the measures implemented by the Group within the context of the Covid-19 epidemic and the inflationary context, the Group has maintained its openness and transparency with unions, with negotiations based on relationships of trust.\n\nGiven its reduced workforce the Group is focused on optimizing and transforming its ways of working, by reviewing organizational structures and workloads. At Group level, coordination takes place between the di/fferent entities, specifically for transverse topics concerning categories of sta/ff across several entities. Significant changes to the HR policies and collective labor agreements are approved at the highest level of management within the airlines and the Group.\n\nDecreasing the distance between management and sta/ff is key to understanding the needs and concerns of sta/ff, tackling any issues in a proactive manner and avoiding any escalation.

The RMC sets hedging targets for the US dollar, sterling and the yen on a quarterly basis.\n\n## 3.1.5.3/emspace Tangible assets investment currency exposure\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nAircraft are generally purchased in US dollars, meaning that the Group is exposed to an appreciation in the US dollar relative to the euro in terms of its investment in aircraft and flight equipment.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe investment exposure could generate volatility on the Group's capital expenditures in euro.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nThe hedging strategy provides for the implementation of a gradual level of hedging between the order and delivery dates of the aircraft or flight equipment.\n\nThe net investments in US dollars figuring in the table below reflect the contractual commitments as of December/uni00A031, 2022:\n\n| (in US$ million)   | 2023   | 2024   | 2025   | 2026   | 2027   |\n|--------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Investments        | 1,779  | 1,474  | 1,133  | 70     | 342    |\n| Currency hedge     | 1,579  | 1,113  | 209    | 70     | 342    |\n| Hedge ratio        | 89%    | 76%    | 18%    | 100%   | 100%   |\n\n## 3.1.5.4/emspace Exposure on indebtness\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nThe aircraft operating leases denominated mostly in USD are recognized in the Group's debt (since the application of IFRS/uni00A016/uni00A0application as of January/uni00A02018).\n\n## Impact\n\nThe US dollar exchange rate variation could generate volatility on the IFRS/uni00A016/uni00A0debt at revaluation.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nAt the accounting level, this US dollar lease debt is recognized as a natural hedge of a fraction of the Group's US dollar revenues.\n\nFor airlines in the Group not generating US dollar revenues, US dollar-denominated assets and currency hedges are in place to mitigate the exchange risk rate.\n\nThe foreign exchange risk on non-IFRS/uni00A016/uni00A0debt is limited: at December/uni00A031, 2022, the exchange rate risk on the debt, other than coming from operating leases, denominated in currencies other than the euro mostly concerns the yen (6%), the US dollar (6%) and the Swiss franc (3%).\n\nNota that the natural hedging relationship, which was temporarily suspended due to the Covid-19 crisis, was reinstated during the 2022 financial year.\n\nTo reduce the currency risk on the debt, a portion of KLM's liquid assets is invested in foreign-currency AAA and AA+ rated bonds.",

They are invested in money market mutual funds, and, secondarily, in debt securities and term deposits with highly-rated banks.\n\n## Impact\n\nThe investment risk is considered to be low, in that the investments in debt securities and term deposits are managed within the framework of the overall counterparty management (see paragraph/uni00A03.1.5.7).\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM only invest in money market funds which are managed by reputable asset managers, selected according to strict selection criteria. With respect to investments in debt securities or term deposits, the latter have to be issued by highly rated banks. The eligible banks are monitored on a quarterly basis by the Risk Management Committee.\n\n## 3.1.5.7/emspace Counterparty risk exposure\n\n## Description of the risk\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM implements the hedging programs to manage the financial risks with derivatives instruments dealt with financial counterparties.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM invests some liquidity directly on financial products proposed by the banks.\n\n## Impact\n\nIn case of default of a counterparty, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is exposed on the debit position (derivatives portfolio market value in favor of AFKLM when the default occurs).\n\nCash invested bilaterally is at risk in the event of default of the counterparty.\n\n## Mitigation plan\n\nEligibility requirements: each counterparty must benefit from a rating, and this rating has to be a minimum of BBB+ (S&P), unless an exemption is expressly granted by the Risk Management Committee (RMC).\n\nMonitoring & reporting: a maximum commitment scale is applied by counterparty based on the quality and ranking of their ratings. The total exposure (overall hedging portfolios added to investments consolidated for the whole Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group) must remain below the prescribed limit. The RMC also monitors the percentages each counterparty represents in the portfolios to ensure permanently appropriate balances.\n\nThe Group monthly report is established and circulated to the members of the General Management.\n\nIn the event of any real risk of a rating downgrading for counterparties, it is supplemented by real time information.\n\nNote that investments on mutual funds incur risk that is deemed to be negligible thanks to broad diversification and the regulatory provisions applicable to such investments.",

It thus aims to create and preserve value, and to safeguard the Group's assets and reputation.\n\nEach Group entity is responsible for managing its risks and for producing regular reports.\n\nThe overall risk management process also serves as a basis for the Universal Registration Document and makes a major contribution to establishing the annual audit program.\n\nAs a facilitator of risk management, Group Internal Audit regularly evaluates the risk management process. Its conclusions are the subject of presentations to the Group Executive Committee and the Audit Committee, and for extra-financial risks to the Sustainable Development and Compliance Committee. The conclusions of the Sustainable Development and Compliance Committee are taken into account by Group Internal Audit in the risk presentations made to the Audit Committee.\n\nThe Risk Management Committee also monitors the management of financial market risks that could have an impact on the financial statements (fuel price, currency exposure,/uni00A0etc.) on a quarterly basis.

The risk management procedures are outlined for each risk, together with the situation which is likely to result from their implementation.\n\n## Risk monitoring and reporting\n\nInternal Audit produces a biannual report for the Group Executive Committee and the Audit Committee on the Group's operational risks. The Audit Committee may decide to bring specific points to the attention of the Board of Directors. Reporting on strategic risks is part of the Strategic process.\n\nThe operational risk reporting process follows a bottom-up process starting in the di/fferent Air/uni00A0France and KLM divisions and the principal subsidiaries. Every half year the Enterprise Risk Coordinators, who have been designated by the di/fferent businesses, entities and subsidiaries, establish the risk sheets and send them to Internal Audit, the latter being responsible for their consolidation at airline and Group level.\n\nThe risk sheets indicate and describe the inherent material risks and the action plans implemented for their mitigation or neutralization, together with an evaluation of their probability of occurrence and the resulting impact. The risk owners and those responsible for the procedures to control risks are specifically\n\nnamed. To ensure the reliability of the process, the risk sheets for each entity are systematically reviewed during regular meetings between Internal Audit and the relevant Executive Vice-Presidents.\n\nThe Group's operational risk sheets (summarizing the operational risks of the entities), which detail any new risks or those which have been withdrawn, and the main changes, are approved by the Group Executive Committee prior to their presentation and review by the Audit Committee.\n\nTo be able to complete the Extra-financial performance statement (see section/uni00A04.1.3 'Business responsibility at the heart of the strategy'), the main environmental, social and societal risks, linked to the Group's activities across the entire value chain, are reviewed and assessed annually. The most material extra-financial risks are an integral part of the Group's operational risk sheet and are submitted to the Sustainable Development and Compliance Committee. The conclusions of this Committee are taken into account in the Group's operational risk sheet presented to the Audit Committee.\n\n## Management of risks by the Risks-Insurance departments\n\nWithin Air/uni00A0France and KLM, each of the Risks-Insurance departments constitutes an integral part of the Internal Control process.

The legal purpose of this Charter is to set forth the principles of prevention, define the actions, stress everyone's individual legal and human responsibilities, and establish internal prevention procedures.\n\nFor its part, the KLM Group has published a Code of Conduct addressing the following principal matters: compliance with laws and regulations, conflicts of interest, confidentiality, the safeguarding of assets, environmental protection, Corporate Social Responsibility and intellectual property.\n\nKLM has a Code of Ethics intended principally for employees in the finance function (see also section/uni00A04.5.3 'Business ethics').\n\n## Manuals to prevent non-compliance\n\nSta/ff have access to a series of manuals and policies on the intranet sites. With regard to the prevention of bribery, the anti-corruption Code of Conduct and its associated policies a/ffirms the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's commitment to conducting business with loyalty, fairness, transparency, honesty and integrity, and in the strict respect of anti-corruption laws wherever its companies or subsidiaries are registered and exercise their activities. The anti-corruption Code of Conduct establishes the guidelines for preventing corruption, and for identifying and handling at-risk situations in the light of the anti-corruption legislation with examples derived from risk mapping or reported dilemmas.

        "page_content": "In each division of the two companies, an ISM/ISMS review takes stock of the operation of the ISM/ISMS management systems and measures the performance of the main steering processes.\n\nIn addition to the regulatory approvals enabling each company to carry out its activities, progress is recognized in the achievement of certification from independent bodies, notably, for example:\n\n## For Air/uni00A0France:\n\n- > IOSA certification (IATA Operational Safety Audit) since September/uni00A02005, renewal audit at the end of 2022;\n- > Air France global IMS certification based on the ISO/uni00A014001 (environment) and ISO/uni00A022000 (food safety) renewal audit scheduled for end of March/uni00A02023.\n\n## For KLM:\n\n- > the ISO/uni00A014001/Environment and ISO/uni00A0500001/Energy certifications were renewed in 2021;\n- > IOSA certification (IATA Operational Safety Audit): The audit was performed in November/uni00A02022 and is valid until March/uni00A02025.\n\n## Quality assurance\n\nControl over the operational processes is based primarily on three monitoring methods:\n\n- a) Internal monitoring is carried out by the quality assurance departments articulated around:\n- > an audit and inspection program (covering, in particular, organization and management, flight operations, in-flight service, flight planning, ground handling and freight, hazardous merchandise, engineering and maintenance);\n- > regular monitoring of operations with incident analysis and routine use of debriefing;\n- > proactive prevention processes.\n- b) External monitoring is carried out by the Civil Aviation Authorities (IVW-DL, DGAC, FAA,/uni00A0etc.) and specialized certification bodies, and takes the form of audits of the operating principles and of the Group's proprietary internal monitoring system. Air/uni00A0France and KLM are also regularly audited by their customers and partners.\n- c) Monitoring of partners:\n\nControl over sub-contractors and suppliers is undertaken within the framework of the regulatory monitoring program approved by the Civil Aviation Authorities.\n\nCode share partnerships are subject to an additional requirement to comply with IOSA standards that are recognized by the profession as the ultimate reference in Flight Safety and Security. The general rule is that partners are IOSA certified except in the specific case when, for example, the size of aircraft excludes the airline from the IOSA scope. In this case, the partner airline is not IOSA certified, Air/uni00A0France and KLM implement a special\n\ntechnical monitoring process aimed at providing a reasonable assurance of an equivalent level.\n\nIn terms of control over the monitoring process, the supervision of the e/ffective implementation of preventive/remedial actions resulting from this overall monitoring is ensured by the quality assurance departments, coordinated within each airline.\n\nMore generally, the sub-contractor control procedure addresses all the areas of risk. It is reflected in the realization of monitoring activities like audits, inspections and checks, sometimes carried out by the sub-contractors themselves. Monitoring is ensured on a quarterly basis. An expanded transverse action plan is in place, taking into consideration the new legislation on the duty of vigilance. More globally an action plan covering the monitoring of sub-contractor activity is deployed in the di/fferent Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM entities and coordinated at the corporate transverse level in dedicated steering committees.\n\n## Information systems\n\nThe control procedures cover the information and telecommunication systems.\n\nThese procedures aim to ensure the:\n\n- > reliability of the IT and telecommunications systems;\n- > integrity of the data through the appropriate resources, infrastructure and checks;\n- > continuity of IT services and the availability of data at the production sites through a local contingency strategy, secure architecture and a security system covering external access points;\n- > confidentiality of information within the framework of national laws and the security of IT infrastructures through the establishment of secure, monitored and e/ffective accesses.\n\nThe managements of the Air/uni00A0France Group and the KLM Group ensure that the resources and expertise required by the information systems are developed within the framework of defined strategic objectives.\n\nProject management and software application development tools are also deployed. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has adopted an 'Agile' development process based on the SCRUM and DEVOPS methodologies. The main aims are to generate business line added value more rapidly, accelerate 'Time to Market', align IT and business line objectives by prioritizing value, avoiding the development of rarely-used functionalities, reducing the risks at the earliest-possible opportunity, streamlining the development and maintenance processes and increasing the e/ffectiveness of the teams.\n\nThe work carried out in connection with Internal Control projects and the ongoing project to gradually establish a coordinated and optimized organization is leading to the launch of action plans designed to strengthen Internal Control, particularly with regard to risks like business continuity and personal data protection.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is structured around seven procurement teams. These procurement teams act in a transverse and coordinated manner for each of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, Air/uni00A0France and KLM as well as for, when required, a number of the Group's airline subsidiaries.\n\nThe activity of the Procurement function aims to supply the entities with suitable products and services at the required time, at the best possible cost of ownership and at the lowest possible risks.\n\nThis is achieved by applying a procurement policy focused on the expertise of the buyers, with separate responsibilities (buyer, prescriber and supplier), the establishment of contracts and the use of various (electronic) tools.\n\nThe CPO Board, comprising the Group Chief Procurement O/fficer from KLM and Air/uni00A0France's Senior Vice-President, Procurement, coordinates the Procurement teams through regular meetings and presents the procurement performance and developments to the CFOs on a quarterly basis.\n\nThe Heads of Procurement meet on a regular basis in the di/fferent structures (e.g. the Quarterly Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM DPO Meeting, a Quarterly Performance Meeting, direct meetings between Heads,/uni00A0etc.) to develop joint programs and share best practices.\n\nTo assess the risks related to sustainability (environmental, ethics, procurement, social) vendors are analyzed and evaluated by EcoVadis, a company mandated by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, with the emphasis on high-risk segments such as production in low-cost countries, and with a minimum score requirement. In addition, all procurement-managed vendors are required to commit to a Code of Conduct, reflecting Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's sustainability requirements.\n\nAll new vendors are assessed on their level of financial risk on the basis of the Dun & Bradstreet evaluation. Risk reduction strategies are required for vendors with a high level of financial risk.\n\nAdditionally, to reduce the risks at Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM level, all contracts with vendors include clauses on anti-bribery, personal data handling and other relevant risk areas.\n\nLastly, In 2022, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Procurement Strategy & Services (PSS) has established a holistic Risk Management Framework to describe all the risks related to the procurement activities along with their mitigation processes & supporting tools.\n\n## Prevention of ticketing fraud\n\nA fraud prevention unit is responsible for preventing, insofar as possible, the risks relating to the:\n\n- > fraudulent use of illegally-purchased tickets (credit cards and other means of payment);\n- > protection of loyalty programs (individual and corporate clients) in terms of both earn and burn;\n- > internal  fraud.\n\nA fraud prevention activity report was submitted to the Audit Committee in October/uni00A02022.\n\nBoth Air/uni00A0France and KLM have put in place whistle-blower procedures and an e-learning anti-fraud training module aimed mainly at the sales teams.\n\n## Prevention of financial fraud\n\nDue to the proliferation of cases of attempted fraud, the Group has strengthened its internal control processes with detailed instruction notes, e-learning modules and training/information sessions.\n\n## Evaluation and monitoring of Internal Control\n\nWhen establishing its internal control framework and risk management process, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM chose the COSO 2013 (Committee Of Sponsoring Organisation of the Treadway Commission) standard and the COBIT 5 (Control Objectives for Information and related Technology) as its starting point.",

It also ensures the realization by the Statutory Auditors of their mission and respect by the Statutory Auditors of the conditions for their independence.\n\n## Financial procedures and processes and the accounting year end\n\n## Finance process\n\nInvestments are managed at the level of each company and the decision-making process is coordinated by the Group Investment Committee (GIC) through decision-making platforms (above \u20ac0.5/uni00A0million) bringing together all the stakeholders (business line and management controllers at company and Group level). This Group Investment Committee is composed of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's Chief Financial O/fficer and the Chief Financial O/fficers of Air/uni00A0France and KLM.\n\nAll investments of more than \u20ac5/uni00A0million, together with operations relating to the fleet, and shareholding and divestment transactions, are submitted for approval to the Group Executive Committee by the Group's Management Controller and the Group's Chief Financial O/fficer. In addition, all investments, acquisitions or disposals of assets (in particular the fleet or shareholdings in any company) or the conclusion of operating leases representing a total amount of more than 150/uni00A0million euros, carried out at the level of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Air/uni00A0France or KLM, must be authorized in advance by the Board of Directors of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM.\n\nThe management of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's market risks is overseen by the Risk Management Committee (RMC), which meets at least each quarter to define the risk management strategy of the Group, and, after examining the various Group risk reports, determines the hedges to be set up during the coming quarters, with notably, the hedging ratios to be achieved, the time period to respect these targets and, potentially, the preferred type of hedging instrument.\n\nThese decisions are then implemented in each company by the respective Treasury Management departments, pursuant to the procedures for the delegation of powers.\n\nRegular meetings are organized between the Treasury Management departments of the two companies, to optimize the coordination of recommendations made to the RMC and subsequent decision implementation (hedging instruments, the strategies planned and counterparties).\n\nThe fuel hedges are covered in a weekly report forwarded to the General Managements of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, Air/uni00A0France and KLM. A summary of the cash positions of Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is communicated weekly to the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's General Management.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Air/uni00A0France and KLM cash positions are the subject of monthly reports to the Finance departments. These reports include the interest rate and currency positions, the portfolio of hedging operations, a summary of investments and financing by currency and a tracking statement of the risk exposure by counterparty. The Risk Management Committee sets the minimum thresholds in terms of the financial quality of counterparties, determines the maximum amount to be allocated to a single counterparty and is responsible for monitoring the quarterly positions.\n\nThe hedge strategies aim to reduce the exposure of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and therefore to preserve budgeted margins. The instruments used are futures, swaps and options. The internal risk management procedures prohibit instruments characterized as trading instruments unless expressly authorized by the Chief Financial O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM. All the instruments used must qualify as hedging instruments pursuant to the IAS/IFRS accounting rules. Generally speaking, no trading or speculation is authorized.\n\nAny substantive change in the hedging strategy is the subject of a systematic presentation to the Group Audit Committee.\n\n## Accounting and financial statements process\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group are prepared on the basis of the data provided by the finance departments of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM holding company and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Group is principally composed of the two operational sub-Groups, Air/uni00A0France and KLM, which prepare their own consolidated financial statements prior to their consolidation within the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM financial statements.\n\nIt is imperative that the accounting information reported by the di/fferent companies complies with the Group's accounting rules, methods and standards as defined by the Group, and the presentation of the financial statements must comply with the format circulated by the Group.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Furthermore, the half-year and annual financial statements are also audited by the Statutory Auditors prior to their formal closure.\n\nThe parent company's financial statements are the subject of a presentation to the General Management and the Audit Committee, are approved by the Board of Directors and are audited by the Statutory Auditors.\n\n## Process for reporting passenger and cargo revenues\n\nThis process is performed in each of the companies and enables monthly revenue figures to be communicated to management. Furthermore, Air/uni00A0France and KLM have established a procedure known as the 'progressive daily revenue' process making it possible to know the estimated amount of passenger revenues for the previous day.\n\nIn addition, departments of the Group, Air/uni00A0France and KLM analyze the results by market and by route (unit revenues per revenue passenger-kilometer, per available seat-kilometer, per revenue ton-kilometer/uni00A0etc.) at the level of the passenger and cargo businesses.\n\nA monthly presentation on the level of transportation revenues (passenger and cargo) is also made to the Group Executive Committee by the senior managers of these entities.\n\nThe Shared Services Center (SSC) in Toulouse is in charge of commercial Passenger revenues for the companies Air/uni00A0France\n\nand KLM, while the Shared Services Center at AmsterdamSchiphol is responsible for commercial Cargo revenues for the Group (Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Martinair).\n\nFor these two activities, service level agreements have been signed between Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM.\n\n## Management Control reporting process\n\nThe Group Corporate Control department coordinates the reporting process with the Corporate Controllers in the two sub-groups.\n\nIn liaison with the Group's principal divisions and subsidiaries, these three teams of controllers then analyze the past month's financial results and estimate the results for the coming months (forecast adjustment process) through to the end of the current financial year.\n\nOnce the accounting result for the month is known, Group Corporate Control produces a monthly document (known as the Group management report) that summarizes the monthly key business, employee-related and financial data, both actual and for the coming months, in order to determine the forecasted outcome for the current financial year for the Group, the two sub-groups and each business line. The same applies to the figures on cash-flow, and the cash and debt positions.\n\nThis monthly Group management report is distributed and presented to the Group Executive Committee by the Group Corporate controller.\n\nIn addition, management review meetings take place on at least a quarterly basis between the CEOs, CFOs and Executive VicePresidents of the Passenger, Cargo, Engineering & Maintenance and Transavia businesses.",

The reporting scope covers the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group. When the information relates to a di/fferent scope, the scope of application is specified in the text.\n\n## 4.1/emspace CREATING LONG-TERM VALUE FOR ALL OUR STAKEHOLDERS\n\n## 4.1.1/emspace The Group's business model\n\nThe Group's business brings together people, economies and cultures, and drives economic growth and social progress. The overarching ambition of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is to become an aviation champion in Europe, while assuming its role as a front-runner in sustainable aviation.\n\nThe value creation model (see section/uni00A01.2.5) shows the impact areas where the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group adds value and which, thanks to its fundamental strengths and unique competitive advantages, enables a response to the societal and sustainability challenges. As part of its day-to-day activities, the Group interacts with all its stakeholders (employees, shareholders, customers, suppliers, authorities, local communities and players in civil society like NGOs,/uni00A0etc.), while its activities and operations have multiple impacts on wider society.\n\nThe main impacts, both quantitative and qualitative, are summarized in the 'reporting of the Group's extra-financial risks' paragraph in section/uni00A04.1.2 'Identification of the key priorities for building long-term relationships'. The policies implemented are outlined in sections 4.2/uni00A0to 4.6.\n\nThe post Covid-19 crisis world will no longer be the same. Within this context, the fundamentals of our strategy, in particular our commitment to sustainability, remain and are being accelerated.\n\n## Principles of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\n\nThe Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) was set up by the G20 in December/uni00A02015 during the United Nations COP21 conference to draft recommendations for use by financial and non-financial companies in their public disclosure of the impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities. These recommendations, which are applicable across all sectors and can be included in existing financial reports, aim to increase the transparency between companies and investors, thereby reducing investment risks and reconciling short-term financial decisions with the longer-term consequences of climate change.\n\nIn 2019, the Group realized the TCDF Climate Maturity Assessment developed by KPMG, to evaluate the concordance of its environmental reporting with the principles of the TCDF. The actions implemented by the Group are presented in the table below.\n\nAs a result, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM decided to become an o/fficial supporter of the TCFD principles with a commitment to continuing to improve its knowledge and reporting.",

A number of initiatives enable their perception to be evaluated on a regular basis through, notably:\n\n- > internal barometers and meetings to gather employee suggestions;\n- > customer perception and satisfaction surveys;\n- > regular exchanges with individual shareholders, mainstream and Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) investors together with recommendations from extra-financial ratings agencies;\n- > dialogue with the authorities and national policy makers;\n- > dialogue and evaluation of supplier CSR performance;\n- > exchange of best practices and working groups within the industry, and with other large companies;\n- > opinions and remarks gleaned from the dedicated email addresses, websites and the social media;\n- > feedback channels deployed to enable stakeholders (particularly employees, customers and local residents around airports) to communicate any comments and complaints.\n\nEvery two years, the Group carries out materiality analyses, enabling the priorities key to the Group's activity to be re-evaluated and the results to be compared with those from previous materiality analyses.

For each topic, the respondents rank the level of priority to be accorded by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and their perception of the Group's current level of performance.\n\nThe materiality analysis carried out in 2021 reaffirmed the priorities deemed to be the most important for the Group in 2019. Customer satisfaction,/uni00A0CO2 emissions reduction, financial performance and safety, and fleet development remain the top materiality issues raised by stakeholders. The 2021 materiality analysis also shows the growing concern surrounding Sustainable Aviation Fuel, sustainable supply chain management and climate change in the impact of the Group's activity. Innovation is also a concern for our customers. The detailed results highlight that the Group and its stakeholders agree on the perception of the priority nature of these issues.\n\nWithin the framework of this analysis, stakeholders also ranked a list of strategic priorities potentially impacting the sector's long-term growth, namely: the acceptability of the environmental impacts of aviation, the use of sustainable alternative fuels, changing customer behavior, control over the carbon reduction trajectory and fair competition between airlines all headed the list.\n\nIn 2022, BlueLink, the Group's largest non-aviation subsidiary and, a specialist in customer relations in the airline, luxury, tourism and cultural sectors, started to implement its sustainability strategy which focuses on three main priorities: human capital development, sta/ff engagement and local & environmental impact. By implementing its sustainable development strategy, BlueLink's ambition is to be an environmentally and socially responsible company that develops its talents and creates value through innovative solutions. The di/fferent projects implemented include a two-hours e-learning module aimed at raising awareness of the challenges of climate change, with all 2000 BlueLink employees set to complete this e-learning program by the end of 2023. In November/uni00A02022, to motivate its sta/ff and work on diversity & inclusion, BlueLink organized a week of events in order to raise awareness among all employees about diversity and engage employees belonging to minorities. On the topic of gender equality, a mentoring program aimed at facilitating mobility and career progression for women has been set up for\n\nimplementation in early 2023. Additionally, in 2023, BlueLink will carry out a carbon audit of all three scopes related to its activities in all of its business units. An action plan with a focus on digital sobriety will then be designed and implemented so as to reduce BlueLink's carbon footprint.\n\n## Analyzing the extra-financial risks\n\nThe extra-financial risks are monitored on a permanent basis and are an integral part of the Group's operational risk sheets. They are also an integral part of the Group's Sustainable Development strategy and are the subject of measures, monitoring procedures and action plans.\n\nThe Group reviews its main extra-financial risks and opportunities on an annual basis. The main environmental, social and societal risks resulting from its activities across the entire value chain are evaluated to establish a matrix of the extra-financial risks. The results are reconciled with those of the materiality matrix which illustrates the di/ffering perceptions of the internal and external stakeholders.\n\nWithin the Board of Directors, the main extra-financial risks are discussed and reviewed each year by the Sustainable Development and Compliance Committee, then validated by the Audit Committee. These risks and the policies implemented are outlined in chapter/uni00A03 'Risk and risk management' and in sections 4.2/uni00A0to 4.6.\n\n## Reporting of the Group's extra-financial risks\n\nIn 2020, the extra-financial risks analysis enabled a re-evaluation of the main risks to which the Group must respond and these risks were outlined in its Extra-financial performance statement.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Group's priorities, the related risks and the opportunities deemed to be the most material, the policies in force to reduce their impacts, the performance indicators and the Group's contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For each topic, the risks are ranked by order of importance. The most material issues are marked with an asterisk. In addition, wherever possible, key performance indicators have been added.",

It may play an important role in helping the EU scale up sustainable investment and implement the European green deal. The EU taxonomy provides companies, investors and policymakers with appropriate definitions and criteria to be met by economic activities to be considered environmentally sustainable. The Taxonomy Regulation was published in the O/fficial Journal of the European Union on June/uni00A022, 2020 and entered into force on July/uni00A012, 2020, with a first application in the year ended December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\nIn 2022, companies subject to this EU regulation had to report the proportion of their total turnover, capital expenditure (capex) and operating expenditure (opex) related to eligible business activities and aligned under the European Taxonomy regulation. An eligible business activity is considered 'aligned' with one of the six environmental objectives (*) (1) if:\n\n- > it contributes substantially to the achievement of that objective (compliance with specific technical criteria);\n- > it does not harm any of the other five objectives ('Do No Significant Harm' criteria);\n- > minimum safeguards (e.g. OECD, United Nations, guidelines,/uni00A0etc.) are otherwise met.\n\nIn 2022, as air transport and the maintenance of aircraft were not included in the delegated acts related to the taxonomy, the share of aligned activities in the Group's turnover was nil. Globally, in compliance with the definition provided by the Taxonomy Regulation, 1.1/uni00A0percent of the Group's capital expenditure and 1.4/uni00A0percent of its operational expenses, are aligned with the EU taxonomy regulation. These percentages are mainly linked to investments and costs related to energy, waste management and remediation, transport, construction and real estate activities, and professional, scientific and technical activities.\n\nDue to the absence of technologically and economically-feasible low-carbon alternatives in the aviation sector, aimed at reaching Net Zero emission by 2050, aviation's contribution to fighting climate change and reducing emissions will need to be achieved by continuing to use kerosene in more fuel-e/fficient aircraft, while, progressively switching to sustainable aviation fuels that are increasingly/uni00A0CO2 neutral. As the current aircraft technology does not support zero or low-emission flying and is unlikely to do so until the next decade, the decarbonization of air transport will have to count on these transition activities. In this respect, the concept of sustainable aviation activity needs to be clarified as well as the key role of certain transition activities essential to achieving our goal of Net Zero emissions by 2050.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Border closures, health measures to respect for travel, a climate of international instability, a challenge of societal acceptability linked to the aviation sector, high inflation and a rapid rebound in activity in a tight labor market had a significant impact on airlines and their workforces throughout the world.\n\nA continuous dialogue between the social partners and the General Management enabled the negotiations on the reconstruction plan to take place in full transparency and in a constructive manner. The reimbursement of the loans guaranteed by the French and the Dutch States is a priority for the Group and the entire social structure is mobilized around making a material contribution to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's long-term future.\n\nThanks to rigorous and e/ffective health protocols, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Air-France-KLM did its utmost to protect the health and safety of its customers and sta/ff. In this context of crisis, employee engagement was challenged in 2021 but has been recovering since the middle of 2022, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group having focused on employee mobility and talent retention..\n\nIn the context of rising inflation, limited capacity in some airports and workforce shortages in certain positions, the Group consolidated its resilience and demonstrated great agility to adapt to the changing volume of operations.\n\nNow more than ever, the strategy common to all the Air-France - KLM Group businesses remains to foster employee commitment and motivation, by o/ffering employees working conditions that enable them to fulfil their professional duties e/ffectively and thus, contribute to the Group's performance.",

'Our people deliver our customer experience' and it is through this policy that the Company can outperform its competitors. The roadmap ('Flight Plan') is defined in action plans at the level of every division of the airlines and the Group including, notably, an ongoing commitment to inclusion, sta/ff development, support for initiative, the promotion of team spirit and the reinforcement of motivation which are key to emerging stronger from the Covid-19 public health crisis.\n\nTo measure the level of employee engagement, Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Transavia use the Employee Promoter Score (EPS), the in-house equivalent of the Net Promoter Score which measures the level of customer satisfaction. In the two companies, a rotating random selection of employees is regularly polled to ascertain whether they would recommend Air/uni00A0France and KLM as employers to their friends and family. The results are shared with all sta/ff. At Group level the consolidated EPS saw an overall fall between 2020 and 2022 however the negative trend was less marked, in absolute value, in 2022 than in 2021 and has been on a recovery trend since the summer of 2022. The Covid-19 crisis had a significant impact on working conditions, on compensation and other elements related to the di/fficulties the industry was facing. In 2022 Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM succeeded in turning the situation around by activating in depth listening to employees, dedicated action plans and exceptional salary measures to protect the workforce from inflation.\n\nA plan was established to give substance to the EPS recovery in the long term:\n\n- > Steering: We are all responsible for creating a culture and environment in which everyone feels comfortable and is supported in the right way to make a di/fference. Employee engagement is steered in all teams and all businesses;\n- > Listening: At Air/uni00A0France and KLM, open questions have been added to the survey to gain employee insight. With the help of the various activities that together form the Employee Listening Strategy, KLM collects useful feedback from employees. In September/uni00A02022, KLM launched a multi-year study among 9.000/uni00A0cabin crew colleagues in collaboration with the Erasmus Happiness Economics Research Organization. to identify the common factors that influence their well-being and professional fulfillment. The result of this study is expected in the first half of 2023;\n- > Action plan: At Air/uni00A0France, a task force was set up with representatives from all businesses to be responsible for implementing the action plan. A communication plan for employees enabled buy-in to the 'Nous sommes Air/uni00A0France' pride in team work initiative, to share important assets of the Company like its history, its products, its brand history and its commitment to be able to contend with the current\n\nenvironmental and societal issues, and to value the many professional perspectives within the Company. In terms of remuneration, in addition to the general salary increase to support all employees during this period of high inflation, specific actions were implemented to, for example, support the operational teams during the Summer peak in activity and retain specific talents. Managers are strongly encouraged to listen to local specificities and needs, and to work on local working conditions or any other local issues raised by employees. They are provided with resources to come up with solutions and move forward together.\n\n## Working conditions during the public health crisis\n\nAs of the onset of the public health crisis in March/uni00A02020 and throughout 2021 and 2022, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM implemented the Company public health protocols stipulated by the French, Dutch and foreign governments, and sought to adapt these protocols to its various sta/ff categories during the di/fferent phases of the pandemic (lockdowns, curfew/uni00A0etc.) As we emerge from this crisis, working from home and hybrid working are entering a phase of consolidation based on experience. The Group does its utmost to o/ffer solutions aligned as closely as possible with employee preferences and needs, and to foster e/fficiency and engagement.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the public health measures were slowly relaxed after a hard lockdown and were lifted altogether in April/uni00A02022. The 'Consider Corona' 'national committee' was set-up in March/uni00A02022 to prepare for a possible new wave of the epidemic and a gradual return to normality.\n\nIn 2022, as during the height of the public health crisis, the health measures were communicated via the di/fferent digital communication channels in support of line managers and via a proactive Health and Safety in the Workplace network: protective measures, availability of health kits, limitation on the number of days spent in the workplace, closure of the workplace canteens, remote working, certification of professional travel,/uni00A0etc.\n\nHealth, safety and working conditions commissions were organized at every key stage to agree with the employee representatives the measures to be put in place.\n\nIn France, in line with the recommendations of the health authorities the measures implemented to protect employees against the epidemic risks were accompanied by a strengthening of the surveillance and follow-up of cases and contacts by the vocational medicine unit, a statistical focus on declarations, and the permanent availability of medical experts for the validation of the preventive measures. Since April/uni00A02022, the Covid commissions have met less frequently, on a quarterly basis. On a regular basis, formal communication campaigns remind sta/ff of the protective measures and behavior (gel, masks,/uni00A0etc.) with the tools still available within the Company. A dedicated General Practitioner covers the Covid topic in the Health and Safety meetings with employee representatives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Continuous company-wide execution of Safety Issue Risk Analyses on the virus and the monitoring/ introduction of new regulations, procedures and methodologies ensured that the appropriate measures and mitigations were in place to maintain safety. Since the second quarter of 2022 when the Covid measures were relaxed in the country, the usual meeting structure has been continued at KLM but all extra meetings have been cancelled.\n\nDuring the crisis and as we return to normality, Air/uni00A0France has implemented successful health prevention measures thanks the adoption of a multidisciplinary approach.\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, within the context of the spread of a less harmful Omicron strain, the governmental guidelines changed to reflect a lighter health protocol: isolation rules were eased for positive Covid cases and their contacts. From mid-March, the mandatory wearing of masks in the workplace ended and all testing and social distancing were removed. The public health protocol was replaced by a guide explaining the issues surrounding vaccination, making recommendations on the management of Covid cases and their contacts, and listing the measures to be implemented to protect employees from contamination risks.\n\nTo guarantee optimal working conditions for their employees, KLM, Transavia and Air/uni00A0France have enabled the development of remote working, as already provisioned or by adding this provision to the existing agreements.\n\nIn the Netherlands after the reopening of the o/ffices following the lifting of lockdowns in January/uni00A02022, KLM provided support for its employees in their transition to the o/ffice.\n\nIn agreement with managers and team-members and based on their type of activity, employees have the option to work from home. The teams can use both digital and physical channels to collectively conclude work agreements: when and with whom at the office, which activities at home or elsewhere? They can also refer to the 'Safe and Healthy Working From Home' e-learning module.\n\nAt Transavia France, in November/uni00A02021, an innovative and flexible Working-From-Home agreement was signed for all support functions and crew management undertaking o/ffice activities. This agreement will be re-discussed in January/uni00A02023 to take into account feedback on the experience.\n\nTransavia Netherlands organized a number of 'Healthy Talks' and online sessions on themes such as stress and a good work-life balance.\n\n## Employee commitment despite the di/fficulties\n\n2022 was marked by a very significant level of commitment from the Group's employees in a context of a rebound in activity. The departures of many colleagues in previous years, the unstable international context and high inflation led to a feeling of uncertainty and this weighed on the major airlines' Employee Promoter Scores (EPS) which dropped to low levels at the end of 2021. In 2022, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group rea/ffirmed its commitment to social and environmental topics in the regions where it operates.\n\nIn partnership with the start-up Vendredi, Air/uni00A0France mobilized its employees around volunteering with the creation of the 'Mon Engagement Citoyen' initiative. Via this network and throughout the year, employees can o/ffer their free time, positive energy and skills to partner associations in six areas of action dear to Air/uni00A0France and the Air/uni00A0France Foundation: Children Education Training - Employment, Disability-Health, Combating Precarity, Intergenerational Sharing and the Environment. Since its launch, 3,800 Air/uni00A0France employees have registered on the Vendredi platform and nearly five hundred volunteering actions have already been carried out.\n\nKLM's approach to promoting sustainable development at the scale of the organization also drove the establishment of programs aimed at making KLM a more welcoming and inspirational employer o/ffering diverse professional development opportunities. The aim is to stimulate employees and facilitate the activities enabling them to discover and develop their talents so that they can make better choices in a constantly changing environment.\n\nA few examples:\n\n- > in collaboration with Airport College, KLM provides vocational education programs for employees with many years of professional experience. In the last five years, more than five hundred KLM operational employees have graduated with a nationally recognized vocational degree in this 'life-long learning' program;\n- > for newly-hired employees on temporary KLM contracts, the Company strengthened their position on the labor market with a training program leading to a recognized degree. These students were well equipped to find positions with another employer;\n- > thanks to a collaboration with Airport College and lecturers in schools, which started in 2020, a further improvement in the quality of the steward/stewardess internship training program was achieved, benefiting hundreds of students;\n- > during the year, KLM held multiple employee events across the Company and in the divisions to create memorable individual experiences. Managers continued to use WhatsUp, a tool to facilitate dialogue within teams and help determine the actions required to improve the Employee Experience.",

In addition, the Human Resources departments multiplied their touch points with employees and managers.\n\n## 4.2.2/emspace Resource adaptation and employee dialogue\n\n## ) Context and strategy\n\nWithin the unprecedented context of the Covid-19 crisis, the most serious crisis experienced by the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group since the Second World War, the Group's airlines initiated a number of di/fferent actions to enable a return to financial breakeven, notably by reducing their labor costs, while prioritizing voluntary departures as far as possible. The Dutch and French governments supported the Group's e/fforts, each within the framework of their own country's social systems.\n\nThis resource adaptation was accompanied by reorganization and transformation projects aimed at improving the Group's e/fficiency and restructuring its French domestic network, but also to take into account the new environmental conditions.\n\nIn 2022, the business context was radically changed with a steep ramp-up in activity through to the summer. This was a challenging operational context for airports with some players having encountered di/fficulties with handling workloads in a tight labor market and with inflation at levels that had been unprecedented in the previous decades. In this new context, the calibration of the di/fferent plans and support measures continue to be systematically discussed and negotiated with the unions within the framework of the procedures imposed by the country's legislative framework.\n\n## * Measures and performance\n\nFor Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and the coordination of the workplace dialogue takes place in each Group entity and within the Group's European Works Council, bringing together the representatives of sta/ff whose head o/ffices or entities are based in the European Community.\n\nDuring 2022, Benjamin Smith (Chief Executive Officer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM), Pieter Elbers then Marjan Rintel (KLM's President & Chief Executive O/fficer) and Anne Rigail (Air/uni00A0France's Chief Executive O/fficer) held regular meetings with employees in the various sites, to engage in dialogue on current topics. The number of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM employees and their skillsets need to be adapted to the transition currently being experienced by the aviation industry. New aviation industry technologies, digitalization and changes in the labor markets are pressurizing the Company to prepare its employees to adapt to these changes.\n\nIn total, during 2022, Transavia France convened 12/uni00A0meetings of the works Councils and four of the health and safety committees, while Air/uni00A0France convened 15/uni00A0meetings of the Social and Economic Committee (Comit\u00e9 Social et \u00c9conomique - CSE), of which three were extraordinary, and four meetings of the Comit\u00e9 de Groupe\n\nFran\u00e7ais, testifying to the intensive employee dialogue required to continue to respond to an unprecedented crisis.\n\n## The implementation of emergency measures for all employees\n\nIn France, further to the Partial activity (Activit\u00e9 Partielle) scheme implemented in 2020, the Company and the unions signed an agreement with the three sta/ff categories (Hostesses/Stewards, Ground Sta/ff and Pilots) to enable the Company to benefit from the Long-Term Partial Activity, from January/uni00A01, 2021 and for a two-year period (the maximum allowed by law).\n\nThis agreement mitigated the effects of the crisis on the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's cash position during 2021 and extended the savings on personnel costs for Air/uni00A0France over this two-year period. It is also a lever for adapting organizations to the level of activity which remains dependent on the public health decisions and travel restrictions linked to border closures worldwide. An amendment to the Partial activity Agreement (APLD) has been signed with the Pilot, Cabin Crew and Ground Sta/ff unions making it possible to again use the scheme in the event of a new crisis in 2023 and 2024.\n\nIn April/uni00A02020, the Dutch government launched a generic wage support grant for companies in the Netherlands whose revenues had been impacted by the Covid-19 crisis. Both KLM and its subsidiaries applied for this so-called NOW-grant (an emergency bridging measure for employment in the Netherlands) and committed to respecting the conditions linked to this measure. The NOW-grant was applied from March/uni00A02020 and continued until the end of the first quarter of 2022. This support mechanism prevented forced redundancies as far as possible in the short term.\n\n## Signature of major agreements in times of crisis\n\nThe negotiation of agreements in the di/fferent airlines of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group continued throughout 2022, to respond to the health and financial issues arising from the Covid-19 crisis and those involved on emergence from the crisis following by the summer activity peak against a backdrop of high inflation.\n\nIn view of the health context and following the lockdowns in France, the TeleWorking Charter (Charte du T\u00e9l\u00e9travail) was introduced in February/uni00A02022 allowing employees whose positions are eligible and following agreement from their managers to benefit from remote working, either for a few days per year or on a regular basis, while initiating discussions on hybrid working. In 2022, based on the results of a dedicated survey, an action plan was established to further improve hybrid working, and to ensure the more e/ffective use of the working spaces and collaborative tools.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

The discussions with the unions led to the decision to organize a special purchasing power bonus to the benefit of all employees as well as a salary increase that would gradually be implemented from November/uni00A02022 through to the middle of 2023. The next salary negotiations are scheduled to start in the second quarter of 2023.\n\nHaving been initiated in 2020, the facilitation of a loan package from the Dutch government to help mitigate the impact of the crisis was terminated in March/uni00A02022. There were conditions attached to this loan package including a mandatory reduction in payroll costs. Employees earning a higher-than-median salary (\u20ac38,000/uni00A0on an annual, full-time basis) had to contribute to this via a reduction in salary. This reduction depended on the level of salary with up to 20% for employees earning three times the average salary or more.\n\nWhile a workable Social Plan for Flight Deck Crew had already been part of an existing collective labor agreement, in 2020 KLM and the unions signed two new Social Plan agreements for Cabin Crew and Ground Sta/ff. These agreements apply between October/uni00A02020 and December/uni00A02024.\n\nThese two Social Plans are based on measures aimed at limiting compulsory lay-o/ffs as far as possible via recourse to a voluntary severance scheme and new career opportunities outside of KLM (e.g. a move into the healthcare or education sectors). Employees whose jobs are redundant after these measures will be forced to leave KLM.\n\nAgreements have been signed with the unions concerning one-o/ff payments in the event of dismissal, and outplacement and assistance in finding new employment.\n\nIn 2022, three collective labor agreements were concluded with Ground Sta/ff, Cabin Crews and Flight Deck Crews in KLM, including a wage increase over the period from March/uni00A02022 to March/uni00A02023. This wage increase contains a minimum monthly increase, with KLM having set an example in the Dutch market: the lowest operational functions receive a salary increase up to 10% over the period, not far from the inflation rate.\n\nIn addition, KLM and the unions further improved work conditions, ratifying agreements that touch aspects of work that are relevant to our employees, such as commuting, compensation for working from home and making a number of regulations more inclusive, such as the sta/ff travel policy.\n\nThrough the agreements signed, we are investing in the employment conditions of today and tomorrow.\n\n## Resource adaptation via a number of measures\n\nAfter having implemented emergency measures via a hiring freeze for external sta/ff and only limited renewal of temporary contracts in 2020 at the height of the Covid-19 public health crisis, the context was to prove very di/fferent in 2022 with a steep ramp-up in air operations activity during a period of high inflation within a tight labor market. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM anticipated the strong summer demand by preparing for both seasonal and longer-term recruitment as of the end of 2021 and the airlines did their utmost to plan for the ramp-up and help their employees to contend with the volume of operations.\n\nAs of the end of 2021, a transversal task force at Air/uni00A0France was in place to coordinate measures and actions to support its employees in the preparation for the activity ramp-up: recruitment of seasonal workers and those on longer-term contracts in specific areas of expertise, sub-contractor management, preparation of the Paris hub infrastructures to facilitate operations and customer flow fluidity at the borders:\n\n- > more than one thousand pilots, mechanics and aviation technicians, and managers in IT, engineering and ground operations were recruited. Seasonal recruitment covered mainly ground sta/ff and cabin crew. In parallel, there was intense internal mobility consistent with its level of before the Covid-19 crisis. The responsiveness and professionalism of the recruitment and HR teams, who were themselves often new to these roles, were recognized and enabled the Air/uni00A0France group to be well prepared, compared to its competitors, to again contend with a very high level of activity;\n- > the departure of many employees within the framework of Voluntary Departure Plans and the reorganization of the Company accelerated internal job transfers; within the airlines, these moves were collectively steered to meet the need for business-specific competencies;\n- > the second half of 2021 and 2022 saw renewed recruitment of interns and the restart of the program to attract management trainees.\n\nIn the Netherlands many new recruitment initiatives supported the ramp-up in activity:\n\n- > attracting new baggage and apron sta/ff was one of the main focuses for the recruitment of ground sta/ff, with several hundred new employees;\n- > KLM Recruitment Flight Sta/ff attracted and selected a large number of new colleagues, including cabin crew and pilots;",

Our inclusive Talent Development strategy aims to enable employees to make optimal use of their talents, improve their employability and thus add value to the organization.\n\nThe 2020-22/uni00A0campaign on the Forward Planning of Jobs and Skills (GPEC), combined with a strategic vision and a business-focused approach, enabled the identification of the future sta/ffing needs based on a number of di/fferent scenarios, while providing solutions on mobility, employability, research and employee loyalty and the management of the e/ffects of the digital transformation.\n\nThe Human Resources teams and the Executive Committee very rapidly pinpointed the strategic challenges involved in retaining and developing talent to add to the succession plan for key positions.\n\nIn 2021, Human Resources had assessed the current talent management approach for the Group, redefining the requirements of the business, reviewing the tools and processes used by the human resources departments and sharing the needs and expectations of the talents. Priority areas for improvement were defined and implementation continued in 2022. This process covered the definition of leadership expectations common to all the Group entities, the development of transversal leadership training programs for di/fferent levels of leadership maturity and a coordinated approach for talent identification and succession planning.\n\nTo structure this process, the airlines follow an annual cycle for managers and employees with a specific pathway through which to address Talent and Performance Development topics. At KLM, the outcome of the talent identification session is captured in the HR system (SAP SuccessFactors). In 2022, the recording of the succession planning in SAP SF was designed and it is now ready for implementation.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is building solid bases to connect people, skills and opportunities, a key factor for agility and in our successful transformation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## * Measures and performance\n\nDespite the challenging context of exit from crisis, the Group pursued its policy of investing in formal training: the number of training hours per employee stood at 42/uni00A0hours in 2022.\n\nThe Group considers people development through the three dimensions of on-the-job experience, feedback and formal learning; in 2022, the entities launched and continued actions covering these three dimensions, taking into account the businesses' own specificities and starting points.\n\nDashboards based on HR data are used and updated to monitor the number of promotions and the inflow and outflow of employees.\n\nIn this respect, particular attention is paid to employee turnover and the age pyramid is also considered when we study employee development support options.\n\nTotal turnover and voluntary turnover of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group employees:\n\n|                     | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   | 2022   |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total turnover rate | 6.10%  | 11%    | 11.4%  | 9.5%   |\n| Voluntary           |        |        |        |        |\n| tornover rate       | 1.50%  | 1.60%  | 2.50%  | 3.40%  |\n\nNote: Turnover rates are calculated based on headcount under permanent contracts at the end of the latest reporting year.\n\nTotal employee turnover (outgoing): proportion of employees who left the Group, expressed as a percentage of the total employees.\n\nVoluntary employee turnover: proportion of employees who voluntarily left the Group, expressed as a percentage of the total employees.\n\nIn 2022, within the framework of the data collection process, people leaving the Company were o/ffered exit interviews or the opportunity to complete an exit survey to gain insight into the reasons for their departure. They form the basis for a further improvement in our employee value proposition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The yearly training plan has been designed to support and accompany the strategy of the Group, and to develop individual and collective performance.\n\nIn 2022, major e/fforts were made to further modernize and fluidify the search process for the various learning programs in the modern and user-friendly MyLearning tool.\n\nIn addition, KLM identified the need for an excellent service and advisory helpdesk. Via the 'Intercom' chat function sta/ff can be assisted in exploring and defining their individual and customized development paths, and a dedicated SharePoint website helps employees to find the right learning and development support.\n\nIn 2022, KLM further enlarged the scope of the learning content distributed, via a link to the 'external training portal' which includes a rich and varied training o/ffer with special attention paid to workers. Air/uni00A0France created Learning Channels (LC) to facilitate use of the training o/ffer: LC Management, LC Leadership - based on the leadership model -, LC Quality and Health at the Workplace, LC Diversity,/uni00A0etc. In December/uni00A02022, Air/uni00A0France launched its third edition of the Learning Week. Conferences, webinars, online games and workshops were proposed to all employees from all the divisions, aimed at introducing the diverse and numerous possibilities on o/ffer for learning.\n\nManagers play an important role in conducting Career Development discussions and proposing training to their teams.\n\nLinked to the transformation of the Company, Air/uni00A0France has prioritized several areas of development, including:\n\n- > risk management: flight safety, occupational health, and safety;\n- > fundamentals and hard business skills: digitalization, customer care, cyber security, compliance, sustainable development, fleet development, languages;\n- > reskilling training programs, dedicated to employees who change jobs and to newly appointed team managers.\n\nFurthermore, training paths for key classical roles such as manager, project manager or expert have been built and rolled out as a reference. At Transavia France, a training module dedicated to managers was launched at the end of 2021 and started at the beginning of 2022, focusing on the development of specific soft and hard skills.\n\nAt Transavia Netherlands, a new vision on learning and development has been developed. The airline took the steps required to build its Learning hub, a learning and development ecosystem aiming at centralizing personal behavioral training; it is now built and delivered the first content in 2022.\n\nAt KLM, to support hybrid working, the teams and leaders are assisted in the possibilities and choices with a roadmap, a team guide, an e-learning module on safe working from home (for 4,000/uni00A0o/ffice employees) and materials with which to organize webinars, all aimed at creating a safe, welcoming and productive working environment in hybrid working conditions.\n\n## Developing performance management\n\nIn the shift from performance management to performance development, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's approach to performance appraisal is now oriented towards a forward-looking and appreciative process based on encouraging feedback to contribute to professional maturity, career development and sustainable employability. In these individual conversations, managers are asked to put the emphasis on talent and the development of the expertise and actions needed to enhance an individual's value in both their current and future roles and activities. The aim is to help identify employees' talents and their individual growth potential, and thus maximize everyone's contribution to the Company's results.\n\nAt Air/uni00A0France, this program is supported by a tool developed internally and is positioned as a management transformation lever. It is based on two key concepts: continuous performance management and multi-evaluation. Development of the feedback process builds employee skills and, consequently, enhances individual and collective performance. Managers conducts at least one annual interview with every member of their teams to assess their performance for the year and their potential development for the following year. In 2022, Air/uni00A0France reinforced its performance management process with dedicated support for managers in their roles: the Management Lab enabled hundreds of managers to share best practices, advertise learning and development opportunities and connect to each other.\n\nAt KLM, a new performance appraisal format was introduced in 2021 and it is now time to evaluate the feedback after the first year of use and the large number of conversations taking place during 2022. The aim is to further improve the adoption and the quality of the conversations.",

Overall, the sessions were evaluated with a average score of eight;\n- > for new leaders, a 'fundamental leadership program' was launched in 2022 and 11/uni00A0groups have already started this program. The main focus points are people skills, managing an inclusive working environment, people sustainability, talent development and the set up for success and results;\n- > for experienced leaders a 'modular leadership program' was developed in 2022 and should be launched in 2023 with the first two groups starting in January. The modules cover self-awareness and development, connection and navigation, inclusive leadership, attract, engage and retain, reflect and optimize and the set up for success and results in a complex and changing environment;\n- > since 2019, for shift leaders in the operational divisions, KLM has been running a leadership program which has already benefited 20/uni00A0groups of employees. The program has now been updated, based on changing circumstances and feedback. The mandatory modules are communication skills, connect, leading teams and supportive leadership;\n- > for functional leaders in the operational divisions, KLM started a leadership program in 2022 with a kick-o/ff attended by 40/uni00A0people from several divisions. The program aims to enable hundreds of functional leaders to improve their people skills, create a safe and sustainable working environment and to lead for results;\n- > about 150/uni00A0employees benefitted from customized development programs like the Senior Leadership development program for Senior Management, the Focus on Your Future leadership development program for middle management, the Reflective Leadership Day and the Development of Leadership Skills Under Pressure focus for top management;\n- > within the Flight Operations division, to dispose of a large enough pool of qualified candidates available for the ancillary positions (next to being a pilot) in future, KLM created the Talent Development Pool, where employees with potential to grow follow a specific learning journey. As part of the 18/uni00A0to 24-month program, they work on projects within the Company, receive guidance about their personal development (coaching, mentoring, development assessment), and attend in-depth training days and inspiring masterclasses. In 2022, the program was designed and the first candidates were selected.\n\nIn 2022, Transavia Netherlands renewed its vision of leadership development and took the first steps in putting this into action with the launch of a Leadership Day in November. Looking at the many new managers, the airline also focused on connection and knowledge exchange with online peer groups of leaders and with wider circles.\n\nIn line with the Group's new leadership model, to support the challenges of the business and to accelerate its transformation, Air/uni00A0France updated the cross-functional skills reference framework for executives and managers and rolled it out in 2022. It defines the required soft and hard skills with the levels of proficiency that executives and managers can call on to develop their teams and their own skills. To supplement the manager toolbox, the training and development o/ffer has been enhanced accordingly, with assessment and self-assessment tools to measure skill gaps and better identify the relevant individual plans. For instance:\n\n- > knowledge of self: transversal competencies auto-diagnostic, mirroring ('retour d'image') 360\u00b0;\n- > individual coaching and mentoring;\n- > peer sharing: The Managers Lab program dedicated to managers numbered 450/uni00A0participants in 2022 and the 'Coup de Pouce' co-development initiative has embarked one hundred employees since its creation in June.\n\nKLM and Air/uni00A0France continue to o/ffer talent and leadership programs like the Femmes de Talent training and coaching program, aimed at enabling high-potential women to develop their leadership skills within the Group and occupy senior management positions.\n\n## Developing skills in various manners\n\nWith a lot of newcomers and employees transitioning into di/fferent roles within the Company, helping people to be up to their jobs is more important than ever. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has invested via the Human Resources departments, in supporting the whole organization in the analysis of performance gaps, researching development and learning needs, designing learning experiences and developing learning products. Aside from an increase in levels of performance, we expect these activities to have a positive impact on employee engagement within their field of work, on retention and ultimately on employee satisfaction.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

With the online platform tool MyTalent on the 'TalentBase' platform, KLM feeds and stimulates employee thinking about the use of their interests and talents. Employees can run several scans to explore their skills, motivation and talents, and can match these against vacancies within the Company and in other organizations in the Netherlands. Since December/uni00A02022, MyTalent has also been available in English; with this upgrade a wider range of employees can be reached.\n\nNextGen is an inclusive Air/uni00A0France program benefitting young graduate employees with various profiles and skillsets, that respects the employees' pace, development objectives and motivation. Employees are individually supported in their development and integration events; conferences throughout the year, talent manager support (buddy system, industry discovery), Yammer network, a dedicated Learning channel and o/ff-site visits, all energize the Next Gen Program.\n\nThe 'Spirit for the Future' program aims to meet the need for inspiration and to enhance skills and knowledge, to promote personal growth, to make an impact, to expand the vision of the airline and to build a network outside the employees' immediate work surroundings. It had been built during the crisis with the aim of retaining the talents identified as changemakers, the key players in the transformation. The program is still relevant and, to date, more than a hundred middle managers and specialists have participated in it, with the last four groups successfully launched in 2022.\n\nIn 2022. KLM created the skills and competency strategy roadmap, outlining the inter-dependent steps, pilot programs and trials needed to evolve towards a more skills-based organization, whilst maintaining the strengths of working with competencies. With the support of the Steering Committee three pilots were identified as priority and implementation has begun. They cover the building of a skills passport via AI using the digital information available within the organization, the development of the skills required for the future and experimentation with the di/fferent recruitment methods based on competencies, skills and experience.\n\nIn 2021, Transavia Netherlands managed the restructuring of the Transavia ground organization and a dedicated team is making progress towards an inclusive talent management policy, focused on mobilizing everyone's talents. This Talent Management initiative has been formally adopted within the Career Journey team. In 2022 the airline hired a talent expert in the Career Journey team who, together with 70/uni00A0Transavia Netherlands employees, built a vision and the action plan steps towards realizing this vision, aimed at a roll-out in the next two years.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM numbers a large proportion of senior employees and is developing dedicated initiatives related to skills development and career opportunities. The new 2023-2024 PACTE agreement signed in July/uni00A02022 will come into force on January/uni00A01, 2023. It includes special arrangements for seniors' employment, learning, skills development, health and retirement planning.\n\nAs with many organizations in the Netherlands, KLM has an ageing working population. To better understand and enable this population to remain fit for the future, a multidisciplinary team has used design thinking to research the needs of this target population and has built answers with both low-hanging fruit and longer-term solutions.\n\n## Reinforced steering of mobility\n\nIn 2022, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group rea/ffirmed its commitment to promoting skills-based mobility. The Group identified the connection of people, skills and opportunities as a key factor in success and a contributor to talent management and sustainable employability.\n\nThroughout 2022, the steering process for transverse mobility between the di/fferent Group companies, deployed in December/uni00A02020, was activated to enable the more e/ffective matching of requirements and resources, and to foster the development of human capital.\n\nDuring 2022, KLM adjusted rapidly to the numerous internal and external labor market changes, and continued to build a strong employer brand. The Company further optimized the candidate journey, updated its communication and simplified the application process removing the requirement for a letter of motivation. Due to its agile team structure, KLM was rapidly able to adapt to the sudden change in internal mobility forecasts. As of the end of 2021, KLM was already preparing for the roll-out of a series of external recruitment campaigns that were launched during 2022, specifically in the technical and IT functions.\n\nAs a pilot for the E&M population, the initiative 'At the helm of your own development' encourages employees to build a match between their experience and ambition, making optimal use of their talents. In May and June/uni00A02022, the Company successfully organized workshops for operational staff and managers along with individual career coaching involving approximately 80/uni00A0employees.",

Based on this trial, KLM continued to develop and o/ffer workshops for both employees and managers and is expanding its pool of career coaches.\n\nTo attract applicants for logistics and limit heavy work to a limited period of time, KLM Ground Services is now o/ffering a new five-year contract with a development program for operational sta/ff. Employees are recruited for a limited period as a member of Team Member Operations (TMO) with a development program which includes a path towards a logistics diploma and career guidance. Employees will switch work location (baggage handling/ platform) after 18/uni00A0months and, after five years, they will leave the role of TMO. The promotion of the new contract format at company open door events and job fairs has resulted in the arrival of new employees who started in TMO in October/uni00A02022, with a training program planned from January/uni00A02023.\n\nThe Management Traineeships were adapted, enabling young top talents to find their way within the organization and use their skills to contribute to creating a more innovative, sustainable, people-orientated and e/fficient organization.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France established the Mobility Steering Committee to address the challenges of matching needs and resources linked to activity reorganization. The aim was to monitor sta/ffing levels and skill sets, to bring visibility to applications from employees whose positions have been made redundant and to focus on the need for external recruitment to fill the gaps for rare or specific skills. The Mobility Steering Committee also promotes the retention and development of talents, bringing agility to both selection and development.\n\nIn 2022, in response to the significant number of new recruits, Air/uni00A0 France set up and pro-actively implemented a dedicated onboarding process for new positions.\n\n## Internal coaching and mentoring continue to be o/ffered at the di/fferent levels of the Company\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group promotes all kinds of positive and constructive feedback, seeing this as an important dimension in development and also contributing to a healthy working environment: on-the-spot and timely feedback, individual conversations, 360\u00b0/uni00A0and other forms of feedback are all encouraged throughout the Group, supplemented by internal or external coaching and mentoring.\n\nThe o/ffer of peer-to-peer co-development sessions for managers has been relaunched within Air/uni00A0France. Specific training aiming at developing managers in using feedback and coaching their teams have been developed and training courses have been rolled out.\n\nDiagnostic tools such as 360\u00b0/uni00A0feedback saw a wider roll-out in 2022 and individual mentoring and coaching continued to be deployed. Mentors are matched carefully based on their expertise to the specific learning/mentoring needs of the mentees as expressed in the various programs. In 2022 the design of a Mentor marketplace through our Talent system (SAP SuccessFactors) was completed and should be rolled out in 2023.\n\nIn 2022, Transavia Netherlands improved and expanded its team coaching product. With a team of more than a dozen internal coaches based on the roles it supported 40/uni00A0teams with behavioral coaching and some fifty individuals within these teams with additional individual coaching. The airline also piloted its first team coaching product that combined behavioral and functional coaching (way of working) and a first multi-cultural team coaching workshop.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Various initiatives have been implemented in the airlines to support this commitment.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM strongly believes that a diverse and inclusive workforce has a positive impact on the performance of the organization and thus continues to support all forms of action to encourage equal opportunity, equity between men and women, LGBTIQ+ and under-represented minority networks, the vocational integration of young people, the transmission of knowledge and skills, and the maintained employment and recruitment of persons with disabilities.\n\nThe decrease in the intensity of the global pandemic, with its far-reaching societal and economic implications, presents both opportunities for and challenges to promoting Diversity & Inclusion within the workplace. Prior to Covid-19, the business imperatives for Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) had become increasingly clear with, as a consequence, an increased management commitment and e/fforts directed at reinforcing D&I. As part of its restructuring, Diversity & Inclusion remains a key priority in the transformation of the Group, of the teams, and of every individual.\n\nIn September/uni00A02021, the Group launched an internal assessment to understand its current D&I departure point and its transversal mindset going forward to emerge stronger from the crisis. The goal was to further improve and encourage an inclusive culture and leadership, improve our approach to combating all forms of discrimination and inequality, make our progress more measurable based on relevant data, insights and good practices, and prioritize decentralized activation based on specific needs, with clear objectives and initiatives. In November/uni00A02021, a D&I survey was sent to all employees within the Group and the strong response rate testified to their keen interest in the topic. The objective of the survey was to develop deeper insights into multiple aspects, like representation, inclusion and equity.\n\nThe Group's priorities are based on stakeholder needs, improvement points and external good practices, and they mainly touch on the dimensions of leadership, culture and measurement. The results were analyzed in early 2022, providing deep insights into employee perception on D&I; they now form recognized elements for our baseline. To anchor diversity and inclusion in the day-to-day lives of our employees and teams within the Company, we have worked on the raising of awareness around the topic, the sharing of our ambition and the deep understanding of our starting point, as a first step in our multi-year plan.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## * Measures and performance\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has set itself a long-term objective of reaching parity between men and women within the Group Executive Committee and within the top 10% highest levels of management.\n\nIn addition, in parallel with the French entities achieving their diversity targets in accordance with the deadlines set by the French law, medium-term targets of a minimum of 40% women within the Group Executive Committee and 40% of the top 10% management level positions to be held by women by 2030 have also been set by the Board of Directors. Concretely, in the event of the recruitment and/or appointment of new members and candidates with equal skills, expertise and management qualities, preference is given to female candidates. An action plan has been deployed with a stronger focus on the careers and promotion of female profiles at all levels of management. In 2022, 31% of the members of the Group Executive Committee were women.\n\nIn 2022, the proportion of women in managerial positions continued to increase for all categories of sta/ff:\n\nRepartition of women/men in managerial positions\n\n| Pursers (Cabin crew)                            |       | 34.9%       |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------|-------------|\n| Flight Captains (Pilots)                        |       |             |\n| Ground Sta/ff (10% of highest management level) | 35.4% | 64.6% 94.1% |\n\nMore diverse and inclusive organizations are known to attract more talent and be more customer driven, have higher levels of employee engagement, take better decisions and be more innovative and creative. All these factors are key to the shared ambition established by the two airlines in terms of equal opportunity and combating all forms of bias and discrimination.\n\nIn 2022, Air-France KLM started work on building its D&I governance, with the appointment of a Group D&I O/fficer. The Group is supported by a solid structure in the airlines: KLM has a D&I Circle responsible for defining the strategy in the Netherlands and safeguarding overall quality and execution of the roadmap. An independent D&I Ecosystem has been established, with representatives from the di/fferent businesses supporting the execution and translating the D&I needs into local goals and actions. Air/uni00A0France is supported by a centralized D&I team which defines the direction, launches actions and interacts closely with all management levels to embody the change and make it tangible in all areas of the Company. Improvement in Diversity & Inclusion is a journey during which we pay constant attention to the way our employees experience this cultural transformation. The evolution of their perception about their own inclusion within their teams will guide us on the path. As a result of our first D&I survey, 76% agreed with the statement 'I feel welcome and included within my teams'.",

The entities have managed this participation in di/fferent ways in accordance with their countries and cultures.\n\nIn November/uni00A02022, Air/uni00A0France organized the Diversity & Inclusion Month, during which webinars, forums, training courses and challenges reiterated the Company's D&I ambitions and explained its concrete actions. Employees were able to participate in interactive and experiential workshops and the new inclusive manager's guide was distributed and widely advertised.\n\nAt KLM, the D&I Learning and Development initiatives support the achievement of inclusive thinking and doing, throughout the organization, touching recruiters (unconscious bias and the ways to remove structural barriers and systematic bias), leaders (organizational sensitivity and micro-aggression, inclusivity and unconscious bias, courageous conversations with (female) leaders), all staff (introduction of personal assessment on inclusive thinking and doing based on a scientific approach by the University of Leiden). All employees are o/ffered a D&I budget for education and development. They are free to choose how they allocate this grant and can opt to be trained via the KLM portal MyLearning/Goodhabitz, to buy days o/ff or to pay out the remaining balance.\n\n## Promoting gender equality\n\nImproving gender equality is key in the Diversity & Inclusion journey as it helps support a widespread cultural change; this improvement goal is promoted and activated throughout all our entities and at various levels.\n\nThe 'Talent to the Top' Charter, signed by KLM's President & CEO in March/uni00A02019, contains guidelines and clear agreements that help KLM to purposefully work towards durable and e/ffective results, with progress monitored around defined criteria and an inter-company Cross-Mentoring program for women.\n\nAt the beginning of 2022, the Gender Balance Act came into force in the Netherlands and the Dutch Social Economic Council (SER) now monitors compliance. This Gender Balance Act provides strict guidelines for:\n\n- > a quota of at least one-third male and one-third female members on the Supervisory Boards of Dutch listed companies. This is not applicable to KLM however since the Company had decided to voluntarily comply with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code;\n- > a self-determined target and reporting obligation for 'large' entities, applicable to KLM. An appropriate and ambitious target to promote gender diversity on KLM's Board of Managing Directors and Supervisory Board as well as for the Executive Team has been set. Each year KLM must report on the implementation and progress to the SER. In addition, this report will also form part of KLM's annual report.\n\nFor Air/uni00A0France, professional and wage equality between men and women is a major priority in which the Company would like to make further progress in terms of human resource management. This undertaking was reflected in the signature, in January/uni00A02022, of a sixth three-year agreement with the unions on Professional Gender Equality. It aims to accelerate economic and professional equality over the next three years and now includes new measures that represent significant progress for professional equality and the fight against sexism; it contains quantified targets for the proportion of women in management roles and management committees.\n\nTo ensure equal treatment between men and women, male-female comparative indicators are tracked annually within each division of the Company (training, careers, vocational safety, remuneration,/uni00A0etc.). Special wage equalization and equitable salary management measures are in place, together with an annual review of male and female comparative remuneration.\n\nTo encourage women to access the highest management positions, coaching and mentoring initiatives are in place to promote their career progression. In 2022, 40/uni00A0participants benefited from the 'Femmes de Talent' coaching program. The female leaders who completed the Female Leadership Program (FLP) in 2019-2021 now share their learning and experience with other aspiring female employees through a Female Leadership Workshop which has already benefited approximately 80/uni00A0colleagues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

In 2022, 60/uni00A0female pupils from middle schools participated in the smart city and industry week organized by 'Elles Bougent', thereby benefiting from insights into maintenance, flight operations and IT career choices. In the Netherlands, Engine Services participated in a Girls' Day on April/uni00A07/uni00A0to inspire young girls to choose a technical future. Air/uni00A0France is a partner of 'Air Emploi' and supports the 'F\u00e9minisons les M\u00e9tiers de l'A\u00e9ronautique';\n- > on the occasion of the International Women's Rights Day in 2022, Air/uni00A0France organized a 100% female commercial flight to Cayenne, whose crew was 100% women. On arrival, the station team was also 100% women;\n- > in March/uni00A02022, Air/uni00A0France signed a Charter of commitment with other companies in the aviation and aeronautics sector 'F\u00e9minisons les m\u00e9tiers de l'a\u00e9ronautique et du spatial'. A special competition with female students was organized with the aim of raising awareness of aeronautics and space industry career opportunities and promoting access for young female students.\n\n## Prevention of sexism and harassment\n\nThe Group has zero tolerance policy with respect to any form of discrimination and inequitable treatment. Bullying, harassment, and any other harmful behavior which stems from discrimination has no place within our Group and our corporate culture. We have zero tolerance for any form of harassment, whether of a sexual, verbal, physical, or psychological nature. We are committed to increasing the awareness of protection and improving our prevention measures. In 2022 we intensified our awareness raising and actions to prevent sexism and sexual harassment.\n\nThe 'Sexisme, pas notre genre' anti-sexism videohad been launched at the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women in 2017. With the hashtag #Osonsledire, employees could share on the social network the sexist remarks they had witnessed in the workplace. As an extension of this operation, a second initiative dubbed '#Osonslefaire' was launched in the Yammer group. This initiative aims to identify internal solutions to combating sexism in the workplace.\n\nIn November/uni00A02022, a booklet on 'Preventing and Acting against Violence and Sexual and Moral Harassment at Work' was rolled-out after the zero-tolerance principle was rea/ffirmed by the Air/uni00A0France Executive Committee.\n\nBecause violence against women in the private sphere also has an impact on professional life (stress, absenteeism, isolation,/uni00A0etc.), Air/uni00A0France is committed to preventing, helping to understand and providing assistance to victims of domestic violence. In 2022, Air/uni00A0France joined the 'One in 3/uni00A0Women' network, the first European network of companies committed to combating violence against women.\n\nDuring a round-table event focused on 'undesirable behavior' - harassment (sexual), intimidation, bullying, discrimination and micro-aggression - awareness is raised and employees are helped to understand what undesirable behavior is, how to stop this happening and where to go for help.\n\n## Equal opportunities within the Group: persons with disabilities\n\nThroughout the Covid-19 public health crisis and despite a challenging economic situation, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has rea/ffirmed its commitment to welcoming persons with disabilities.\n\nThe 2021-23/uni00A0Disability Agreement was signed in January/uni00A02021. Through this eleventh agreement, Air/uni00A0France rea/ffirms its desire to pursue an ambitious policy by maintaining the recruitment of people with disabilities, by pursuing actions on their employability, training and professional support via, in particular, coaching and co-development. Changes were also related to adapting workstations at home to encourage home working, suitable career support, the implementation of measures in favor of family carers and, more particularly, employees who are parents of children with disabilities.\n\nFor the fourth year running, Air/uni00A0France took part in the DuoDay (30/uni00A0Duos at Air/uni00A0France) and organized remote internships for school children with disabilities. During the European Week for the Employment of People with Disabilities, many awareness-raising initiatives were organized, for instance mental disability awareness sessions and webinars for employees who are parents of children with disabilities.\n\nIn 2022, the hiring of employees with disabilities was maintained, along with dedicated actions towards the retention of people with disabilities. The airline strongly supports suppliers who employ people with disabilities. Thus, about forty external organizations have signed agreements with Air/uni00A0France, to cover activities such as the laundering of blankets or bolting in aircraft maintenance.\n\nAt KLM, pursuant to Dutch Law, all employees have equal rights in the workplace. Di/fferentiating between employees on the basis of disability or chronic disease is not permitted. Adjustment of tasks or the work environment to assist a person with a disability to perform the job in question are considered. It is only when people with a disability or health condition are unable to fulfil the tasks necessary to do a job e/ffectively that employers may refuse to hire them, especially if health or safety is a major issue.",

In 2019, Air/uni00A0France's Chief Executive O/fficer, Anne Rigail, signed the association L'Autre Cercle's LGBT+ Commitment Charter.\n\nWith the signature of Workplace Pride's Declaration of Amsterdam in 2021 KLM committed to developing a working environment where openness and equality are fundamental, and where there is an explicit awareness of diversity, inclusion and the LGBTIQ+ community.\n\nIn 2022, KLM organized three all-LGBTIQ+ flights to New York, Barcelona and Paramaribo on the occasion of the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, Intersexism and Transphobia, campaigning for LGBTIQ+ diversity and inclusion across the globe. KLM led a Pride 'road show' involving colleagues discussing D&I at di/fferent KLM locations and engaging in external societal activities at a local home for the elderly. A transgender policy is now in place and is being enforced.\n\nOur Employee Resources Groups play a key role in providing insight about under-represented population groups, increasing awareness and enhancing discussions. KLM expanded its internal Networks with the network Connecting Colors that was o/fficially launched on March/uni00A021, 2022 - the International Day against Racism and Discrimination. The network focuses on contributing to a working environment that is free of racism and discrimination and acts worldwide to connect and share insights for colleagues with a bi-cultural ethnic background.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group takes into consideration the diverse situations of employees in their personal lives. Air/uni00A0France has support initiatives in place to optimize the return to work after maternity or parental leave and to promote a serene resumption of activity combining their private and professional lives for employees who recently become parents (men and women).\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM o/ffers flexible working conditions to all employees whose positions enable this, subject to the service requirement. Thus, part-time employment is widespread within our entities (see the social indicators).\n\n## Adapted initiatives for young people\n\nYouth diversityis reflected in the diversity of our initiatives, covering a wide spectrum of socio-economic backgrounds and educational levels. As part of a growing commitment to the territories in which they exercise their activities, the airlines have stepped up their support for educational actions in line with the airline industry.\n\nAir/uni00A0France cooperates with the Association for Training in Aviation Professions (AFMAE) and works with local organizations and French job centers (P\u00f4le Emploi) to identify profiles who could benefit from educational actions linked to the airline industry.\n\nA collaboration between JEREMY and Air/uni00A0France's Maintenance division, AFMAE and Grand Paris Seine Bi\u00e8vre has been successful and o/ffers a pre-training program to unemployed young people, enabling them to be prepared for the AFMAE selections and to integrate a two-year or three-year apprenticeship. In 2022, 19/uni00A0 young people benefited from this program and Air/uni00A0France welcomed 12/uni00A0of them on apprenticeship contracts. In 2022, around 9% of the apprentices in Air/uni00A0France came from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds (Quartiers Prioritaires de la Ville).\n\nIn 2022, Air/uni00A0France partnered with the local associations 'Article 1' and 'Nos Quartiers Ont du Talent' to sponsor secondary school students and young graduates from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds and to help them succeed in their studies or in their professional integration. In line with its commitment to helping local young people find employment, Air/uni00A0 France has voluntarily signed the governmental PAQTE programs agreement, 'La France, Une Chance, Les Entreprise S'ententent' and '1/uni00A0student, 1/uni00A0solution'. In parallel, Air/uni00A0France in partnership with the association 'Tous en Stage' continues to regularly welcome students in year three of secondary school for an internship lasting a few days.\n\nAir/uni00A0France supports its interns nearing the end of their contracts in partnership with Sodesi. Workshops on job-seeking techniques, building self-confidence and starting a business are thus proposed to interns. A dedicated website enabling them to access numerous job o/ffers, training and internships but also training content is made available to them.\n\nIn 2022, KLM worked on developing a new Management Trainee program to be implemented in 2023. KLM's Management Traineeship is the fast lane to KLM leadership, aimed at the rapid development of recent Bachelor and Master graduates into leadership roles. The two-year program is a combination of 'on the job' learning in four di/fferent assignments each lasting six months and learning from and with each other. Every Friday the trainees are fully dedicated to personal and professional development with topics such as self-reflection, strengths, resilience, D&I and energy management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

Everyone working for or with the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has the right to a healthy and safe working environment that takes into account their physical and mental well-being.\n\nThe public health crisis had major human consequences for every one of us and thus for the Group's employees. Remote working, partial activity, and also and especially the Job Protection and Voluntary Departure Plan formalized in 2020, had human repercussions that the Company supported with care.\n\nIn 2022, the global inflationary economic environment and the steep ramp-up in activity against the backdrop of a tight labor market put the airline sector's workforce under pressure; Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM needs to foresee and support its employees in this new context.\n\n## * Measures and performance\n\nOn an annual basis, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group measures and reports the indicators related to health and safety at work: absenteeism, number of workplace accidents, frequency rate and severity rate of workplace accidents (see sections 4.2.6.2 and 4.2.6.3).\n\nThe Health, Safety and Quality of Life at Work Department within the Human Resources division of Air/uni00A0France is responsible for steering and coordinating the health, safety and quality of life at work networks. This department has representatives in all of the Company's business lines, enabling coordinated deployment of the policy, actions and objectives. Accident analysis is used to adjust the policy and actions designed to protect the health and safety of individuals. The monitoring of indicators ensures that the initiatives are continuously adapted.\n\nWithin both Transavia Netherlands and KLM, safety and compliance are achieved via a continuous system of processes and procedures known as the Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS). The ISMS guarantees the safety performance of all processes, in all domains, through the e/ffective management of safety risks. Safety and compliance are continuously improved via collaboration between the tasks and responsibilities of the Integrated Safety Services Organization (ISSO) and the divisions/business units. The ISMS identifies hazards, threats and safety issues, collects and analyses data, assesses safety risks, implements mitigations and monitors the results. The ISMS supports the mitigation of risks in order to keep accident and incident rates below an 'acceptable level' and to further improve the occupational safety and health performance, the mitigation team of occupational experts continues to support the\n\nline management and their departments in the implementation of KLM's Occupational Safety and Health policies and the mitigation of the occupational safety and health risks. In 2022, we had two fatal accidents respectively due to a heart attack for a remote worker, and a case of malaria for a crew member.\n\n## Permanent adaptation and application of the health measures\n\nIn line with the previous years, the focus in 2022 remained on managing the consequences and impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, and adapting and continuing the risk prevention measures for the Group's operations.\n\nThese measures consisted of implementing procedures to protect employees from the risk of the pandemic in line with the recommendations from the public health authorities and the national protocol in response to the unfolding public health crisis. The deployment of these measures was accompanied by the reinforcement of the intelligence teams and the monitoring of the cases and contacts by the occupational medicine teams, a statistical focus on the declarations and the permanent availability of occupational experts to approve the prevention measures.\n\nDuring 2022, the focus was on the return to normal operations within the boundaries of safety and compliance with the worldwide Covid-19 regulations. Within the framework of the risk inventory and evaluation, further in-depth studies were conducted in the areas of physical load, work equipment and psychosocial workloads. External authorities and companies such as Baines Simmons IATA and DSS+ performed assessments in both the operational and occupational domains, further strengthening the Safety Culture within the Company.\n\n## Reinforced prevention of psycho-social risks\n\n## Listening, counselling, supporting\n\nAt Air/uni00A0France, a network of committed players made up of doctors, psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, prevention o/fficers and Health, Safety and Quality of Life in the Workplace advisors support employees and care for their well-being and health in the workplace in all entities of the Company including:\n\n- > since 2021, for sta/ff facing personal or professional di/fficulties, Air/uni00A0France has offered a completely anonymous and confidential psychological support and advice program with a 24/7/uni00A0number.

A dedicated program relying on peer support with specifically-trained employees is available for aircrew experiencing professional fragility.\n\nAt KLM, a procedure for complaints about inappropriate behavior is in place with a pool of skilled confidential advisors and a Complaints Committee. They provide employees with independent consultation, advice on how to deal with inappropriate behavior and support in filing reports or complaints.\n\nA range of training options is available, from workshops for team development to interventions when serious issues arise in the teams. The management can also bring in external expertise or request mediation.\n\nExperts in the Corporate Social Work department (Gimd) remain available for all forms of mental support.\n\n## Prevention\n\nIn addition to the listening and counselling initiatives mentioned above, the Company continually adapts and enriches its preventive actions.\n\nIn the Netherlands, as with the D&I survey results, the attention paid to social security in the workplace by the Netherlands Labour Authority and the increased awareness of inappropriate behavior within Dutch society has led to a review of the reporting policy, processes, existing mitigating measures and interventions. A policy, training program and communication on inappropriate behavior have been rolled out and are available for employees and managers.\n\nContinuous company-wide execution of Safety Issue Risk Analyses on the virus and the monitoring/introduction of new regulations, procedures and methodologies have ensured the appropriate measures and mitigations are in place to maintain safety. To guarantee the safety of all employees, the Covid-19 regulations have constantly been adapted and wherever possible improved with more rules added following safety studies and risk analysis.\n\nThe mental health of employees working under increased pressure and/or from home is monitored via surveys. Initiatives to safeguard social coherence are also carried out throughout the Company:\n\n- > psycho-social Risks Observatory: every month a sample of 1,000/uni00A0employees is polled to assess the level of stress, depression and anxiety of sta/ff. This observatory is managed by occupational medicine and the survey results are shared with the Central Health Committee (CSSCT) and can lead to the implementation of specific action plans;\n- > a Learning Channel was launched in the summer of 2022, with an extensive library of digital training content which encourages everyone to be a player in Health, Safety and Quality of Life at the Workplace;\n- > to raise still further the professional standards of the Health, Safety and Quality of Life in the Workplace representatives and Human Resources players, a training module has been made available giving guidance on how to conduct investigations in the domain of discrimination and harassment.\n\nAt KLM, tackling inappropriate behavior was a focus in 2022 and is now an integral part of leadership training and team workshops at divisional level:\n\n- > this topic is continuously addressed on various media, through meet and talk events with employees or in the presence of confidential advisors, and via a movie in the briefing rooms of in-flight and flight operations;\n- > KLM's Code of Conduct and policy for psychosocial occupational safety have both been updated setting the appropriate standards for professional behavior.\n\nDue to the many voluntary and compulsory departures linked to the crisis, followed by a ramp-up of activity within a tight labor market, workload management and stress were important themes in 2022. KLM o/ffered various interventions, webinars and workshops to support its employees in stress management. As in previous years, KLM participated in the Week van de Werkstress, or Stress in the Workplace Week, whose theme this year was 'Mentally Strong!'. A video training module is available on how to prevent too much pressure, at home or at work, leading to stress.\n\nStaying both physically and mentally fit has been particularly important during the pandemic and periods of lockdown or quarantine and remains key to managing workload appropriately. To highlight good practices and encourage employees to take this question seriously, the airlines have deployed various initiatives, such as:\n\n- > on-the-spot  physiotherapy;\n- > physically strong: various interventions to stay/become physically strong such as Urban Trails and Hello Fit (online exercises on the MyHealth portal);\n- > care and preventive measures with webinars on various topics like sleep, losing weight and menopausal complaints;\n- > on the topic of stress, the Center of Expertise Health has hosted a webinar to provide basic information while workshops o/ffer additional information and learning practice on topics like 'Master your work-stress!' and the 'Early recognition of mental complaints among employees';\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

The portal is currently\n\nbeing upgraded and there are plans to also give Transavia Netherlands Cabin Crew employees access, with a health budget aligned with that of the Ground Sta/ff.\n\nIn 2021 Transavia Netherlands started looking into whether a hybrid way of working could be introduced. Di/fferent hybrid working methods were tested during a three-month pilot among 40% of the o/ffice-based workforce, enabling the Company to introduce a hybrid working method in early 2022, to which o/ffice sta/ff gave a score of eight in the Employee Experience survey.\n\nIn 2022, Transavia France introduced the hybrid 2-3-2/uni00A0working method in the o/ffice organization for all colleagues who do not work in operational positions or rosters and who, based on the requirements of their positions, (also) work from home. To ensure the health and safety of its home workers Transavia has developed a number of interventions: employees can take o/ffice supplies and furniture such as a desk, chair or keyboard from the o/ffice to use at home; a mandatory online course explains how to work from home in a healthy and safe way.\n\nWithin the Group, there are many and varied initiatives to promote physical activity and/or sports. In France, the organization and promotion of sports activities and the use of sports facilities and halls are carried out by the CSE (Social and Economic Committees) and are implemented in conjunction with the ASAF (Amicale Sportive d'Air/uni00A0France). KLM promotes sports via traditional communication channels (e.g. NewsApp, My Health) and also organizes sports events for its employees; for example a bootcamp on the King's Day, a soccer tournament for Flight Operations teams or the 5 th /uni00A0KLM Urban Trail in Utrecht.",

Furthermore, in the Netherlands, employees are provided with a Sustainable Employability budget enabling them to choose to receive a maximum of five extra days of annual leave. Three times a year employees can use their annual bonus to purchase an additional maximum of 20/uni00A0days in the event that the balance of their annual leave doesn't su/ffice in that calendar year.

In particular, in France, the father is granted up to 25/uni00A0days of paternity leave or 32/uni00A0days in the event of multiple births and Air/uni00A0France pays a salary supplement to\n\nthe daily social security allowances over this period. In the event that the parents are two fathers, Air/uni00A0France grants paternity leave despite this not being required by law. Women benefit from paid hours of leave for breastfeeding during the child's first year and crew members can opt for schedule arrangements or temporary ground assignments.\n\nWithin Air/uni00A0France, most employees who work part-time are between 30 and 45/uni00A0years old, probably related to parenthood. At the end of December/uni00A02022, the proportion of employees who had chosen to work part-time stood at 18% at Air/uni00A0France and 42% at KLM.\n\n- > Flexibility; At KLM, employees can request a temporary or structural adjustment to their contractual working hours.

        "page_content": "## 4.2.6.4/emspace Note on the methodology for the reporting of the social performance indicators\n\nIn 2005-06, under the aegis of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Disclosure Committee, and validated by the college of Statutory Auditors, the social performance indicators were defined to comply with the requirements of the French New Economic Regulations law (Les Nouvelles R\u00e9gulations Economiques, NRE, May/uni00A015, 2001) and the European Prospectus Directive Regulation (EC 809/2004).\n\nWork on optimizing these indicators was undertaken in 2018 to align the Grenelle II reporting with the new requirements linked to the transposition of the Directive on the Extra-financial performance statement.\n\nSince the 2007-08/uni00A0financial year, the Group has chosen to appoint one of its Statutory Auditors, KPMG Audit, a department of KPMG/uni00A0SA, to be responsible for verifying a selection of its reported social indicators.\n\nSince 2018 and in application of the provisions of Article L./uni00A0 225-102-1/uni00A0of the French Code of Commerce (Code de Commerce), it has been the responsibility of our Independent Third Party to determine the compliance of the Extra-financial performance statement and the accuracy of the published CSR information.\n\n## Reporting scope\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's social reporting consolidation scope is based on the number of employees (expressed as headcount) on the payroll at the end of the calendar year.\n\nThe reporting scope covers 98% of the average employees in the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group at the end of the 2022 calendar year, expressed in full-time equivalent.\n\nThe subsidiaries of Air/uni00A0France and KLM over which the Group exercises control at the 50% minimum, whose acquisition dates back at least one full year and which have at least 250/uni00A0employees, are included in this social reporting scope.\n\nNote that the number of employees for Air/uni00A0France and KLM and its subsidiaries comprises their entire workforce including sta/ff employed internationally:\n\n- > for the 2022 financial year, the Air/uni00A0France consolidated subsidiaries are: Barfield/uni00A0Inc., Blue Connect, BlueLink, BlueLink International CZ, CRMA, HOP, Sodexi and Transavia France, representing 93% of the employees of the subsidiaries in the Air/uni00A0France Group;\n- > for the 2022 financial year, the KLM consolidated subsidiaries are: Cygnific, KLM UK Engineering, KLM Cityhopper, Transavia C.V., KLM Catering Services and Int. Airline Services, representing 86% of the employees in the subsidiaries of the KLM Group.\n\nThe reporting scope for the AF subsidiaries did not change relative to 2021, with no subsidiaries being either included or withdrawn.\n\nThe reporting scope for the KLM subsidiaries did not change relative to 2021, with no subsidiaries being either included or withdrawn.\n\nThe reference number of employees to calculate the coverage rate of the social reporting is the average number of employees in Full Time Equivalent during 2022, derived from the Management Control division's BFC tool.\n\nThe reporting period for the Group's social information is based on the calendar year to ensure consistency with the social performance indicators of other French companies.\n\n## Reporting tools\n\nAs last year, the social reporting has been carried out using the ONEmission tool from the editor Enablon implemented for the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group. Consistency tests have been incorporated within this tool together with precise definitions of each indicator. The data are verified and approved locally at the level of each subsidiary by a manager who is responsible for the HR statistical data.\n\nThis tool is supplemented by overall coordination of the process and by a general reporting procedure which defines the process for compiling, calculating and consolidating the indicators, based on an instruction memorandum circulated by the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's Finance division.\n\nThe consolidation of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's social information is carried out by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's Sustainability & Compliance department.\n\n## Details and methodology - Definition of the key performance indicators and comments on changes in the indicators\n\n## Definition of the key performance indicators\n\n## Employee Promoter Score (EPS)\n\nScope: Air/uni00A0France and KLM (employees on French or Dutch contracts).\n\nThe Employee Promoter Score (or EPS) is the score given to Air/uni00A0France, Transavia France and KLM in their capacity as employers by their employees. This indicator has been measured at Air/uni00A0France and KLM since July/uni00A02019, and at Transavia France since end of 2021, on a weekly basis, based on a random group of employees in the form of a question sent by mail: 'How likely are you to recommend Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM as an employer to friends and family?', on a scale of 0/uni00A0to 10. The EPS corresponds to the di/fference between the percentage of employee promoters (score of 8/uni00A0to 10) of the employer brand and the percentage of detractors (scores 0/uni00A0to 5).\n\nThe indicator measured is the annual change in the consolidated EPS for Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM.\n\n## Percentage of women in management functions (ground sta/ff, pilots, cabin crews)\n\nScope: Air/uni00A0France and KLM employees (expressed as 'headcount') on both permanent (CDI) and fixed-term (CDD) contracts, on the payroll as of December/uni00A031/uni00A0of the reference year.\n\nThe indicator measured is the percentage of women in the three sta/ff categories:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The percentage of women is calculated by combining all the levels of management, classified in descending hierarchical order, until the threshold of 10% of the total salaried workforce of Air/uni00A0France and KLM is reached. For this last level of management, the entire workforce is taken into account;\n- > pilots: percentage of women amongst the pilots exercising management functions (Flight Captain);\n- > cabin crews: percentage of women amongst the cabin crews exercising management functions (Pursers).\n\n## Number of training hours\n\nSee 'Training' below - Note/uni00A05.\n\n## Comments on changes in the social indicators\n\nIn 2022, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM reported three new indicators:\n\n- > number of trainees among Air/uni00A0France and KLM employees with a contract starting date in 2022;\n- > number of apprentices among Air/uni00A0France and KLM employees with a contract starting date in 2022;\n- > number of young people in the 'Jeunes Talents' program: 'Next Gen' program for Air/uni00A0France, 'Management Trainee' program for KLM, among Air/uni00A0France and KLM employees on the payroll as of December/uni00A031.\n\nNo changes were made to the social indicators in 2022.\n\nFor the other social data dashboard (Absenteeism, Health and Safety, Disabled Sta/ff and Collective Agreements Signed), the data of Air/uni00A0France and its subsidiaries have been aggregated. KLM and its subsidiaries' data have also been aggregated.\n\n## 'Consolidated social data for the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group' table\n\nThis table presents the indicators relating to the number of employees, hires and departures, the proportion of female employees and the percentage of sta/ff working part time. These indicators are consolidated at the level of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group.\n\nThe following notes refer to the references in the social indicator tables (section/uni00A04.2.1).\n\n## Employees\n\nNote/uni00A01: The number of people employed by the Group (expressed as headcount) on both permanent (CDI) and fixed-term contracts (CDD) on December/uni00A031/uni00A0of the reference year.\n\n## Recruitment on permanent contracts\n\nNote/uni00A02: The indicator concerns employees hired on permanent contracts (CDI).\n\nFor Air/uni00A0France, the calculation of the number of employees recruited on permanent contracts includes those initially recruited on fixed-term contracts (CDD) transferring to permanent contracts (CDI) during the year.\n\nFor KLM, only employees recruited directly on permanent contracts are taken into account.\n\n## Percentage of women - Organization of working time\n\nNote/uni00A03: These indicators enable the percentage of women to be evaluated relative to the workforce and the proportion of part-time employees on both permanent and fixed-term contracts at December/uni00A031/uni00A0of the reference year.\n\n## Employees by geographical zone at December/uni00A031\n\nNote/uni00A04: In 2022, the Air/uni00A0France Group employees in the French Overseas Departments and Territories, i.e. 581/uni00A0employees, have been included in the Caribbean-Indian Ocean geographical zone.\n\n## Training\n\nNote/uni00A05: The 'Number of training hours by employee' indicator is calculated based on all the training sessions, divided by the average monthly headcount. This indicator is presented at Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group consolidated level.\n\nFor KLM and the KLM subsidiaries, the hours of external training dispensed to KLM Group administrative employees and the hours of training given to employees of the Transavia Netherlands subsidiary (less than 10% of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's headcount) are not included in the 'Training Hours' indicator due to there being no information collation process in place. Measures will be taken to progressively expand the reporting scope of the indicator in the coming financial years. The subsidiaries regrouped under KLM International are managed independently locally and KLM Group only has access to e-learning training.\n\nNote: the total number of training hours in 2022 for the KCS subsidiary was estimated on the basis of the total number of training hours reported in 2021. Due to a technical problem, the entity was unable to provide reliable data for the 2022 reporting exercise. For information, the KCS workforce represents 1% of the total workforce of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group.\n\n## 'Other social data' tables\n\nThe indicators reported in the 'Other social data' tables are subject to di/fferent qualification and legal reporting obligations in France and the Netherlands, meaning that they are not comparable and need to be presented separately for Air/uni00A0France and KLM. The subsidiaries concerned in these tables are listed in the reporting scope section above.\n\n## Absenteeism - Health and safety in the workplace (Note/uni00A01)\n\nA significant portion of the work-related accidents reported by Air/uni00A0France is due to cases of barometric otitis and musculoskeletal disorders which are recognized as work-related accidents in France whereas they are recorded as sick leave by KLM in accordance with Dutch law.\n\nAll KLM absences are on a declarative basis due to the local legislation, which unlike in France, requires an evaluation of the employee by KLM Health Services only after six weeks of absence. For work-related absences, only absences following a work-related accident are easily detected.",

The sector's emissions thus represent more than 2% of total global emissions and 10% of those originating from the transport sector. Approximately 80% of emissions come from flights over more than 1,500/uni00A0km (medium and long-haul).\n\nThe sector's emissions increased by 40% between 2005 and 2019 due to strong tra/ffic growth, despite a steady improvement in the energy e/fficiency of aircraft, engines and their operation. A significant reduction in emissions from air transportation is thus a matter of urgency. According to the IEA, the aviation sector is one the most challenging sectors of the global economy to decarbonize. The aviation sector's pathway to Net Zero will require substantial investment in efficiency and disruptive technologies to switch fuel sources, in addition to optimized airspace management and a modal shift. IATA recently set a course towards Net Zero emissions by 2050. The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, whose emission intensity was reduced by 30% (based on fuel reduction) between 2005 and 2019, is committed to playing a leading role in the sector transition.\n\nSee also section/uni00A03.1.2 'Risks relating to the air transportation activity'.\n\nClimate change is a major concern for the airline industry and for the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group in particular. Attitudes towards the acceptability of air transportation growth are changing at both a political level and in terms of society. Both France and the Netherlands as well as the European Union have implemented policies to ensure the transition to a carbon neutral and climate neutral society by 2050.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group intends to be a player in the transformation of its sector, and aims to occupy a leading role.\n\nPlaying an active role in advancing towards our goal of Net Zero emissions by 2050 at the industry and ICAO levels, and obtaining validation from the SBTi (Science Based Targets Initiative) for our science-based 2030 emission reduction target, were crucial milestones in 2022 and an important marker for the Group, reflecting people's changing perceptions of travel and the call for more responsible aviation (See also section/uni00A03.1.2 'Risks relating to the air transportation activity').\n\n| Key Performance  Indicator                | Definition                                                                                                               | 2021  results                                                                                                            | 2022  results                       | 2030  targets                   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| CO2 e/fficiency  per passenger  kilometer | CO2 footprint for passenger transportation  \u221a                                                                            | 95.5/uni00A0  gCO2eq/ passenger/km                                                                                       | 77.0/uni00A0   gCO2eq/ passenger/km |                                 |\n|                                           | GHG emissions intensity in metric tons   of/uni00A0CO2 equivalents per revenue ton-kilometer  (gCO2eq/RTK)/thinspace (1) | 1,042  gCO2eq/RTK                                                                                                        | 921                                 | 30% reduction  compared to 2019 |\n|                                           | Percentage change in/uni00A0CO2 e/fficiency (gCO2/passenger/km)  between 2005 and 2022 (operational measures only)       | Percentage change in/uni00A0CO2 e/fficiency (gCO2/passenger/km)  between 2005 and 2022 (operational measures only)       | -22.3%                              |                                 |\n| CO2 emissions  from ground  operations    | Percentage change in absolute/uni00A0CO2 emissions (scope/uni00A01&2)   from the ground operations between 2020 and 2022 | Percentage change in absolute/uni00A0CO2 emissions (scope/uni00A01&2)   from the ground operations between 2020 and 2022 | -1.1%                               | Carbon  neutrality              |\n| Non recycled  waste                       | Percentage change in non recycled wastes between 2011 and 2022                                                           | Percentage change in non recycled wastes between 2011 and 2022                                                           | -54%                                | 50% reduction                   |\n| Acoustic  impact/thinspace (2)            | Number of chapter/uni00A04 and 14/thinspace (3)  certified aircraft out of the total  AFKL fleet in operation            | Number of chapter/uni00A04 and 14/thinspace (3)  certified aircraft out of the total  AFKL fleet in operation            | 75%                                 |                                 |\n\n- \u221a Figures verified by KPMG for 2022 (reasonable level of assurance).\n- (1) The GHG emissions intensity measure was created in 2022 (see methodological Note/uni00A04.3.5.4).\n- (2) The measurement of the acoustic impact changed in 2021.\n- (3)  Chapters 4 and 14/uni00A0are the most e/fficient acoustic levels to date for jet aircraft.",

        "page_content": "## 4.3.1/emspace Accelerate the environmental transition\n\n## Climate goals\n\nSince 2019, the Group has accelerated its environmental transition and has set ambitious sustainability performance targets to highlight its sustainability commitment:\n\n- > reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity by 30% by 2030 from the 2019 baseline (gCO2eq/RTK revenue ton-kilometer). These targets were validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in November/uni00A02022 for the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, as well as for Air/uni00A0France and KLM;\n- > replace at least 10% of our Conventional Aviation Fossil Fuel with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2030;\n- > achieve carbon neutrality on the ground/thinspace (1) ;/thinspace\n- > achieve Net Zero emissions by 2050 for the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group,  Air France and KLM submitted their CO/two.inf emissions reduction targets to the SBTi which have been approved in November 2022 by the SBTi's Target Validation Team confirming that they are in line with a well-below 2\u00b0C objective, as determined by the Paris Agreement signed in 2015.\n\nIn addition, the Group has instituted internal carbon pricing, placing a monetary value on greenhouse gas emissions, which is factored into investment decisions.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group will reach its ambitious objectives by working with all the players in the aviation industry - aircraft manufacturers, airlines and industrial partners - as well as with the entire transport sector, including rail partners.\n\n## Our carbon footprint in 2022\n\nKey 2022 emission milestones:\n\n- > reduction of 140,000/uni00A0tons of/uni00A0CO2 due to SAF use in 2022;\n- > SAF contracts signed for 2.4/uni00A0Mt in long-term o/fftake contracts and a pipeline of projects in support of our 2030 SAF target;\n- > a  50%/uni00A0CO2 reduction during two flights (one long-haul and one medium-haul) operated within SkyTeam during the Sustainable Flight Challenge (Scopes 1 + 2 + 3) thanks to the use of a 30% SAF blend and many other actions (weight reduction, air tra/ffic management measures, route optimization, aircraft selection, special catering,/uni00A0etc.);\n- > 63% electrification of our ground equipment services vehicles.\n\n## The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Decarbonization Strategy\n\nMost of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are generated by its direct activities (scope/uni00A01), and mainly by the flight operations which represent 99.8% of the Group's total direct emissions. The ground operations (testing bench, runway vehicles,/uni00A0etc.) represent 0.2% of emissions. Ground operations, like aircraft maintenance and tertiary activities, also generate indirect greenhouse gas emissions through energy consumption in buildings (electricity and air conditioning) (scope/uni00A02).\n\nThe indirect greenhouse gas emissions (scope/uni00A03) mostly come from the upstream phase (extraction, production, distribution,/uni00A0etc.) of aviation kerosene production and carbon emissions from runway vehicles and equipment. The other main indirect components are the purchasing of goods and services, aircraft manufacturing, business travel, and employee commuting.\n\nEvery year, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group reports 100% of its scope/uni00A01 and 2/uni00A0CO2 emissions, and the scope/uni00A03/uni00A0emissions resulting from the upstream phase in aviation kerosene production. These emissions are reported in the form of indicators presented in the environmental indicator tables, accompanied by a definition of the respective scopes (see section/uni00A04.3.5/uni00A0hereinafter).\n\n## Non-CO2 e/ffects\n\nWhile/uni00A0CO2 remains the most commonly cited and probably best-understood pollutant from aviation, its contribution to global E/ffective Radiative Forcing (ERF), i.e. warming, is estimated to be approximately one third of the industry's total impact. Two-thirds of aviation's climate impact is estimated to be caused by other pollutants from jet engines that cause further warming beyond the impact of carbon alone. For example, particulate matter has been linked to the formation of condensation trails (the cloud-like stripes that form behind an aircraft) which are potent but short-lived and may last from a few minutes to a day./uni00A0NOx emissions from aircraft engines at altitude contribute to the formation of ozone and the destruction of methane (both greenhouse gases) such that the overall e/ffect is estimated to be warming although this is dependent on background surface air pollution levels.\n\nThere is an overall consensus on the existence of these non-CO2 e/ffects although some major uncertainties remain. We need to be conscious that actions to limit non-CO2 e/ffects do not result in increased/uni00A0CO2 emissions. Nonetheless, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is actively working with research facilities and solution providers to deepen the knowledge of non-CO2 e/ffects and identify the most e/ffective measures for mitigation:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Air/uni00A0France is reviewing financing to install instrumentation across a larger fleet to collect a representative set of data;\n- > to better understand and predict ISSR (Ice Super Saturated Regions), the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is working with the Maastricht Upper Area Control Centre (MUAC 2). Through contrails observations, the aim is to determine contrail sensitive times as well as areas to avoid for ISSRs;\n- > in September/uni00A02022, KLM announced the launch of a pilot project with SATAVIA, a British company that has developed software enabling aircraft operators to forecast, prevent and quantify the warming e/ffects caused by contrails, by adjusting flight paths to avoid ice supersaturated regions. The pilot will kick o/ff in the 2023 first quarter and should provide a first insight into the non-CO2 e/ffects of KLM;\n- > Air France - KLM participates in research through the 'Conseil pour la Recherche A\u00e9ronautique Civile' (CORAC) and supports the creation of a Climate Chair focusing on cooperation in research and tackling the challenges non-CO2 e/ffects have on climate change.\n\n## Compliance and participation in carbon o/ffset and reduction schemes\n\nDifferent mechanisms and obligations governing carbon o/ffsetting and reduction are gradually coming into force at all territorial levels (national, European and international). In order to achieve its objective of Net Zero emissions in 2050, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is investing in all the mechanisms in place, while advocating strict complementarity.\n\n## Mandatory o/ffsetting of domestic flights (French national level)\n\nSince January/uni00A01, 2022, operators of French aircraft whose emissions exceed the annual threshold of 1,000t/CO2 must o/ffset carbon emissions from flights within France (excluding the French overseas departments). However, Air/uni00A0France has voluntarily been committed to o/ffsetting 100% of the emissions of its domestic flights since 2019, in the form of participation in various certified projects with verifiable, measurable, permanent and additional results (see Chapter/uni00A04.3.3/uni00A0Biodiversity). The regulatory threshold of 50% by 2022 has thus been met thanks to anticipation and an ongoing dialogue with the competent authorities.\n\n## Integration into the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme - ETS (European level)\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is also preparing for the ramp-up in the European carbon emissions trading scheme (European level). A pillar of the 'Fit for 55' legislative package currently being adopted by the EU institutions, the revision of the European carbon market should lead to the gradual elimination of free ETS allowances at European level as a clear market signal against conventional kerosene. The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group welcomes these orientations adopted by the European institutions while actively participating in the ongoing discussions.\n\n## Participation in the international carbon o/ffset and reduction scheme - CORSIA (International level)\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is fully committed to the CORSIA scheme, implemented by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), under the voluntary commitments of France and the Netherlands. The Group is participating in the first phase of implementation over the 2021-26/uni00A0period by reporting its emissions and implementing any o/ffsets. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, which supports its representative organization IATA, welcomed this step forward as well as the adoption of the Long-Term Aspirational Goal (LTAG) for the entire industry at global level.\n\nIn this context and in view of the possible complementarity of the di/fferent systems, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM considers that the same/uni00A0CO2 emissions should not be simultaneously subject to the domestic o/ffset obligations, the European Emissions Trading Scheme and the CORSIA scheme.\n\n## Our decarbonization road map\n\nTo achieve its objectives and reduce its carbon footprint by activating all the levers at its disposal, the Group is pursuing its Decarbonization Road Map. This road map includes the following key priority areas for which targets have been identified and action plans deployed:\n\n## Fleet modernization and technological improvement\n\n## Fleet modernization\n\nThe renewal of the fleet with more fuel-e/fficient aircraft is the first lever in the Group's decarbonization trajectory. The Group is continuously investing in fleet renewal with the latest-technology aircraft like the A350, the Airbus A320neo and the Embraer 195-E2, which are up to 25% more e/fficient in terms of fuel consumption and thus/uni00A0CO2 emissions, than the aircraft they replace. It is also progressively accelerating the phase-out of aircraft that are the least adapted to its environmental route map.",

This new type of aircraft is also 63% quieter than the EMB190.\n\nBy 2025, 40% of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's fleet will be composed of next-generation aircraft compared to 10% in 2021.\n\n## Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM fleet renewal plan (1)\n\n|         | 2021   | 2022   | 2025   | 2028   |\n|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Results | 10%    | 15.60% |        |        |\n| Targets |        |        | 40%    | 64%    |\n\n- (1) For more details, see chapter/uni00A01.4.\n\n## Supporting aeronautical Research and Development\n\nThe Group is mobilizing the industry and is committed to research and development into innovative solutions, design, and aeronautical and engine maintenance.\n\nIn 2019, TU Delft and KLM announced the start of the design of the Flying-V aircraft, a design for a very-energy-e/fficient long-haul aircraft with an improved aerodynamic shape and reduced weight of the aircraft. After extensive wind tunnel and ground tests, the first successful test flight with a scale model of the Flying-V took place in 2020. Further flight simulator tests were successfully completed in 2021, making further climate assessments and studying the potential for noise reduction and improvements in flight characteristics and structures. In 2022, KLM continued collaborating on the Flying-V by, for example, researching the implications for the ground procedures.\n\n## Operational measures generating fuel savings of up to 5% (CO2 emissions)\n\n## Weight reduction\n\nThe lighter the aircraft, the less fuel it consumes. All the divisions of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM are thus working to reduce weight on board. This includes, for example, reducing the weight of seats, galley and service equipment, products such as paper documentation for cargo and flight decks, magazines and the loading of drinking water. The weight of the equipment required to transport the payload is also taken into account. The wooden beams to support the cargo are replaced by a lightweight carboard version and we use lightweight cargo containers.\n\n## Aircraft performance optimization\n\n- > as part of its fleet renewal program, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is also renewing its engine portfolio aimed at creating significant improvements in fuel e/fficiency. This includes the LEAP for the A320 neo, the P&W 1500 for the A220 and the GENx for the B787;\n- > a dedicated engine wash process enables engines to be washed at the gate instead of in the hangar. This makes it easier to plan a wash in the maintenance program. The number of annual engine washes has increased, resulting in better performance and a reduction the fuel burned;\n- > Air France - KLM works with di/fferent paint suppliers to reduce the amount and weight of paint and coatings. The paint is smoother and less dirt adheres to the hull which improves the streamline. Together with other improvements, this ensures that the aircraft are faster, cleaner and more e/fficient compared to previous practices;\n- > the use of winglets help to reduce fuel consumption. For example, since 2019 Transavia has replaced its winglets with the latest Split Scimitar Winglets in partnership with GKN Fokker Techniek;\n- > Air France - KLM is also involved in studies for more aerodynamic airframes such as the Flying V (for more information, see the Fleet Renewal and Technological Improvement section).\n\n## Route and flight path optimization\n\nImprovements in fuel efficiency are achieved through the optimization of routes, flight paths and altitudes, and a reduction in aircraft waiting times:\n\n- > Air France - KLM is proactively involved in the SESAR program, which contributes to the targets of the Single European Sky (SES) for the better management of air tra/ffic. SESAR aims to contribute to the SES's 10%/uni00A0CO2 reduction target by reducing fuel burn. In 2022, the Russian and Afghan airspaces were closed, with a major impact on flights to and from Asia. However, the Group was able to reduce the impact of these closures by applying decompression and drift-down procedures, thus enabling shorter routes around these closed airspaces. The creation of these decompression and drift-down procedures has thus made it possible to operate new routes, thereby reducing the impact of airspace closures;\n- > whenever possible, pilots apply the most-fuel-efficient procedures: Flight Plan precision, speed adjustments and optimized trajectories, and, on the ground, taxiing with one engine shut down. New e/fficient tools based on artificial intelligence are being implemented, in partnership with innovative start-ups;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nAddressing the impact on the environment\n\n- > for example, Air/uni00A0France and Transavia France have joined forces with OpenAirlines, a start-up which has been awarded the Solar Impulse E/fficient Solution label by Bertrand Piccard's Solar Impulse Foundation. Its SkyBreathe tool enables the highly-precise tracking of the application of fuel-e/fficiency practices for each flight. Transavia was the first airline to deploy this solution in France and is pursuing its e/fforts on eco-flying. Transavia has thus announced a new partnership with OpenAirlines for the roll-out of SkyBreathe OnBoard, a real-time, eco-flying solution. Air/uni00A0France and Transavia France have also deployed a tool proposed by Safety Line: Optidirect. The application proposes direct alternative routes in flight to reduce fuel consumption. With Optiflight (composed of Opticlimb, Optispeed and Opdirect) Transavia France and Air/uni00A0France benefit thus from e/fficient tools to reduce their inflight/uni00A0CO2 emissions;\n- > lastly, the Group's airlines work closely with French and Dutch Air Tra/ffic Control to make their descents and take-o/ffs more e/fficient.\n\n## Fuel-saving measures\n\nAll possible avenues of fuel-savings measures are identified and, when feasible, implemented, subject to strict respect of the rules on Flight Safety. All the airlines within the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group are included in the Fuel Plan, to improve the Group's energy e/fficiency and reduce its carbon footprint.\n\n## Combining di/fferent modes of transportation\n\nFor journeys over short distances, there are low-carbon transportation alternatives. Prioritizing these low-carbon alternatives on shorter journeys, and more energy-e/fficient flights (new generation aircraft, sustainable aviation fuels) on longer journeys, enable the overall carbon footprint of a journey to be minimized. The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group thus believes that combining train and air travel is an obvious choice. Wherever possible, the Group's airlines o/ffer their customers the possibility of combining di/fferent modes of transportation, a solution known as inter-modality. Air/uni00A0France and KLM o/ffer their customers services that allow them to combine train and air travel in the same reservation, with guaranteed connections. These o/ffers called 'Train+Air' and 'Air/Rail' are, respectively, in partnership with SNCF and Thalys. The 'Train+Air' product is used every year by more than 160,000/uni00A0customers travelling to and from Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Paris-Orly airports.\n\n## Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF)\n\nSustainable aviation fuels are one of the most promising ways of reducing/uni00A0CO2 emissions in the aviation industry. Next to reducing fuel use, they can reduce/uni00A0CO2 emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel on a life cycle basis and require no engine modifications.\n\n## In 2022, the Group:\n\n- > committed to incorporating a minimum of 10% SAF by 2030;\n- > committed to incorporating approximately 0.6% of SAF in its total jet fuel consumption, up from 0.08% last year. The SAF is mainly used for its flights departing from France (in compliance with French legislation) and the Netherlands;\n- > on October/uni00A025, 2022, signed a new series of long-term supply agreements and MoU's (Memorandum of Understanding) to cover the SAF (or Bio fuels) requirements of its airlines in the coming years. The agreements were signed with Neste, for the supply of 1/uni00A0million tons over the 2023 to 2030 period, and DG Fuels, for the supply of 600,000/uni00A0tons over the 2027 to 2036 period. These contracts represent a first step by the Group towards achieving its 2030 targets and will cover approximately 3% of the 10% SAF requirement;\n- > on December/uni00A05, 2022 signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Total Energies for the supply of more than one million cubic meters (800,000/uni00A0metric tons) of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM companies over a 10-year period, starting in 2023.\n\nAs of January/uni00A02022, the Group's airlines began incorporating up to 1% SAF over one year in total for their flights departing from France (in accordance with French legislation) and 0.5% SAF for flights departing from the Netherlands.\n\n## Committing to SAF incorporation\n\nAs a leader in the use of SAF, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has rea/ffirmed its commitment to making the aviation sector more sustainable and has committed to incorporating a minimum of 10% SAF by 2030.\n\n## Committing to long-term SAF procurement\n\nBy committing to long-term supply agreements, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is supporting the development of the SAF production industry, which is still in its infancy worldwide (in 2021, SAF production represented 0.01% of the jet fuel consumed worldwide), resulting in prices two to four times higher than those of conventional kerosene. By increasing SAF use and demand, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM aims to play its part in increasing the scale of commercial SAF production.\n\n## Engaging our customers and partners\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM were the first carriers to o/ffer their customers a SAF program for both businesses and cargo, thereby raising awareness and knowledge around SAF, and encouraging companies to reduce their scope/uni00A03/uni00A0emissions linked to business travel and the transportation of cargo. The programs currently number 125/uni00A0participants.",

        "page_content": "Customers can also voluntarily contribute to increasing the use of SAF in their flights when they make a booking or up until check-in. For Flying Blue members, Air/uni00A0France and KLM now o/ffer the option to pay for sustainable aviation fuel with Miles. Since June/uni00A02022, as a mark of recognition for Air/uni00A0France and KLM high-value customers, these contributions also count towards earning or maintaining Flying Blue Elite status. Flying Blue is the first loyalty program in the travel industry to structurally introduce such a choice to earn status.\n\n## Securing the quality of our SAF supplies\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has established a strict sourcing policy to ensure that SAF projects selected directly have a minimal impact on the environment. The SAF selected should have a minimum 75% CO2 reducttion,  not compete with human food or animal feed supplies, not derive from palm oil and  be RSB or ISCC certified.\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM have been members of RSB since 2008, in their capacity as founding members of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Users Group (SAFUG). This body takes into account 12/uni00A0criteria ranging from food security to rural development, the quality of air, soil and water resources, and waste management.\n\nThe current generation of SAF can be made from used cooking oil, waste, and agricultural and forestry residues. In the future, sustainable synthetic aviation fuels (e-fuels) made from hydrogen and captured carbon will be available. They will allow a reduction of more than 100% in/uni00A0CO2 emissions.\n\n## Supporting SAF-related Research and Development\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has invested in the testing and use of sustainable aviation fuel for more than 15/uni00A0years. In 2011, KLM operated the world's first commercial flight partially fueled with SAF while Air/uni00A0France launched the Lab Line for the Future in 2014, a two-year experiment during which 78/uni00A0flights between Paris-Orly and Toulouse, and between Paris-Orly and Nice, were partially fueled with sustainable aviation fuel. In 2021, Air/uni00A0France operated its first long-haul flight fueled by SAF produced entirely in France, while KLM operated the world's first commercial flight with synthetic fuel.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France promoted from an early stage greater knowledge of biofuels for aviation, thus raising public authority awareness of the need to support a French biofuels industry. Air/uni00A0France then joined forces with ATAG (Air Transport Action Group) in the establishment of the French national road map on aviation biofuels managed by the National Alliance for Coordination of Research on Energy (ANCRE), with a final report delivered in 2018.\n\nThrough the Council for Civil Aviation Research (CORAC), Air/uni00A0France is participating in the definition of a sustainable fuel strategy via coherent technological research and innovation actions, aimed at achieving the objectives of the ecological transition in a global context.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is a founding member of the Aviation Climate Taskforce (ACT), a non-profit organization founded to accelerate breakthroughs in emerging technologies to decarbonize aviation, with a focus on synthetic SAF, hydrogen and direct air capture technologies.\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM also participate in consortia which have been awarded funding by the EU as part of the European Green Deal to investigate and speed up the rollout of sustainable technologies in aviation and significantly contribute towards zero-emission and zero-waste airports by 2030, and climate-neutral aviation by 2050. These consortia include:\n\n- > TULIPS : a consortium of 29/uni00A0partners, including KLM, led by Royal Schiphol Group. Amsterdam Airport Schiphol will be the proving ground for 17/uni00A0demonstrator projects originating from the collaboration. The TULIPS project kicked o/ff in January/uni00A02022 and will run until December/uni00A02025. The first demonstrator projects are planned for 2023;\n- > OLGA : led by the A\u00e9roports de Paris (ADP) Group with Paris-Charles de Gaulle Airport as frontrunner, this project regrouping four international airports and 57/uni00A0partners was launched on October/uni00A01, 2021. Air/uni00A0France, as a partner of the OLGA project and a pioneer in the electrification of the ground support equipment fleet at the Paris airports, is a driving force in the clean energy transition and the reduction of local emissions thanks to its work on optimizing electric recharging operations and hydrogen solutions, and the use of sustainable aviation fuel.\n\n## Supporting the development of a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production chain in Europe\n\nKLM is one of the founders of SkyNRG, a Dutch company specialized in the production and supply of SAF. Since 2016, KLM flights on departure from Los Angeles airport have thus been operated with SAF produced by the local World Energy (former AltAir Fuels) refinery and supplied by SkyNRG. In 2019, KLM made a decade-long commitment to developing and purchasing an annual 75,000/uni00A0tons of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, making it the first airline in the world to invest in SAF on this scale. SkyNRG will develop Europe's first dedicated plant for the production of SAF.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

By actively seeking industrial and logistics partners to combine forces in consortia, the Group is backing innovative technologies, with alternative fuels originating from the circular economy and, in future, synthetic fuels (e fuels) whose design is based on green electricity and carbon capture.\n\nIn 2022, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM joined the Renewable and Low-Carbon Fuels Value Chain Industrial Allia (RLCF) Alliance, a new EU initiative bringing together the aviation and waterborne sectors to jointly boost the production and supply of Renewable and Low-Carbon Fuels in Europe.\n\n## Reduce Scope/uni00A02/uni00A0emissions\n\nEnergy consumption in the ground operations, such as the fuels used by ground support equipment, electricity and gas use in buildings, and electricity used for aircraft maintenance and tertiary activities, generates direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions (scopes 1 and 2).\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has set a target to reach Net Zero emissions at its Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Paris-Orly and Amsterdam-Schiphol hubs by 2030.\n\n## Reduce the energy consumption of the ground facilities and operations\n\nIn 2022, within the framework of its Net Zero-emission target for its ground hub operations by 2030, the Group pursued and stepped up its actions to reduce its energy consumption. It upgraded its equipment and included this target in supplier contracts with, notably, an energy-e/fficiency commitment based on a bonus/malus principle and the implementation of a five-year action plan. In order to comply with the Energy Efficiency Directive, which replaced this agreement as of January/uni00A01, 2021, KLM has obtained ISO/uni00A050001/uni00A0certification to manage the realization of energy e/fficiency improvements.\n\nAt Toulouse and Valbonne in the south of France where the bulk of the IT servers are located, 100% of the heating needs of the tertiary buildings are met by recycling the heat generated by the air conditioning system. Photovoltaic energy projects will be deployed in the Group's facilities at the Roissy-CDG head o/ffice. Another example is KLM's initiative to install solar panels on the roof of its largest aircraft hangar, finalized in 2021. The 7,000-panel array generated 1.2/uni00A0million kilowatt hours (kWh) of renewable electricity in 2022.\n\nIn 2022, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM launched an active program of energy e/fficiency and sobriety measures targeting reductions in the energy consumption of all o/ffice buildings through various concrete actions: switching o/ff lighting after 8/uni00A0p.m./uni00A0in all o/ffice areas or lighting on presence detection only; automatic switch-o/ff of the Company's electronic devices; thermal insulation work and the installation of heat pumps; adjusting the temperature settings of o/ffice buildings to 19/uni00A0degrees Celsius in winter and 26/uni00A0degrees\n\nCelsius in summer; adjustments to building operational hours to reduce temperature control periods; closure of the Air/uni00A0France head o/ffice and several other sites every Friday (made possible by remote working). These measures have enabled Air/uni00A0France to reduce its building energy consumption by 23% since 2011 and the aim is a further 10% reduction by 2024.\n\n## Reduce Scope/uni00A03/uni00A0emissions\n\n## A sustainable supply chain\n\nThe Group's supply chain covers approximately 3,200/uni00A0suppliers across every category. Working with key partners, including fuel suppliers, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is targeting a net reduction in its Scope/uni00A03/uni00A0emissions by 2030 and 2050 relative to the 2019 baseline.\n\nThe Group has appointed EcoVadis, a market-leading provider of business sustainability ratings, to support its understanding of every aspect of sustainability in the supply chain, including the environment, labor and Human Rights, and ethics.\n\nSustainability is a key part of the Procurement transformation plan. As well as continuing the measures above, the plan includes embedding sustainability KPIs into procurement processes and criteria for awarding new business to suppliers. We are also developing a wider training program for employees, building sustainability awareness and driving higher sustainability performance across the entire organization.\n\n## Employee commuting\n\nAir/uni00A0 France has participated in the Paris Region Atmosphere Protection Plan since 2008 through its Mobility Plan and, at the outstations in the French provinces, has rolled out proprietary Mobility Plans. Support for employees to promote sustainable mobility was reinforced in 2022 since this action is an integral part of the Air/uni00A0France energy sobriety plan launched in September/uni00A02022.\n\nWith more than 80% of sta/ff commuting to work by car, the aim of the Mobility Plan is to reduce the pollutant emissions linked to their journeys, something which is an issue for the environment, and for health and safety in the workplace.\n\nIn 2022, the action plans launched in the Ile de France region, led by the CCI 95 (R'Pro Mobility) and the CCI94 (Orly'Pro Mobility), were continued within the framework of the Employer Mobility Plans of which Air/uni00A0France is a member, as are 19/uni00A0companies based at Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Paris-Orly.\n\nIn 2022, compared to 2019, the number of Air/uni00A0France employees working from home in France was up by 66% (9,439/uni00A0remote workers in 2022 in France) and the number of days of remote working was multiplied by 3.8/uni00A0to reach 612,520/uni00A0days. The associated home-work trips not made enabled the avoidance of 26/uni00A0million commute kilometers (or 657/uni00A0laps of the earth) and 5,736/uni00A0tons of/uni00A0CO2. This finding confirms the embedding of a new sustainable work organization.",

The implementation of the Karos carpooling platform in the Paris region in 2021 has enabled a growing number of Air/uni00A0France employees (642/uni00A0registered at the end of December/uni00A02002) to carpool. The number of carpools has increased six-fold, bringing the average number of carpools per carpooler to 33. A total of 6,501/uni00A0carpools were carried out over the year, 65% of them over an average distance of 44/uni00A0kilometers.\n\nAmong the other actions in progress are:\n\n- > monitoring the timetable and progress of the many major infrastructure projects underway in the Ile de France region;\n- > the deployment plans for charging points in Air/uni00A0France car parks have been revised in order to optimize their adaptation to future needs, while taking into account the capacity of the existing electrical networks and investment decisions. Deployment will resume in 2023;\n- > feasibility studies on bicycle lanes at Orly and Roissy although their deployment schedules remain uncertain. These studies did however show clear interest on the part of hub employees;\n- > raising employee awareness of the link between air quality and commuting.\n\n## Absorb and store carbon from the atmosphere\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's priority is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible, primarily those generated directly by its operations, but also upstream and downstream of its activities.\n\nThe Group airlines, with the support of customers participating in its environmental programs, are contributing to projects that capture and store carbon from the atmosphere in natural carbon sinks (forests, mangroves).\n\nAir/uni00A0 France supports several reforestation and tree planting projects in collaboration with its partner EcoAct, such as: the International Small Group and Tree Planting program in India, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, helping small groups of farmers to organize themselves to plant trees on their farms; a Gold Standard-certified reforestation program in the Vichada region of Colombia, aimed at planting 76,000/uni00A0hectares of hardwood while protecting local biodiversity.\n\nSince 2017 KLM has supported a reforestation project in Panama. In 2022, KLM added two projects in Uganda and Colombia to its portfolio. The selected projects are all Gold Standard and FSC certified; supporting job creation for the local population, community development; and contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations.\n\nFor more information on these programs, see section/uni00A04.3.3 'Biodiversity' hereinafter.\n\n## Engaging customers and partners\n\nOn April/uni00A020, 2022, Air/uni00A0France launched its 'Air/uni00A0France ACT' program presenting its new/uni00A0CO2 emission reduction strategy targeting a 30% reduction in/uni00A0CO2 emissions per passenger/km by 2030 compared to the 2019 baseline. This strategy is based on three priorities:\n\n- > reducing the direct emissions generated by Air/uni00A0France's activities as a priority;\n- > reducing indirect emissions, generated upstream and downstream by the Company's activities;\n- > supporting projects that capture/uni00A0CO2 from the atmosphere.\n\n'Air/uni00A0France ACT' embodies the transparent, realistic and scientific approach adopted by the Company to ensure its environmental transition through concrete and measurable actions. To present Air/uni00A0France's environmental strategy and all its commitments in greater detail, the airline has launched a video campaign and a dedicated website, 'Air/uni00A0France ACT', aimed at the general public, available in both French and English.\n\nBased on a KLM idea adopted by the SkyTeam alliance for the first time in 2022, both Air/uni00A0France and KLM participated in the inaugural The Sustainable Flight Challenge. The two airlines operated one medium-haul and one long-haul flight in their existing networks as sustainably as possible, sharing knowledge and experience with the other participating airlines. Through a range of measures, the SkyTeam TSFC flights performed almost 33% better than the industry average.\n\nIn addition, in June/uni00A02022, the Group's airlines participated, by operating SAF-powered flights, in the Connecting Europe Days organized by the European Commission, showcasing all the possible ways to achieve aviation's sustainability goals and raising awareness of what needs to be done to reach Net Zero emissions at European Union level.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Internal and external audits verify the e/ffective implementation of the EMS.\n\nIn addition to compliance with the regulations in force, the Environmental Management System is used to drive an improvement in environmental performance and innovation, both within the Group and at its suppliers.\n\n## Air quality\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group monitors its atmospheric emissions for both the flight and ground operations, including low altitude emissions which impact the quality of the air around airports. The indicators cover emissions of/uni00A0CO2,/uni00A0SO2 and/uni00A0NOx.\n\nMost of these gas and particle emissions come from aircraft movements. The remainder is produced by ground operations and maintenance activities, airport logistics and road travel by passengers, employees and suppliers.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM reduces its emissions via a number of levers:\n\n- > fleet renewal replacing old aircraft with new ones responding to the highest criteria concerning/uni00A0NOx;\n- > accelerating the development of SAF, which has been identified as a key lever in minimizing the non-CO2 e/ffects due to its reduced amounts of non-volatile particulate matter (nvPM);\n- > using electric or more e/fficient ground vehicles and runway equipment, powered by cleaner fuels;\n- > optimizing operational procedures for the ground operations: taxiing time, taxiing using just one engine, the use of ground power units (GPUs) to ensure the functioning of on-board systems, replacing the use of Auxiliary Power Units (APUs).\n\nKLM works with its sector partners on the research and measurement of Ultrafine Particulates (UFP). KLM participates in both the Commission and the Sector Taskforce (set up in the 2022 first quarter). KLM conducts research in cooperation with\n\nsector players into a further reduction in the use of Auxiliary Power Units (APUs) and more widespread use of n-1/uni00A0taxiing. Together with Schiphol airport, KLM is conducting an exploratory study into exposure to UFPs to gain more insight into the personal exposure of employees and the sources of this exposure. The findings will be included in a follow-up study that will be carried out externally.\n\n## Electrification of equipment\n\nIn 2022, for the Group's airlines, 63% of the ground handling equipment at Paris-Charles de Gaulle, Paris-Orly and AmsterdamSchiphol airports was electrically powered.\n\nThe electrification of ground equipment has the benefit of generating no local emissions. This contributes to cleaner air and better working conditions at and around airports.\n\nSince 2020, Air/uni00A0France has been able to connect 100% of its long-haul flights with electric ACUs at all gates in the ParisCharles de Gaulle and Paris-Orly terminals.\n\nIn 2022, Air/uni00A0France won the 'boldest move challenge' with 100% electric ground transportation and the testing of an autonomous baggage tractor. At KLM, all baggage services are now electrically driven, including all-electric towing tractors, platform wagons and ramp equipment transporting baggage.\n\nIn 2022, KLM Ground Services introduced a proactive program to reduce the use of diesel Ground Power Units (GPU) following modifications to electric Fixed Power Units (e-FPU) at Schiphol Airport. All members of the GPU pool participated in a trial program using battery-powered electric GPUs. The program was successful in identifying the suitability of e-GPUs for the handling of narrow body aircraft. GPU equipment is responsible for 40% of the/uni00A0CO2 emissions from ground equipment, meaning that pursuing these trials o/ffers a promising avenue towards reducing direct emissions in airports.\n\nTransavia has been experimenting with the start-up/uni00A0SAS on the use of thermal ACU converters for air conditioning on the ground. This reduces the emissions from the use of APUs. During the first test phase, Transavia was able to save 50,000/uni00A0liters of fuel, i.e. around 100/uni00A0tons of/uni00A0CO2 emissions. In the long term, Transavia is pursuing its road map for the use of electric GPUs and ACUs.\n\nIn 2022, in collaboration with other partners like A\u00e9roport de Paris and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM continued to conduct sustainable taxiing trials, using special towing vehicles to bring planes to the runway. This so-called 'Taxibot' is driven by a combination of electric and diesel engines that use 95% less fuel than airplane engines. This method of taxiing greatly reduces fuel consumption and therefore/uni00A0CO2, as well as local emissions including Nitrogen (NOx) and (ultra) fine particulate emissions.",

        "page_content": "## Move to Gas to Liquid (GTL)\n\nAt the end of 2020, Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Paris-Orly adopted Gas-to-Liquid (GTL) a synthetic diesel to replace NonRoad Diesel (GNR). All Air/uni00A0France Ground Service equipment at Paris-Charles de Gaulle is now powered by this fuel, which is 15% to 20% more economical in terms of/uni00A0CO2, generates 10% less/uni00A0NOx, requires 10% less fuel consumption and lowers maintenance costs (less engine clogging). Air/uni00A0France plans to systematically use GTL as a substitute fuel for GNR throughout the electrification phase of its equipment.\n\n## Towards renewable fuels for Ground Equipment\n\nIn 2022, KLM decided to replace Gas to Liquid (GTL) with HVO100, a synthetic fuel, made of 100% hydrotreated vegetable oil, as of 2023. This fuel o/ffers a transitional solution to significantly r e d u c i n g /uni00A0C O 2 emissions until such time as all ground vehicles are electric or powered by hydrogen. Ground equipment powered by this fuel emit 98% less/uni00A0CO2.\n\n## Reducing noise\n\nAirlines are accommodating their customers' increased demand for mobility, while maintaining noise hindrance at an acceptable level for those living near airports.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM group has formalized its commitment to noise mitigation by making it a requirement enshrined in The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Principles.\n\nThanks to its proactive fleet renewal policy, by 2022 the Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM group will have an e/fficient fleet in terms of noise levels, with 75% of its fleet complying with the certification criteria of ICAO chapters 4 and 14, i.e. the most stringent noise levels for jet aircraft to date.\n\n## Fleet modernization and improved operational measures\n\nSince September/uni00A02021, Air/uni00A0France has been taking delivery of new Airbus 220s for its fleet. This new medium-haul aircraft is contributing to Air/uni00A0France's strategy and commitments: improved competitiveness and reduced environmental impact with a 34% noise reduction and 20% fewer/uni00A0CO2 emissions than the aircraft it replaces. As for the long-haul fleet, the A350 is the new spearhead with a 40% reduction in its noise footprint and a 25% reduction in/uni00A0CO2 emissions.\n\nSpecific solutions are also sought to reduce the noise emissions from aircraft. Whenever possible, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM thus implements continuous descent or NADP (Noise Abatement Departure Procedure) procedures which significantly reduce noise pollution. The SESAR program also aims to improve the management of noise and its impact through precision-landing procedures using satellite navigation and optimized flight paths, including optimized climb and descent operations.\n\nAir/uni00A0France has been actively involved in the Night Flights working group, overseen by the Prefect of the Paris-CDG airport region. This working Group has notably proposed new 'dead of night' continuous descent procedures and welcomed the voluntary retirement of noisy aircraft, including Air/uni00A0France's B747s and A340s. Air/uni00A0France and Transavia already implement continuous descent procedures whenever possible, enabling the crew to operate the flight on arrival at an airport by avoiding level flight phases as much as possible and thus reducing the load on the engines, which significantly reduces noise pollution. The Air/uni00A0France Group would like to see this procedure extended to all airports and is committed to supporting the relevant government and DGAC departments in the rapid and widespread implementation of continuous descent.\n\n## Stakeholder dialogue\n\nAir/uni00A0 France and KLM are committed to ensuring a permanent dialogue with stakeholders in all territories. They meet with the representatives of local communities, the airport authorities and air tra/ffic control to identify measures enabling a reduction in noise hindrance potentially a/ffecting the inhabitants of areas located near airports.\n\nIn France, this dialogue is mainly conducted within the context of the CCEs (Environmental Consultative Commissions) and CCARs (Advisory Residents' Assistance Commissions) in which the Air/uni00A0France Group participates at all the French airports where it has operations.\n\nIn the Netherlands, KLM participates in the Het Regioforum that addresses issues surrounding noise with the local community.\n\nIn 2022, KLM took also part in the Minder Hinder (less hindrance) program with Schiphol and Air Tra/ffic Control The Netherlands to reduce noise hindrance and improve the quality of the local environment. KLM is committed to this hindrance program and has undertaken to contribute to the government and Schiphol's local emission reduction plans covering ultrafine particles and nitrogen.\n\nIn 2022, the Air/uni00A0France Group's (Air/uni00A0France, Air/uni00A0France HOP! and Transavia France) contribution to the Airport Noise Tax (TNSA) paid to the French State amounted to \u20ac16.3/uni00A0million. Its proceeds are allocated to the financing of sound-proofing for homes located around the main airports. Since the introduction of the TSNA, some \u20ac770/uni00A0million have been allocated to soundproofing homes, to which the Air/uni00A0France group has made a significant contribution.\n\nAround Schiphol airport, all the measures to reduce the noise footprint have been implemented. Over the past two decades, KLM has contributed most of the total \u20ac750/uni00A0million in noise taxes, devoted to the sound-proofing and compensation for loss of value in property around Schiphol airport.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nIn December/uni00A02020, the Dutch Cabinet approved the Aviation Policy 2020-2050 (Luchtvaartnota 2020-2050) including a prospective 540,000/uni00A0aircraft movements. The current coalition agreement stresses the importance of Schiphol's worldwide connectivity for the Dutch economy and underlines the need to improve sustainability. The latest decision by the Dutch Cabinet to reduce aircraft movements to 440,000/uni00A0will thus undermine the goal of direct connectivity and the sustainability objectives.\n\nReducing the maximum number of movements puts further pressure on the ability to invest in sustainability: for example, commitments have been made to Airbus to purchase A320/321neos, to EMBRAER to purchase the EMB195-E2s and to Boeing to purchase the Boeing 787-10s.\n\n## Water conservation\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM achieved a 32% reduction in water consumption between 2019 and 2022.\n\nThe UN predicts that there will be a 40% shortfall in freshwater resources by 2030. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM launched its first water conservation projects in 2011. Its engineers designed a method to wash aircraft exterior with pads, using 80/uni00A0times less water than previously: 150/uni00A0liters to clean a Boeing 777/uni00A0rather than the 12,000/uni00A0liters previously used. The water used for the engines water wash (which reduces fuel consumption and lowers/uni00A0CO2 emissions) is recycled, and AI is used to optimize the loading of drinking water on its flights.\n\nIn 2022, the Group decided to end the practice of aircraft water salutes.\n\n## Waste management and the circular economy\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM handles many forms of waste, mostly arising from flight operations and maintenance, within a context of strict regulatory requirements. Across the entire supply chain, the Group strives to minimize waste and increase the proportion of waste recycled or incinerated with energy recovery where recycling is not possible.\n\nThe following performance targets have been set:\n\n- > a 50% reduction in residual waste (non-recycled waste from the cabin and ground activities) by 2030 compared to 2011 for all operations in France and the Netherlands;\n- > 90% of single-use plastic items to be replaced by 2023 compared to 2018 for Air/uni00A0France.\n\nIn 2022, the Group reduced its residual waste from France and the Netherlands by 54% (compared to 2011), representing 6.400/uni00A0tons of recycled waste.\n\nActions are based on the four principles of the circular economy: rethink, reduce, reuse and recycle. Risks and mitigation actions are assessed from a life cycle perspective. The airlines run programs aimed at a constant improvement in the overall management\n\nof waste: waste prevention, increasing the recycled portion, the eco-design of products and the identification of appropriate reprocessing facilities. The end-of-life management of items is factored into their initial design.\n\nParadoxically, one of the biggest hurdles when it comes to improving waste management for both Air/uni00A0France and KLM is the the strict European Union legislative framework. For example, the current regulations restrict the recycling of most of the catering waste from intercontinental flights entering the EU. In 2022, Air/uni00A0France, KLM and other European airlines issued a joint statement and launched a campaign to make legislators aware of this issue.\n\n## Reduction of single-use plastics\n\nWhether for reasons of hygiene and food safety, or to reduce the weight embarked, the inflight service uses a substantial quantity of Single-Use Plastic products (SUPs). The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is committed to reducing the environmental impact of SUPs in its operations. The Group achieves this via a number of levers: eliminating SUPs wherever possible; replacing these plastics with other materials whenever more sustainable alternatives are available (based on life cycle assessments or other environmental proof); redesigning SUP items to decrease material use, using recycled plastic and ensuring SUPs are recycled wherever possible.\n\nIn 2022, Air/uni00A0France eliminated or replaced with alternative materials 765/uni00A0tons of single-use plastic used by passengers on board, i.e. nearly 80%. Among the plastic items still in use, 85% are recyclable and 37% contain recycled plastic.\n\nTransavia now uses certified alternatives to single-use plastic (Duty Free bags in Kraft paper and cups, stirrers and cutlery kits of plant origin,/uni00A0etc.). In total, more than seven million single-use plastic items are no longer distributed each year on its scheduled flights, or 41/uni00A0tons of plastic.\n\nKLM now deploys fully reusable food containers for its new Premium Comfort class. These containers are returned to the supplier after the flight, so that they can be reused as food containers on a forthcoming flight.\n\nIn 2022, KLM Inflight Services set a new Responsible Catering ambition and introduced new goals on smart packaging and reducing waste. A Life Cycle Assessment tool was developed and adopted together with Dutch research institute TNO to support decision making regarding more-sustainable packaging and to find alternatives to Single-Use Plastic (SUP) items.\n\n## Other Inflight waste\n\nAt Air/uni00A0France, the cabin crews carry out selective sorting of plastic bottles, cardboard juice cartons, cans and glass bottles on board all short, medium and long-haul flights to Paris. The items are sorted on board and then picked up by the caterer at Paris-CDG and Paris-Orly, and recycled in France or Europe.",

        "page_content": "In 2022, 550 tons of cabin waste and glass packaging were sorted and recycled, i.e. 148% more than in 2021.\n\nIn 2022, Air/uni00A0France continued to work with the international outstations to set up a process for the recycling of packaging sorted on board. Inflight waste is handled in accordance with health regulations and in local facilities. In Paris (Charles de Gaulle and Orly), inflight waste is incinerated with energy recovery, enabling the generation of heat or electricity. This represents 10,510/uni00A0tons or 85% of Air/uni00A0France's on board waste.\n\nOn KLM's European flights, on-board waste is also sorted and the process to collect plastic and cardboard cups has been improved. Crew engagement campaigns make crews aware of their role in this process in order to improve the recycling figures. Glass, cans, aluminum lids, paper, EPS boxes, PET plastic bottles and other forms of plastic are also sorted and recycled by the catering teams. As part of its ambition, KLM has launched the Zer0Waste initiative. This initiative brings together all the employees who are involved in the di/fferent phases of the catering process to pinpoint the biggest catering waste bottlenecks and come up with practical solutions. Another goal of the initiative is to improve and increase data collection.\n\n## Action to combat food waste and food insecurity\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM processes food waste from flight operations with a constant concern for food safety and in a strict regulatory context.\n\nTwo main levers make it possible to reduce food waste: the adjustment of on-board services and a rigorous policy for managing merchandise inventories.\n\nThe pre-selection of hot meals in the Business cabin thus saw a widespread roll out during 2022. This process has made it possible to avoid 5.3/uni00A0tons of waste per year. While eliminating any form of food waste is paramount, some food waste is to be expected and therefore actions are taken to handle this properly. As such, in 2022, KLM Catering Services (KCS), which is responsible for handling all inflight catering waste, expanded its bio-treatment of organic waste to include co/ffee grounds from all European flights.\n\nTo combat food insecurity and limit waste, Air/uni00A0France donates food and non-food items to charities such as the Agence du Don en Nature, the Restaurants du C\u0153ur, the Samu Social, the Secours Populaire and the Food Bank. In 2022, approximately 1 million food and other materials were donated.\n\nIn collaboration with their service providers and caterers, the Air/uni00A0 France crews are working on improving the process for recovering uneaten food. For example, unconsumed items from the gourmet boxes served on long-haul flights are donated to charities. In 2022, more than 10/uni00A0tons of items from gourmet boxes were donated.\n\nAdjusting perishable product orders and maintaining a rigorous merchandise inventory management policy also helps reduce wastage of unconsumed fresh products.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and Martinair Cargo are active players in the transportation of perishable goods. The teams are in constant contact with all the stakeholders in the chain (producers, exporters, importers, supermarkets, airport authorities,/uni00A0etc.) in order to promote sustainable development of the agricultural sector and air transportation. Many initiatives are under way: joint communication actions with the phytosanitary control departments of Paris-Charles de Gaulle and export customers, improving the processing capacity for perishable products and control over the cold chain,/uni00A0etc. The Group also contributes to the work of the Cool Chain association, of which it is a member, which aims to reduce food waste. Within this framework, the priority actions to be carried out for the sustainable development of West African mango exports by air were defined in 2019, both technically (combating the fruit fly which degrades the quality of the fruit) and logistically (improving airport infrastructure in Burkina Faso and Senegal in particular, and control procedures at Paris-CDG).\n\n## Aircraft end-of-life\n\nAircraft that are at the end of their service with the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group and are not returned to their lessors, maintain a high value. These aircraft are sold to another airline or to a company specialized in tear-down services for the recycling and reuse of spare parts. We can also use the components from old aircraft to replace parts in the Group's current operational fleet.\n\nSince 2013, the Group airlines have thus been working with companies with best-in-class environmental standards such as Tarmac Aerosave, a company with which the Group works to dismantle its aircraft. Tarmac Aerosave recycles approximately 90% of the aircraft materials, an additional 8% are fluids such as oils which are reused to produce energy, leaving 2% as disposal.\n\n## Aeronautical waste\n\nEngine parts, aircraft seats, cargo pallets and broken suitcases are just some examples of the production waste generated by our Engineering & Maintenance, Cargo and Flight Operations. Although most aeronautical waste is subject to strict regulation, Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has implemented many initiatives to reduce non-recycled production waste.\n\nEngineering and Maintenance prevents waste of aeronautical components by developing alternative repairs. Whenever repair is no longer viable, aeronautical components are deemed to be Beyond Economical Repair (BER). These components, as well as other aeronautical waste, are then sent to the in-house salvation and scrap team. This team handles procedures that reuse and recycle spare parts and other waste. Wherever the rules and regulations allow, the cradle-to-cradle principle is applied to reintegrate waste into a new production cycle. Scraps that cannot be integrated within our own production cycles and components that are governed by strict regulations, and thus are not reusable, are collected by external partners and either destroyed or processed into secondary raw materials.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\nThe process foresees procedures to reuse and recycle spare parts. This program has been extended to other types of waste: furniture, equipment, pallets and blankets.\n\nAt Air/uni00A0France, the move up-market for the medium and long-haul cabins with the installation of new seats has been accompanied by the implementation of a recycling and dismantling process for the old seats ranging from the reuse and recycling of components to the recovery of foams and metals.\n\nHazardous waste from the maintenance activities is the subject of a comprehensive tracing system and its management is harmonized in the di/fferent maintenance sites.\n\n## Applying the principles of the circular economy\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is working on initiatives to up-cycle waste for new uses like, for example, the recycling of used cabin materials (life jackets, seat fabrics, seat belts,/uni00A0etc.) or aircraft parts (AIR ART).\n\nA permanent recycling process is in place for Air/uni00A0France uniforms and work clothing. Sta/ff are invited to adopt good sorting practice by depositing them in secure containers in the Air/uni00A0France premises. The uniforms are collected (72/uni00A0tons of textiles since September/uni00A02018 at the Roissy site) from the various sites by di/fferent partners including a Work Assistance Establishment (ESAT for the employment of disabled workers). For safety reasons these textiles must be crushed before being transformed into solid recovered fuels with a high calorific value. These fuels o/ffer a non-fossil alternative to large fuel consumers such as the cement and lime industries.\n\n## 4.3.3/emspace Impact on Biodiversity\n\n## ) Context and strategy\n\nDue to human activity, biodiversity is declining more rapidly than at any other time in human history. However, healthy and biologically-diverse ecosystems are essential to produce the ecosystem services required for human survival and development. In order to curb the loss of biodiversity, it is essential to participate in the reconstruction of natural ecosystems and to conserve and restore degraded ecosystems.\n\n## * Measures and Performance\n\n## Commitments of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group supports several projects and actions aimed at protecting biodiversity, notably diversity within species and between species and the diversity of ecosystems.\n\nTo reduce textile waste, three trial programs were implemented in 2022: one has allowed the reuse of 1,391/uni00A0items of uniforms and work clothing and another has enabled the sorting of white shirts which are then forwarded to a recycling channel (139/uni00A0kg collected). Lastly to reduce the impact of textile production, cabin crews and pilots have tested a new shirt including mechanical recycled polyester fiber, or rPET, whose manufacturing is less energy-intensive and consumes fewer resources. These three successful trial programs are set for widespread deployment in 2023. In addition, employees have launched the 100% Uniforms initiative to recycle old uniforms into other products such as a new collection of non-aeronautic accessories (pouches,/uni00A0etc.).\n\nIn order to avoid the destruction of products and encourage their reuse, Air/uni00A0France signed a Framework Agreement with the Agence du Don en Nature (ADN) in January/uni00A02017. By donating new, refurbished products such as crockery or blankets, Air/uni00A0France supports the work of the ADN association, which collects and redistributes new, non-food products for everyday use to combat exclusion in France. In 2022, approximately 70,000/uni00A0food and material items were donated.\n\nAt KLM Engineering & Maintenance (E&M) finding and developing new repair opportunities is seen as a key activity. To this end, KLM E&M collaborates with suppliers, local companies and knowledge institutes. For example, in 2022, an alternative repair for folding tray tables was developed together with a local Dutch company. This has enabled the replacement of only the damaged section of the tables and has to date prevented the complete scrapping of 500/uni00A0tables.\n\nIn May/uni00A02021, Air/uni00A0France made a commitment to biodiversity by joining the Act4Nature international initiative. Act4Nature is a voluntary initiative aimed at fostering biodiversity that brings together 67/uni00A0major companies with an international presence and which are committed to fulfilling 10/uni00A0common as well as specific commitments. These commitments are recognized as SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time-bound) and are published on the website https://www.act4nature.com/.\n\nKLM has made a commitment to the nature conservation and restoration programs initiated by FORLIANCE (https://forliance. com/about-us). These programs are all Gold Standard certified (the most demanding standard in the voluntary market), which guarantees the e/ffectiveness of these projects in terms of social and environmental benefits.",

        "page_content": "## Assessing the Group's impact on biodiversity\n\nAir/uni00A0France is involved in quantifying the biodiversity footprint of companies along their value chain through its participation in the B4B+ club (https://www.cdc-biodiversite.fr/le-club-b4b/).\n\n## Preservation and restoration of the environment\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's commitments in terms of preserving biodiversity are articulated around the main factors in the erosion of biodiversity, ranked according to the magnitude of their impact:\n\n## Artificialization of soils\n\nLand artificialization is the main cause of species extinction in the world and air transport contributes very little to this. Contrary to popular belief, airports are in fact enclosed and protected areas. Their meadows are a preserved environment that host a rich and sometimes remarkable biodiversity, helping to develop the local ecosystem. Protected from urban development and human activities, airport grasslands, which are generally untreated and un-ploughed, encourage the reproduction of fauna and flora that are often unknown to the general public. Here a whole ecosystem is preserved and protected. Aviation plays a positive role in the preservation of this natural habitat, even though it is now the most threatened in Western Europe.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France supports the 'A\u00e9robiodiversit\u00e9' association, which works to identify, protect and enhance the ordinary biodiversity of airport meadows using participatory science protocols in collaboration with the National Museum of Natural History (MNMH). In France, an average of 73% of the reserved airport areas are made up of green spaces and meadows, i.e. approximately 350/uni00A0km/two.sup for all structures hosting aircraft. The CDG hub, for example, covers approximately 2,140/uni00A0hectares, including 1,144/uni00A0hectares of green space. The Orly hub covers about 930/uni00A0hectares, of which 553/uni00A0hectares is green space.\n\n## Over-exploitation of resources:\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group contributes to the preservation of nature and seeks to have a positive impact on biodiversity through reforestation programs and the restoration of degraded land.\n\nIn this context, KLM supports projects initiated by FORLIANCE in several countries, all of them being Gold Standard certified.\n\n- > in Panama, the 'CO2oL Tropical Mix project' is located in an area of high biological diversity, which has been severely degraded due to unsustainable cattle-breeding practices. The objective is to reforest the land with a mix of agroforestry and protected areas. By using nature-based solutions (NBS) such as agroforestry, the project ensures long-term benefits like the protection and enhancement of biodiversity, the restoration of a valuable ecosystem and fair employment for local communities selling cocoa from certified agroforestry;\n- > in Colombia, a reforestation project that focuses on the regeneration of native trees. More than 70,000/uni00A0hectares are certified and protected, and local communities can make a living from the sustainable production of wood;\n- > in Uganda, the project aims to conserve biodiversity and improve the economic situation of the surrounding villages by combining protected areas where biodiversity is restored and production land where wood is produced in a sustainable way.\n\nKLM also o/ffers its customers the opportunity to contribute to these projects and support carbon balancing and biodiversity restoration. More information about these projects can be found at: StoryMap - KLM (forliance.com).\n\nSince January/uni00A02020, Transavia has also o/ffered this service to its customers.\n\nAir/uni00A0France supports reforestation and tree-planting projects in partnership with EcoAct to capture and store atmospheric/uni00A0CO2 in natural sinks (forests, mangroves). For example:\n\n- > Air France supports a research-action program for the conservation and restoration of mangroves in Martinique as part of the French Low Carbon Label in collaboration with the French Ministry for Ecological Transition. Mangroves are tropical coastal forest formations which, in addition to harboring a very rich biodiversity, represent a very e/fficient sink for carbon capture and sequestration. This project aims to improve knowledge of the ecosystem services provided by these environments and to carry out actions to replant mangroves in the French Overseas Departments and Territories;\n- > Air France also supports projects to combat deforestation in Brazil and Cambodia. Thus, the Anourok forestry project in the Cardamom Mountains prevents deforestation of a unique and biodiverse region that is the habitat of many native species. The region is home to the second largest virgin rainforest in Southeast Asia, which is under significant pressure from illegal logging and poaching. The project focuses on the south of this region, with the aim of preserving its unique biodiversity, which provides a habitat for many species including 50/uni00A0present on the IUCN red list, including the Asian elephant, the brown bear of Asia, the clouded leopard, the Siamese crocodile,/uni00A0etc.\n\nIn its relationship with subcontractors and suppliers, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group ensures that environmental protection is guaranteed. The Ecovadis assessment and its 360\u00b0/uni00A0monitoring system in the Environment category ensures that the supplier being assessed has not had any serious negative results over the last three years. The Ecovadis evaluations allow us to assign a score per category (Environment, Human Rights and Labor Rights, Ethics and Responsible Purchasing), all of which contribute to the overall score assigned to each company evaluated. Biodiversity is one of the nine themes evaluated in the environment field with the impacts of the Company's activities on flora, fauna, protected lands and ecosystems all being taken into account. As a result, the severity and probability of the occurrence of risks (including deforestation) are in fact reduced, and even greatly reduced, especially when the suppliers are themselves committed to fighting deforestation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Climate change is a major challenge for Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, and is also an important factor in the preservation of biodiversity. Reducing greenhouse gases (GHGs) is the primary lever for reducing our impact on biodiversity. All actions that make it possible to reduce our/uni00A0CO2 emissions have an indirect beneficial e/ffect on reducing the loss of biodiversity and the degradation of ecosystems.\n\n## Pollution (air, water, noise, waste)\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's actions to improve air quality on the ground (see notably above 'Employee commuting') and water quality, to reduce its noise footprint, to reduce the use of single-use plastics and to better manage its waste, are all initiatives that help limit pollution and, consequently, reduce the negative impact on biodiversity.\n\n## Contributing to the fight against invasive species\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM participates in the fight against the introduction of invasive species by respecting the prohibitions on the transportation of certain animal and plant species as well as the conditions for authorized transportation as set out in the conventions and regulations in force.\n\n## Combating the tra/ffic of protected species\n\nTo its cost, air transport is particularly concerned by this tra/ffic, which is the fourth largest organized criminal network. To tackle this problem, in 2017 the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group became a signatory of the Buckingham Palace Declaration, which formalizes its resolute commitment to combating the illegal trade in protected species and its zero-tolerance approach. In addition, through Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's membership of IATA, the Group is a member of CITES (Convention on International\n\nTrade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) and fully respects the Convention. Air/uni00A0France is also behind the creation of an inter-professional platform bringing together several corporate partners as well as governmental bodies and NGOs with the aim of making Paris-CDG a 'no-fly' zone in respect of these species. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM also carries out awareness and communication actions for customers and employees (dedicated intranet site, creation and reminder of procedures).\n\nThe Cargo division deploys a wide number of initiatives involving, notably, training for employees and raising customer awareness, and participates in working groups with international organizations and associations such as the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH), the International O/ffice of Epizootics (OIE), IATA and United for Wildlife. KLM also has a global policy that prohibits the carrying of game and hunting trophies. In the summer of 2022, Air/uni00A0France launched an extensive poster campaign aimed at customers and employees to help them identify and report suspicious behavior or baggage to the relevant authorities. Customers are also informed on the commercial website under the heading 'Items forbidden in baggage' and on board long-haul flights through an awareness-raising video on illegal tra/ffic.\n\n## Acting locally by engaging employees\n\nIn addition to these actions, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM raises awareness among its individual and corporate customers about these initiatives to protect biodiversity. Informing and involving our employees and reaching out to as many people as possible are also a priority, through forums, briefings, training, dedicated intranet pages and biodiversity observation days at airports. Since 2021, Air/uni00A0France has been encouraging and facilitating the civic commitment of its employees by providing them with the Vendredi platform, which enables employees to get in touch with, for example, environmental and biodiversity protection associations.",

It provides decarbonization guidelines to implement the transition to an emission-neutral economy by 2050 (i.e. generating zero net emissions in line with the regulatory target rea/ffirmed in the Climate and Resilience Act of August/uni00A02019). Within this framework, a series of greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, based on the allocation of five-year carbon budgets that must not be exceeded, have been established in the short and medium term for each sector of the economy. In line with France's multilateral commitments, these budgets make it possible to identify a target trajectory to be respected and implemented by each player at its own level.\n\nFor air transportation, the scope of this trajectory includes emissions related to flights within and between the di/fferent national geographical zones, including metropolitan France and the overseas departments (DOM). Emissions associated with air links between foreign countries are therefore excluded. While intra-European flights are governed by the EU ETS, international flights, subject to the ICAO legal framework, are governed by the CORSIA program (see Chapter/uni00A04.3.1). This program is based on o/ffsetting/uni00A0CO2 emissions when they exceed a pre-established reference threshold (set at 85% of the volume of emissions for the year 2019).\n\n## The SNBC trajectory and the AMS scenario for air transportation\n\nThe emission reduction trajectory as defined by the SNBC is based on the AMS ('with additional measures') reference scenario. This scenario integrates all the public policy measures, in addition to those already in place, that will make it possible to achieve the reduction targets set. Based on the 'carbon' budgets allocated to each sector, it allows for the setting of stepwise targets until Net Zero Carbon is achieved.\n\nFor the transportation sector as a whole, the AMS scenario foresees a 28% reduction by 2030 before a gradual and complete decarbonization by 2050. Air transportation is fully integrated in this trajectory through a contribution scheme proportional to the emissions attributable to it and based on clearly-identified levers. Thus, the AMS scenario dedicated to air transportation takes into account assumptions on traffic growth, energy e/fficiency improvements and biofuel incorporation. It leads to the following/uni00A0CO2 emissions trajectory, for which the 'National Air Transport' component is used as an assumption for the Transport part of the SNBC.\n\n## AMS scenario projections\n\n| MtCO2e       | 2015   | 2025   | 2030   | 2050   |\n|--------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Domestic air |        |        |        |        |\n| transport    | 4.7    | 4.8    | 4.9    | 2.3    |\n\nIn order to comply with the reduction rate set for national air transportation within the framework of the SNBC, Air/uni00A0France has defined its own trajectory, basing its calculations on a series of assumptions. Some of these assumptions can be commonly used to build the SNBC trajectory and the decarbonization trajectory of the Group across the scope of its worldwide operations, while others are specific to the perimeter covered by the SNBC.\n\n## Assumptions common to the worldwide trajectory of the Air/uni00A0France group\n\n- > Emission factor: 1/uni00A0ton of kerosene burned generates the emission of 3.16/uni00A0tons of/uni00A0CO2 (reference SBTi).\n- > Percentage of incorporation of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF): minimum incorporation target of 10% in 2030 to reach 63% in 2050.\n- > Gains related to the optimization of flight operations: 4% by 2050 compared to 2019.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The method of calculation, the forecast data used and the reduction targets defined as a result are in line with the Science Based Target initiative methodology, whose role is to enable businesses to set ambitious emissions reduction targets consistent with the latest climate science.\n\n## The Air/uni00A0France group's strategy to meet the trajectory\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France Group's/uni00A0CO2 emission trajectory on the SNBC scope is supported by its ambitious overall decarbonization targets:\n\n- > in the short term (2024), the Air/uni00A0France Group aims to reduce its/uni00A0CO2 emissions over the domestic point-to-point perimeter (based at Orly) by 50% compared to the 2019 baseline;\n- > in the medium term (by 2030), the Air/uni00A0France group aims to reduce its carbon intensity (expressed in/uni00A0CO2 emissions per Revenue Ton Kilometer) by 30% compared to the 2019 baseline;\n- > In the long term (by 2050), a reduction of/uni00A0CO2 emissions of at least -50% compared to 2019.\n\nA Sustainable Aviation Fuel incorporation target of at least 10% in 2030 and 63% by 2050:\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions forecast trajectory Comparison of the AMS scenario (SNBC) and the Air France trajectory (Base 100 in 2025)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScenario AMS-SNBC AF Group scope - SNBC These targets translated into the SNBC geographical scope enable the tracing of an emissions forecasting trajectory which, as shown by the graph above, complies with the AMS scenario. Although in some respects uncertain as concerns a time horizon as far away as 2050, the forecasts for fleet renewal, the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and improved operational e/fficiency due to optimized flight procedures are the key factors underlying this trajectory.",

This has led to the signature of some major contracts with the main suppliers in the sector:\n\n- > on October/uni00A025, 2022, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM signed two contracts with Neste and DG Fuels for the supply of 1.6/uni00A0million tons of sustainable aviation fuel. These contracts are an important first step towards achieving one of the Group's objectives: incorporating 10% SAF by 2030. These contracts will represent approximately 3% of this 10%;\n- > on December/uni00A05, 2022, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and Total Energies signed a Memorandum of Understanding for the supply\n\nof more than one million cubic meters (800,000/uni00A0metric tons) of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM companies over a 10-year period, starting in 2023.\n\n## -Fleet  renewal\n\nThe specificities of Air/uni00A0France's decarbonization trajectory aligned with the SBTi methodology are based on several key elements linked to fleet renewal. The replacement of the B777-300ER aircraft on the long-haul network to the French Overseas Departments is not planned before 2028. From that date, the arrival of the A350-900/uni00A0will accelerate the reduction i n /uni00A0C O 2 emissions. For Air/uni00A0France short-haul operations departing from the Paris airports, the entry into service of the A220 aircraft family to replace the current A320s by 2025 will be an e/ffective lever. Transavia's fleet will also be renewed in the short term, as the new generation A320neo aircraft will replace the B737-800s.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

Work on optimizing these indicators was undertaken in 2018 to align the Grenelle II reporting with the new requirements linked to the transposition of the Directive in the Extra-financial performance statement.\n\nSince 2018 and in application of the provisions of Article L./uni00A0 225-102-1/uni00A0of the French Code of Commerce (Code de Commerce), it has been the responsibility of our Independent Third Party to determine the compliance of the Extra-financial performance statement and the accuracy of the published CSR information.\n\nFurthermore, the data relating to the 'Conventional kerosene consumption' and 'CO2eq emissions associated with conventional kerosene consumption' indicators linked to the Flight Operations have been verified with the highest level of assurance, reasonable assurance (indicated by the symbol \u221a ), since 2007-08.\n\n## Scope covered and scope N-1\n\nFor the flight operations, the environmental consolidation scope covers:\n\n- > all the commercial flights under the AF codes operated by Air/uni00A0France and HOP!, and the TO codes operated by Transavia France;\n- > all the commercial flights under the KLM code operated by KLM and its subsidiaries KLM Cityhopper B.V. (KLC), Martinair and Transavia Netherlands.\n\nFor the ground operations, the environmental consolidation scope covers:\n\n- > Air France consolidated subsidiaries: HOP!, CRMA, Sodexi, BlueLink and Transavia France;\n- > KLM consolidated subsidiaries: KLC (KLM Cityhopper), KES (KLM Equipment Services), KCS (KLM Catering Services), KHS (KLM Health Services), Transavia Netherlands, Martinair and EPCOR (for a portion of the indicators).\n\nFor the ground activities, the consolidation scope for the environmental reporting covers nearly 100% of the sites in France and the Netherlands (some very small subsidiaries being excluded). The international stations are not taken into account (partially for the French Overseas Departments and Territories).\n\nFor Air/uni00A0France, the indicators in the French stations are not reported when there is no detail available on the charges invoiced by airports. The contribution from the relevant stations is, however, marginal compared with the reported data.\n\n## Reporting tools\n\nThe environmental indicators are assembled at local level via different reporting tools: ONEmission (Enablon software), Tennaxia for waste, SAP Finance (invoicing) for Air/uni00A0France and CaeSaR for KLM.\n\nThe reliability of the reporting process is supported by definitions of each indicator and tool user guides made available to the contributors. Consistency tests have also been implemented.\n\nThe consolidation of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's environmental data is carried out by the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Sustainability department.\n\n## Details and methodology - Definition of the key performance indicators and comments on changes in the indicators\n\nAt Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group level, the regulatory requirements and the reporting and consolidation principles are outlined in a joint document which is updated annually. Within the framework of an improvement-based approach, methodological details are provided on some indicators, and particularly on their definitions. When these changes have a significant impact on the data, comparison with the figures for previous years is not meaningful.\n\nWhen the data is not available, the figure reported for the year (N) is estimated based on the value reported for the previous year (N-1).\n\nThe reporting period for the Group's environmental data is based on a rolling twelve-month period from October/uni00A01/uni00A0until September/uni00A030 for ground data and January/uni00A01/uni00A0to December/uni00A031 for flight.\n\n## Definition of the key performance indicators\n\n## Comments on changes in the indicators\n\nFor Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, 2022 was to be a year of recovery compared with 2020 and 2021, although activity remained at a lower level than in 2019 due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, particularly in the first quarter with the Omicron strain, but also throughout the year with the continued closure of most Asian countries. The war between Russia and Ukraine, which began in February/uni00A02022, also had a significant impact on overall activity in 2022.\n\nWhile the Group increased its capacity by around 44% in 2022 compared to 2021 in terms of seats, its level of activity, albeit is close, did not return to its 2019 level (15% di/fference). However, the overall energy e/fficiency of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has improved in 2022, as fuel consumption and carbon emissions have increased to a lesser proportion (+40%) than the Group's activity (+44%).\n\nEnergy e/fficiency per passenger (CO2eq/passenger/km) improved significantly in 2022 (by 19% relative to 2021), after a sharp deterioration in 2020 (29%) followed by a slight improvement (6%) in 2021, thanks in particular to the increase in the load factor, which was significantly higher in 2022 (+25/uni00A0points) than in 2021. Energy e/fficiency per passenger nonetheless remained below the 2019 level (72/uni00A0gCO2eq/passenger/km in 2019 versus 77/uni00A0gCO2eq/passenger/km in 2022).",

It is calculated using the actual jet fuel consumed and the number of passengers flown over the actual flight distance planned. For international flights, the fuel burned is divided between passengers and cargo based on mass. The distance used is the flight distance planned which is on average around 7% longer than the great circle distance due to various restrictions (no fly zones, local air tra/ffic control, weather conditions,/uni00A0etc.). The standard mass for a passenger plus luggage amounts to 100 kg (ICAO-standard).\n\nFrom 2022 onwards, the fuel e/fficiency with the market-based measures that compares the e/fficiency of the current year with the value in 2005, is no longer tracked and is replaced by the greenhouse gas Emissions Intensity (GHG) indicator (see Note/uni00A01).\n\n## Carbon e/fficiency -/uni00A0CO2eq emissions for freight transportation\n\nFuel e/fficiency is expressed both in liters of kerosene per 100/uni00A0kg of freight - 100/uni00A0kilometers and in grams of/uni00A0CO2 per 100/uni00A0kg of freight. The calculation is based on a split of fuel between passengers and freight. The fuel consumption for freight is divided by 0.1TK and corrected by the ratio between the planned flight distance and the shortest distance. Freight/uni00A0CO2eq emissions are calculated based on the fuel consumption from which the of/uni00A0CO2eq emissions linked to the use of sustainable alternative fuels are deducted.\n\n## Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity (Note/uni00A01)\n\nIn 2022, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM group committed to the SBTi program and has set itself the target of reducing its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity by 30% by 2030 compared to the reference year 2019 (in gCO2eq/RKT). This target was validated in November/uni00A02022 for Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, as well as for Air/uni00A0France and KLM.\n\nThe GHG emissions intensity is expressed in Tons of/uni00A0CO2 equivalent per Revenue Ton-Kilometer (gCO2eq/RKT). This indicator covers in absolute terms the/uni00A0CO2eq Scope/uni00A01 (emissions from the Group's direct activities) and Scope/uni00A03 (upstream emissions from the fuel production of the Group's activities) emissions, divided by the sum of RKT (Revenue ton-kilometer) and RPK (Revenue passenger-kilometer), representing all the industry segments in which the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group operates. The scope of activities taken into account for its evaluation is the same as that used for the URD. Carbon o/ffsetting and avoided emissions are not included in the calculation of the indicator to comply with the SBTi methodology and framework.\n\nThe baseline for the indicator in 2019 is 948/uni00A0gCO2eq/RTK.\n\n## CO2eq emissions from the ground operations (Note/uni00A03)\n\nThe/uni00A0CO2eq emissions from the ground operations include all scope/uni00A01 and 2/uni00A0emissions at the sites in France and the Netherlands.\n\n## Non-recycled non-hazardous industrial waste\n\nNon-recycled non-hazardous industrial waste is defined as waste disposed of (Eural Code D). Waste incinerated with energy recovery (Eural Code R1) and R12 or R13 waste, for which it is not possible to know whether this waste has been recycled or incinerated with energy recovery, is categorized as Non-Recycled Waste as a conservative position.\n\n## Comments on changes in the environmental indicators\n\n## Carbon emissions (Note/uni00A04)\n\nDirect and indirect/uni00A0CO2eq emissions are reported in accordance with the GreenHouseGas Protocol. Since 2017, the scope/uni00A03/uni00A0emissions from flight operations (upstream emissions from Jet fuel) have been reported. According to ADEME, the/uni00A0CO2eq emissions correspond to 98% of all greenhouse gases.\n\n## Scope/uni00A01 - Aviation fuel\n\nScope/uni00A01/uni00A0emissions generated by the combustion of aviation fuel are reported for all the kerosene used in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's flight operations. The emission factor used of 3.16/uni00A0kgCO2eq per kg kerosene is in line with the emission factor from the ICAO (CORSIA - Carbon O/ffsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation). Since the combustion of kerosene does not emit/uni00A0CH4 or/uni00A0N2O, we consider in this situation that the/uni00A0CO2 emitted is similar to the equivalent/uni00A0CO2.\n\nNote that there are di/fferences between the scope of the/uni00A0CO2eq emissions published in the Extra Financial Performance Statement and the scope of the EU ETS for greenhouse gas emission allowance, so the comparison is not meaningful.\n\n## Scope/uni00A01 - Ground operations\n\nThe direct emissions from the ground operations are based on the consumption of energy coming from di/fferent sources and their corresponding emission factors. The factors are based on national standards or are delivered by the energy suppliers.\n\nIn 2022, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group updated all its emission factors to express its direct emissions in/uni00A0CO2eq.\n\nCO2eq (or carbon dioxide equivalent) is the unit of measurement used to compare the global warming impacts of different greenhouse gases./uni00A0CO2eq is calculated by measuring all the greenhouse gases (nitrogen, methane, carbon dioxide/uni00A0etc.) emitted at all stages of the ground activities. To simplify the analysis of their footprint, we convert these greenhouse gases into/uni00A0CO2 equivalent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

The emission factors used are taken from the ADEME database for Air/uni00A0France and the CO2emissiefactoren database for KLM;\n- > market-based method: this method takes into account the contractual agreements under which the organization sources electricity from specific sources, such as renewable energy. It is becoming mandatory to provide Certificates of Origin guaranteeing that the electricity has been produced from a renewable energy source and fed into the electricity grid. The/uni00A0C O 2 emissions reduction resulting from the purchase of these certificates for renewable electricity are subtracted from the total. The renewable energy rates are communicated by the suppliers. Note that, the electricity supply is 100% renewable for KLM.\n\nTo facilitate comparison with the 2022 results, the 2021 data (based on electricity consumption only) has been recalculated by integrating heating and cooling consumption.\n\n## Scope/uni00A03 - Upstream emissions from kerosene production\n\nThese emissions are generated during the production, transportation and distribution of kerosene.\n\nIn 2022, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group updated the greenhouse gas emission factor used to calculate Scope/uni00A03/uni00A0emissions to align with the SBTi methodology. It is 0.80422 (former factor = 0.6448) kgCO2eq per kg of fuel, determined from the emission factor defined by the ICAO (89/uni00A0gCO2e/MJ) for the entire life cycle of kerosene and the heating value of kerosene (44.5/uni00A0MJ/kg).\n\nTo facilitate the comparison with the 2022 results, the Scope/uni00A03/uni00A0values for 2021 have been recalculated for the Air/uni00A0 France, KLM and Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM groups on the basis of this new emission factor.\n\n## Scope/uni00A01 & 3 - CO2 eq emission reduction from the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (Note/uni00A03)\n\nThe/uni00A0C O 2eq reductions from the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) are calculated based on the specific percentage/uni00A0CO2eq reduction for the particular SAF batch and the total volume purchased.\n\n## Emissions regulation - ETS (Emissions Trading System) (Note/uni00A04)\n\nThe volume of reported mandatory carbon credits is based on the annual reporting of the ETS and CORSIA. Free allowances and the trading costs are excluded.\n\nThe number of ETS emission allowances reported by the Air/uni00A0France group in 2021 has been corrected from 336/uni00A0to 250, to include the CH-ETS and Transavia France allowances.\n\n## Carbon credits (Note/uni00A05)\n\n- > Mandatory : Pursuant to Article 147/uni00A0of the French Climate and Resilience Law, the Air/uni00A0France group is required to compensate 50% of its 2022 domestic emissions. This mandatory compensation scheme for the Air/uni00A0France Group applies to the domestic emissions emitted since January/uni00A01, 2022. As a result, in 2022, the Air/uni00A0France group changed its policy, moving from a voluntary to a mandatory basis. The scope of mandatory compensations will gradually increase starting from 50% of domestic emissions in 2022, to 70% in 2023 and 100% in 2024.\n- > Voluntary : The volume of voluntary carbon credits is calculated over the calendar year. Voluntary carbon o/ffsetting of/uni00A0CO2 paid by customers is not included. The carbon credits are purchased by Air/uni00A0France and KLM. These carbon credits are Gold Standard or VERRA certified.\n- > Customer : The volume of voluntary carbon credits is calculated based on the calendar year. This concerns the voluntary/uni00A0CO2 compensation paid by customers via the Air/uni00A0France and KLM programs.\n\n## Flight operations\n\n## Consumption of conventional aviation fuel\n\nThis is the actual conventional aviation fuel consumption for each flight. It includes the fuel consumption for the use of APUs (Auxiliary Power Unit).\n\n## Consumption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel\n\nThis is the quantity of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) purchased during the reporting period.\n\n## Non-carbon emissions -/uni00A0NOx low altitude\n\nThe methodology used to calculate low-altitude emissions (i.e. below 3,000/uni00A0feet) is common to Air/uni00A0France and KLM. It is based on the LTO (Landing-Take O/ff) cycle and on engine data communicated by the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization). The taxiing time taken into account is the actual taxiing time, which is more precise than the standard values recommended by the ICAO methodology. Note that, since the actual taxiing time is not available for Transavia France, the standard ICAO values have been used for this subsidiary.",

        "page_content": "## Non-carbon emissions -/uni00A0SO2 low altitude\n\nNote: the 'low altitude' and 'LTO' for Landing-Take O/ff cycle denominations are equivalent. The calculation of the/uni00A0SO2 emissions from flight operations is based on the average sulfur content (level provided by the SMCA company for Air/uni00A0France and AFS for KLM, in charge of Jet Fuel logistics at CDG and AMS) of the fuel loaded, respectively, on the Amsterdam and Paris platforms which is applied, respectively, to all fuel used during the year by KLM and its subsidiaries, and by Air/uni00A0France and its subsidiaries.\n\n## Acoustic impact\n\nThe measurement of the acoustic impact of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group changed in 2021 and is now closer to those commonly used by other air transport operators. It is measured according to the classification of its fleet in operation according to the ICAO noise chapters. The indicator evaluates the percentage of aircraft certified under chapters 4 and 14 (which are the most e/fficient noise levels for jet aircraft to date) out of the total fleet in operation. Thanks to its ongoing e/fforts to renew its fleet, the Group has achieved good results, with 75% of its fleet certified at very high noise standards (chapters 4 and 14). The flights concerned are under the commercial codes AF, KL, TO, HV and MP, operated, franchised and chartered, code-share excepted.\n\n## Ground operations\n\n## Consumption - Electricity (of which renewable)\n\nThis is the total volume of electricity use in/uni00A0MWh. For KLM the volume of renewable electricity is based on the purchase of EU Certificates of Origin coming from wind energy.\n\n## Consumption - Other energies: Fuel\n\nThe total volume of fuel use for the ground operations includes:\n\n- > kerosene (Jet fuel A1) for testing engines;\n- > non-road diesel fuel for a portion of the Air/uni00A0France runway equipment;\n- > gasoline, diesel and GTL for the Ground Support Equipment (GSE).\n\n## Consumption - Other energies: Natural gas\n\nThe total quantity of natural gas is mainly used for heating buildings, maintenance hangars and cargo warehouses. The conversion factor for the quantity of gas used is based on the characteristics of the gas specific to France and the Netherlands.\n\n## Consumption - Other energies: Steam/other heating/ cooling (of which renewable)\n\nThis includes superheated and iced water for climate comfort. For Air/uni00A0France, superheated and iced water is supplied by ADP (A\u00e9roports de Paris) at the Orly and Roissy sites. The KLM facilities do not consume this type of energy.\n\n## Consumption - Other: Water consumption\n\nThe consumption of water is taken into account for all the ground activities. The water used on board the aircraft is not included.\n\n## Non-carbon emissions -/uni00A0NOx\n\nThe/uni00A0NOx emissions related to engine testing are calculated based on a methodology similar to the one used for the Flight Operations, which reflects the actual testing conditions. Other sources of/uni00A0NOx include combustion of the fuel used by ground support vehicles and runway equipment. For Air/uni00A0France, the calculation is based on the European standards EURO 1/uni00A0to 6 for light and heavy vehicles, and Stage I to IV for diesel engines (European Directive 97/68/EC for non-road mobile machinery), setting the emission limits based on engine power. For KLM, the/uni00A0 NOx emissions from gas installations and vehicles are determined by direct measurements, from manufacturer data or external databases.\n\n## Waste - Non-hazardous industrial waste and percentage recycled\n\nNon-hazardous waste is monitored and reported by specialized waste management providers. KLM's scope includes KLM Catering Services (a KLM subsidiary) and therefore Catering waste, unlike Air/uni00A0 France which subtracts this activity. The percentage of non-hazardous waste recycled covers all waste sorted separately for recycling. The percentage of recycling does not cover waste incinerated with energy recovery (EURAL code R1).\n\nTransavia France waste (services included in the rent) is not included in the waste data. However, it represents an insignificant volume (less than 1% of the total tonnage).\n\n## Waste - Hazardous industrial waste and percentage recycled\n\nHazardous industrial waste is monitored and reported by specialized waste management service providers. When the quantity of hazardous waste has not been communicated by the service providers at the end of the reporting period, the quantity mentioned on the slip leaving the site is taken into account. However, this quantity is estimated to be marginal. The recovery of hazardous waste complies with European regulations. The percentage of recovery is the ratio of hazardous industrial waste incinerated with energy recovery and recycled (codes R1 to R13) to total hazardous industrial waste.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Customer satisfaction is notably measured through the Net Promoter Score (NPS), the reference indicator driving customer recommendations. Performance indicators and tools have been developed to track the results on a daily basis.\n\nCustomer satisfaction is above all based on their trust in the Group's airline activities. As a responsible airline Group, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM must ensure the safety and health of its customers, employees and partners. This commitment covers flight safety, health security, the safety of the food services offered on board and in the lounges, the protection of personal data and also occupational health and safety (see section/uni00A04.2.3).

It corresponds to the di/fference between the percentage of promoter customers (scores 9 and 10) and the percentage of customers critical of the brand (scores 0/uni00A0to 6). This concerns the response to the first question asked in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's e-Score online customer satisfaction questionnaire: 'Based on your opinion and experience, how likely are you to recommend Air/uni00A0France/KLM/Transavia to your friends/colleagues?'.

They have deployed this method in all the operational entities and at all levels of the business. The management of Flight Safety risks, notably through systems compiling flight parameters and situation reports, enables threats to be identified, risks to be evaluated, the implementation of remedial measures and the monitoring of the results obtained. It enables proactive management of the risks to maintain them below the level that is deemed acceptable to the responsible management. The management of flight safety risks is monitored by the Corporate Safety Department. An internal quality assurance procedure continuously evaluates the proper functioning of Flight Safety Risk Management. To this end, Air/uni00A0France has decided to invest in new software tools for the management of its safety data.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France is developing synergies between an array of progress-oriented and risk management approaches - Flight Safety, Health & Safety in the Workplace, Customer Service Quality, Operational Performance, Environmental & Sustainable Development, Food Safety & Hygiene. This quality-based approach is the vector for the steering and management of the businesses, aimed at a continuous improvement in results.\n\nKLM deploys a similar approach. The Company is building on the best safety and security practices through an Integrated Safety Management System (ISMS), a working environment of continuous learning and improvement, and independent oversight of the four safety domains: operational, occupational, environmental safety and operational security. KLM thus continuously aims to improve its industry-leading, risk and performance-based Safety Management System in which risk-based decisions can be taken by the responsible management at all levels within KLM. The ISMS is outlined in KLM's Integrated Safety Management Manual (ISMM) and has been approved by the Dutch Civil Aviation Authorities as part of the Air Operator Certificate.\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM's Safety Culture programs, which include promotion, communication, training and learning interventions, are embedded in the companies to enhance safety awareness and the relevant safe attitude and behavior at all levels.\n\nIn 2022, following the Covid-19 public health crisis, activity returned to close to its 2019 level. This led Air/uni00A0France and KLM to implement specific measures to support the development of safety. The Group has realized safety studies aimed at identifying the risks generated by the situation and defining risk mitigation measures enabling the level of safety to be maintained. These actions form part of the international cooperation framework via, notably, participation in the work of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the Flight Safety Foundation. This cooperation enables synergies to be generated, within the SkyTeam alliance and the sharing of information between partner airlines.\n\n## Governance\n\nFlight Safety Committees, chaired by the Executive VicePresidents responsible for the operational entities (Safety Action Groups), meet every quarter within Air/uni00A0France. Their task is to approve the action plans established to apply the orientations set by the companies, the outcomes of inquiries and the results of supervisory acts.\n\nThese committees are also tasked with sharing information on the emergence of new Flight Safety issues originating from feedback or risk analysis, by ensuring that the resources and action plans in place are adapted to the issues.\n\nFlight Safety Committee meetings are held twice a year at the level of each company, to evaluate the e/ffectiveness of the existing action plans.\n\nAt KLM, the Corporate Safety Committee within the KLM Board of Directors meets every quarter to analyze the Safety Indicators. In 2022, KLM maintained its focus on Occupational Safety hazards by updating the overall Occupational Safety Policy to provide structure for the required mitigating action. Occupational risk analyses were performed on the transmission of the virus followed by the implementation of mitigating measures. All working environments, whether these be aircraft, o/ffices or operational work spaces, have been set up to facilitate a safe working and living environment. Safety Action Groups (SAGs), chaired by the Nominated Persons and/or Heads of Divisions are in place across the Company with, at the highest level, the Corporate Safety Action Group chaired by the COO and Accountable Manager. The SAGs decide on the safety action plans during meetings held either weekly or fortnightly. In cooperation with the aviation industry stakeholders at Schiphol Airport, like the airport authorities and Dutch Air Tra/ffic Control, KLM has carried out a number of joint safety risk assessments and conducted mitigating actions to improve safety around the airport. These activities were carried out within the common sector Integrated Safety Management System, a unique collaboration between the aviation players at the airport which was established in 2018.\n\nFurthermore, since Flight Safety is an absolute priority for Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, the Board of Directors conducts an annual review of the Flight Safety indicators (KPIs) and results, and the measures in place to mitigate the impact of the risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ns\n\n## Developing a safety culture\n\nBuilding a company-wide culture of the prerequisite for a safety awareness across all the operations is a gradual yet ongoing approach aimed at raising the ambition of the airlines in the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group. Vocational training is a cornerstone of this culture and thus primarily takes into account the skills and expertise to be acquired in matters of safety: safety training for pilots and cabin crews, and training for the maintenance professions and ground operations.\n\nThe quintessential idea that concerns all employees is a comprehensive safety awareness and a safe working environment, both physical and mental/social. Everyone working in the Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group should feel safe and free to report mistakes and incidents, even those for which they themselves are responsible. By embracing a 'Just Culture' we learn, develop and improve on a permanent basis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

The ambition of Safety Attitude is to always be strengthening the Company's safety performance and promote industry best practices.\n\nThe Safety Attitude program began with a benchmarking study of five companies, completed by a diagnostic phase, conducted by an independent organization. 22,500/uni00A0employees from all the Air/uni00A0France professions responded to a questionnaire and over 600/uni00A0people were interviewed. This in-depth diagnosis enabled the identification of the areas of work that will enable the federation of all employees around a common safety Culture as close to operations as possible, based on transparency and trust. In 2020, despite the crisis, the Executive Committee rea/ffirmed its determination to pursue the project by implementing the first concrete actions, in particular the introduction of field visits for the entire line management. The action plan has been developed with contributions from all the departments to maintain a culture of transparency, simplification and respect for procedures, the evaluation of non-technical skills and inter-business exchanges.\n\nIn 2021, Safety Leadership training courses were deployed from the Executive Committee down to the middle management level, addressing important subjects such as the just culture and arbitration.\n\nIn 2022, other major actions were launched, such as the definition of rescue procedures and 'safety moments' during all briefings and meetings. To this end, a three-year program of concrete actions adapted to each business line has been structured: mobilization of the line management, a culture of transparency, respect of the procedures, evaluation of non-technical competencies and exchange between the professions.\n\n## n Results and performance\n\nDuring 2022, based on the IATA and ICAO definition, we experienced three non-major ground safety accidents and one serious incident, respectively damage to an aircraft on the ground from a collision with another aircraft passing behind, injury to a cabin crew member due to severe turbulence, a passenger injured by the ignition of his electronic cigarette and an un-stabilized approach.\n\nThe rate of reporting of Flight Safety events by sta/ff is above target, contributing to the proper functioning of the Safety Management System.\n\nThe measures taken to accompany the ramp-up in flight operations have borne fruit. The Flight Safety network teams are mobilized to analyze the signals coming from the Safety Management System and to take the appropriate action, in addition to the measures already in force.\n\n## Health security and commercial measures\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ) Context and strategy\n\nSince 2020, the world has had to contend with one of the gravest public health emergencies in its history, a/ffecting all populations across all continents. As of the emergence of the Covid-19 virus, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group implemented unprecedented measures to guarantee the health and safety of its customers and sta/ff, including:\n\n- > exceptional commercial measures have been maintained and constantly adjusted by the airlines within the Group to enable their customers to plan their travel with peace of mind;\n- > in view of the health situation, some countries continue to require a health pass, a negative Covid-19 test and/or quarantine or specific travel documents. Since 2021, customers have had access to the TravelDoc website, enabling them to check the latest entry requirements before travelling;\n- > in addition, Air/uni00A0France's Ready to Fly and KLM's Upload@ Home digital services, free of charge and optional, enable customers to verify that they have all the necessary health documentation before starting their journeys.\n\n## l Measures and action plans\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group implemented the strictest health measures both on the ground and on board, as well as a fully-flexible commercial policy and o/ffered a travel insurance policy in partnership with Allianz Travel for epidemic-related risks.\n\nThese measures included the:\n\n- > mandatory wearing of surgical masks by both customers and sta/ff;\n- > at the airport, posters, announcements and floor signage reminding people of the physical distancing measures;\n- > sales, check-in and boarding counters equipped with Plexiglass protective screens;\n- > regular disinfectection of the check-in counters and self-service kiosks, hydro alcoholic gel dispensers mad are available throughout the customer journey;\n- > possible body temperature checks on the departure of certain flights;\n- > all the health measures were also implemented in the lounges: hydro alcoholic gel dispenser at the entrance, mandatory wearing of masks, organized physical distancing and cleaning of all surfaces.

To facilitate customers in the event of unforeseen developments, the Group's airlines adapted their commercial policies. With 100% changeable and refundable tickets, trips could be postponed for any reason, a refundable credit issued if the customer no longer wished to travel or a refund given if their flight was cancelled.\n\nKLM has introduced an interactive 'Where can I fly to?' map showing the current travel requirements for every country in the KLM network. The map displays the travel requirements based on the customer's country of departure and vaccination status, so they can choose their next destination at a glance.\n\n## n Results and performance\n\nIn 2022, KLM was named a five-star airline by APEX with the status of World Class Airline for the second year running. Customers award this distinction in respect of themes including safety, customer well-being and sustainability.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group was certified by Skytrax for its Covid-19 measures, safety measures and the improvement in its hygiene processes to help reduce the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nWitthin this framework, Air/uni00A0France was certified as a five-star airline and KLM was named a four-star airline. For the second year running, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group won the APEX (Airline Passenger Experience Association) Diamond Award Health Safety award, the highest distinction in its category. This award\n\nrecognizes the best measures put in place by the airlines in terms of health and health safety, showing that the airlines take the right measures at the highest level to o/ffer customers the safest possible journey.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group was certified as a four-star airline for the quality of its airport and onboard product and sta/ff service. This product rating includes the seats, amenities, food and beverages, IFE (Inflight Entertainment Equipment), cleanliness, and the service delivered by cabin crews and ground sta/ff.\n\nFollowing the implementation of Air/uni00A0France Protect, customers were rapidly consulted to evaluate their level of satisfaction with the hygiene measures deployed throughout the customer journey and their in-flight experiences. Since June/uni00A02020, they have thus been invited to complete a questionnaire. Nearly 89% of Air/uni00A0France customers say they are satisfied or very satisfied with the measures in place, approaching 44% reply that they feel comfortable during their journeys and some 27% say that they are enthusiastic/happy; feelings of aggravation, anxiety or stress are reported by 15% of the customers polled.\n\n## Operational measures to take into account the impact of climate change\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ) Context and strategy\n\nFor air transportation, the impacts of climate change could have consequences for the routes and destinations served. In particular, the more frequent occurrence of extreme climate events could a/ffect the safety of flight operations and service continuity (re-routing, flight cancellations and delays,/uni00A0etc.) causing disruption for customers.\n\n## * Measures and performance\n\nSince they are present across all continents, the Group's airlines already operate safely in all weather conditions. They have thus already deployed the procedures and resources to ensure operations in extreme climate conditions. Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Transavia have developed special training programs for employees on the management of emergency situations.\n\nThe airlines also work in cooperation with airports to ensure safe operational and passenger handling conditions and, in such circumstances, deploy commercial measures to enable passengers to defer their travel should they so wish, or change their destinations.\n\nLastly, the size of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM network, with services balanced between the di/fferent continents and the flexibility linked to fleet composition, are all valuable assets when it comes to minimizing the economic and commercial consequences of these impacts, and adapting flight schedules to market requirements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

This is why food safety is a key priority for the Group. Air/uni00A0France and KLM both deploy quality-control procedures to fulfil these requirements. Since September/uni00A01, 2022, Air/uni00A0France Food Safety has been taken into account by the Corporate Multi-Risk Management department in order to benefit from synergies with Flight Safety.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Measures and action plans\n\nThe management system is based on four processes, steered by a centralized unit within the Group:\n\n- > the first process is cross-cutting and applies to the whole risk area: regulatory intelligence, risk analysis and definition of the measures to mitigate these risks, staff training, establishment and updating of the reference standards, monitoring of the action plans;\n- > the three other processes are operational and are detailed based on the activity: on board services, water loaded on board and services o/ffered in the lounges.\n\nThe management measures are deployed by a Food Safety specialist in each relevant entity: procurement, flight operations, in-flight services, maintenance, operations, international stations, logistics and flight product,/uni00A0etc. They are the guarantors that the measures have been applied within their business lines and report back on functioning together with the associated action plans. The management measures are regularly monitored through indicators and decision-making committees ensuring the e/ffectiveness of the provisions in place relating to Food Safety.\n\nDespite the significant reduction in the number of flights owing to the public health crisis, the monitoring of catering suppliers has been maintained while adapting the model. Within the framework of the monitoring process, food safety audits are realized on departure from Paris and Amsterdam, and in the international outstations. To adapt to the public health crisis,\n\nremote audits have been set up. Microbiological checks, water analyses and temperature checks have been maintained in proportion to the flight schedule.\n\nRisk control relating to food safety is managed in the following ways:\n\n- > for airline catering, the caterers are audited at least once a year by an external company specialized in food safety. These on-site hygiene audits are un-announced and are carried out by specially-trained auditors. The audits verify compliance with the IQS (Safety and Quality Standards) for the transformation of foods based on the HACCP principles (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point);\n- > e-audits are also conducted to verify the exhaustiveness and e/ffectiveness of the traceability within all caterers;\n- > in addition, all food product suppliers are referenced based on very strict specifications and are the subject of close microbiological monitoring by an internal laboratory for KLM and an external laboratory for Air/uni00A0France, both of which are ISO/uni00A017025/uni00A0certified.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## n Results and performance\n\nIn addition to compliance with the HACCP Principles & Application Guidelines, Air/uni00A0France is the first airline in the world to have attained ISO/uni00A022000/uni00A0certification. An annual audit carried out by an external body verifies that the management system complies with the standard and with the regulatory requirements. In response to the standard's new requirements, Air/uni00A0France made some changes to its management system which were approved by an external audit in March/uni00A02021. Internal audits are also realized based on a three-year plan across all the relevant business lines.\n\nA series of key indicators, one per operational process, form part of a monthly dashboard presented to the Executive Committee. Any malfunctioning flagged, notably, by flight crews or customers, is also studied to be able to implement remedial and/or preventive measures. Throughout the year, several meetings of in-house steering bodies are held, enabling the monitoring of current events in this area and the tracking of performance via indicators and action plans, with a view to ensuring a continuous improvement.",

Passengers with disabilities or reduced mobility (PDRM) are welcome, providing that air travel is not undertaken against medical advice.\n\nThis calls for the appropriate assistance involving a degree of complexity owing, notably, to the di/fferences between EU and US regulations. In the United States, the responsibility falls solely to the airline and there are no reporting requirements for US citizens and passengers on flights to/from the US. In the European Union, however, the airport authority is responsible for the end-to-end assistance of PDRMs during their journeys through airports and customers are invited to transmit this information to the airline 48/uni00A0hours before departure, the airline then being responsible for forwarding this information to the airport authority 36/uni00A0hours prior to departure. At Paris-CDG, Paris A\u00e9roport (ADP Group) oversees special assistance for Air/uni00A0France passengers via its Passerelle CDG and Samsic service providers. At Amsterdam-Schiphol Airport, PDRM assistance is supplied by Axxicom Airport Caddy.\n\nFor disabled and reduced mobility (PDRM) customers, within the context of the public health crisis, the airlines have reinforced their protocols to guarantee their health and well-being (wheelchairs disinfected daily and after every use, the wearing of masks and gloves by airport assistance personnel,/uni00A0etc.).

As the application of ethical, social and environmental principles constitutes an important criterion when selecting suppliers and service providers, the latter must confirm their adherence to and compliance with these principles stated in the Supplier Sustainibility Code of Conduct or their own code if acceptable for the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group. This Code of Conduct specifies the commitments on Human Rights, health and safety, the environment and ethics. It is regularly reviewed and updated to\n\nSustainable Code of Conduct based on the ten Principles of the United Nations Global Compact or to comply with their own Code of Conduct provided that its terms and conditions are as stringent as the ones in the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Supplier Sustainability Code of Conduct (see sections 4.6.2 and 4.6.3).\n\nAir/uni00A0France carries out awareness-raising actions for its employees on human tra/fficking, to help them to identify at-risk situations and take action against this form of international organized crime, comparable with modern-day slavery. Whether it is tra/fficking for the purpose of forced labor or crime, sexual exploitation, illegal adoption or forced marriage, child soldiers, organ tra/fficking or other forms of human exploitation, the ground sta/ff and flight crews should be able to recognize behavior that may seem abnormal or concerning and, in the event of suspected human tra/fficking, report the event as soon as possible and in accordance with the internal instructions. These actions, which were initiated in 2019, continued in 2022.\n\nensure its alignment with the applicable regulations, notably the French Sapin 2/uni00A0Act and the French law on the Duty of Vigilance which sets forth a monitoring obligation concerning the probity of contracting partners respectively with respect to probity and integrity and vigilance with regard to human and social rights, the environment and sustainability within the supply chain.\n\n## Governance and strategy\n\nThe Compliance activities are based on compliance programs, executed within the context of a formalized framework. New legislation or requirements relating, for example, to anti-corruption or protection of personal data are taken into account when establishing the compliance programs and their increased appropriation is ensured via, amongst other initiatives, awareness-raising campaigns, and dedicated processes or projects which are organized to ensure compliance.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has deployed an organization dedicated to compliance. The Compliance Officers within Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Air/uni00A0France and KLM are tasked with overseeing the implementation of the Compliance programs within the Group. They are supported by a network of compliance coordinators appointed in the activities or departments and subsidiaries. Depending on the type of business transaction envisaged and the complexity of the activities exercised within the departments and entities, compliance experts and coordinators facilitate compliance with specific legislation and the roll-out of the relevant elements of the compliance program. In 2022, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Air/uni00A0France and KLM worked on rationalizing and strengthening their respective compliance coordinator networks so that they could help to accelerate the deployment of the compliance programs.",

        "page_content": "In October/uni00A02022, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group selected a service provider to implement a compliance steering digital tool which will also facilitate the deployment and monitoring of the anti-corruption program within the Group.\n\nRisk mapping and Internal Audit reports also contribute to verifying the adequacy and e/ffectiveness of the compliance program, and when necessary, its improvement.\n\nThe compliance program is mainly based on training and awareness-raising. These campaigns are supplemented by dedicated training which is made available to individual employees. Employees can also raise questions or concerns with the Compliance O/fficers and legal experts.\n\n## Prevention of corruption\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is committed to conducting business with loyalty, fairness, transparency, honesty and integrity in the strict respect of the anti-corruption laws in all the countries where its entities are registered and operate.\n\nThis commitment guides its social and ethical policy and is embedded in its Corporate Purpose, as the prevention of and fight against corruption is the basis for responsible and sustainable business around the world.\n\nTo this end, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has implemented internal rules consistent with the requirements of the various anti-corruption laws, including the French Sapin 2/uni00A0Act, the UK Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group regularly reviews and updates its internal documentation to take into account changes in legislation and, recent case law, but also the result of risk mapping and any reported incidents.\n\nFollowing publication of the latest Recommendations from the French Anti-corruption Agency ('AFA'), the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group updated its anti-corruption manual which has since become the anti-corruption Code of Conduct. Six policies were added to\n\nthis code covering the topics of gifts and hospitality, conflicts of interest, facilitation payments, lobbying, sponsoring and patronage and third parties. A policy for compliance concerning M&A transactions is currently being drafted.\n\nThese documents were approved by the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Air/uni00A0 France and KLM Executive Committees in October/uni00A02022 and a presentation was made to the Air/uni00A0France Works Council (Comit\u00e9 de Groupe Fran\u00e7ais) on November/uni00A024, 2022.\n\nAn anti-corruption e-learning campaign was also approved by the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, Air/uni00A0France and KLM Executive Committees in October/uni00A02022. The e-learning module was produced in both French and English. The content is based on examples of cases arising from alerts, cases encountered in practice and the results of bribery risk mapping. The aim is to explain the applicable legal framework, the associated sanctions and the rules stipulated in the updated anti-corruption documentation with a quiz to check that the internal rules have been properly understood. This e-learning module was launched on December/uni00A014, 2022.\n\nIn addition to this e-learning module, a comprehensive training campaign was drawn up with the support of an external service provider to (i)/uni00A0build a dedicated training program for the Top Management and (ii)/uni00A0plan a training program for employees with the highest risk of exposure involving three hours of classroom-based sessions based on a 'train the trainers' principles with the participation of the compliance and legal teams to be rolled out in 2023.\n\nAhead of the roll out of this new campaign, an anti-bribery e-learning module had been deployed to maintain and reinforce the anti-bribery awareness and knowledge of sta/ff. At the end of 2022, the realization rate for this training was 85%. Awareness is also reinforced through, for example, information meetings and discussions, improved access to compliance documents and regular communication by the Group's General Management.\n\nSee also section/uni00A03.2.1 'Risks relating to their air transportation activity'\n\n| Key Performance Indicators                                              | Definition                                                                                                                                                                      | 2021  results   | 2022  results   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Completion rate of the e-learning  program on prevention of  corruption | Number of employees having completed the entire  training program as of December/uni00A031, 2022 divided   by the total number of employees invited to undertake  this training | 85%             | 85%             |\n\nScope: Target group of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group employees.\n\nTraining is mandatory for the target group of employees. The latter is selected based on functional level (i.e. executives or managers) or exposure to bribery risk according to the results of the bribery risk mapping performed within the organization (i.e. the Sales and Procurement teams).\n\nThe indicator measured is the number of employees having completed the entire training program as of December/uni00A031, divided by the total number of employees invited to undertake\n\nthis training.

They can also contact a Compliance O/fficer directly. Employees also have the option to flag an incident via the whistle blower procedure. Both KLM and Air/uni00A0France have reviewed and updated their speak up policies and procedures to collect and manage internal alerts so as to comply with the latest regulations in force.\n\nThese whistle blower procedures also include the option to report any corruption issues or serious incidents linked to the duty of vigilance (Human Rights, fundamental freedoms, health and safety, environment) in all areas of activity, pursuant to the regulation in force via secured channels which ensure the strict confidentiality of the alert and identity of the relevant employees. The associated procedure gives guidance on how to proceed and guarantees that no sanctions will be taken against employees reporting any such incidents in good faith, as provided under the applicable law.\n\nIncidents reported by employees according to the above-mentioned procedures are investigated and the appropriate corrective actions are implemented.\n\n## Prevention of anti-competitive practices\n\nThe prevention of anti-competitive behavior is an important factor in honest and fair business practice. It is crucial to prevent unfair practices since unethical or inappropriate behavior can have significant detrimental consequences, both financial and in terms of reputational damage.\n\nIn terms of anti-competitive practices, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is developing its policy aimed at the prevention of anti-competitive acts by circulating to sta/ff a Competition Law Compliance Manual which was updated in 2020. This manual is regularly reviewed and updated.\n\nA competition law e-learning module was developed in-house and rolled out between December/uni00A014, 2021 to March/uni00A015, 2022 to a significant number of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group employees, to remind them of the competition law principles and the risks incurred.\n\nIn addition to this e-learning module, the competition law team carries out dedicated training sessions with certain categories of sta/ff, as was the case for the Cargo activity in 2022.\n\nSee also section/uni00A03.1.2 'Risks relating to the air transportation activity'.\n\n## Compliance with embargoes, trade sanctions and export controls legislation\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France and KLM Trade Compliance departments are responsible for defining the program to ensure full compliance with commercial sanctions and export control legislation applicable to the Group's activities.\n\nThey monitor changes in the applicable regulations, liaise with the relevant administrations and authorities in charge of control, participate in third-party screening with regard to trade sanctions and follow up on the measures applied in the business activities. They review the need for the request and renewal of export licenses by products category, partner and country (dual use goods, military goods, explosives and ozone depleting products,/uni00A0etc.) and complete or review compliance questionnaires issued by the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group stakeholders (banks, insurers,/uni00A0etc.).\n\nThe Trade Compliance O/fficers ensure the monitoring the existing export control framework.\n\nCustomers of the Air/uni00A0France and KLM joint businesses in cargo and maintenance are monitored thanks the screening tool implemented by KLM. The same tool is used for the screening of suppliers and service providers by the Air/uni00A0France's Treasury and Trade Compliance.\n\nIn February/uni00A02022, an Air/uni00A0France Industries (AFI) Export Control Project, known as the 'International Trade Compliance Roadmap' was approved by the Air/uni00A0France Industries Executive Vice-President for deployment over the next twelve months to respond to the recommendations of both an Internal Audit and an administrative audit.\n\nTraining and awareness-raising is a major priority for the Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group. Joint awareness training initiatives led by the Air/uni00A0France and KLM Trade Compliance teams were scheduled for the last quarter of 2022.\n\n## Tax strategy\n\nTax is an integral part of the Finance function within Air/uni00A0France and KLM and supports Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's corporate strategy. As such the tax strategy is aligned with the business strategy, ambitions and values of the Group. We seek to act fairly, transparently and with integrity towards all our stakeholders. Our tax strategy aims to demonstrate our commitment to compliance with legislation and to explaining Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's approach to tax.\n\n## Main principles\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM bases its approach to tax on a set of three key principles: Compliance, Transparency and Risk Management.\n\n## Compliance\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM recognizes the important role fiscal compliance plays in its strategy and undertakes to act with integrity and transparency in all tax matters, and to combat tax evasion. The Company is committed to compliance with the letter, intention and spirit of the tax legislation, local and international legislation (including bilateral tax treaties, OECD and UN guidelines) of the countries in which it operates and to pay the right amount of tax at the right time. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM complies with the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Action Plan and files all the required transfer pricing documents, including a Country-byCountry Report.",

        "page_content": "Pursuant to the specific guidelines relating to the taxation of international air transportation services, wherein operational income is taxed in the country of domicile, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM consequently reports most of its airline income in France and the Netherlands. Specific local taxation rules require the Group to also report a relatively small portion in foreign jurisdictions where the Group operates. The tax declarations are duly monitored, based on solid evidence and full transparency. All the information is recorded and reported in a fair, timely, and accurate manner pursuant to good business practices, and in compliance with the applicable accounting standards and local tax laws.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM tax departments are fully involved in sustainable development issues in order to secure the Group's different projects (Trip and Tree, SAF Corporate and SAF Cargo) and to comply with the French and EU obligations in this respect (Fitfor55).\n\n## Transparency\n\nMutual respect, transparency and trust drive the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's relationships with the tax authorities and the other relevant external stakeholders all around the world. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM seeks to establish and maintain an open and constructive dialogue with the tax authorities and other government bodies. The Group participates in the development of tax policies by contributing constructive inputs to public consultations. The aim is to proactively deal with disputed taxation matters and avoid unnecessary challenges and disputes to achieve certainty wherever possible. To this end, the Group has reinforced its relationship with both tax administrations via the following initiatives:\n\n- > on March/uni00A014, 2019, a fiscal partnership was signed between the French tax authorities and Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, the consolidating entity of the French tax group. This partnership is aimed at improving the relationship with the French tax authorities within the framework of the day-to-day operations and ongoing tax audits. While the Covid period did not allow Air/uni00A0France to submit enough elements to the partnership, the 2022 financial year was the opportunity for a real exchange and discussions on certain tax positions of the French Tax group;\n- > KLM has a long-term relationship with the Dutch tax authorities and is one of the top 100/uni00A0companies in the Netherlands to have entered into an individual tax monitoring plan (ITP). Following this ITP approach, the tax authorities test the level of monitoring measures (tax control framework) KLM implements to recognize and manage its key tax risks. Ultimately this approach enables the tax authorities to adapt their control measures for KLM more e/fficiently.\n- > in 2022, in an important step towards further transparency, KLM actively embraced the Dutch tax governance code as developed by The Confederation of Netherlands Industry\n\nand Employers (known as the VNO NCW). Published in May/uni00A02022. the tax governance code not only includes the relevant tax codes and principles but is also more ambitious with regard to:\n\n- -  the view that tax is not only a cost factor but also a contribution to society and that tax rules must be interpreted in accordance with the spirit of the law,\n- -  a reluctance to use tax havens, and\n- -  transparency, especially on taxes paid and collected.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe Group's aim is to take sustainable tax positions which are long-term in nature, in support of the business operations. It only uses business structures that are driven by commercial considerations, are aligned with its business activity and have genuine substance. It does not look at schemes that might be deemed improper at the fiscal level or are intended to avoid paying taxes.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM conducts its operations with a minimum level of risk with respect to tax matters and as such applies the anti-tax-avoidance rules within the framework of the European Directive (EU) 2016-1164 transposed into French and Dutch tax legislation.\n\nThe European mandatory disclosure regime for potentially aggressive international tax arrangements has been in force since July/uni00A01, 2020 (DAC6 Directive, EU 2018/822/uni00A0of May/uni00A025, 2018). Both Air/uni00A0France and KLM's tax departments have reviewed the compliance reporting obligations the businesses are potentially facing under the new Mandatory Disclosure Rules (MDR) in relation to certain cross border arrangements. No such arrangements have been identified.\n\nThe Tax A/ffairs departments in France and the Netherlands seek to anticipate and reduce the tax risks to their lowest-possible level. They ensure that reasonable care applies in relation to all the Group's processes that could materially a/ffect compliance with the tax obligations and are particularly vigilant in the application of the rules combating fraud and tax evasion.\n\n## The global challenges of the public health crisis for tax\n\nThe impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Group has led to unprecedented challenges for all the businesses and for tax a/ffairs globally, in terms of supporting the operations aimed at preserving and improving the Group's liquidity position. In 2022, one element of the Group's fiscal strategy consisted of repaying a portion of its State Aid and worldwide tax deferrals, mainly concerning taxes on tickets, wage taxes and social security contributions.\n\nThe possibility of obtaining government support in the form of employment subsidies and financial plans was also the subject of rigorous verification on the part of the French and Dutch Governments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

These hubs o/ffer multiple connecting opportunities in Europe and with the rest of the world, and are part of an extensive, high-quality network that generates an attractive business environment. According to an Opinionway survey of international investors carried out in 2019, the presence of a hub o/ffering direct and frequent international connections is the second most important criterion when choosing a location. As Air/uni00A0France and KLM serve 300/uni00A0destinations worldwide, in 120/uni00A0countries, there is also an (economic) impact beyond its hubs.\n\nWith 91% of the Group's employees based in France and the Netherlands, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is a significant contributor to direct job creation in the regions around its two main hubs. The Group's activities also generate numerous indirect and induced jobs: assistance and catering in the outstations, cleaning and sub-contracted services required for the operation of an aircraft.\n\nThe hubs create highly-attractive business environments while airport proximity leads to the development of other activities (hotels, conferences, company show-rooms, commercial and marketing functions, business services and activities linked to innovation).\n\nAs the number one air operator carrying international tourists visiting France, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM makes a significant contribution towards promoting France and the Netherlands as destinations, and to the development of tourism.\n\nKLM's extensive network has contributed to making the Netherlands an attractive location for both Dutch and international companies. The Air/uni00A0France Group, with operations at 30/uni00A0French airports in 2022 (in mainland France and overseas), reinforces the appeal of the regions and contributes to the growth in local activity.\n\nHistorically, the Group has also played an active role in promoting international development, particularly through its support of NGOs and projects sponsored by its own employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Measures and action plans\n\n## Contributing to national and local development\n\nFor many years, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has supported the development of small and medium-sized companies to which it entrusts a significant proportion of its procurement. The Group also promotes innovation and working with start-ups via its involvement in initiatives such as the creation of an innovation counter, and participation in special business incubators.\n\nAt local level, Air/uni00A0France and KLM are involved in various initiatives and local bodies to promote sustainable development, and build human capital and the attractiveness of the territories around their hubs. Air/uni00A0France is working in cooperation with local o/fficials and companies as a member of the Board of the 'Club des Acteurs du Grand Roissy'. This association aims to\n\nfoster harmonious and balanced development of the Grand Roissy area, in synergy with the airport platform, and to promote public transport, housing and infrastructure projects that are vital to the development of this region.\n\nBetween 2020 and 2022, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group was significantly impacted by the consequences of the Covid-19 public health crisis. It nonetheless maintained an intensive dialogue with stakeholders at both local and national level to adapt and optimize its schedule, operations and network to take into account, as far as possible, the expectations and connectivity needs of the regions. During the various lockdown phases, particularly in France and the Netherlands, Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Transavia thus maintained a minimum schedule enabling the repatriation of fellow French and Dutch compatriots, and ensuring the basic needs for regional access and connectivity. Furthermore, the Air/uni00A0 France Group maintained territorial continuity between France and the overseas departments and territories, while the whole Group mobilized around operating the air bridge for the transportation of masks and medical equipment.\n\n## Creating social impact\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM support initiatives enabling the development of skills, the vocational integration of young people and the social inclusion of vulnerable individuals. This also includes promoting access to training leading to professions in the airline industry, through numerous associations and educational programs for young people.\n\nAir/uni00A0France is a founder member and partner of four associations involved in information and training programs on aviation careers (AirEmploi, Jeremy, AFMA\u00e9, and Engineers for Schools). The Company is also a partner of two associations, 'Nos Quartiers ont du Talent' and 'Article 1', to which Air/uni00A0France employees volonteers o/ffer mentoring for socially disadvantaged young people. Air/uni00A0France is also a founder member of 'Tous en Stage', an association that organizes multi-company internships for secondary school students in the areas where the Company operates (mainland France, French overseas departments or young people with disabilities).\n\nThe KLM Group contributes to various educational programs to attract and develop future talent, through collaboration with ROC education centers, Luchtvaart College Schiphol, Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences and the JINC Foundation. KLM's Maintenance Department o/ffers internships to students training as aeronautical mechanics: some 75/uni00A0students from 'MBO College Airport' and 25/uni00A0graduate and university students were welcomed to KLM in 2020. KLM is continuing its partnership with the Luchtvaart College Schiphol (Schiphol Aviation School).\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM continue to support workers with disabilities by using companies in the sheltered and adapted sector for multiple projects (e.g. the upkeep of green spaces at some sites, shipment of packages of uniforms, packaging of headphones used on board, laundering of on-board linen) and by entrusting them with highly-critical services (four sheltered sector suppliers work with the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM IT department).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Company thus rea/ffirms its commitment to addressing social and environmental issues in the territories where it operates. Via this network and throughout the year, employees can donate their free time, positive energy and skills to partner associations in six areas of action dear to Air/uni00A0France and the Air/uni00A0France Foundation: Children, Education Training - Employment, Disability-Health, Combating Precarity, Intergenerational Sharing and the Environment.\n\nSince its launch, 3,800/uni00A0Air/uni00A0France employees have registered on the 'Mon engagement Citoyen' platform and nearly 494/uni00A0volunteering actions have already been carried out this year. The 1,281/uni00A0visits to the platform in 2022 also testified to the interest aroused. In total, more than 530/uni00A0employees have taken up at least one challenge or carried out a volunteer action, of which around a quarter in 2022.\n\n## Social partnerships\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group partners with local and global NonGovernmental Organizations to increase its reach and widescale positive impact.\n\nAir/uni00A0France provides practical support to development projects through three long-standing partnerships; the Air/uni00A0France Foundation, Acting for Life and Aviation Sans Fronti\u00e8res.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France Foundation has adapted its projects while pursuing its primary objective: supporting children and youth, as well as humanitarian sponsorship. Long-term projects on the themes of education and integration for sick, disabled and vulnerable children are being pursued and which now include environmental awareness issues. The Foundation finances educational projects contributing to fostering new kinds of behavior and increased understanding of climate issues, together with training and awareness-raising projects on sustainable practices respecting natural resources.\n\nIn 2022, the Air/uni00A0France Foundation supported 45/uni00A0projects (13/uni00A0 projects for environmental education, 24/uni00A0projects for children in di/fficulty, 4 projects for sick or disabled children and 4 projects to support the social and health crisis support projects) in 25/uni00A0countries with 70,000/uni00A0beneficiaries. Among these projects, 12/uni00A0concern France, with 30,000/uni00A0beneficiaries across the national territory. The Friends of the Air/uni00A0France Foundation network mobilizes more than 4,800/uni00A0employees around di/fferent volunteering, skills-sharing and donation-based initiatives.\n\nThe Humanitarian Patronage Service supports 18/uni00A0medical NGOs working with children. In 2022, following the health situation related to Covid-19, 520/uni00A0tickets were issued for medical teams and the repatriation of sick children. In addition, free excess baggage fees were donated to more than 26/uni00A0NGOs for the transportation of medical and emergency aid equipment within the context of the health crisis, i.e. 143/uni00A0pieces of baggage.\n\nIn 2022, Acting for Life, of which Air/uni00A0France has been a partner for more than 40/uni00A0years, was involved in 12/uni00A0projects in Africa and Latin America. Acting for Life works to promote sustainable territorial economic and social development.\n\nThanks to the financial support and transportation facilities donated by Air/uni00A0France, the emergency aid organization Aviation Sans Fronti\u00e8res accompanied more than 950/uni00A0sick children on the airline's flights and shipped nearly 7,500/uni00A0packages of medicines and minor medical supplies to 26/uni00A0destinations. In addition, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Flying Blue loyalty program enables Aviation Sans Fronti\u00e8res to benefit from numerous miles, thereby reducing the transportation costs incurred in accompanying sick children. There are many active and retired Air/uni00A0France employees amongst the Aviation Sans Fronti\u00e8res teams of volunteers.\n\nFor many years, Air/uni00A0France has been involved in promoting sustainable and responsible tourism within the travel profession ecosystem, and particularly the most proactive like Agir pour un Tourisme Responsable (ATR). Air/uni00A0France also acts as an information conduit on the devastation caused by child sex tourism, by financing ECPAT International's prevention campaign and handing out literature on the airline's long-haul flights.\n\nTwenty-four years ago, Transavia created the Peter Pan Holiday Club. This initiative, supported by Transavia employees, organizes holidays for young people between the ages of 13 and 20/uni00A0years who are unable to enjoy a 'normal' holiday due to illness or di/fficult circumstances. Transavia also works closely with JINC, an organization that arranges activities for children from economically-disadvantaged backgrounds.\n\nTransavia employees are invited and encouraged to actively participate in these initiatives during which children notably visit companies to gain valuable insight into the working world and its functioning, and become familiar with the concept of networking. These initiatives illustrate the Transavia conviction that 'Everybody deserves to be seen' and contribute to a more inclusive society.\n\nFor over a decade, Transavia France has been supporting the Louis Carlesimo association, enabling sick children to travel on its flights. Every year, between 50 and 80/uni00A0children have the opportunity to travel to Lapland and meet Father Christmas on the outbound flight as part of a magical and unforgettable moment with the airline. In 2022, once again, the magic worked and 80/uni00A0children, accompanied by 11/uni00A0employees, were able to explore Lapland and visit Santa Claus.",

In 2022, special flights were organized to raise customer awareness and highlight the association. In Partnership with Les Hommes de l'Air limited edition key rings were sold on board the aircraft as well as to employees. All proceeds were donated to the association.\n\nSince 2019, Transavia has fostered diversity by supporting Personn'Ailes, an LGBT association. Each year, special flights are organized in the colors of rainbow to share a common vision of diversity and inclusion. On May/uni00A017, 2022, Transavia organized special flights to raise awareness of homophobia, transphobia and biphobia.\n\nKLM works together with selected partners to protect the environment and preserve cultural heritage. In addition, KLM supports a number of large institutions that assist people in need. One of these is Wings of Support, which was founded by KLM and Martinair sta/ff, and runs projects that provide shelter, education and medical care for children in need worldwide. In 2021, the partnership with Wings of Support was extended for a further three years. KLM is also engaged in several partnerships that aim to preserve cultural heritage and, more generally, o/ffer support to arts and cultural initiatives. Examples include the Royal Concertgebouw in Amsterdam, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and leading museums and theaters in the Netherlands.\n\nLastly, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM customers who are members of the Flying Blue loyalty program are o/ffered the opportunity to donate their miles to 18/uni00A0NGOs selected by Air/uni00A0France and KLM, including WWF, the Ocean Cleanup, Close the Gap, the Red Cross, UNICEF, Wings of Support and Giro555.

The KLM Group accounted for more than 31,000/uni00A0jobs.\n\nSee section/uni00A04.2.2 'Resource adaptation and employee dialogue' for the impact of the Covid-19 public health crisis on the number of employees.\n\n## Contribution to the sheltered and adapted sector\n\nIn 2020, Air/uni00A0France renegotiated its eleventh three-year agreement on jobs and the maintained employment of persons with disabilities. Within the framework of this agreement, one of the commitments concerns rea/ffirmed support for the sheltered and adapted sector.\n\nAir/uni00A0France also cooperates with associations and companies in the sheltered sector on multiple projects representing, in 2022, approximately \u20ac13.5/uni00A0million of the Group's procurement (e.g. supplies of carrier bags and hygiene and amenity products for our passengers, laundry, maintenance of printers and scanners, maintenance of industrial equipment). Air/uni00A0France maintains long-term partnership relations, thus enabling these companies to develop in a sustainable context.\n\nSince the 2000s, Air/uni00A0France has been developing one of the most important support initiatives in the national territory for workers with disabilities by using the STPA (Secteur du Travail Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 et Adapt\u00e9) for multiple projects.\n\n## Contribution to community projects\n\nIn 2021, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM had allocated \u20ac5.7/uni00A0million to supporting NGOs and other social and environmental initiatives.

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n## 4.6.2/emspace Sustainable  procurement\n\n## ) Context and strategy\n\nAs an airline company with activities spanning the globe, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM purchases a wide variety of goods, products and services worldwide. The Group's procurement brings together many di/fferent industries. Procurement has a significant impact on the sustainability performance of its supplier base. Procurement must support the Group's sustainability strategy with a sourcing process aimed at selecting more sustainable products, and services and business partners that fit its Environmental, Social and Governance ambitions (ESG).\n\nProcurement is responsible for an annual spend of around \u20ac14.5/uni00A0billion. Fuel purchasing accounts for the bulk of this figure at around \u20ac7/uni00A0billion or roughly 50%. In view of its industrial profile, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has a sharp focus on this procurement category in which investment in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (or SAF) plays a major role. However, this does not mean that other possibilities to drive sustainability through responsible purchasing are left untouched. These range from the purchase of aircraft maintenance and components to airport handling, cargo trucking, on-board products,/uni00A0etc.\n\nThe Procurement department has a risk-based approach, wherein it targets suppliers in sustainability high-risk categories first, in order to mitigate or avoid risk. It does so by understanding the broad umbrella of sustainability to include not only environmental but also societal and ethical factors. At a compliance level, high-sustainability-risk suppliers are required to carry out assessments on their ESG (Environment, Social, Governance) performance. On top of addressing the high-risk categories, Procurement invites any supplier to commit to such an assessment in an e/ffort to move beyond (legal) compliance and promote supply-chain transparency.\n\nSince it considers sustainable procurement to be more than a mere box-ticking exercise, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Procurement actively seeks to engage with suppliers as sustainable business partners. In this way, the groups will want to cooperate, innovate and develop in order to accelerate sustainability in the aviation industry.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Measures and action plan\n\n## Factoring internal/uni00A0CO2 pricing into our investment decisions\n\nScope/uni00A01 and 2/uni00A0emissions are a major concern for the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group and, for this reason, the Group has decided to apply internal/uni00A0CO2 pricing. Investment decisions with a potential impact on the Company's direct/uni00A0CO2 emissions, i.e., a/ffecting its fuel or energy consumption, will take into account the costs associated with these/uni00A0CO2 emissions.\n\nPutting a price on/uni00A0CO2 thus encourages more sustainable decisions and will support our emission reduction pathway. The primary focus is on the fleet and fleet-related investment decision-making.\n\n## Pursuing a responsible procurement policy throughout the process\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM integrates a responsible procurement policy in its sourcing process:\n\n- > during the supplier referencing process, the Group sends suppliers a questionnaire, addressing a number of themes such as safety, environmental management and Human Resources policy;\n- > suppliers are invited to sign the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Supplier Sustainability Code of Conduct. This revised Code of Conduct was introduced in 2020 to replace the existing Code of Conduct and the Sustainable Development Charter. In addition, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM accepts endorsement of the UN Global Compact from signatory suppliers as an alternative;\n- > the tender documents include criteria enabling the evaluation of the environmental impact of the product or service, which is taken into account during the evaluation of the di/fferent supplier proposals. This is an integral part of the assessment of the total cost of ownership and the life cycle analysis.\n\nTo manage and verify the sustainability quality of its supplier base, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM uses the services of EcoVadis. EcoVadis operates an evidence-based online platform, providing supplier sustainability ratings that allows Procurement to assess the ESG performance of its global suppliers.\n\nThe focus is on suppliers with high sustainability risks. A compliance threshold in terms of an assessment score applies to qualify as a sustainable business partner. Sustainability risk levels are determined by using a risk mapping process. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Procurement is exploring the possibility of joining forces with industry partners to boost sustainability standards with its suppliers. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Procurement is convinced that this can make a positive contribution to the envisioned shift to sustainable aviation. As such, the average score of participating suppliers is increasing year after year.\n\nThe sustainability risk mapping process, which takes place at the beginning of the procurement process, takes into account the di/fferent procurement categories as well as the countries in which the suppliers are based to determine the associated potential sustainability risks of dealing with a supplier:\n\n- > buyers must systematically verify the positioning of each supplier in the risk mapping. There are six levels of risk;",

        "page_content": "- > in the event of an elevated or severe level of risk, suppliers are contacted so that they can be evaluated by EcoVadis or an equivalent organization on the following four themes: environment, social, ethics and sustainable procurement (as defined in the EcoVadis system);\n- > if the risk category of the supplier is lower than 'elevated or severe', the buyers are advised to encourage their supplier to be evaluated in order to improve their weak points. The suppliers can then share their scores with other companies, which may prove to be a competitive advantage in terms of winning bids and contracts.\n\nSince March/uni00A02020, the Procurement department has been monitoring suppliers with the support of two risk managers to ensure the financial health of its partners. The Covid-19 public health crisis has required the Group to safeguard its supply chain and to take into account the specific issues being faced by its suppliers, in particular the smallest. Local purchasing, SMEs and the protected sector are a central concern.\n\n## Taking responsibility\n\nAir France Procurement assumed its social responsibility during the European Week for the Employment of People with Disabilities (EWPD) by organizing and hosting an event at the Air/uni00A0France head o/ffice in support of the sheltered sector. Air/uni00A0France is a major contributor to this sector with an annual spend of \u20ac13.5/uni00A0million in 2022.\n\nAs a leader in the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has rea/ffirmed its commitment to making the aviation sector more sustainable. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has signed two long-term contracts with Neste and DG Fuels for a total volume of 1.6/uni00A0million tons. These agreements are a first step for the Group on the road to its 10% SAF incorporation target by 2030. The purchase of 1.6/uni00A0million tons of sustainable aviation fuel between 2023 and 2036 will avoid 4.7/uni00A0million tons of/uni00A0CO2 emissions on a full lifecycle basis, compared to fossil fuels. This decision not only supports the Group's own decarbonization commitments but also the further development of the SAF production industry, which is still in its infancy. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM recognizes the importance of this development in view of its realization that decarbonization is the biggest challenge the industry has ever faced.\n\n## Empowering the buyers\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM buyers are committed to respecting the Group's Corporate Social Responsibility commitments. On their first day in the o/ffice, they sign a Code of Ethics outlining the ethical rules they must follow when dealing with suppliers. In the light of the Anti-Bribery legislation, the business requesters receive a reminder of the Code of Ethics. The Supplier Sustainability Code of Conduct and the Code of Ethics are available on the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Procurement website.\n\nTo standardize the processes and align the buyers' skillsets, Procurement continues to develop its Procurement Academy.\n\nThis online training platform, launched at the end of 2021, o/ffers numerous training courses for buyers and other procurement sta/ff. These courses can be on stand-alone topics or part of training modules focusing on a specific topic such as sustainability. The aim is to factor sustainability further into sourcing since sustainability is regarded as a strategic priority.\n\nAll Procurement staff have completed an anti-corruption e-learning module. All new buyers receive training on the Group's CSR commitments and the resulting procurement responsibilities. This includes the duty of vigilance law in France and the anti-bribery processes. Training is also provided on the use of the supplier ESG performance management tool EcoVadis, in support of supplier selection and engagement. The relevant documentation is available for all Procurement sta/ff in the section on 'Procurement and Sustainability' on the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Procurement SharePoint website.\n\nSustainability news and specific news about sustainability in procurement is shared in a monthly Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM newsletter, entitled Newsfeed. In this online publication, developments such as the launch of new processes and tools, and regulatory changes are shared.\n\nFurther alignment of the processes, policies and the execution thereof, is ensured through bi-monthly meetings of the combined Dutch-French procurement teams.\n\n## Mobilizing and innovating with suppliers\n\nBuilding long-term relationships with strategic suppliers is the basis for Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's Supplier Relations Management (SRM). The SRM process enables issues like Corporate Social Responsibility to be central to discussions. It can be a starting point to move forward with suppliers on these issues.\n\nThe Procurement function seeks to work with suppliers as sustainable business partners based on mutual trust. Together with these partners, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM seeks to explore and develop innovative solutions to limit the environmental impact of the products and services purchased. The aim is to reach a next level in responsible procurement that moves beyond simple compliance.\n\nOne such example is the focus on a life cycle analysis (LCA) for on-board products. When drawing up product specifications, the business requester and buyer work together to identify the characteristics and the environmental and societal impacts of the goods and services. This approach encourages suppliers to consider their overall impact on sustainability and increases their commitment.\n\nIn 2022, along the same lines, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM IT vendor management department took the initiative to engage with its 15/uni00A0 key IT suppliers on sustainability. The aim was to team up with vendors to see how both parties could benefit from each other's best practices and investigate options to reduce the environmental footprint under the existing contracts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

In addition, the division is experimenting with recyclable and lightweight cargo beams for on board cargo stowage;\n- > Air France - KLM Procurement recognizes sustainability as a strategic priority and considers the further integration of sustainability into its sourcing activities to be key. In 2022, Procurement focused on further training of its sta/ff as well as the revision of some of its processes. In addition, there have been a number of initiatives, some of which remain in progress for implementation in 2023.\n\n## On board catering\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Procurement pays special attention to the catering products and the related materials loaded on board the aircraft, like trays, cutlery, trolleys and meals. These on-board products have a multi-faceted sustainability impact. Apart from the environmental footprint of a product or the social implications of the production process, weight is a specific issue in aviation. Additional weight leads to additional emissions during flight. Sometimes, seemingly straightforward sustainability considerations on the ground may not apply in the air.\n\nThe Life Cycle Analysis approach deployed by KLM Inflight Services Procurement aims to capture these factors and help make well-founded sourcing decisions. This follows a trend within the Group towards purchasing increasingly eco-responsible products on board and favoring locally sourced and seasonal products.\n\nFor on-board meals, the Group is committed to o/ffering its customers a more-environmentally-friendly service, while guaranteeing the choice and origin of the food. On departure from its hubs, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group o/ffers its customers,\n\nmeat, dairy products and eggs of 100% French and Dutch origin and fish from sustainable fisheries. In addition to an eventual third-party supplier assessment, the Group select products with internationally recognized labels such as the controlled and protected designation of origin (AOC/PDO) and organic farming (AB) labels. As a member of the Responsible Soy (RTRS) and Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) Round Table, KLM o/ffers certified products such as MSC and ASC certified fish, 'better life' eggs, chicken and veal, and UTZ-certified co/ffee, tea and chocolate. Furthermore, to guarantee customers a balanced meal, all hot dishes served in the Economy and Premium Economy classes have an A or B Nutri-Score. Lastly, the dishes for babies and children are composed exclusively of organically-grown food.\n\nFor on-board equipment, multiple criteria are considered: weight of the articles, the materials used, place of manufacturing, mode of transportation and management of the material's end of life. Environmental labels and certifications like FSC or PEFC are prioritized and the selection of new articles is made in cooperation with the suppliers to include products with the lowest-possible environmental impact from a long-term perspective. The reduction of single-use plastic (SUP) is a major objective for the Group. the Air/uni00A0France target is to eliminate 90% of this material by 2023. In 2022, Air/uni00A0France eliminated or replaced with alternative materials 765/uni00A0tons of single-use plastic used by passengers on board, i.e. nearly 80%.\n\n## Results and performance\n\nThrough its 'Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Procurement' website, the Group maintains an ongoing dialogue with suppliers, informing them, amongst other things, of its policy and commitment to sustainable development. At the beginning of the procurement or sourcing process, Procurement makes their (potential) suppliers aware of the sustainable procurement policy and the suppliers' involvement. As a point of departure, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM requires its suppliers to sign the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Supplier Sustainability Code of Conduct or provide an acceptable alternative.\n\nIn 2022, 53% of suppliers signed the Supplier Sustainability Code of Conduct.\n\nIn 2022, the total number of companies evaluated and actively assessed by EcoVadis or an equivalent body stood at 302. The suppliers considered are those with a score of 35 or higher over the last three years. As part of a continuous-improvement process, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM aims to evaluate 90/uni00A0additional suppliers in 2023.\n\n## 4.6.3/emspace Monitoring of Act No. 2017-399/uni00A0known as the Duty of Vigilance Law\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is subject to the obligations introduced by the Act of March/uni00A027, 2017 relating to the duty of vigilance for parent companies and ordering companies.\n\nSince 2018, in response to the regulatory requirements, the Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has implemented a vigilance plan, it being understood that the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group already had processes in place enabling it to comply directly or indirectly with the requirements of the 2017 Duty of Vigilance Act.\n\nIn particular, having established verification processes in the areas required to be covered by the vigilance plan, the Group has ensured that it is in a position to benefit, as e/ffectively as possible, from the contributions of its various divisions/entities through the completion of a questionnaire by the aforementioned entities. As required by the Act, in 2021, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group also focused on its commercial partners by updating the template of the questionnaire to be sent to suppliersand service providers with the support of an external law firm (this process is still ongoing between Procurement (Center of Expertise) and the Ethical Compliance team) and reviewing (i)/uni00A0the procedure for screening suppliers and service providers notably through",

As a facilitator of risk management, the Group Internal Audit regularly evaluates the risk management process and its conclusions are the subject of presentations to the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group Executive Committee and the Audit Committee.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's overall sub-contracting management system applies to all risk areas. It is based on contract reviews, compliance monitoring and supervisory acts such as audits, inspections and checks, carried out internally by the sub-contractors themselves where appropriate or with external providers (as part of the EcoVadis screening on social rights, the environment and sustainable procurement).\n\nEvery year, the Group conducts a review of the non-financial risks generated by its activities. This analysis verifies the relevance and comprehensiveness of the measures and action plans aimed at the e/ffective prevention, control and mitigation of the non-financial risks deemed to be the most material.\n\nSee also Chapter/uni00A03 'Risks and risk management' and section/uni00A04.1.2 'Identification of the key priorities in building long-term relationships'.\n\n## Measures deployed to prevent and mitigate the risks and monitoring mechanisms\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's policy enshrines the respect of fundamental rights as established in the leading international principles: Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labor Organization's (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) guiding principles.\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has been a signatory of the United Nations Global Compact since 2003 and is committed to respecting and promoting its ten Principles in the areas of Human Rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption. This undertaking is rea/ffirmed each year by the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's top management bodies.\n\nThe duty of vigilance is a multi-risk approach. The management of risks is at the heart of the steering of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's business activities, based on a rational of prevention and homogeneous management via common methods and tools.\n\n## Human Rights and fundamental liberties\n\nIn 2019, the Social Rights and Ethics Charter was reviewed by a working group bringing together the relevant Group entities and the European Works Council, to develop its content and formalize of a set of principles fostering the respect of Human Rights. This new document, intended for both internal and external use, and entitled The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Principles, was published in 2020. The Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Principles are subject to regular review to verify any need for its updating.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Principles a/ffirm the Group's commitment to fostering a climate of mutual trust and respect amongst sta/ff, and ensuring a safe working environment. The Group undertakes to apply the labor legislation of the European Union and its Member States and all national collective agreements, and to respect the exercise of trade union rights in all the relevant countries. The Group also undertakes to scrupulously respect Human Rights, oppose child and forced labor, apply laws and ask its service providers and suppliers to uphold these principles.\n\nIn view of its organization, the Group delegates to its subsidiaries the responsibility of respecting and promoting the content of these commitments locally, in the respect of the national provisions and legislation specific to each country.\n\nFor more information, see also sctions 4.2 'Human Resources' and 4.5.2 'Respect of Human Rights'.\n\n## Health and safety\n\nFor Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, the health and safety of both customers and sta/ff is an absolute priority.\n\nFlight Safety is paramount for the Group. It is key to retaining the trust of customers and imperative for the long-term viability of its operations. All the Group's operations are the subject of multiple checks and certifications, and comply with extremely strict norms and the highest standards in the industry.\n\nEach Group airline deploys a Safety Management System, which is integral to their business organizations, processes and corporate cultures.\n\nFor more information, see Chapter/uni00A03 'Risks and risk management' and section/uni00A04.4 'Customer trust'.\n\nSafeguarding health and safety in the work place is a human priority to which the Group responds by preventing vocational risks and improving the quality of life in the workplace.\n\nFor more information, see section/uni00A04.2 'Human resources'.\n\nThe Group must guarantee its customers and flight crew safe catering services and, to this end, has implemented a Food Hygiene and Safety process to respond to the regulatory requirements linked to the preparation and supply of meals.\n\nFor more information, see section/uni00A04.4 'Customer trust'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

In November/uni00A02019, the Group unveiled its global strategy through to 2025, based on environmental sustainability.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France and KLM Environmental Management Systems (EMS) aim to prevent and mitigate the environmental impacts of their operations. These Environmental Management Systems have ISO/uni00A014001/uni00A0certification and internal and external audits enable the verification of their e/ffective deployment.\n\nIn 2019, the Group adopted the format recommended by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) for the management of financial risks linked to climate change (TCFD concordance table, section/uni00A04.3.2).\n\nFor more information, see section/uni00A04.3 'Environment'.\n\n## Supply chain\n\nIn its relations with sub-contractors and suppliers, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM ensures that the fundamental social rights and principles, and environmental protection provisions, are properly respected everywhere in the world.\n\nA supplier selection process has been implemented to respond to the duty of vigilance requirements. To this end, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's Procurement function provides awareness-raising training on these risks. A compliance training program for new members of the Procurement teams of Air/uni00A0France and KLM was carried out in 2022.\n\nA risk-mapping process is in place with, for each segment and procurement domain, an evaluation of the environmental, social and ethical risks. Risks are also evaluated by country.\n\nFor all new contracts or contract renewals, the signature of the Supplier Sustainability Code of Conduct or an equivalent commitment covering the four areas (environment, social, ethical and supply chain) is mandatory and is included in the contract's appendix. In case of deviation, the legal department or the Compliance O/fficer may be called on to provide guidance.\n\nIn the segments most exposed to risks, suppliers are asked to submit an evaluation of their sustainability performance, carried out by a specialized organization or the equivalent. It is mandatory for this evaluation to address four areas: environment, social, ethics, supply chain. The 'Supplier supply chain' section provides visibility for tier 2/uni00A0suppliers.\n\nSuppliers failing to reach an acceptable level are required to put in place a remedial action plan. Independent in-situ audits may also be triggered.\n\nIndependently of the level of risk, all suppliers are encouraged to have their CSR performance evaluated.\n\nIn 2022, at the Group's request, 302/uni00A0suppliers had their sustainability performance evaluated.\n\n## Listening to stakeholders and whistle blower mechanism\n\nIn 2021, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM realized a new materiality analysis by questioning a representative panel of internal and external stakeholders. The comparison of these results with those of the analysis carried out in 2019 enabled confirmation of the relevance of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's strategic choices in the light of the issues deemed to be priorities for its activities and the expectations of its stakeholders.\n\nSeveral processes enable the Group to regularly evaluate the perception of its stakeholders and to understand the related risks. The Group also has a number of feedback channels in place enabling stakeholders (particularly employees, customers and local residents around airports) to communicate any complaints.\n\nFor more information, see section/uni00A04.1.2 'Identification of the key priorities in building long-term relationships'.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has updated the scope of its speak-up policies, internal whistle-blower procedures and mechanisms to enable employees to report any situations arising within the scope of the applicable legislation, including the Act of March/uni00A027, 2017 relating to the duty of vigilance of parent companies and ordering companies.\n\nFor more information, see also section/uni00A04.5.3 'Business ethics'.",

This report should be read in conjunction with, and construed in accordance with, French law and professional standards applicable in France.\n\n## For the year ended 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02022\n\nTo the Shareholders,\n\nIn our capacity as Independent Third Party of your company (hereinafter the 'entity'), and accredited by the French Accreditation Committee (COFRAC) under number 3-1884 (1) and, as a member firm of the KPMG International network, one of your Statutory Auditors, we have undertaken a limited assurance engagement on the historical financial information (observed or extrapolated) in the consolidated non-financial statement, prepared in accordance with the entity's procedures (hereinafter the 'Guidelines'), for the year ended\u2026 (hereinafter, the 'Information' and the 'Statement' respectively), presented in the Group's management report pursuant to the legal and regulatory provisions of Articles L./uni00A0225-102-1, R./uni00A0225-105 and R./uni00A0225-105-1/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).\n\nAt the request of the entity, we conducted works designed to express a reasonable assurance conclusion on the information selected by the entity and identified by the sign \u221a .\n\n## Limited assurance conclusion\n\nBased on the procedures we have performed, as described under the 'Nature and scope of procedures' and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention that cause us to believe that the consolidated non-financial statement is not prepared in accordance with the applicable regulatory provisions and that the Information, taken as a whole, is not presented fairly in accordance with the Guidelines, in all material respects.\n\n## Reasonable assurance conclusion on a selection of non-financial information\n\nBased on the procedures performed, as set out in the 'Nature and scope of our work' and 'Nature and scope of additional work on the information selected by the entity and identified by the sign ' \u221a ' sections of this report, and the evidence collected, the information selected by the entity and identified with the symbol \u221a in the Statement has been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Guidelines.\n\n(1)\n\n## Preparation of the non-financial performance Statement\n\nThe absence of a commonly used generally accepted reporting framework or a significant body of established practices on which to draw to evaluate and measure the Information allows for di/fferent, but acceptable, measurement techniques that can a/ffect comparability between entities and over time.\n\nConsequently, the Information needs to be read and understood together with the Guidelines, summarized in the Statement and available on the Entity's website or on request from its headquarters.\n\n## Inherent limitations in preparing the Information\n\nThe Information may be subject to uncertainty inherent to the state of scientific and economic knowledge and the quality of external data used. Some information is sensitive to the choice of methodology and the assumptions or estimates used for its preparation and presented in the Statement.\n\n## Responsibility of the entity\n\nManagement of the Entity is responsible for:\n\n- > selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the Information;\n- > preparing a Statement pursuant to legal and regulatory provisions, including a presentation of the business model, a description of the main non-financial risks, a presentation of the policies implemented considering those risks and the outcomes of said policies, including key performance indicators, and the information set out in Article 8/uni00A0of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Green Taxonomy);\n- > preparing the Statement by applying the Entity's 'Guidelines' as referred above; and\n- > designing, implementing and maintaining internal control over information relevant to the preparation of the Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe Statement has been prepared by the Management Board.",

In addition, we have implemented a system of quality control including documented policies and procedures aimed at ensuring compliance with applicable legal and regulatory\n\nrequirements, ethical requirements and the professional guidance issued by the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes) relating to this engagement.\n\n## Means and resources\n\nOur work engaged the skills of nine people between November 2022 and February/uni00A02023 and took a total of eleven weeks.\n\nWe were assisted in our work by our specialists in sustainable development and corporate social responsibility. We conducted twenty interviews with the people responsible for preparing the Statement.\n\n## Nature and scope of procedures\n\nWe are required to plan and perform our work to address the areas where we have identified that a material misstatement of the Information is likely to arise.\n\nThe procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment. In carrying out our limited assurance engagement on the Information:\n\n- > we obtained an understanding of all the consolidated entities' activities, and the description of the principal risks associated;\n- > we assessed the suitability of the criteria of the Guidelines with respect to their relevance, completeness, reliability, neutrality and understandability, taking into account, where appropriate, best practices within the sector;\n- > we verified that the Statement includes each category of social and environmental information set out in article L./uni00A0225-102-1/uni00A0III, as well as information regarding compliance with Human Rights and anti-corruption and tax avoidance legislation;\n- > we verified that the Statement provides the information required under article R./uni00A0225-105/uni00A0II of the French Commercial Code, where relevant with respect to the main risks, and includes, where applicable, an explanation for the absence of the information required under article L./uni00A0225-102-1/uni00A0III, paragraph/uni00A02/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code;\n- > we verified that the Statement presents the business model and a description of principal risks associated with all the consolidated entities' activities, including where relevant and proportionate, the risks associated with their business relationships, their products or services, as well as their policies, measures and the outcomes thereof, including key performance indicators associated to the principal risks;\n- > we referred to documentary sources and conducted interviews to:\n- -  assess the process used to identify and confirm the main risks as well as the consistency of the outcomes, including the key performance indicators used, with respect to the main risks and the policies presented,\n- -  corroborate the qualitative information (measures and outcomes) that we considered to be the most important\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

This work was carried out on a selection of contributing entities/thinspace (2) and covers between 29% and 100% of the consolidated data relating to the key performance indicators and outcomes selected for these tests;\n- > we assessed the overall consistency of the Statement based on our knowledge of all the consolidated entities.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance review are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance opinion in accordance with the professional guidance of the French Institute of Statutory Auditors (Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes); a higher level of assurance would have required us to carry out more extensive procedures.\n\n## Nature and extent of additional work on the information selected by the entity and identified by the sign \u221a\n\nWith regard to the information selected by the entity, presented in the appendix and identified by the symbol \u221a in the Statement, we conducted the same work as described in the paragraph 'Nature and scope of our work' above for the Information considered to be the most important, but in a more in-depth manner, in particular with regard to the number of tests.\n\nThe selected sample accounts for 74% of the information identified by the symbol \u221a .\n\nWe believe that our work is su/fficient to provide a basis for our reasonable assurance opinion on the information selected by the entity and identified by the symbol \u221a .\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense, on 21 st /uni00A0February/uni00A02023\n\n## KPMG/uni00A0S.A.\n\nFanny Houlliot ESG Expert ESG Center of Excellence\n\n\u00c9ric Dupr\u00e9 Partner\n\nEnvironmental indicators - Air Operations: Air/uni00A0France; HOP!; KLM; KLC.\n\nEnvironmental indicators - Ground Operations: Air/uni00A0France in France; KLM Schipol.",

Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and its two main subsidiaries, Air/uni00A0France and KLM, represent 90% of revenues and 61% of the balance sheet. The other\n\nsubsidiaries are principally involved in air transportation (Hop!, KLM Cityhopper), maintenance and low-cost transportation (Transavia).\n\nAs far as possible, the changes in the like-for-like figures have been estimated on a constant currency basis.\n\n| (in \u20ac million)                                 | 2022   | 2021    | Change   |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|----------|\n| Sales                                          | 26,393 | 14,315  | 12,078   |\n| EBITDA                                         | 3,615  | 745     | 2,870    |\n| Income from current operations                 | 1,193  | (1,626) | 2,819    |\n| Income from operating activities               | 1,194  | (2,532) | 3,726    |\n| Net income for the period                      | 744    | (3,294) | 4,038    |\n| Net income/(loss), Group part                  | 728    | (3,292) | 4,020    |\n| Basic earnings/(loss) per share, Group  (in \u20ac) | 0.35   | (5.95)  | 6.30     |\n\n## Revenues\n\nConsolidated revenues for the period amounted to \u20ac26.4/uni00A0billion, an increase of 84.4% and 79.7% on a constant currency basis. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM increased its overall capacity by 44.2% (ASK). The 2022 financial year was characterized by a 29.5% increase in unit revenues on a constant currency basis, due to the combined performances of the passenger (56.4%) and cargo ((19.5)%) transportation activities, both these activities being included in the Network business, and the performance of Transavia (19.9%). In addition, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM increased its passenger capacity by 39.4% (ASK) and its cargo capacity by 15.6% (ATK). Transavia's capacity increase stood at 85.9% (ASK).

The fuel bill before hedging increased by \u20ac5,134/uni00A0million compared to the previous year, partially o/ffset by the \u20ac641/uni00A0million change in fuel hedge e/ffects and by the higher fuel e/fficiency of the new aircraft;\n- > chartering costs: the costs incurred in leasing aircraft capacity from other airlines. Their increase in 2022 (+19.1%) remained lower than the Group's overall capacity increase;\n- > landing fees and en-route charges: these costs are incurred for air navigation services and the use of airports and their increase relative to last year (+44.3%) was in line with the capacity growth (ASK 44.2%);\n- > catering costs: these costs comprise the services supplied on board the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's own aircraft. They increased by 88.5% compared to last year, when in-flight catering on board had been considerably reduced due to the Covid-19 health measures;\n- > handling charges and other operating costs: principally cover aircraft handling on the ground and the cost of passenger care for the Group and, to a lesser extent, third-party customers. The increase in these costs (+56.6%) is mainly explained by the increase in capacity and by inflationary pressures;\n- > aircraft maintenance costs: they include maintenance procurement and consumption for the Group's aircraft and for the third-party activity; their increase is linked to the increase in internal and third-party activities;\n- > commercial and distribution costs: these costs increased by 130.4%, significantly more than capacity due to a base e/ffect as marketing costs had been extremely limited in 2021 within the context of the Covid-19;\n- > other external expenses principally comprise rental charges, telecommunications costs, insurance and fees. Their level, increased by considerably less than capacity thanks to cost saving initiatives.\n\nSalaries and related costs were up by 36.5% to \u20ac7.3/uni00A0billion versus \u20ac5.3/uni00A0billion in 2021. This was largely explained by the decrease in Long-Term Partial Activity ('APLD') in France and the end of the NOW program in the Netherlands in the first quarter of 2022, whose total contribution was reduced from \u20ac1,428/uni00A0million in 2021 to \u20ac269/uni00A0million in 2022. In addition, salary costs increased due to higher activity and the new collective labor agreements negotiated in the context of high inflation.\n\nTaxes other than income taxes stood at \u20ac156/uni00A0million in 2022 versus \u20ac116/uni00A0million in 2021, up by 34.5%.\n\nOther current income and expenses stood at net income of \u20ac964/uni00A0million in 2022 versus net income of \u20ac715/uni00A0million in 2021.

To analyze the Company's overall cost performance, the Group uses the net cost per ASK. This net cost is obtained by dividing the total net cost\n\nby the capacity produced expressed in available seat-kilometers (ASK). The net cost is calculated by subtracting the revenues other than those generated by the three transportation activities (passenger, cargo and Transavia) from total operating expenses. The capacity produced by the two passenger transportation activities is combined by adding the capacity of the passenger business (in ASK) to that of Transavia (in ASK).",

The \u20ac0.8/uni00A0billion increase is mainly explained by the following:\n\n- > a positive net result of \u20ac0.7/uni00A0billion;\n- > the redemption of \u20ac(2.4) billion of perpetual supersubordinated Notes held by the French State;\n- > a \u20ac2.2/uni00A0billion capital increase;\n- > a \u20ac0.3/uni00A0billion impact of other comprehensive income (mainly due to the remeasurements of defined benefit pension plans and the change in fair value of the hedging instruments).\n\n## 5.1.7/emspace Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM parent company results\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM parent company results were closed on December/uni00A031, 2022.\n\nAs a holding company, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has no operating activity. Its revenues comprise royalties paid by the two operating subsidiaries for use of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM logo and the supply of services invoiced to Air/uni00A0France and KLM. Its expenses mostly comprise financial communication expenses, Statutory Auditors' fees, the expenses linked to the compensation of the Company o/fficers and the sta/ff made available by Air/uni00A0France and KLM. At December/uni00A031, 2022, the operating result amounted to a loss of \u20ac(6) million (versus a loss of \u20ac(3) million in 2021).\n\nThe net result was a \u20ac(13) million loss, mainly due to the financial costs on the bonds, the loan guaranteed by the State (Pr\u00eat Garanti par l'\u00c9tat - PGE), the State Current Account Advance and the Deeply Subordinated Undated Notes and other loans.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of Article 39-5 and Article 223/uni00A0quinquies of the French Tax Code relating to expenses in the statement of general expenses excluded from non-tax-deductible expenses, note that no amount was recognized during the financial year.\n\nPursuant to the provisions of Article 39-4 and Article 223/uni00A0quater of the French tax Code no excess amortization was recognized.",

The term 'Group' is represented by the economic definition of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and its subsidiaries. The Group is headquartered in France and is one of the largest airlines in the world.\n\nThe Group's core business is network activities which includes passenger transportation on scheduled flights and cargo activities. The Group's activities also include aeronautics\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmaintenance, leisure passenger transportation (Transavia) and other air-transport-related activities.\n\nThe limited company Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, domiciled at 7, rue du cirque 75008/uni00A0Paris - France, is the parent company of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is listed for trading in Paris (Euronext) and Amsterdam (Euronext).\n\nThe presentation currency used in the Group's financial statements is the Euro, which is also Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's functional currency.\n\n## NOTE 2/emspace SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND CLIMATE\n\nClimate change is a major concern for the airline industry and for the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group in particular. Attitudes towards the acceptability of air transportation growth are changing at both political level and in terms of wider society. Both France and the Netherlands have implemented policies to ensure the transition to a Net Zero Carbon society by 2050.\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group intends to be a key player in the transformation of its sector of activity, and aims to take a leading role and influence.\n\nPlaying an active role in advancing the ambition of Net Zero emissions by 2050 as an industry, and committing to science-based targets in line with the SBTi criteria approved in November/uni00A02022, is a strong marker for the Group, reflecting people's changing perception of travel and calls for a more responsible use of aviation. The Group's environmental e/fforts are summarized in a Climate Action Plan, with the objective of reducing/uni00A0CO2 emissions by 30% in 2030 compared to 2019, in particular by progressively incorporating sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and investing in the renewal of the Group's fleet for new generation aircraft emitting up to 25% less/uni00A0CO2.\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM assesses its extra-financial performance on a regular basis, through through Standard and Poor's (S&P), DJSI, CDP, Ecovadis, Climate Action 100+ and Sustainalytics ratings.\n\nIn 2022, for the eighteenth consecutive year, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes (DJSI World and Europe), the Ecovadis rating agency awarded Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM a gold medal (ranking in the top 3%), while the CDP gave the Group a C-rating (awareness level) for the climate change questionnaire.\n\nFurthermore, to objectify its ESG performance and improve its strategy and practices, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM proactively requested an independent ESG rating from Standard and Poor's, becoming the first airline group to be evaluated through a requested ESG rating. In 2021, Standard & Poor's (S&P) Global Ratings thus assigned to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM an ESG rating of 64/100. With this rating, the Group is well positioned among the players in the airline industry with regard to the management of its significant exposure to environmental challenges. S&P underlined that the Group was well prepared to manage the ESG risks faced by airlines in the short and medium term.\n\nThe Group's financial statements integrate climate change and sustainability issues in various items as described below.\n\n## 2.1/emspace Valuation of assets and consideration of environmental risks\n\nThe impact of climate change in the short to medium term has been taken into account in preparing the Group's financial statements for the year ending December/uni00A031, 2022. However, the physical risks identified have not been considered material\n\nto the Group's operational continuity, given the operation of a balanced network across the di/fferent continents and the flexibility of the fleet, which minimizes the economic consequences of extreme weather events that may occur.",

        "page_content": "The impacts of expected or probable changes (increase in carbon credit prices,/uni00A0CO2 compensation and development of sustainable aviation fuel - 'SAF'), the Group's ability to pass on additional costs in ticket prices, as well as investments and depreciations linked to the fleet renewal plan, in line with the/uni00A0CO2 emission reduction targets validated by SBTi, are included in the Group's\n\nfive-year plan and consequently in the tested recoverable value of assets (see Note/uni00A022 'Impairment').\n\nIn 2022, the Group's environmental objectives have not led to the recognition of any impairment or accelerated depreciation of assets.\n\n## 2.2/emspace Sustainable investments and financings\n\nThe Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has committed to reduce its/uni00A0CO2 emissions per passenger/km by 30% by 2030 compared to 2019. Currently, one of the most impactful ways to reduce the carbon footprint is to invest in a more fuel-e/fficient fleet. The Group is focusing on simplifying and rationalizing its fleet to make it more competitive. The Group's transformation is therefore continuing with the arrival of more modern, high-performance aircraft with a significantly lower environmental impact and a reduced noise footprint.\n\nTo support its investments, the Group has entered into secured financing agreements integrating sustainable development issues,\n\n## 2.2.1/emspace Fleet  modernization\n\nThe renewal of the Group's airline fleet for new generation aircraft, that are up to 25% more e/fficient in terms of fuel consumption and therefore/uni00A0CO2 emissions, and generate less noise, resulted in capital expenditures on aircraft equipment amounting to \u20ac1,332/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2022 (\u20ac1,047/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021) (see Note/uni00A018 'Capital expenditures').\n\nPursuing its fleet renewal plan, the Group will continue to receive new generation aircraft over the next few years, with the aim of having more than two-thirds of its fleet composed of new generation aircraft by 2028 (see Note/uni00A039 'Flight equipment orders').\n\n## 2.2.2/emspace Other  investments\n\nIn order to adapt its business to climate change and in particular to achieve the objective of carbon neutrality of ground operations by 2030, the Group is pursuing a sustainable investment policy and is notably investing in fully electric ramp equipment (vehicles,\n\ntractors and loading equipment) and the energy renovation of its buildings.\n\nThese investments represented \u20ac52/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2022 (\u20ac40/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021).\n\n## 2.3/emspace Greenhouse gas emission rights -/uni00A0CO 2 compensation and SAF supply\n\nSince January/uni00A01, 2012, airlines have been subject to the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) regulations for all flights to or from the European Economic Area, as described in Note/uni00A04.23 'Emission Trading Scheme'. and Note/uni00A037.4 'Carbon credit risk'. As such, the Group must purchase/uni00A0CO2 allowances to o/ffset its emissions. The Group accounts for the/uni00A0CO2 quotas as intangible assets. These assets are not subject to amortization.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2022, the value of the/uni00A0CO2 quotas related to ETS program in the Group's balance sheet represented \u20ac208/uni00A0million (\u20ac74/uni00A0million euros as of December/uni00A031, 2021) (see Note/uni00A016 'Intangible assets'). To meet its obligation to surrender the allowances corresponding to its emissions, the Group recorded a net expense of \u20ac137/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2022 (\u20ac32/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021) corresponding to the best estimates of its emissions for the year 2022 (see Note/uni00A09 'Other current operating income and expenses').\n\nthrough which the Group benefits from more advantageous financing conditions if it achieves targets related to fleet renewal and the incorporation of sustainable aviation fuels ('SAF').\n\nIn addition, on January/uni00A09, 2023, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM issued sustainability-linked bonds for a total amount of \u20ac1/uni00A0billion (see Note/uni00A03.3 'Subsequent events'). The coupons of the bonds will be indexed to the Group's objective of reducing its kerosene-related greenhouse gas emissions (scope/uni00A01 and 3) by 10% per revenue/ ton/kilometer (RTK) by 2025 compared to 2019, as part of its global decarbonization roadmap.",

The purchase of credits representing the carbon compensation, notably from the partner Ecoact, are booked as intangible assets, for an amount of \u20ac2/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2022 (\u20ac2/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021) (see Note/uni00A016 'Intangible assets') and are subject to a provision for an amount of \u20ac5/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2022 (unfunded amount as of December/uni00A031, 2021), corresponding to the best estimates of its emissions for the year 2022 (see Note/uni00A09 'Other current operating income and expenses').\n\nIn order to secure its purchases of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and thus achieve the Group's decarbonization objectives, in particular through the incorporation of at least 10% SAF by 2030, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM signed two contracts in October/uni00A02022 with the suppliers Nest\u00e9 and DG Fuels for the supply of 1.6/uni00A0million tons of SAF between 2023 and 2036 (see Note/uni00A040.1 'Commitments made'). In December/uni00A02022, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with TotalEnergies for the supply of 0.8/uni00A0million tons of SAF to the Group's airlines over a 10-year period, starting in 2023.\n\nSince January/uni00A01, 2022, in order to meet the additional costs linked to the mandatory purchase of SAF, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group has introduced a specific surcharge on tickets departing from France and the Netherlands. As of December/uni00A031, 2022, the total amount of the surcharge collected represents \u20ac48/uni00A0million, entirely allocated to the purchase of SAF.\n\n## 2.4/emspace Other expenses and commitments\n\nThe performance criteria taken into account for the calculation of both annual and long-term variable management compensation (see Note/uni00A041.1 ' Transactions with the principal executives') include non-financial indicators linked related to sustainable development, respectively the compliance with the 2030 environmental roadmap trajectory and the 50% reduction target f o r /uni00A0C O 2 emissions (measured in/uni00A0gCO2/passenger/km, including market measures) over the period 2005-2030.\n\n## NOTE 3/emspace SIGNIFICANT  EVENTS\n\n## 3.1/emspace Going  concern\n\nThe global spread of Covid-19 since early 2020 has had a major impact on air tra/ffic worldwide. The very strict conditions on global travel adopted by many countries beginning in March/uni00A02020 resulted in a contraction of air tra/ffic. Recovery began in the second half of 2021 and has continued amply through 2022.\n\nThe strong measures taken by the Group to limit the e/ffects of Covid-19 on business since the beginning of the pandemic have been adapted throughout 2022 to the changing situation. They include, among other things, adapting the capacity o/ffered in line with demand, securing cash-flow, systematically refinancing new aircraft deliveries, and salary measures.\n\nIn addition, the Ukrainian crisis has had repercussions on the Group's activity, which has suspended services and overflights to Ukraine and Russia since February/uni00A02022 and until further notice. The routes to the two countries represented less than 1% of the Group's network activity in terms of revenues. The impact of the extension of routes to China, Japan and South Korea is however limited. In compliance with the sanctions imposed on Russia by Western countries, the Group's maintenance activities\n\nIn addition, KLM has made sustainability commitments as part of the conditions associated with the direct loan granted by the Dutch State (see Note/uni00A032.3 'Financial support from the French and Dutch States'), as well as Air/uni00A0France within the framework of the loan guaranteed by the French State and the National Low-Carbon Strategy in France.\n\nfor Russian airlines have been suspended without generating any significant impact. Finally, although the Ukrainian crisis is driving oil prices to high levels with wide variations, the Group's fuel hedging policy has mitigated the impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements at December/uni00A031, 2022.\n\n## Adapting available capacity and reducing costs\n\nAvailable seat-kilometer capacity for the passenger business and Transavia was 44% higher in 2022 than in 2021, in response to the recovery in demand, and reached 82% of the 2019 level for the passenger business and 14% more capacity than in 2019 for Transavia.\n\nRevenue per passenger kilometer for the passenger business and Transavia jumped 105% in 2022 compared to 2021. The cargo business continued to benefit from a buoyant environment with available ton-kilometers up 16% compared to 2021. As a result, total revenues increased by 84% compared to last year and amount to \u20ac26,393/uni00A0million, which is 97% of the 2019 amount and an increase of 84% compared to 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Overall, the Group's capacity for 2023 is expected to be between 95 and 100% of the 2019 level.\n\nAt the same time, external expenses amount to \u20ac(16,297) million, an increase of 85% compared to 2021, mainly driven by fuel costs. After hedging, these will amount to \u20ac(7,241) million in 2022 compared with \u20ac(2,748) million in 2021, an increase of 164% due to the change in capacity and the rise in fuel prices. Excluding fuel, external expenses will increase by only 49%.\n\nDue to the recovery in activity, the Dutch government has terminated the 'Emergency Measures for Sustainable Employment' (NOW) program in the Netherlands as of March/uni00A031, 2022. The impact of this measure represents a compensation of \u20ac134/uni00A0million in 2022 compared to \u20ac771/uni00A0million in 2021. At the same time, the impact of partial activity in France, implemented as of March/uni00A023, 2020, represents a reduction in labor costs of \u20ac135/uni00A0million in 2022, compared with \u20ac657/uni00A0million in 2021.\n\n## Liquidity and financing\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2022, the Group's total liquidity amounted to \u20ac10.6/uni00A0billion, comprising \u20ac8.0/uni00A0billion of net cash (see Note/uni00A034 'Net debt') and \u20ac2.6/uni00A0billion of undrawn credit lines (see Notes/uni00A032.3 'Financial support from the French and Dutch States' and 32.7 'Credit lines'). Net cash increased by \u20ac0.3/uni00A0billion compared to December/uni00A031, 2021 due to an adjusted free cash-flow from operations of 1.9/uni00A0billion compared to a negative cash-flow of \u20ac0.6/uni00A0billion in 2021 (see Note/uni00A042.1 'Operating free cash-flow') and to the various financing and aid repayment operations of the French and Dutch governments detailed below.\n\n- > the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM capital increase of June/uni00A016, 2022, subscribed in cash for \u20ac1,611/uni00A0million (see Note '3.2 Significant events occurring during the period') enabled the partial repayment in cash of the subordinated notes held by the French State for a nominal amount of \u20ac993/uni00A0million. In July/uni00A02022, Apollo's investment in the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM group (see Note '3.2 Significant events occurring during the period') enabled another partial repayment of the subordinated notes held by the French State for a nominal amount of \u20ac487/uni00A0million;\n- > in November/uni00A02022, the Group also repaid a \u20ac1/uni00A0billion loan guaranteed by the French State and issued \u20ac305/uni00A0million of convertible subordinated bonds allocated to a further repayment of subordinated securities held by the French State for a nominal amount of \u20ac287/uni00A0million (see Note/uni00A03.2 'Significant events occurring during the period');\n- > the Dutch government grants were repaid in full in the first half of 2022 for a total amount of \u20ac942/uni00A0million;\n- > these transactions contributed to strengthening the Group's balance sheet and equity.\n\nFinally, in January/uni00A02023, the Group raised \u20ac1/uni00A0billion in sustainability bonds and decided to make a further repayment of \u20ac2.5/uni00A0billion in loans guaranteed by the French State during the first quarter of 2023 (see Note '3.3/uni00A0Subsequent events').\n\n## Going concern\n\nIn order to determine an appropriate basis for preparing the consolidated financial information for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2022, the going concern assumption was assessed by evaluating the financial forecasts over a horizon of at least one year and by analyzing in particular the Group's business activity in the context of the decline in the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukrainian crisis.\n\nDuring 2022, the Group has returned to positive free cash-flow from operations, has repaid a large part of the aid received from the French and Dutch governments to deal with the Covid pandemic, and has maintained a high level of available cash to face the future.\n\nThus, after taking into account the uncertainties related to the current context and in particular the evolution of the price of oil impacted by the sanctions imposed on Russia, as well as the level of indebtedness of the Group, the Board of Directors has approved the financial statements for the year ending December/uni00A031, 2022 on a going concern basis, taking into account the improvement in the health situation since the end of 2021 the recovery in activity with capacity forecast in 2023 very close to be at 2019 levels, a dynamic pricing policy, the cash position at the end of December/uni00A02022 and the Group's ability to refinance.\n\n## 3.2/emspace Significant events occurring during the period\n\n## \u20ac2,256/uni00A0million capital increase\n\nOn the May/uni00A024, 2022, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM group announced the launch of a capital increase with preferential subscription rights for an amount of \u20ac2.256/uni00A0million, to be subscribed in cash and/ or by o/ffsetting claims.\n\nThe gross proceeds of the capital increase amounted to \u20ac2,256/uni00A0million (of which \u20ac1,611/uni00A0million subscribed in cash),\n\nincluding issue premium, corresponding to the issue of 1,928/uni00A0million new shares (the 'New Shares') at a subscription price of \u20ac1.17/uni00A0per share. Net of issuance fees, the proceeds amounted to \u20ac2,196/uni00A0million (of which \u20ac1,551/uni00A0million subscribed in cash). Following settlement and delivery of the Rights Issue of the capital increase on June/uni00A016, 2022, the share capital of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM was increased to 2,570,536,136/uni00A0shares with a nominal value of \u20ac1/uni00A0each.",

The Group has, however, determined that the financial information for the periods presented would not di/ffer substantially if the Group had applied IFRS as published by the IASB.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on February/uni00A016, 2023.\n\n## Change in accounting principles\n\n## IFRS standards which are applicable on a mandatory basis to the 2022 financial statements\n\n## Amendments to IAS/uni00A016 'Property, Plant and Equipment'\n\nThese amendments aim to standardize the accounting method for the proceeds and costs while an item of property, plant or equipment is in the testing phase.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS/uni00A03 'Business Combinations'\n\nThese amendments update the conceptual framework that changed the definition of assets and liabilities, which could have\n\n## Early repayment of the loan guaranteed by the French State\n\nOn February/uni00A016, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM group approved the early repayment of the loan guaranteed by the French State for an amount of 2.5/uni00A0billion in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nFollowing this operation, the loan guaranteed by the French State will be fully repaid.\n\n## Firm order of 3/uni00A0Airbus A350\n\nAs part of the renewal of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM fleet, the Group announced on January/uni00A027, 2023 firm orders for 3/uni00A0additional Airbus A350s for Air/uni00A0France. These aircraft will be financed through operational leases.\n\nresulted in the derecognition of some liabilities immediately after an acquisition. The amendments also clarify that contingent assets acquired in a business combination should not be recognised.\n\n## Amendments to IAS/uni00A037 'Provisions, Contingent liabilities and Contingent Assets'\n\nThese amendments standardize the identification and assessment practices related to the provisions for onerous contracts, especially regarding losses upon termination arising from contracts concluded with customers within the scope of IFRS/uni00A015 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers'.\n\nA study carried out within the Group on the implementation of these amendments concludes that there will be no impact on the Group's financial statements at December/uni00A031, 2022.\n\n## Amendments to IFRS/uni00A09 'Financial instruments'\n\nThe amendment to IFRS/uni00A09/uni00A0is included in the annual improvements to IFRS standards 2018-2020.\n\nThe amendment indicates that the fees included in the 10% test for assessing whether a financial liability must be derecognized are only the costs paid or fees received between the borrower and the lender, including those which are paid or received on behalf of the other party.\n\nThe Group has performed the 10% test on the government guaranteed loan. The result is that the Group has to keep the debt in the financial liabilities.",

        "page_content": "## IFRS standards which are applicable on a mandatory basis to the 2023 financial statements\n\n## Amendments to IAS/uni00A01 'Presentation of financial statements'\n\nThese amendments aim to identify the disclosures about accounting policies that are useful to users of financial statements. The main change is to provide information about 'significant' accounting policies rather than 'major' accounting policies.\n\n## Amendments to IAS/uni00A08 'Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors'\n\nThese amendments aim to facilitate the distinction between accounting policies and accounting estimates. However, they focus exclusively on accounting estimates, now defined as\n\n'monetary amounts in the financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty'.\n\n## Other texts potentially applicable to the Group, published by the IASB but not yet adopted by the European Union\n\n## Amendments to IAS/uni00A01 'Presentation of financial statements' (E/ffective for accounting periods as of January/uni00A01, 2024)\n\nThese amendments clarify the classification of current or non-current liabilities and aim to promote a consistent approach to this classification.\n\n## 4.2/emspace Main judgements and accounting estimates\n\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make estimates based on judgements and assumptions that a/ffect the information presented in the consolidated financial statements and their notes.\n\nThe Group's management makes these estimates and assessments continuously on the basis of its past experience and various other factors considered to be reasonable.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements for the financial year have thus been established on the basis of the financial parameters available at the closing date.\n\nThese accounting estimates are based on the most-recently available, reliable information.\n\nThe actual results could di/ffer from these estimates depending on changes in the assumptions used or di/fferent conditions.\n\nThe main estimates, assumptions and judgements made in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes are described below. They should be reviewed in conjunction with the related notes referred to in each paragraph.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax assets relating to temporary di/fferences and tax losses carried forward are recognized only to the extent it is probable that a future taxable profit will be available against which the asset can be utilized at the tax entity level.\n\nDeferred tax assets corresponding to fiscal losses are recognized as assets given the prospects of recoverability resulting from the budgets and medium-term plans prepared by the Group. The assumptions used are the same as those used for the impairment tests on assets (see Note/uni00A04.16 'Impairment test').\n\nA deferred tax liability is also recognized for the undistributed reserves of the equity a/ffiliates.\n\n(See Note/uni00A013 'Income taxes').\n\n## Impairment testing of assets\n\nTangible fixed assets, intangible assets, right-of-use assets and goodwill are tested for depreciation if there is an indication of impairment, and those with an indefinite useful life are tested at least once a year on September/uni00A030.\n\nFor this test, the Group deems the recoverable value of the asset to be the higher of the market value less cost of disposal and its value in use. The latter is determined according to the discounted future cash-flow method, estimated based on budgetary assumptions approved by management, using an actuarial rate which corresponds to the weighted average cost of the Group's capital and a growth rate which reflects the market hypotheses for the appropriate activity.\n\nRevenues (network, leisure and maintenance), costs and investments forecasts are based on reasonable hypotheses and are the management's best estimates. They are subject to the uncertainties prevailing at the time the test is performed.\n\n(See Note/uni00A022 'Impairment')\n\n## Useful life of the fleet\n\nThe Group expects to operate its aircraft for between 20 and 25/uni00A0years, regardless of aircraft type, except in exceptional cases. The fleet is amortized over this useful life on a straight-line basis.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe discount rate is a key assumption in determining the accounting impacts of applying IFRS/uni00A016 'Leases'. It is used to measure the lease liability. The Group refers to the implicit interest rate to determine the lease liability for each aircraft. The lease liability for real estate and other assets is measured using the incremental borrowing rate at the inception of the lease.\n\n(See Note/uni00A033 'Lease debt')\n\n<!-- image -->",

These calculations follow the projected unit credit methodology and incorporate the following main assumptions:\n\n- > discount and inflation rates according to the duration of the plans;\n- > salary revaluation rates;\n- > mortality tables; and\n- > sta/ff turnover rates.\n\n(See Note/uni00A030 'Retirement benefits')\n\n## 4.3/emspace Consolidation  principles\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nIn conformity with IFRS/uni00A010 'Consolidated Financial Statements', the Group's consolidated financial statements comprise the financial figures for all the entities that are controlled directly or indirectly by the Group, irrespective of its level of participation in the equity of these entities. The companies over which the Group exercises control are fully consolidated. An entity is controlled when the Group has power over it, is exposed or has rights to variable returns from its involvement in this entity, and has the ability to use its power to influence the amounts of these returns. The determination of control takes into account the existence of potential voting rights if they are substantive, meaning they can be exercised in time when decisions about the relevant activities of the entity need to be taken.\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control begins until the date this control ceases.\n\nNon-controlling interests are presented within equity and on the income statement separately from Group stockholders' equity and the Group's net income, under the line 'non-controlling interests'.\n\nThe e/ffects of a buyout of non-controlling interests in a subsidiary already controlled by the Group and divestment of a percentage interest without loss of control are recognized in equity.\n\nIn a partial disposal resulting in loss of control, the retained equity interest is re-measured at fair value at the date of loss of control. The gain or loss on the disposal will include the e/ffect of this re-measurement and the gain or loss on the sale of the equity interest, including all the items initially recognized in equity and reclassified to profit and loss.\n\n## Return obligation liabilities and provision for leased aircraft\n\nReturn obligation liabilities and provision for leased aircraft are remeasured each year to take into account the change in the discount rate. The discount rate is determined using risk-free rate assumptions plus a spread on risky debt.\n\n(See Note/uni00A031 'Return obligation liability and provision for leased aircraft and other provisions')\n\n## Sales\n\nThe valuation of revenue, related to passenger tickets and freight airwaybills issued and not used ('ticket breakage'), is based on a calculation using statistical rates, updated regularly and adjusted for non-recurring and specific events that may impact passenger behaviour.\n\n## Interest in associates and joint ventures\n\nIn accordance with IFRS/uni00A011 'Joint Arrangements', the Group applies the equity method to partnerships over which it exercises control jointly with one or more partners. Control is considered to be joint when decisions about the relevant activities of the partnership require the unanimous consent of the Group and the other parties with whom control is shared.\n\nIn cases of a joint activity, the Group recognizes assets and liabilities in proportion to its rights and obligations regarding the entity.\n\nIn accordance with IAS/uni00A028 'Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures', companies in which the Group has the ability to exercise significant influence over financial and operating policy decisions are also accounted for using the equity method. The ability to exercise significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds more than 20% of the voting rights.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the Group's share in the net result of associates and joint ventures from the date the ability to exercise significant influence begins until the date it ceases, adjusted for any impairment loss.\n\nThe Group's share of losses of an associate exceeding the value of the Group's interest and net investment (long-term receivables for which no reimbursement is scheduled or likely) in this entity are not accounted for, unless the Group has:\n\n- > incurred contractual obligations to recover losses; or\n- > made payments on behalf of the associate.\n\nAny surplus in investment cost over the Group's share in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the associate company on the date of acquisition is accounted for as goodwill and included in the book value of the investment accounted for using the equity method.",

Profits and losses resulting from intra-Group transactions are also eliminated.\n\nGains and losses realized on internal sales with associates and jointly-controlled entities are eliminated, to the extent of the Group's interest in the entity, providing there is no impairment.\n\n## 4.4/emspace Translation of foreign companies' financial statements and transactions in foreign currencies\n\n## Translation of foreign companies' financial statements\n\nThe financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into euros on the following basis:\n\n- > except for the equity for which historical prices are applied, balance sheet items are converted on the basis of the foreign currency exchange rates in e/ffect at the closing date;\n- > the income statement and the statement of cash flows are converted on the basis of the average foreign currency exchange rates for the period;\n- > the resulting foreign currency exchange adjustment is recorded in the 'Translation adjustments' item within equity;\n- > goodwill is expressed in the functional currency of the entity acquired and is converted into euros using the foreign exchange rate in e/ffect at the closing date.\n\n## 4.5/emspace Business  combinations\n\nBusiness combinations completed on or after April/uni00A01, 2010 are accounted for using the purchase method in accordance with IFRS/uni00A03 'Business Combinations'. In accordance with this standard, for a first consolidation, all assets and liabilities are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. The time period for adjustments to goodwill/negative goodwill is limited to 12/uni00A0months from the date of acquisition (except for non-current assets classified as assets held for sale which are measured at fair value less costs to sell).\n\nGoodwill corresponding, at the acquisition date, to the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree minus the net amounts (usually at fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, is subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. The previously held equity interest in the acquiree at fair value at the date of acquisition is also revalued and any gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss.\n\nCosts other than those related to the issuance of debt or equity securities are recognized immediately as an expense when incurred.\n\n## Translation of foreign currency transactions\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated using the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction.\n\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate in e/ffect at the closing date.\n\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies assessed on an historical cost basis are translated using the rate in e/ffect at the transaction date or the hedging rate, when applicable.\n\nThe corresponding exchange rate di/fferences are recorded in the income statement. Changes in fair value of the hedging instruments are recorded using the accounting treatment described in Note/uni00A04.11 'Financial instruments'.\n\nFor individual acquisitions, the Group has the option of using the 'full' goodwill method, where goodwill is calculated by taking into account the fair value of non-controlling interests at the acquisition date rather than their proportionate interest in the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquiree.\n\nIf the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceed the consideration transferred, the resulting negative goodwill is recognized immediately in the income statement.\n\nContingent considerations or earn-outs are recorded in equity if the contingent payment is settled by delivery of a fixed number of the acquirer's equity instruments (according to IAS/uni00A032). In all other cases, they are recognized in liabilities related to business combinations. Contingent payments or earn-outs are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. This initial measurement is subsequently adjusted through goodwill only when additional information is obtained after the acquisition date about facts and circumstances existing on that date. Such adjustments are made only during the 12-month measurement period that follows the acquisition date and insofar as the initial measurement had still been presented as provisional. Any other subsequent adjustments which do not meet these criteria are recorded as receivables or payables through the income statement.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The transportation service is also the trigger for the recognition as external expenses of the commissions paid to agents (e.g. credit card companies and travel agencies) and the booking fees.\n\nBoth passenger tickets and freight airway bills are consequently recorded as 'Deferred revenue upon issuance date'. The recognition of the revenue known as 'ticket breakage' is deferred until the transportation date initially foreseen.\n\nThe Group applies the exemption provided by IFRS/uni00A015/uni00A0which allows the balance of the outstanding transactions to remain unspecified as well as their planned recognition date for the performance obligations related to contracts with an initial term set at one year or less. If the tickets are not used, the performance obligations related to passenger and freight transportation e/ffectively expire within one year.\n\nPursuant to the European Union's Regulation EC 261, the Group compensates passengers in the event of denied boarding and for flight cancellations or long delays. This compensation is booked as contra revenue. The Group recognizes a corresponding amount in liabilities for future refunds to passengers. The determination of this liability for future refunds relies on a statistical approach.\n\nPassenger ticket taxes calculated on ticket sales are collected by the Group to be paid to the airport authorities. Therefore, they do not correspond to revenue. Taxes are recorded as a liability until such time as they are paid to the relevant airport authority as a function of the chargeability conditions (on ticket issuance or transportation).\n\nThe Group considers that the Company that issues the airway bill acts as principal since the latter has control over the achievement of the performance obligation. When the Group issues freight airway bills for its goods carried by another carrier (airline company or road carrier), the Group acts as principal. Therefore, at the time of transportation the Group recognizes as revenue the amount invoiced to the customer in its entirety as well as the chartering costs invoiced by the other carrier for the service provision.\n\nbe accounted in profit or loss as well as elements previously recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Maintenance\n\nThe main types of contracts with customers identified within the Group are mainly:\n\n## Sales of maintenance and support contracts - Power by the hour contracts\n\nSome maintenance and support contracts cover the airworthiness of engines, equipment or airframes, an airframe being an aircraft without engines and equipment. The invoicing of these contracts is based on the number of flight hours or landings of the goods concerned by these contracts.\n\nThe di/fferent services included within each of these contracts consist of a unique performance obligation due to the existing interdependence between the services within the execution of these contracts.\n\nRevenue from maintenance and support services is recognized on a percentage of completion basis, based on the costs incurred, if they can be reliably measured, plus the expected margin.\n\nThe transfer of the control of these services is performed continuously, As long as the margin on the contract cannot be measured in a reliable manner, the revenue will only be recognized at the level of the costs incurred.\n\nForecast margins on the contracts are assessed through the forecast future cash flows that take into account the obligations and factors inherent to the contracts as well as other internal parameters to the contract selected using historical and/or forecast data.\n\nThese forecast margins are regularly reviewed. If necessary, provisions are recorded as soon as any losses on completion of contracts are identified.\n\nAmounts invoiced to customers, and therefore mostly collected, which are not yet recognized as revenue, are recorded as liabilities on contracts (deferred revenue) at the accounting year end. Inversely, any revenue that has been recognized but not yet invoiced is recorded under assets on the balance sheet at the accounting year end.",

This program enables members to acquire Miles as they fly with Air/uni00A0France, KLM and airline partners and from transactions with non-airline partners (credit card companies, hotels, car rental agencies). These Miles entitle members to a range of benefits such as free flights with Air/uni00A0France, KLM and their airline partners or other free services with non-airline partners.\n\nMiles are considered as separate elements of a sale of a ticket with multiple elements and one part of the price of the initial sale of the ticket is allocated to these Miles and deferred until the Group's commitments relating to these Miles have been met.\n\n## Third-party procurement\n\nWhen the Group serves as a broker between its suppliers and end customers, the Group acts as an agent and hence, recognizes the margin that results from this operation as revenue.\n\nThe deferred amount due in relation to the acquisition of Miles by members is estimated:\n\n- > according to the fair value of the Miles, defined as the amount for which the benefits could be sold separately;\n- > after taking into account the redemption rate, corresponding to the probability that the Miles will be used by members, using a statistical method.\n\nWith regard to the re-invoicing of Miles between the partners in the program, the margins realized on sales of these Miles are recorded immediately in the income statement.\n\n## 4.8/emspace Distinction between income from current operations and income from operating activities\n\nThe Group considers it relevant to the understanding of its financial performance to present in the income statement a subtotal within the 'income from operating activities'. This subtotal, entitled 'Income from current operations', excludes unusual elements that do not have predictive value due to their nature, frequency and/or materiality, as defined in recommendation No. 2020-01/uni00A0from the France's accounting standards authority.\n\nSuch elements are as follows:\n\n- > sales of aircraft equipment and significant disposals of other assets;\n- > accelerated aircraft phase-out;\n- > income from the disposal of subsidiaries and a/ffiliates;\n- > restructuring costs when they are significant;\n- > modification of pension plans;\n- > significant and infrequent elements such as the recognition of badwill in the income statement, the recording of an impairment loss on goodwill and significant provisions for litigation.\n\n## 4.9/emspace Aggregates used within the framework of financial communication\n\nEBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization): by excluding the main line of the income statement which does not involve cash disbursement ('Amortization, depreciation and provision') from income from current operations, EBITDA provides a simple indicator of the cash generated by the Group's current operational activities. It is thus commonly used for the calculation of the financial coverage and enterprise value ratios (see 'Consolidated income statement').\n\nOperating free cash flow : this corresponds to the net cash flow from operating activities net of the purchases of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, plus the proceeds on the disposal of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. It does not include the other cash flows linked to investment operations, particularly investments in subsidiaries and other financial assets and net cash flow from the operating activities of discontinued operations (see Note/uni00A042.1 'Operating free cash flow').\n\n<!-- image -->",

The average number of shares outstanding does not include treasury shares.\n\nDiluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the net income attributable to the equity holders of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, adjusted for the effects of dilutive instrument exercise, by the average number of shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for the e/ffect of all potentially-dilutive ordinary shares.\n\n## 4.11/emspace Financial  instruments\n\n## Valuation of trade receivables and non-current financial assets\n\nTrade receivables, loans and other non-current financial assets are considered to be assets issued by the Group and are initially recorded at fair value. They are subsequently valued using the amortized cost method. In addition, they are written o/ff based on the expected loss.\n\nRegarding the impairment of trade receivables, the Group has chosen the simplified method approach in that the automated customer invoicing and settlement processes for the Network business significantly limit the credit risk. The Group also uses credit insurance to reduce the risk of potential default regarding trade receivables concerning the clients of the Maintenance activity.\n\nThe Group considers that the change in credit risk on the non-current financial assets since their initial recognition is limited due to the current selection criteria (e.g. type of instrument, counterparty rating, maturity). The impairment recorded by the Group consists of the expect credit loss over the 12/uni00A0months following the closing date.\n\nPurchases and sales of financial assets are booked as of the transaction date.\n\n## Investments in equity instruments\n\nInvestments in equity securities qualifying as equity instruments are recorded at fair value in the Group's balance sheet. For publicly-traded securities, the fair value is considered to be the market price at the closing date. For non-quoted securities, the valuation is made on the basis of the financial statements of the entity.\n\nThe valuation of equity instruments is either in fair value through the income statement or in fair value through other comprehensive income:\n\n- > when the instrument is deemed to be a cash investment, i.e. it is held for the purposes of monetary transactions, its revaluations are recorded in 'Other financial income and expenses';\n\n- > when the instrument is deemed to be a business investment, i.e. it is held for strategic reasons (as it mainly consists of investments in companies whose activity is very close to that of the Group), its revaluations are recorded in 'Other comprehensive income' non-recyclable. Dividends are recorded in the income statement.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Group uses various derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to the risks incurred on shares, exchange rates, changes in interest rates or fuel prices and the ETS (Emission Trading Scheme).\n\nForward currency contracts and options are used to hedge exposure to exchange rates.\n\nThe Group also uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risk. Most of the swaps traded convert floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt.\n\nThe exposure to fuel risk is hedged by swaps or options on jet fuel, diesel or Brent.\n\nFinally, the risk related to the ETS is hedged by forwards.\n\nMost of these derivatives are classified as hedging instruments if the derivative is eligible as a hedging instrument and if the hedging relationships are documented as required by IFRS/uni00A09 'Financial Instruments'.\n\nThese derivative instruments are recorded on the Group's consolidated balance sheet at their fair value adjusted for the market value of the Group's credit risk (DVA) and the credit risk of the counterparty (CVA). The method of accounting for changes in fair value depends on the classification of the derivative instruments.\n\nThere are three classifications:\n\n## Derivatives classified as fair value hedge\n\nChanges in the fair value of the derivative are recorded through the income statement and o/ffset within the limit of its e/ffective portion against the changes in the fair value of the underlying item (asset, liability or firm commitment), which are also recognized through the income statement.",

The ine/ffective portion is recorded as financial income or losses until the termination of the derivative. When the termination occurs, the residual ine/ffective portion is recycled on the hedged item.\n\n## Derivatives classified as trading\n\nChanges in the fair value of the derivative are recorded as financial income or losses.\n\nFor options, only the intrinsic risk can be hedged. The time value is excluded as it is considered as a cost of hedging. The change in fair value of the option time value is recognized in other comprehensive income in so far as it relates to the hedged item. When the latter occurs (if the hedged item is transaction related), the change in fair value is then recycled and impacts the hedged item or is amortized over the hedging period (if the hedged item is time-related).\n\nThe di/fference in time value between non-aligned structured options and the related 'vanilla' ('aligned') options is recognized in the profit and loss account.\n\nRegarding forward contracts, only the spot component is considered as a hedging instrument, since the forward element is considered as a hedging cost and accounted for similarly to the option time value.\n\nThe currency swap basis spread is also excluded from the hedging instrument and considered to be a hedging cost.\n\n## Convertible bonds\n\nConvertible bonds are deemed to be financial instruments comprising two components: a bond component recorded as debt and a stock component recorded in equity. The bond component is equal to the discounted value of all the coupons due on the bond at the rate of a simple bond that would have been issued at the same time as the convertible bond. The value of the stock component recorded in the Group's equity is calculated by the di/fference between this value and the bond's nominal value at issuance.\n\nThe di/fference between the financial expense recorded and the amounts e/ffectively paid out is added, at each closing date, to the amount of the debt component so that, at maturity, the amount to be repaid if there is no conversion equals the redemption price.\n\n## Financial assets, cash and cash equivalents\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss\n\nFinancial assets include financial assets at fair value through profit and loss (French mutual funds such as SICAVs and FCPs, certificates,/uni00A0etc.) that the Group intends to sell in the near term to realize a capital gain, or that are part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments managed collectively and for which there is evidence of a practice of short-term profit taking. They are classified in the balance sheet as other current financial assets.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents are short-term, highly-liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nBorrowings and financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value. Subsequent to the initial measurement, they are recorded:\n\n- > at their net book value for bonds;\n- > based on amortized cost calculated using the e/ffective interest rate for the other financial liabilities. Under this principle, any redemption and issue premiums, as well as issue costs, are recorded as debt in the balance sheet and amortized as financial income or expense over the life of the loans using the e/ffective interest method.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy of the financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe table presenting a breakdown of financial assets and liabilities categorized by value (see Note/uni00A038 'Valuation methods for financial assets and liabilities at their fair value') meets the amended requirements of IFRS/uni00A07 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures'. The fair values are classified using a scale which reflects the nature of the market data used to make the valuations.\n\nThis scale has three levels of fair value:\n\nLevel/uni00A01 : Fair value calculated from the exchange rate/price quoted on an active market for identical instruments,\n\n- Level/uni00A02 : Fair value calculated from valuation methods based on observable data such as the prices of similar assets and liabilities or scopes quoted on an active market,\n- Level/uni00A03 : Fair value calculated from valuation methods which rely completely or in part on non-observable data such as prices on an inactive market or multiple-based valuation for non-quoted securities.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations taking place prior to April/uni00A01, 2004 were not modified at the time international standards were adopted, on April/uni00A01, 2004, in accordance with IFRS/uni00A01 'First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards'.\n\n## 4.13/emspace Intangible  assets\n\nIntangible assets are recorded at initial cost less accumulated amortization and any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nIT development costs are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives. The Group has the tools required to enable the tracking by project of all the stages of development, and, in particular, the internal and external costs directly related to each project during its development phase.\n\nIdentifiable intangible assets acquired with a finite useful life are amortized over their useful lives from the date they are available for use.\n\nThe KLM and Transavia brands and slots (takeo/ff and landing rights) acquired by the Group as part of the acquisition of KLM are identifiable intangible assets with an indefinite useful life. They are not amortized but tested annually for impairment or whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. If necessary, impairment as described in Note/uni00A04.16/uni00A0is recorded.\n\nGoodwill is valued in the functional currency of the entity acquired. It is recorded as an asset in the balance sheet.\n\nIt is not amortized and is tested for impairment annually and at any point during the year when an indicator of impairment exists. As described in Note/uni00A04.16, once recorded the impairment may not subsequently be reversed.\n\nWhen the acquirer's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired exceeds the consideration transferred, there is negative goodwill which is recognized and immediately reversed in the Group's income statement.\n\nAt the time of the sale of a subsidiary or an equity a/ffiliate, the amount of the goodwill attributable to the entity sold is included in the calculation of the income from the sale.\n\nSince January/uni00A01, 2012, airlines have been subject to the ETS (Emission Trading Scheme) market regulations as described in Note/uni00A04.23 and the 'Risks on carbon credit' paragraph in Note/uni00A037.4. As such, the Group is required to purchase/uni00A0CO2 quotas to o/ffset its emissions. The Group records the/uni00A0CO2 quotas as intangible assets. These assets are not depreciable.\n\nIntangible assets with a definite useful life are amortized on a straight-line basis over the following periods:\n\n| Software                            | 1/uni00A0to 5/uni00A0years          |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Licenses                            | Duration of contract                |\n| Information Technology developments | Up to 20/uni00A0years/thinspace (1) |\n\n- (1) IT developments are amortized over the same useful life as the underlying software. In some cases, they can be amortized over a longer period. This duration must be documented.\n\n## 4.14/emspace Property, plant and equipment\n\n## Principles applicable\n\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at their acquisition or manufacturing cost, less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nPursuant to IAS/uni00A023, the financial interest attributed to advance payments made on account of investments in aircraft and other significant assets under construction is capitalized and added to the cost of the asset concerned (see Note/uni00A012 'Net cost of financial debt and other financial income and expenses'). As prepayments on investments are not financed by specific loans, the Group uses the average interest rate on the current unallocated loans of the period.\n\nMaintenance costs are recorded as expenses during the period when incurred, with the exception of programs that extend the useful life of the asset or increase its value, which are then capitalized (e.g. maintenance on aircraft airframes and engines including parts with limited useful lives).\n\n## Flight equipment\n\nThe purchase price of aircraft equipment is denominated in foreign currencies. It is translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction or, if applicable, at the hedging price assigned to it. Manufacturers' discounts, if any, are deducted from the value of the related asset.",

These are incremental costs which would not have been incurred if the contract had not been concluded;\n\nAircraft spare parts (maintenance business) which enable the use of the fleet are recorded as fixed assets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated residual lifetime of the aircraft/engine type on the world market. The useful life is limited to a maximum of 30/uni00A0years.\n\n## Other property, plant and equipment\n\nOther property, plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their useful lives as follows:\n\nBuildings\n\n20/uni00A0to 50/uni00A0years\n\nFixtures and fittings\n\n8/uni00A0to 20/uni00A0years\n\nFlight simulators\n\n10/uni00A0to 20/uni00A0years\n\nEquipment and tooling\n\n3/uni00A0to 15/uni00A0years\n\n- > estimated costs for the restoration and dismantling of the leased asset according to the terms of the contract. At the date of the initial recognition of the right-of-use asset, the lessee adds to these costs, the discounted amount of the restoration and dismantling costs through a return obligation liability or provision as described in Note/uni00A05.20. These costs also include maintenance obligations with regard to the engines and airframes.\n\nFollowing the initial recognition, the right-of-use asset must be depreciated over the useful life of the underlying assets (lease term for the rental component, flight hours for the component relating to engine maintenance or on a straight-line basis for the component relating to the airframe until the date of the next major overhaul).\n\n## Measurement of the lease debt\n\nAt the commencement date, the lease debt is recognized for an amount equal to the present value of the lease payments over the lease term.\n\nAmounts involved in the measurement of the lease debt are:\n\n- > fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments; meaning that even if they are variable in form, they are in-substance unavoidable);\n- > variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or the rate in force at the lease commencement date;\n- > amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;\n- > payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The lease debt is subsequently measured based on a process similar to the amortized cost method using the discount rate:\n\n- > the lease debt is increased by the accrued interests resulting from the discounting of the lease debt, at the beginning of the lease period;\n- > less payments made.\n\nThe interest cost for the period as well as variable payments, not taken into account in the initial measurement of the lease debt and incurred over the relevant period, are recognized as costs.\n\nIn addition, the lease debt may be remeasured in the following situations:\n\n- > change in the lease term;\n- > modification related to the assessment of the reasonably certain nature (or not) of the exercise of an option;\n- > remeasurement linked to the residual value guarantees;\n- > adjustment to the rates and indices according to which the rents are calculated when rent adjustments occur.\n\n## Types of capitalized lease contracts\n\n## 'Aircraft' lease contracts\n\nFor the aircraft lease contracts fulfilling the capitalization criteria defined by IFRS/uni00A016, the lease term corresponds to the non-terminable period of each contract except in cases where the Group is reasonably certain of exercising the renewal options contractually foreseen. For example, this may be the case if substantial cabin customization has taken place whereas the residual lease term is significantly shorter than the useful life of the cabins. The accounting treatment of the maintenance obligations related to leased aircraft is outlined in Note/uni00A04.21.\n\nAircraft lease contracts concluded by the Group do not include guaranteed value clauses for leased assets.\n\nThe discount rate used to calculate the lease debt corresponds, for each aircraft, to the implicit interest rate induced by the contractual elements and residual market values. This rate is easy to calculate due to the availability of current and future data concerning the value of aircraft. It is recalculated on each contract renewal (prolongation). The implied rate of the contract is the discount rate that gives the aggregated present value of the minimum lease payments and the unguaranteed residual value. This present value should be equal to the sum of the fair value of the leased asset and any initial direct costs of the lessor.\n\nSince most of the aircraft lease contracts are denominated in US dollars, starting from January/uni00A01, 2018 the Group put in place a cash-flow hedge for its US dollar revenues via the lease debt in US dollars. Consequently, the revaluation of the Group's debt at the closing rate is accounted for in 'Other comprehensive income'.\n\n## 'Real-estate' lease contracts\n\nBased on its analysis, the Group has identified lease contracts according to the standard concerning surface areas rented in its hubs, lease contracts on buildings dedicated to the maintenance business, customized lounges in airports other than hubs and lease contracts on o/ffice buildings. The lease term corresponds to the non-terminable period, with most of the contracts not including renewal options.\n\nThe discount rate used to calculate the lease debt is determined, for each asset, according to the incremental borrowing rate at the signature date. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate that the lessee would pay to borrow the required funds to purchase the asset over a similar term, with a similar security and in a similar economic environment. This rate is achieved by the addition of the interest rate on government bonds and the credit spread. The coupon on government bonds is specific to the location, currency, period and maturity. The definition of the spread curve is based upon reference points, each point consisting of asset financing on assets other than aircraft.\n\n## 'Other-assets' lease contracts\n\nThe main lease contracts identified correspond to company cars, pools of spare parts and engines. The lease term corresponds to the non-terminable period. Most of the contracts do not provide renewal options. The discount rate used to calculate the lease debt is determined, for each asset, according to the incremental borrowing rate at the signature debt. The incremental borrowing rate is the rate that the lessee would pay to borrow the required funds to purchase the asset over a similar term, with a similar security and in a similar economic environment (for the method used to determine the incremental borrowing rate, see the 'Real estate lease contracts' paragraph above).\n\n## Types of non-capitalized lease contracts\n\nThe Group uses the two exemptions foreseen by IFRS/uni00A016/uni00A0allowing for non-recognition in the balance sheet: short-term lease contracts and lease contracts for which the underlying assets have a low value.\n\n## Short duration lease contracts\n\nThese are contracts whose duration is equal to or less than 12/uni00A0months. Within the Group, they mainly relate to leases of:\n\n- > surface areas in our hubs with a reciprocal notice-period equal to or less than 12/uni00A0months;\n- > accommodations for expatriates with a notice period equal to or less than 12/uni00A0months;\n- > spare engines for a duration equal to or less than 12/uni00A0months.\n\n## Low value lease contracts\n\nLow-value lease contracts concern assets with a value equal to or less than US$5,000. Within the Group, these include, notably, lease contracts on printers, tablets, laptops and mobile phones.",

The constitution of these return obligation liabilities and provisions depends on the type of maintenance obligations to fulfill before returning these aircraft to the lessors: overhaul and restoration work, airframe and engine potential reconstitution as well as the replacement of limited life parts.\n\n## Overhaul and restoration works (not depending on aircraft utilization)\n\nCosts resulting from work required to be performed just before returning aircraft to the lessors, such as painting of the shell or aircraft overhaul ('C Check') are recognized as provisions as of the inception of the contract. The counterpart of these provisions is booked as a complement through the initial book value of the aircraft right-of-use assets. This complement to the right-of-use asset is depreciated over the lease term.\n\n## Airframe and engine potentials reconstitution (depending on the utilization of the aircraft and its engines)\n\nThe airframe and the engine potentials as well as the limited life parts are recognized as a complement to the right-of-use assets since they are considered as fully-fledged components, as distinct from the physical components which are the engine and the airframe. These components are the counterparts of the return obligation liability, recognized in its totality at the inception of the contract. When maintenance events aimed at reconstituting these potentials or replacing the limited life parts take place, the costs incurred are capitalized. These potentials and the limited life parts are depreciated over the period of use of the underlying assets (flight hours for the engine potentials component, straight-line for the airframe potentials component and cycles for the limited life parts).",

Other cargo revenues are derived principally from the sale of cargo capacity to third parties and the transportation of shipments on behalf of the Group by other airlines.\n\nMaintenance : Maintenance operating revenues are generated through maintenance services provided to other airlines and customers worldwide.\n\nTransavia : The revenues from this segment come from the 'leisure' activity realized by Transavia.\n\nOther : The revenues from this segment come from various services provided by the Group and not covered by the four segments mentioned above.\n\nThe results of the business segments are those that are either directly attributable or that can be allocated on a reasonable basis to these business segments. Amounts allocated to business segments mainly correspond to the EBITDA, current operating income and to the income from operating activities. Other elements of the income statement are presented in the 'non-allocated' column.\n\nInter-segment transactions are evaluated based on normal market conditions.\n\n## Geographical segments\n\n## Activity by origin of sales area (Note/uni00A06.2.1)\n\nGroup external sales by origin of sale are broken down into four geographical areas:\n\n- > France, including French overseas departments;\n- > Benelux, including Dutch Caribbean & Surinam;\n- > Europe (excluding France and Benelux);\n- > Rest of the world.\n\n## Activity by destination (Note/uni00A06.2.2)\n\nGroup Tra/ffic sales by destination are broken down into seven geographical areas:\n\n- > Metropolitan  France;\n- > Europe (excluding France) and North Africa;\n- > Caribbean, West Indies, French Guyana and Indian Ocean;\n- > Africa (excluding North Africa), Middle East;\n- > North America, Mexico;\n- > South America (excluding Mexico);\n- > Asia and New Caledonia.",

The Group limits its recoverability horizon on the deferred tax losses of the French fiscal group to a period of five years, consistent with its strategic plan.\n\nIn view of the recovery in activity and the medium and long-term outlook, the fiscal group has recognized deferred tax assets for an amount of \u20ac61/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2022. The deferred\n\ntax assets position for tax losses was therefore increased to \u20ac346/uni00A0million (versus \u20ac285/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021).\n\n## Dutch fiscal group\n\nIn the Netherlands, the tax rate is 25.8% in 2022. Tax losses can be carried forward for an unlimited period. However, the amount of fiscal loss recoverable each year is limited to 50% of the profit for the period beyond the first million euros.\n\nIn view of the recovery in activity and the medium and long-term outlook, the Group has recognized deferred tax assets for an amount of \u20ac346/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2022. The deferred tax assets position for tax losses and deductible financial interests was therefore increased to \u20ac403/uni00A0million (versus \u20ac57/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021).\n\n## Undiscounting of provision\n\nThe rate used to undiscount the long term return obligation liability and provision for leased aircraft and other provisions non current is 3.6% in 2022 against 3.4% in 2021 (see Note/uni00A031.1.1 'Return obligation liability and provision on leased aircraft').\n\n<!-- image -->",

These partnerships, whose country localizations and percentages of interest are presented in Note/uni00A044.2/uni00A0have been concluded either with airlines or with independent players in the maintenance market.\n\n## Servair Group (Catering)\n\nThe Servair Group is the French number one in aviation catering. With about 36/uni00A0establishments in 19/uni00A0countries and approximately 10,500/uni00A0employees, Servair has a leading position in Paris and Africa. Servair numbers more than a hundred air carrier customers worldwide and proposes a series of services regrouped around three core businesses: On-Board Services, Airports Services and Out-of-Home Catering.\n\nFollowing the acquisition of gategroup by HNA on December/uni00A022, 2016, Air/uni00A0France and gategroup finalized the agreement for the sale to gategroup of 49.99% of the Servair share capital. On conclusion of this transaction, the operational control of Servair\n\nwas transferred to gategroup in application of the governance planned in the agreements between Air/uni00A0France and gategroup.\n\nIn early 2021, the terms under which Air/uni00A0France could sell a 30% shareholding in Servair to Gategroup were re-negotiated. This resulted in the sale by Air/uni00A0France Finance, on May/uni00A031, 2021, of 15% of Servair shares for \u20ac71/uni00A0million. A second installment for a further 15% shareholding should be paid. These 15% are classified in assets held for sale (see Note/uni00A028 'Assets held for sale') and the remaining 20% were revalued accordingly to the IFRS/uni00A010/uni00A0standard at their fair value based on the transaction value for an amount of \u20ac55/uni00A0million in the line 'equity a/ffiliates'.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2022, the Servair group remains consolidated according to the equity method, as it has been the case since December/uni00A031, 2016.\n\nThe net result from airline catering is mainly impacted by the Servair operating loss. However, the total fair value of the Group's 34.9% equity interest in the Servair Group, including the put option recorded in the balance sheet in the lines other derivatives and assets held for sale, remains unchanged (see Note/uni00A040 'Other commitments').\n\n<!-- image -->",

Given the plan settlement, the agreement with the trustees and the application of IFRIC14, this surplus is fully recognised\n\n## NOTE 22/emspace IMPAIRMENT\n\nNo indication of impairment has been identified. Given the existence of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, an impairment test (see Note/uni00A04.16 'Impairment test') has been carried out, in accordance with IAS/uni00A036, in order to verify that the net assets of the cash-generating units (CGUs) do not exceed their recoverable amount. The test is performed based\n\non the values as of September/uni00A030 for the annual closing. The Group monitors any significant changes that could a/ffect this calculation in the last quarter. The Group's CGUs correspond to the Group's business segments (see Note/uni00A06.1 'Information by business segment'). Their carrying amounts break down as follows:\n\n| As of September, 30   (in \u20ac millions)   | Network   | Network   | Maintenance   | Maintenance   | Transavia   | Transavia   | Other/Non allocated   | Other/Non allocated   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                                         | 2022      | 2021      | 2022          | 2021          | 2022        | 2021        | 2022                  | 2021                  |\n| Segment assets                          | 16,440    | 15,937    | 4,249         | 3,987         | 1,831       | 1,718       | 12,043                | 9,348                 |\n| Segment liabilities                     | (11,983)  | (8,825)   | (1,985)       | (1,931)       | (1,574)     | (1,222)     | (19,021)              | (19,012)              |\n| Net segment assets (liabilities)        | 4,457     | 7,112     | 2,264         | 2,056         | 257         | 496         | (6,978)               | (9,664)               |\n\nThe recoverable amount of the net assets of the CGUs has been determined by reference to their value in use as of September/uni00A030, 2022, based on a five-year target plan presented by Management to the Board of Directors early December/uni00A02022. Subject to the uncertainties associated with the current situation, this plan is based on revenue, cost and investment projections that are based on reasonable assumptions and correspond to Management's best estimates, including:\n\n- > a return to the 2019 level of activity expected in 2024;\n- > savings linked to the continuation of the reorganization/ restructuring plans implemented by the Group;\n- > the increase in the price of/uni00A0CO2 emission allowances, the implementation of the international system for o/ffsetting and reducing emissions (CORSIA) from 2026 and the gradual disappearance of free allowances until 2026 in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS);\n\nin the balance sheet (see Note/uni00A030 'Retirement benefits' for more details).\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2021, the analysis of these pension assets including the impacts related to the modification of the KLM Ground sta/ff pension plan is presented in Note/uni00A030 (see Note/uni00A030.1 'Characteristics of the main defined benefit plans').",

In addition, the discount rate used for the test is the weighted average cost of capital (WACC).\n\n| As of December/uni00A031      | Network   | Network   | Maintenance   | Maintenance   | Transavia   | Transavia   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|---------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                               | 2022      | 2021      | 2022          | 2021          | 2022        | 2021        |\n| Operating margin rates        | 7.4%      | 7.4%      | 6.0%          | 6.0%          | 8.2%        | 7.4%        |\n| Long-term growth rates        | 1.0%      | 1.0%      | 1.0%          | 1.0%          | 1.0%        | 1.0%        |\n| Discount rate (after tax)     | 7.7%      | 6.7%      | 7.7%          | 6.7%          | 7.7%        | 6.7%        |\n| Fuel price  (USD/metric tons) | 772-867   | 598-664   | n/a           | n/a           | 772-867     | 598-664     |\n\nThe long-term growth rate and the current operating margin rates used by the Group for the realization of the test, which are relatively conservative, make it possible to take account of the uncertainties that apply to the Group's three segments, in particular the acceptability of air transport.\n\nOn the other hand, the Group has not taken into account technological advances not available at the closing date, nor potential future changes in law or regulations not yet voted (kerosene taxes, limitation of the number of slots,/uni00A0etc.).\n\nAs a result of the test, no impairment was recognized on the Group's CGUs (as was the case for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2021). The results are identical for the sensitivity tests performed:\n\n- > with a WACC 100/uni00A0bps higher associated with a 100/uni00A0bps decrease in the long-term growth rate;\n- > with a 100/uni00A0bps increase in WACC associated with a 100/uni00A0bps decrease in target current operating margins.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The issue was composed of three tranches with perpetual maturities and each in a nominal amount of \u20ac1/uni00A0billion, respectively bearing a coupon of 7/uni00A0per cent, 7.25/uni00A0per cent and 7.5/uni00A0per cent, and with first redemption options (call) at 4, 5 and 6/uni00A0years respectively.\n\nThis non-monetary transaction was recorded in the Group's consolidated balance sheet as a reclassification to equity of \u20ac3/uni00A0billion from the line 'Financial liabilities'.\n\nOn April/uni00A020, 2022, the Group paid the accrued coupon on the perpetual super-subordinated bonds held by the French State, for a total amount of \u20ac218/uni00A0million (see Note/uni00A03.2 'Significant events occurring during the period'), including \u20ac151/uni00A0million for the coupon accrued to December/uni00A031, 2021 and \u20ac67/uni00A0million for the coupon accrued to the payment date.\n\nOn June/uni00A016, 2022, following the completion of the capital increase of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, the partial repayment of the perpetual super-subordinated bonds held by the French\n\nState was carried out, for a total amount of \u20ac1,649/uni00A0million, including 1,631/uni00A0million euros in nominal value and \u20ac18/uni00A0million in accrued coupons (see Note/uni00A03.2 'Significant events occurring during the period').\n\nOn July/uni00A029, 2022, the proceeds of Apollo's investment (see Note/uni00A03.2 'Significant events occurring during the period' and 29.7 'Non-controlling interests') were allocated to the reimbursement of an amount of \u20ac487/uni00A0million in nominal plus the coupon accrued to that date for an amount of \u20ac10/uni00A0million.\n\nFinally, on December/uni00A09, 2022, an amount of \u20ac287/uni00A0million in nominal plus the coupon accrued until that date for an amount of \u20ac14/uni00A0million was repaid thanks to the proceeds of the issue of the subordinated convertible bonds described in Note/uni00A029.4.2 'Last-rank indefinite subordinated bond convertible into new shares and/or existing shares' below.\n\nThe amount of the accrued coupon on the 2021 perpetual super-subordinated bonds as of December/uni00A031, 2022 amounts to \u20ac31/uni00A0million.\n\n<!-- image -->",

From November/uni00A023, 2025, the bonds will bear interest at a rate equal to 1,300/uni00A0basis points above the Mid-Swap rate applicable to 3/uni00A0years in Euro as reference rate, which will be subject to revision every three years thereafter. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears.\n\nThe bonds are for an indefinite period, and the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group may, at its option, proceed with the early redemption of all the bonds at par plus interest, for the first time on November/uni00A023, 2025, or over the period from December/uni00A014, 2024 to November/uni00A023, 2025 if certain conditions linked to the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM share price are met.\n\nBondholders may exercise their conversion/exchange right at any time until November/uni00A010, 2025.

As provided for by this agreement, the KLM Ground Sta/ff pension fund now qualifies as a defined contribution plan under IFRS rules. The pension assets, based on the actuarial assumptions as of May/uni00A031, 2021, amounted to \u20ac875/uni00A0million (before tax). Under this agreement, KLM has paid an additional pension premium covering the period January-May/uni00A02021, as well as a one-o/ff contribution representing the savings realized since 2014 following changes in the Dutch law. These contributions amount to \u20ac63/uni00A0million.\n\nThe total impact of the de-recognition of the pension assets together with the additional contributions has been booked in 'Other non-current income and expenses' in the consolidated statement of income for an amount of \u20ac938/uni00A0million (\u20ac704/uni00A0million net of tax).\n\n## Air/uni00A0France pension plan (CRAF) - France\n\nThe employees covered by this plan are the Air/uni00A0France Ground Sta/ff a/ffiliated to the CRAF until December/uni00A031, 1992.\n\nThe participants receive, or will receive on retirement, an additional pension paid monthly or a lump sum based on the monthly annuity and definitively calculated based on the data known as of December/uni00A031, 1992 and expressed in the form of points. The value of each point is adjusted every year based on the weighted increases seen in the CNAV and AGIRC-ARRCO schemes over the last twelve months.\n\nUntil 2009, the CRAF had the legal form of a supplementary pension institution (pursuant to the 'Code de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Sociale'). With this status, the CRAF was responsible, on behalf of the Air/uni00A0France ground sta/ff employed in France, for managing the",

        "page_content": "pension plan resulting from the merging of the Air/uni00A0France ground sta/ff plan with the mandatory pension plan for the private sector.\n\nFollowing the 2003 law on pension reform foreseeing the disappearance of supplementary pension institutions as of December/uni00A031, 2009, the CRAF's Board of Directors opted to transform it into an institution managing supplementary pensions. The CRAF is now responsible for the administrative functions linked to the plan. The pension rights were not amended by this reform. Air/uni00A0France is directly responsible for the pension obligations.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2009, all the funds managed by the CRAF had been transferred to two insurance companies. On December/uni00A031, 2012, one of the insurance contracts was terminated and its funds were transferred to the other, which thus became the only insurer.\n\nThis guarantees a capital of 17/uni00A0per cent equal to the amount of capital invested in units of account in its collective fund, this percentage being automatically set to increase over time. The annual payments made by Air/uni00A0France to the insurance company are governed by the agreement signed with the employee representative bodies on December/uni00A014, 2009. The minimum annual payment defined by this agreement amounts to \u20ac32.5/uni00A0million as long as the life annuity guaranteed by the insurer does not reach 85/uni00A0per cent of the benefits payments for this plan without future revaluations. If the value of the funds falls below 50/uni00A0per cent of the total obligations calculated for funding purposes, Air/uni00A0France is required to make an additional payment to achieve a minimum 50/uni00A0per cent coverage rate.\n\nThe funds are invested in bonds, equities and general assets of the insurance company. Studies of assets/liabilities allocation are carried out regularly, to verify the relevance of the investment strategy.\n\n## Air/uni00A0France end of service benefit plan (ICS) - France\n\nPursuant to French regulations and the Company agreements, every employee receives an end of service indemnity on retirement.\n\nIn France, this indemnity depends on the number of years of service, the professional category of the employee (Flight Deck Crew, cabin crew, ground sta/ff, agent, technician and executive) and, in some cases, on the age of the employee at retirement. There is no mandatory minimum funding requirement for this scheme.\n\nOn retirement, employees consequently receive an end of service indemnity based on their final salaries over the last twelve-months and on their seniority. The indemnity is only payable to employees on their retirement date.\n\nAir/uni00A0France has nevertheless signed contracts with three insurance companies to partly pre-finance the plan. Air/uni00A0France has sole responsibility for payment of the indemnities, but remains free to make payments to these insurance companies.\n\nThe relevant outsourced funds are invested in bonds and equities.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2022, the two French plans presented above represented a respective 67/uni00A0per cent (61/uni00A0per cent in 2021) of the Group's defined benefit obligation and 45/uni00A0per cent (42/uni00A0per cent in 2021) of the Group's pension plan assets.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2022, the coverage of liabilities by reserves is 59/uni00A0per cent against 53/uni00A0per cent in 2021..\n\n## 30.2/emspace Description of the actuarial assumptions and related sensitivities\n\nActuarial valuations of the Group's benefit obligation were made as of December/uni00A031, 2022 and 2021.\n\nThese calculations include:\n\n- > assumptions on sta/ff turnover and the life expectancy of the plan beneficiaries;\n- > assumptions on salary and pension increases;\n- > assumptions on retirement ages varying from 50/uni00A0to 68/uni00A0years depending on the localization and applicable laws;\n- > inflation rates determined with reference to the inflation swaps applied to the Group's cash flows and based on the duration of the schemes:\n\n| As of December/uni00A031                          | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Euro zone - Duration 10/uni00A0to 15/uni00A0years | 2.55%  | 2.15%  |\n\n- > discount rates used to determine the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligations.\n\nThe discount rates for the di/fferent geographical areas are thus determined based on the duration of each plan, taking into account the average trend in interest rates on investment grade bonds, observed on the main available indices. In some countries, where the market in this type of bond is not su/fficiently broad, the discount rate is determined with reference to government bonds. Most of the Group's benefit obligations are located in the Euro zone, where the discount rates used are as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->",

This change consists of moving, as from January 1, 2023 and for the entire population concerned by this agreement, from a scale favoring retirement at 55/uni00A0years of age to a more progressive scale, allowing departures up to 60/uni00A0years of age to be linearized.\n\nThe counterpart of this increase has been recognized on the line Other non-current income and expenses in the income statement (see Note/uni00A011).\n\n## -As of December/uni00A031, 2021\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2021, an adjustment to the 2020 plan reduction was made based on the final list of individuals for the Air/uni00A0France departure plan in the amount of \u20ac27/uni00A0million (see Note/uni00A011 'Sales of aircraft equipment and other non-current income and expenses') and the thresholds for the payment of small capital annuities were increased, leading to a decrease in the liabilities to active and deferred members of the CRAF plan for an amount of \u20ac16/uni00A0million.\n\nIn addition, on June/uni00A014, 2021, KLM and the five Dutch unions for the KLM Ground Sta/ff signed an agreement allowing for the modification of the Ground Sta/ff pension scheme as of January/uni00A02021. As a result of this agreement, the KLM Ground Sta/ff pension fund is now classified as a defined contribution plan under IFRS rules. The overall impact of the de-recognition of the the pension asset as well as these additional payments has been recognized in 'other non-current income and expenses' in the consolidated income statement for an amount of \u20ac938/uni00A0million (\u20ac704/uni00A0million net of tax) (see Note/uni00A030.1 'Characteristics of the main defined benefit plans').\n\n## 30.4/emspace Asset  allocation\n\nThe weighted average allocation of the funds invested in the Group's pension and other long-term benefit plans is as follows:\n\n| (in %)   | Funds invested as of  December/uni00A031, 2022   | Funds invested as of  December/uni00A031, 2022   | Funds invested as of  December/uni00A031, 2021   | Funds invested as of  December/uni00A031, 2021   |\n|----------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n|          | France                                           | Other                                            | France                                           | Other                                            |\n| Equities | 20                                               | 42                                               | 23                                               | 40                                               |\n| Bonds    | 52                                               | 21                                               | 54                                               | 20                                               |\n| Others   | 28                                               | 37                                               | 23                                               | 40                                               |\n| Total    | 100                                              | 100                                              | 100                                              | 100                                              |\n\nThe equity portion is mainly invested in active markets in Europe, the United States and emerging countries.\n\nThe Group's pension assets do not include assets occupied or used by the Group.\n\nThe bonds primarily comprise government bonds, rated at least BBB, and invested in Europe, the United States and emerging countries.\n\n## 30.5/emspace Expected cash outflows and risks linked to the pension obligations\n\nThe employer contributions relating to the defined benefit pension plans amount to \u20ac36/uni00A0million for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2023.

        "page_content": "## 31.1/emspace Provisions\n\n## 31.1.1/emspace Return obligation liability and provision on leased aircraft\n\nThe movements in return obligation liabilities and provisions (revaluation of future costs and change in discount rate) are booked in the components corresponding to the potential and restoration work performed on leased aircraft and recorded in the right-of-use assets. The e/ffects of discounting and foreign exchange translation on return obligation liabilities and provisions recorded in local currencies are recognized in 'Other financial income and expenses' (see Note/uni00A012 'Net cost of financial debt and other financial income and expenses').\n\nThe discount rate used to calculate these restitution liabilities and provisions relating to leased aircraft, determined on the basis of a short-term risk-free rate increased by a spread on risky debt (used for companies with high financial leverage), is 5.5% as of December/uni00A031, 2022 against 3.6% as of December/uni00A031, 2021 (see Note/uni00A012 'Net cost of financial debt and other financial income and expenses' and accounting policies in Note/uni00A04.2 'Main judgements and accounting estimates').\n\n## 31.1.2/emspace Restructuring  provisions\n\nThe movements in restructuring provisions with a significant impact on the income statement are booked in 'Other non-current income and expenses' (see Note/uni00A011 'Sales of aircraft equipment and other non-current income and expenses').\n\n## 31.1.3/emspace Litigation\n\nAn assessment of litigation risks with third parties has been carried out with the Group's attorneys and provisions have been recorded whenever circumstances require.\n\nProvisions for litigation with third parties also include provisions for tax risks. Such provisions are set up when the Group considers that the tax authorities, within the framework of tax audits, could\n\nreasonably challenge a tax position adopted by the Group or one of its subsidiaries.\n\nIn the normal course of its activities, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group, its subsidiaries Air/uni00A0France and KLM (and their subsidiaries) are involved in litigation cases, some of which may be significant.\n\n## 31.1.4/emspace Litigation concerning anti-trust laws in the air-freight industry\n\nAir/uni00A0France, KLM and Martinair, a wholly-owned subsidiary of KLM since January/uni00A01, 2009, have been involved, since February/uni00A02006, with up to twenty-five other airlines in investigations initiated by the antitrust authorities in several countries, with respect to allegations of anti-competitive agreements or concerted actions in the air freight industry.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2021, most of these investigations had been terminated following the entry into plea agreements between the three companies of the Group and the appropriate competition authorities, providing for the payment of settlement amounts or fines, with the exception of the proceedings initiated by the European Commission, and by the Swiss antitrust authority, which are still pending.\n\nIn Europe, the decision of the European Commission of 2010 against eleven air cargo carriers, including the companies of the Group, Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Martinair, was annulled by the General Court of the European Union on December/uni00A016, 2015 because it contained a contradiction regarding the exact scope of the practices sanctioned. On March/uni00A017, 2017, the European Commission issued a new decision against the aforementioned cargo carriers, including Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Martinair. The\n\ntotal amount of fines imposed in respect of this decision at the Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group level was \u20ac339/uni00A0million. This amount was slightly reduced by \u20ac15.4/uni00A0million as compared to the initial decision owing to a lower fine for Martinair due to technical reasons. On May/uni00A029 and 30, 2017, the Group companies filed an appeal against this decision before the General Court of the European Union. The hearings before the General Court took place on June and July/uni00A02019.\n\nDecision from the General Court in March/uni00A02022 confirmed the fines against Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM group companies. The Group companies appealed in June/uni00A02022 to the European Union Court of Justice, decision expected in 16-24/uni00A0months. The Group has maintained a provision covering the total amount of these fines.\n\nIn Switzerland, the Federal Administrative Court cancelled the decision of the Competition Authority that imposed a \u20ac4/uni00A0million fine for lack of competence. Consequently the \u20ac4million provision was cancelled as of December/uni00A031, 2022.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2022, the total amount of provisions in connection with proceedings, which have yet to give rise to definitive decisions amounts to \u20ac352/uni00A0million.",

In 2016 and 2018, the District Court and Court of Appeal ruled in favor of KLM and rejected all claims of plainti/ffs. In November/uni00A02019, however, the Supreme Court ruled against KLM on the basis of lack of su/fficient motivation and referred the case to another Court of appeal. On June/uni00A08, 2021, this Court of appeal rendered its judgment in favor of the plainti/ffs, the former Martinair pilots, ruling that the transfer of the cargo department qualifies as a transfer of undertaking.\n\nAccording to the ruling the rights and obligations under the employment contracts of 116/uni00A0Martinair pilots automatically transfer to KLM as per 1/uni00A0January/uni00A02014. The Court of Appeal rejected the plainti/ffs' claim to also transfer the rights regarding seniority accrued at Martinair.\n\nVrachtvliegers filed complaints on August/uni00A08, 2021 at the Supreme Court claiming that the rights regarding seniority accrued at Martinair should transfer to KLM. On June/uni00A024, 2022, the Attorney General has given the advice to the Supreme Court that the complaints should be rejected. The pilots started a new court case at the supreme court, because the court of appeal did not grand their Martinair seniority. On January/uni00A020, 2023, the supreme court ruled that this claim is denied.\n\nThe pilots also started a new court case about the implementation by KLM of the 'transfer of undertaking'.\n\nIn 2021, KLM had booked a provision for a total amount of \u20ac22/uni00A0million, unchanged in 2022.\n\n## 31.1.6/emspace Other  provisions\n\nOther provisions relate principally to provisions for onerous contracts, provisions for the portion of/uni00A0CO2 emissions not covered by the free allocation of quotas and provisions for the dismantling of buildings on non-freehold land.\n\n## 31.2/emspace Contingent  liabilities\n\nThe Group is involved in several governmental, judicial and arbitration procedures for which in most cases provisions have not been recorded in the financial statements in accordance with the applicable accounting rules. Indeed, with respect to most cases.\n\nThe Group is not in a position at this stage in these procedures, to give a reliable estimate of the potential loss that could be incurred in connection with these disputes.\n\n## 31.2.1/emspace Litigations concerning anti-trust laws in the air-freight industry\n\nFollowing the initiation of various investigations by the competition authorities in 2006 and the European Commission decision in 2010, several collective and individual actions were brought by forwarders and air-freight shippers in the civil courts against Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Martinair, and other cargo operators, in a number of jurisdictions.\n\nUnder these civil lawsuits, shippers and freight forwarders are claiming for damages to compensate alleged higher prices due to alleged competition law infringement.\n\nAlthough significant amounts have been reported by the media, plainti/ffs are mostly claiming for unspecified and/or insu/fficiently substantiated damages against defendants taken as a whole (and not individually) and the EU decision to which the plainti/ffs refer to is still not definitive.\n\nThe Group companies and the other airlines involved in these lawsuits continue to vigorously oppose all such civil claims. For Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Martinair the main civil claims still pending are those in the Netherlands and in Norway.",

The Paris Court of Appeals ruled on May/uni00A012, 2021, referring Airbus and Air/uni00A0France to the Criminal Court. Following the rejection by the Court of Cassation on August/uni00A026, 2021 of the appeal a criminal trial took place from October/uni00A010 th /uni00A0 to December/uni00A08 th /uni00A0 2022 at Criminal Court. Court decision is fixed for April/uni00A017 th /uni00A02023.\n\nAtlantic routes, for which they are claiming damages. Air/uni00A0France and KLM strongly deny any participation in such a conspiracy.\n\nAfter the courts dismissed that case in the US, the plainti/ffs have not taken any steps to move the case forward here since 2013. Based upon external counsel advice, this file is considered as closed now.\n\n## US Department of Justice investigation related to United States Postal Service\n\nIn March/uni00A02016, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) informed Air/uni00A0France and KLM of a civil inquiry regarding contracts with the United States Postal Service for the international transportation of mail by air. In September/uni00A02016, a Civil Information Demand from the DoJ has been received seeking certain information relating to these contracts. The DoJ has indicated it is investigating potential violations of the False Claims Act. Air/uni00A0France and KLM have settled the case with DoJ in July/uni00A02022 for an aggregate amount of $3.9/uni00A0million (\u20ac3.6/uni00A0million).",

Since this date, the interests rate applicable on the residual nominal amount has been reset at a fixed rate of 4% per annum.\n\nThe residual nominal amount of these perpetual notes can be redeemed at KLM's discretion on each fifth anniversary of the first interest payment date, August/uni00A028, 1999. The next option date for redemption at Par is thus August/uni00A028, 2024. Note that an indemnity is due if the JPY loan is redeemed in a currency other than the JPY.\n\nThis debt is subordinated to all other existing and future debt at KLM.\n\n## 32.1.2/emspace KLM perpetual subordinated debt in Swiss Francs\n\nThe perpetual subordinated bond debt in Swiss Francs (CHF) was issued by KLM in two tranches, one in 1985 and one in 1986. The initial nominal amount for these two perpetual bonds combined was CHF 500/uni00A0million.\n\nOver the years, KLM has proceeded with several partial buy back transactions to partially redeem the debt. As a result, the total amount now outstanding is CHF 375/uni00A0million, i.e. \u20ac381/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2022.\n\nConcerning the tranche issued in 1985, KLM is entitled to early redeem at Par the then-prevailing outstanding residual amount on each tenth anniversary of the interest payment date. The next 'call date' is February/uni00A012, 2025. The coupon reset date is fully aligned with the above mentioned frequency. If the call option is\n\nnot exercized, the next coupon reset date is February/uni00A012, 2025. The current outstanding coupon is 0.75% per annum.\n\nConcerning the tranche issued in 1986, the KLM Group is entitled to early redeem the outstanding residual nominal amount at Par on each fifth anniversary of the interest payment date. The next 'call date' is May/uni00A015, 2026. The call price amount in 2001 was 101.75% of the notional face value, and thereafter with a premium declining by 0.25% on each fifth anniversary of the interest payment date. From May/uni00A015, 2036, the amount of early redemption will thus be set at 100% of the residual Par. The debt is subject to the payment of a coupon of 5.75% per annum.\n\nThe two CHF perpetual bond debts are ranked 'pari passu' with the JPY perpetual loan debt and are subordinated to all other existing and future debt at KLM.",

Each bond has a nominal value of \u20ac17.92. The annual coupon amounts to 0.125%. The conversion period of these bonds runs from May/uni00A04, 2019 to the seventh working day preceding the normal or early reimbursement date. The conversion ratio is one share for one bond.\n\nRepayment at par, plus accrued interest, will be possible on March/uni00A025, 2024 at the request of the bond holders. Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM can enforce the cash reimbursement of these bonds by exercising a call option running from April/uni00A015, 2022 if the share price exceeds 130% of the nominal, i.e. \u20ac23.29, encouraging OCEANE bond holders to convert their bonds into Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM shares.\n\nUpon issue of these convertible bonds, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM recorded a debt of \u20ac446/uni00A0million, corresponding to the present value of\n\n## 32.2.2/emspace Plain vanilla bonds\n\n| Bond                                | Issuing   date      | Amount   issued   (in millions)   | Maturity date        | Reimbursement  date   | Coupon   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|----------|\n| \u20ac Bond issued in 2014               | June/uni00A04, 2014 | \u20ac289                              | June/uni00A018, 2021 | June/uni00A018, 2021  | 3.875%   |\n| \u20ac Bond issued in 2016               | Oct. 5, 2016        | \u20ac361                              | Oct. 12, 2022        | Oct. 12, 2022         | 3.75%    |\n| $ Bond issued in 2016/thinspace (1) | Dec. 9, 2016        | $145                              | Dec. 15, 2026        | -                     | 4.35%    |\n| \u20ac Bond issued in 2020               | Jan. 10, 2020       | \u20ac750                              | Jan. 16, 2025        | -                     | 1.875%   |\n| \u20ac Bond issued in 2021               | July/uni00A01, 2021 | \u20ac300                              | July/uni00A01, 2024  | -                     | 3.00%    |\n| \u20ac Bond issued in 2021               | July/uni00A01, 2021 | \u20ac500                              | July/uni00A01, 2026  | -                     | 3.875%   |\n\n- (1) Bonds issued to Asian institutional investors via an unlisted private placement.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfuture payments of interest and nominal discounted at the rate of a similar bond without a conversion option.

The loan had a coupon at an annual rate equal to EURIBOR (floored at zero) plus a margin of 0.75% in the first year, 1.50% in the second year and 2.75% in the third year. The cost of the French State guarantee initially equals 0.5% of the total amount of the loan and will step up to 1% for each of the second and third years.\n\nThe loan includes a mandatory partial early repayment of 75% of any net new money raised by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM or Air/uni00A0France from financial institutions or through debt capital markets, subject to some exceptions and a mandatory total early repayment notably in case of change of control of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM or Air/uni00A0France.\n\nOf this \u20ac4/uni00A0billion, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM group repaid \u20ac500/uni00A0million on December/uni00A010, 2021. Following this operation, the redemption profile of the outstanding balance (\u20ac3.5/uni00A0billion as of December/uni00A031, 2021) breaks down as follows:\n\n- -  May 2023: repayment of \u20ac800/uni00A0million,\n- -  May 2024: repayment of \u20ac1.35/uni00A0billion,\n- -  May 2025: final repayment of \u20ac1.35/uni00A0billion.\n\nAs of November/uni00A07, 2022, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group early repaid \u20ac1/uni00A0billion of the State guaranteed loan. Following this operation, the redemption profile of the outstanding balance (\u20ac2.5/uni00A0billion as of December/uni00A031, 2022) breaks down as follows:\n\n- -  May 2024: repayment of \u20ac1.15/uni00A0billion,\n- -  May 2025: final repayment of \u20ac1.35/uni00A0billion.\n\nThe loan has been recognized using the amortized cost method with an effective interest rate of 5.73% as of December/uni00A031, 2022 and 2.66% as of December/uni00A031, 2021 reflecting the changes in the interest rate market and over the redemption profile described above. The change of the e/ffective interest rate had no significant impact in the net cost of financial debt as of December/uni00A031, 2022;\n\n- > a subordinated shareholder loan of \u20ac3/uni00A0billion, granted by the French State to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, with a maturity of four years, with two consecutive one-year extension options exercisable by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM. This loan has a coupon payable annually or capitalizable at the discretion of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM at a rate equal to EURIBOR 12/uni00A0months (floored at zero) plus a margin of 7% for the first four years, 7.5% for the fifth year and 7.75% for the sixth year.\n\nThe rate for this Shareholder Loan should have increased by a 5.5% step up in case (i)/uni00A0the Shareholders' Meeting would not approve a capital increase proposed by the Board of Directors that would enable incorporation in the Company's shareholder equity of all or part of the outstanding Shareholder Loan, (ii)/uni00A0the Shareholders' Meeting would approve, without the approval from the French State, a capital increase which would not enable the incorporation of all or part the outstanding Shareholder Loan in the Company's shareholder equity or (iii)/uni00A0a third party, not acting in concert with the French State, would exceed, alone or in concert, the threshold of 20% of the capital of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM.\n\nThis loan is subordinated to the bank loan guaranteed by the French State and, in the event of receivership or liquidation, to all the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM senior bond and bank debt, without prejudice of an incorporation of all or part of the outstanding Shareholder Loan in the Company's shareholder equity.\n\nThe Company has undertaken not to pay dividends until these two loans have been repaid in full.\n\nThe European Commission approved the French State's aid mechanism on May/uni00A04, 2020.\n\nOn April/uni00A020, 2021, the \u20ac3/uni00A0billion direct loan granted by the French State to Air/uni00A0France via Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM at the end of May/uni00A02020, was converted into super subordinated notes of the same nominal amount, allowing the Group to improve its equity by \u20ac3/uni00A0billion without impacting cash flow, while increasing the flexibility of its debt repayment profile. This issue is made up of three tranches with perpetual maturities of a nominal amount of \u20ac1/uni00A0billion each, each with a first redemption option (call) at 4, 5 and 6/uni00A0years respectively.\n\n## Financial support package of \u20ac3.4/uni00A0billion backed by the Dutch State\n\nOn June/uni00A025, 2020, the Dutch State, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group and KLM have finalized an agreement on a financial support mechanism supported by the Dutch State for an amount of \u20ac3.4/uni00A0billion. This financial support package includes two loans for KLM and its subsidiaries:\n\n- > a revolving credit facility of \u20ac2.4/uni00A0billion, 90% guaranteed by the Dutch State and with a maturity of 5/uni00A0years. This revolving credit facility incurring interest at EURIBOR (floored at zero) plus a margin of 1.35%. The cost of the associated Dutch State guarantee equals 0.50% in year 1, 1.00% in year 2 and 3 and 2.00% after year 3;\n- > a direct loan of \u20ac1/uni00A0billion, granted by the Dutch State to KLM, with a maturity of 5.5/uni00A0years and incurring interest at EURIBOR 12/uni00A0months (floored at zero) plus a margin of 6.25% for year 1, 6.75% for year 2 and 3, and 7.75% for year 4 and 5.

It replaced the existing revolving credit facility drawn on March/uni00A019, 2020. KLM's first drawdown under the Dutch State loan, amounting to \u20ac277/uni00A0million, was made on the same day.\n\nThe main conditions associated with the direct State loan are linked to manageable cost improvements, the airline becoming more sustainable and the restored performance and competitiveness of KLM, including a comprehensive restructuring plan and contributions made by employees.\n\nKLM has undertaken to suspend dividend payments to its shareholders until these two loans have been repaid in full.\n\nThe European Commission approved the Dutch State Aid on July/uni00A013, 2020.

Market risk coordination and management is the responsibility of the Risk Management Committee (RMC) which is composed of the Chief Financial O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, and the Deputy Chief Financial O/fficer, head of Financial Operations of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, and the Chief Financial O/fficers of Air/uni00A0France and of KLM.\n\nThe RMC decides on the derivative instruments to be implemented, the targets for hedging ratios and the periods and instrument types.\n\nTo implement the strategy most appropriate to each circumstance, any type of instrument may be used provided it qualifies as hedging within IFRS. As a general rule, no trading or speculation is allowed. Any exception to this rule must be approved by the Risk Management Committee.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2022, the fair value of the Group's derivative financial assets and liabilities and their expected maturities are as follows:\n\n| (in \u20ac millions)                                       | Notes   |                 | Total   | Y+ 1   | Y+ 2   | Y+ 3   | Y+ 4   | Y+ 5   | > Y+ 5   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------|-----------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Fuel derivative   instruments                         | 37.1    | Asset           | 42      | 42     | -      | -      | -      | -      | -        |\n|                                                       |         | Liability       | (59)    | (59)   | -      | -      | -      | -      | -        |\n| Interest rate derivative                              | 37.2    | Asset           | 207     | 41     | 22     | 25     | 16     | 5      | 98       |\n| instruments                                           |         | Liability       | (1)     | -      | -      | -      | -      | -      | (1)      |\n| Currency exchange-debt                                | 37.3    | Asset           | 27      | 12     | 8      | 4      | 3      | -      | -        |\n| derivative instruments                                |         | Liability       | (2)     | (2)    | -      | -      | -      | -      | -        |\n| Currency exchange  -operating derivative  instruments | 37.3    | Asset           | 104     | 84     | 20     | -      | -      | -      | -        |\n| Currency exchange  -operating derivative  instruments |         | Liability       | (25)    | (9)    | (15)   | (1)    | -      | -      | -        |\n| Currency   exchange-Capex                             | 37.3    | Asset Liability | 150     | 89     | 60     | 1      | -      | -      | -        |\n| Carbon credit derivative                              |         |                 | (15)    | (11)   | (2)    | (2)    | -      | -      | -        |\n| instruments                                           | 37.4    | Asset           | 15      | 15     | -      | -      | -      | -      | -        |\n| instruments                                           |         | Liability       | (2)     | (2)    | -      | -      | -      | -      | -        |\n| Other derivative   instruments                        |         | Asset           | 44      | 44     | -      | -      | -      | -      | -        |\n| Other derivative   instruments                        |         | Liability       | -       | -      | -      | -      | -      | -      | -        |\n| Total                                                 |         | Liability       | (104)   | (83)   | (17)   | (3)    | -      | -      | (1)      |\n\nSee Note/uni00A038 'Valuation methods for financial assets and liabilities at their fair value' for the fair value valuation method.\n\n<!-- image -->",

A sharp increase in the oil price can have a very material negative impact on the profitability of airlines, particularly if the economic environment does not enable them to adjust their pricing strategies. Similarly, a sharp decline in fuel prices is favorable for airline profitability. However, the way in which airlines pass on a sharp fall in the fuel price in their fares is a factor of significant uncertainty.\n\nIn addition to fare adjustments and permanent e/fforts to reduce fuel consumption, the Group has implemented a policy of systematically hedging the fuel price risk.\n\nThe hedging strategy:\n\n- > sets the time span of the hedges;\n- > sets the target hedging ratios to be reached for the coming quarters;\n- > the hedging uses simple futures or option-based instruments, eligible for hedging pursuant to the accounting standards in force.\n\nIn respect of the application of IFRS/uni00A09, hedging by component is applied. Since the Group's fuel procurement is strongly correlated to the Jet Kerosene Cargoes CIF NWE Index, components specific to this fuel risk are used (Brent ICE, Gasoil ICE, Jet CIF NWE) to align the fuel hedging accounting and the Group's risk management policy more e/ffectively.\n\nIn a context of high volatility and tension in the commodity market due to the geopolitical events of 2022, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM group has incorporated new hedging instruments on crack spreads in order to better cover the risk associated with the decoupling between indices reflecting the price of crude oil (Brent ice) and indices reflecting the price of refined products (Gasoil ICE and Jet CIF NEW).\n\nHedging strategy, remains on a rolling 12/uni00A0months time span for 50% of the annual volume consumed.",

However, because of its international activities, the Group incurs a foreign exchange risk. The principal exposure relates to the US dollar. Since the expenditure on items such as fuel and components exceeds the amount of revenues in dollars, the Group is a net buyer of US dollars. As a result, any significant appreciation in the dollar against the euro could result in a negative impact on the Group's financial results.\n\nOn the other hand, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group is a net seller of other currencies, the level of revenues in these currencies exceeding its expenditure. This exposure is far less significant than with the US dollar. As a result, any significant decline in these currencies against the euro would have a negative e/ffect on the Group's financial results.\n\nThe management of the Group's exchange rate risk is carried out based on the forecasted net exposure for each currency. Currencies which are highly correlated to the US dollar are aggregated with the US dollar exposure.\n\nFor each currency hedged, the time span of the hedging is a rolling 12/uni00A0to 24-month period, the first four quarters having more hedging than the following four.\n\n## Interest rate sensitivity\n\nThe Group is exposed to the risk of interest rate variations. A 100/uni00A0basis point variation (increase or decrease) in interest rates would have an impact of \u20ac40/uni00A0million on the financial income for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2022 versus \u20ac40/uni00A0million for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2021.\n\nAircrafts are mostly paid for in US dollars, meaning that the Group is exposed to an appreciation in the dollar relative to the euro in terms of its investments in flight equipment. The hedging strategy provides for the implementation of a graduated level of hedging between the date aircrafts are ordered and their delivery.\n\nThe exchange rate risk on the Group's financial debt is limited. At December/uni00A031, 2022, 84% of the Group's financial debt, after taking into account derivative instruments, was euro-denominated, thereby significantly reducing the risk of currency fluctuation on the debt. The exchange rate risk on debt denominated in other currencies mostly concerns the Yen for 6%, the US dollar for 6% and the Swiss franc for 4% (see Note/uni00A032.6).\n\nSince the application of IFRS/uni00A016/uni00A0by the Group as of January/uni00A01, 2018, the aircraft operating leases, which are mostly denominated in US dollars, have been recognized in the Group's debt. This debt is recognized as hedge of future operating revenues in USD. For airlines not generating US dollar revenues, US dollar-denominated assets and currency hedges are in place to mitigate this exchange rate risk.\n\n<!-- image -->",

As such, it fully complies with regulatory measures to reduce carbon emissions (see Note/uni00A04.23). These include the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which has been in force at European level since 2012 for aviation. The European institutions have confirmed the intra-European scope of the EU-ETS, thus reinforcing CORSIA's future role in defining clearing solutions for international flights.\n\nThey have also programmed the gradual end of allowances allocated free of charge to air operators. From 2026 onwards, this new measure will require the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group to purchase emission rights (credits) for all its flights to and from the European Union (intra-European flights).\n\nTo minimize the consequences of the necessary strengthening of the European carbon market and the gradual increase in the price of credits, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is responding through a proactive financial policy based on the purchase of forward credits.",

Finally, the Group's fuel hedging policy has mitigated the high level with wide variations of oil prices.\n\nAs shown in Note/uni00A03.2/uni00A0to the consolidated financial statements, several recapitalization, refinancing and aid repayment operations were set up in the 2022 financial year.\n\nAs of 31/uni00A0December/uni00A02022, the Group's total liquidity amounted to \u20ac10.6/uni00A0billion.\n\nAs shown in Note/uni00A03.1/uni00A0to the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors approved the financial statements on the assumption of going concern.\n\nThe assumption is based on the recovery in activity with capacity forecast to be very close to 2019 levels in 2023, a dynamic pricing policy, the cash position at the end of December/uni00A02022 and the Group's ability to refinance.\n\nWe considered the assessment of going concern to be a key audit matter since it is based on management assumptions and judgments and presents an inherent risk from the determination of future cash flows, which are uncertain by nature, notably considering the current context of the Ukrainian crisis.\n\nWe considered the risk of liquidity and going concern resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukrainian crisis when planning and performing our audit.\n\nOur work included notably:\n\n- a) analyzing Management's risk assessment with regard to the Group's operations and financial resources as compared to our own understanding of the risks associated with the Covid-19 crisis and macro-economic situation;\n- b) understanding the procedures used to prepare the cash-flow forecasts;\n- c) performing a critical analysis of the main assumptions used in the preparation of the 12-month cash-flow forecasts derived from operations, investments and financing, based on our knowledge of the business, the macro-economic situation, the Group and of Management's intentions;\n- d) assessing the consistency of the business plan used to evaluate going concern with that used for impairment tests;\n- e) conducting interviews with Management about the status of the additional recapitalization and financing project designed to improve equity;\n- f) inquiring management on any other events or circumstances subsequent to December/uni00A031, 2022 that could call into question its forecasts;\n- g) assessing the appropriateness of the liquidity and going concern disclosures in Note/uni00A03.1/uni00A0of the consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Assets that cannot be directly linked to independent cash flows are grouped together into Cash Generating Units (CGU) to perform the impairment test. The Group concluded that the CGUs correspond to the Group's business segments - the network, Maintenance and Transavia activities.\n\nTheir value in use is determined based on particularly sensitive forward-looking assumptions, given the current context which is following the crisis related to the Covid-19 pandemic and which has uncertainty due to the Ukrainian crisis and the increasing impact of ESG considerations. These assumptions include the discounted cash flows derived from the 5-year budget figures prepared by Management and validated by the Board of Directors, the discount rate corresponding to the weighted average cost of capital, and the growth rates reflecting assumptions relating to mid- and long-term business development. Such cash flows reflect the Group's environmental objectives as well as the impacts related to expected or probable regulatory changes in terms of environment (modernization of the fleet, increase in the cost of carbon credits,/uni00A0CO2 compensation, development of sustainable aviation fuel 'SAF').\n\nAs indicated in Note/uni00A02.1/uni00A0to the consolidated financial statements, the Group's environmental objectives have not led to the recognition of any impairment or acceleration of depreciation on its assets.\n\nWe considered the valuation of those assets to be a key audit matter in light of their significant amount and of the high degree of judgment and estimates required by Management to determine their recoverable value.\n\nWe assessed the procedures and controls implemented by the Group to determine and review the useful lives of flight equipment assets and assessing their consistency with the Group's environmental objectives. Also, we assessed the procedures and controls implemented to identify indicators of impairment, and for the purpose of the impairment test, calculate the book value of non-current assets by CGU and determine their recoverable amount. We tested the key controls used by the Group in the design process of the assets' impairment test.\n\n## Our work also included:\n\n- a) assessing whether the methodology used by Management complies with current accounting standards (IAS/uni00A036), including validating the CGU independence and consistency criteria as well as the frequency of impairment tests;\n- b) reconciling the book value of the non-current assets of each CGU with the accounting balances and the corresponding allocation.\n- c) verifying (i)/uni00A0the cash-flow projections with the Management-approved 5-year plan, (ii)/uni00A0the intermediate period and perpetual growth rates, as well as (iii)/uni00A0profit margin rates used;\n- d) assessing the consistency of discount rate calculation assumptions such as risk-free rate, industry gearing, financing spread and specific risk premium;\n- e) assessing the consistency of the assumptions with the Group's environmental objectives and the impacts related to expected or probable regulatory changes in terms of environment;\n- f) assessing the sensitivity scenarios retained by Management by verifying arithmetic accuracy of sensitivity calculations based on WACC, perpetual growth rate and long-term profitability;\n- g) reviewing the calculation of the enterprise value performed by Management from Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's market capitalization to corroborate the impairment test based on value in use;\n\nWe also assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in Notes/uni00A02, 4.14, 4.15, 4.16, 17, 19 and 22/uni00A0to the consolidated financial statements.",

The amount comprises 346/uni00A0M\u20ac of deferred tax assets relating to tax loss carryforwards for the French tax consolidation group as presented in Note/uni00A013.4/uni00A0to the consolidated financial statements. These deferred tax assets are recognized based on their likelihood of recovery pursuant to the medium-term budgets and plans prepared by the Group. As presented in Note/uni00A013.1/uni00A0to the consolidated financial statements, the recovery period for these deferred tax assets of the French tax consolidation group is five years.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2022, unrecognized deferred tax assets relating to tax loss carryforwards of the French tax consolidation group amounts to 3.3/uni00A0billion \u20ac as presented in Note/uni00A013.5/uni00A0to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe identified deferred tax assets related to French tax loss carryforwards as a key audit matter given their significant amount and the high degree of judgments and estimates made by the Group to assess the validity of the related deferred tax assets recognized.\n\nOur procedures consisted in assessing the compliance of the Group's methodology with IAS 12 and assessing the likelihood of the Group making future use of the tax loss carryforwards generated to date by the French tax consolidation group, particularly with regards to:\n\n- a) deferred tax liabilities in the same tax jurisdiction, against which deferred tax assets related to tax loss carryforwards could be o/ffset and.\n- b) the French tax consolidation group's ability to generate future taxable profits in order to use prior-year tax losses recognized as deferred tax assets.\n\nWe assessed the appropriateness of the methodology adopted by the Group to identify existing tax loss carryforwards that will be utilized, either through deferred tax liabilities or future taxable profits.\n\nTo determine future taxable profits, we assessed the forecasting process by:\n\n- a) examining the procedure for preparing the latest taxable income forecasts used as a basis for estimates;\n- b) verifying tax regulations application.\n- c) comparing income forecasts for prior years with actual results;\n- d) verifying the consistency of the assumptions used by Management to prepare taxable income forecasts with those adopted for non-current assets impairment tests.\n\nWe also assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in Notes/uni00A04.25 and 13/uni00A0to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These rates are determined by the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group based on historical data taken from the information systems and adjusted for non - recurring and specific events that could impact passenger behavior.\n\nWe considered the recognition of deferred revenue on ticket sales to be a key audit matter due to the importance of the Group judgement in determining the recognition assumptions.\n\n## Specific Verifications\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations of the Group's information given in the management report of the Board of Directors.\n\nWe have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements.\n\nWe assessed the procedures and controls implemented by the Group to determine the statistical rates of 'Deferred revenue on ticket sales'.\n\nOur procedures primarily consisted in:\n\n- a) assessing the appropriateness of the methodology adopted by the Group.\n- b) corroborating the historical database with the databases used.\n- c) verifying the statistical rate calculation.\n- d) evaluating and analyzing the impact of the adjustments made for non-recurring and specific events related to the health crisis.\n- e) analyzing the age of deferred revenue on ticket sales presented in liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet to assess the appropriateness of the revenue recognized in the period.\n\nWe attest that the consolidated non-financial statement required by Article L./uni00A0225-102-1/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce), is included in the Group's information given in the management report, it being specified that, in accordance with the provisions of Article L./uni00A0823-10/uni00A0of this Code, we have verified neither the fair presentation nor the consistency with the consolidated financial statements of the information contained therein and this information must be reported by an Independent Third Party.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\n## Format of presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report\n\nWe have also verified, in accordance with the professional standard applicable in France relating to the procedures performed by the statutory auditor relating to the annual and consolidated financial statements presented in the European single electronic format, that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L./uni00A0451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code (code mon\u00e9taire et financier), prepared under the responsibility of Chief Executive O/fficer, complies with the single electronic format defined in the European Delegated Regulation N\u00b0/uni00A02019/815/uni00A0of 17/uni00A0December/uni00A02018. As it relates to consolidated financial statements, our work includes verifying that the tagging\n\nof these consolidated financial statements complies with the format defined in the above delegated regulation.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we conclude that the presentation of the consolidated financial statements intended to be included in the annual financial report complies, in all material respects, with the European single electronic format.\n\nDue to the technical limitations inherent in the macro-tagging of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the European single electronic format, it is possible that the content of certain tags in the notes to the financial statements may not be rendered identically to the consolidated financial statements attached to this report.\n\nWe have no responsibility to verify that the consolidated financial statements that will ultimately be included by your company in",

        "page_content": "the annual financial report filed with the AMF are in agreement with those on which we have performed our work.\n\n## Appointment of the Statutory Auditors\n\nWe were appointed as Statutory Auditors of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM/uni00A0S.A. by the Annual General Meetings held on September/uni00A025, 2002 for\n\nKPMG/uni00A0S.A. and on May/uni00A022, 2022 for PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit.\n\nAs at December/uni00A031, 2022, KPMG/uni00A0S.A. was in the 21 st /uni00A0year of total uninterrupted engagement and PricewaterhouseCoopers Audit was in the 1 st /uni00A0 year.\n\n## Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a\n\ngoing concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless it is expected to liquidate the Company or to cease operations.\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the financial reporting process and the e/ffectiveness of internal control and risks management systems and where applicable, its Internal Audit, regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Objectives and audit approach\n\nOur role is to issue a report on the consolidated financial statements. Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L./uni00A0823-10-1/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the a/ffairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- a) identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- b) obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ffectiveness of the internal control;\n- c) evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the consolidated financial statements;\n- d) assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n- e) evaluates the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation;\n\n<!-- image -->",

It is listed for trading in Paris (Euronext) and Amsterdam (Euronext).\n\n## 1./emspace Accounting policies and procedures\n\nGenerally accepted accounting policies have been applied, consistent with the prudence principle and in accordance with the legal and regulatory provisions applicable in France and to the base assumptions whose aim is to provide a true and faithful representation of the Company:\n\n- > going  concern;\n- > consistent accounting methods from year to year;\n- > independence of financial periods;\n\nand in accordance with the general rules for establishing and presenting annual financial statements.\n\nThe basic method used to value items recorded in the financial statements is the historical cost method.\n\n## Going concern\n\nIn order to determine an appropriate basis for preparing the consolidated financial information for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2022, the going concern assumption was assessed by evaluating the financial forecasts over a horizon of at least one year and by analyzing in particular the Group's business activity in the context of the decline in the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukrainian crisis.\n\nDuring 2022, the Group has returned to positive free cash-flow from operations, has repaid a large part of the aid received from the French and Dutch governments to deal with the Covid pandemic, and has maintained a high level of available cash to face the future.\n\nThus, after taking into account the uncertainties related to the current context and in particular the evolution of the price of oil impacted by the sanctions imposed on Russia, as well as the level of indebtedness of the Group, the Board of Directors has approved the financial statements for the year ending December/uni00A031, 2022 on a going concern basis, taking into account the improvement in the health situation since the end of 2021 the recovery in activity with capacity forecast in 2023 very close to be at 2019 levels, a dynamic pricing policy, the cash position at the end of December/uni00A02022 and the Group's ability to refinance.\n\n## Value in use of its equity investments\n\nIn the current context, the Company has paid particular attention to the value in use of its equity investments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The main accounting methods used are the following:\n\n## Long-term investments\n\nInvestments in equity securities are presented on the balance sheet at their acquisition cost net of impairment, if any. A provision for impairment is recorded as soon as the fair value, which corresponds to the value in use, falls below the acquisition value. The fair value of securities is determined by taking into account the share of shareholders' equity, the outlook for profitability and the stock market values that can be used as a reference.\n\nTransfer taxes, fees or commissions and legal fees related to the acquisition of securities are expensed, according to the option o/ffered by the regulations.\n\nTreasury shares not allocated to employees or to a capital decrease are booked in long-term investments.

        "page_content": "## 16./emspace Commitments\n\n## KLM shares\n\nDuring the business combination of the Air/uni00A0France and KLM groups, the Dutch government undertook to reduce its stake in KLM proportionally to any reduction by the French government of its stake in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's capital. To this end, the Dutch government had to sell its cumulative preferred shares to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM or to a Dutch foundation in the name of and on behalf of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, if the transfer had occurred during the first three years following the business combination.\n\nIn the latter case, the foundation would have issue, to the benefit of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, share certificates corresponding to the cumulative A preferred shares transferred to the foundation. These share certificates would have conferred to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM all of the economic rights attached to the said shares, the voting rights attached to the said shares being exercised by the foundation until Air/uni00A0France exchanges the share certificates against the said shares.\n\nAt the end of the initial three-year period, Air/uni00A0France-KM had the option to exchange the share certificates against the cumulative A preferred shares, which it could hold directly. As Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM decided in 2007 to maintain SAK I and SAK II foundations, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM did not carry out this exchange. Furthermore, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM can decide to dissolute the foundations at any time and at its sole discretion.\n\nMoreover, the Dutch government has the right to sell to Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM at any time as many cumulative A preferred shares as it wants.\n\nAfter the sale of 5,103,885/uni00A0shares to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM in April/uni00A02005 for \u20ac11.6/uni00A0million, the acquisition price of the 3,708,615/uni00A0cumulative A preferred shares still held by the Dutch government amounts to \u20ac8.4/uni00A0million (i.e. a unit price of \u20ac2.27/uni00A0per cumulative A preferred share, which has to be paid pro rata during any sale or transfer under the conditions above).\n\n## Hedges\n\nThe December/uni00A018, 2016, $145/uni00A0million bond is fully hedged by a cross currency swap. As of December/uni00A031, 2022, the fair value of this derivative instrument is \u20ac3/uni00A0million (see Note/uni00A012.2).\n\n## Other\n\nSince January/uni00A02009, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has acted as a guarantor for Air/uni00A0France Company within the framework of its commitments to A\u00e9roport de Paris in respect of civil leases. This guarantee has been renewed in July/uni00A02014 and more recently on 23/uni00A0September/uni00A02019 for a period of 5/uni00A0years. The guarantee is now expressly limited to \u20ac19/uni00A0million (and, cumulatively, at a maximum of 3/uni00A0months' rent per contract).\n\nAir/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM guarantees the payment by Transavia Holland to a lessor, of outstanding operational leases until 2024 for an amount of $104/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2022.\n\n## 17./emspace  Litigation\n\n## Litigation concerning anti-trust laws in the air-freight industry\n\nAir/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, as parent company of Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Martinair, is involved, since February/uni00A02006, with up to twenty-five other airlines in investigations initiated by the antitrust authorities in several countries, with respect to allegations of anti-competitive agreements or concerted actions in the air freight industry.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2021, most of these investigations had been terminated following the entry into plea agreements between the three companies of the Group and the appropriate competition authorities, providing for the payment of settlement amounts or fines, with the exception of the proceedings initiated by the European Commission, and by the Swiss antitrust authority, which are still pending.\n\nIn Europe, the decision of the European Commission of 2010 against eleven air cargo carriers, including the companies of the Group, Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Martinair, was annulled by the General Court of the European Union on December/uni00A016, 2015 because it contained a contradiction regarding the exact scope of the practices sanctioned. On March/uni00A017, 2017, the European Commission issued a new decision against the aforementioned cargo carriers, including Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Martinair. The total amount of fines imposed in respect of this decision at the Air/uni00A0 France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group level was \u20ac339/uni00A0million. This amount was slightly reduced by \u20ac15.4/uni00A0million as compared to the initial decision owing to a lower fine for Martinair due to technical reasons. On May/uni00A029 and 30, 2017, the Group companies filed an appeal against this decision before the General Court of the European Union. The hearings before the General Court took place on June and July/uni00A02019.\n\nDecision from the General Court in March/uni00A02022 confirmed the fines against Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM group companies. The Group companies appealed in June/uni00A02022 to the European Union Court of Justice, decision expected in 16-24/uni00A0months. The Group has maintained a provision covering the total amount of these fines.\n\nIn Switzerland, the Federal Administrative Court cancelled the decision of the Competition Authority that imposed a \u20ac4/uni00A0million fine for lack of competence. Consequently the \u20ac4million provision was cancelled as of December/uni00A031, 2022.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2022, the total amount of provisions in connection with proceedings, which have yet to give rise to definitive decisions amounts to \u20ac352/uni00A0million.\n\nThose provisions are booked by each airlines and do not have any impact in the financial statements of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM.",

For Air/uni00A0France, KLM and Martinair the main civil claims still pending are those in the Netherlands and in Norway.\n\nExcept for the matters specified under the paragraphs 17 and 18, the Company is not aware of any governmental, judicial and arbitration dispute or proceedings (including any proceedings of which the issuer is aware, or that are pending or threatened against it) that could have a significant impact on the Company's financial position, earnings, assets, liabilities or profitability, for a period covering at least the past twelve months.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 19./emspace Subsequent  events\n\nOn January/uni00A016, 2023, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has issued its first sustainability-linked bonds, for a nominal amount of \u20ac1.0bn, linked to the Company's target to reduce its well-to-wake scope/uni00A01 and 3/uni00A0jet fuel greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per revenue tonne kilometer (RTK) by 10% by 2025, compared to a 2019 baseline, as part of its 2030 SBTi approved objective.

The assumption is based on the improvement of the sanitary situation in 2022, the recovery in activity with capacity forecast to be very close to 2019 levels in 2023, a dynamic pricing policy, the cash position at the end of December/uni00A02022 and the Group's ability to refinance.\n\nWe considered the assessment of going concern to be a key audit matter since it is based on management assumptions and judgments and presents an inherent risk from the determination of future cash flows, which are uncertain by nature, particularly in the current context of the Ukrainian crisis.\n\n## Our response\n\nWe considered the risk of liquidity and going concern resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukrainian crisis when planning and performing our audit.\n\nOur work included notably:\n\n- a) analyzing Management's risk assessment with regard to the Group's operations and financial resources as compared to our own understanding of the risks associated with the Covid-19 crisis and macro-economic situation.\n- b) understanding the procedures used to prepare the cash-flow forecasts;\n- c) performing a critical analysis of the main assumptions used in the preparation of the 12-month cash-flow forecasts derived from operations, investments and financing, based on our knowledge of the business, the macro-economic situation, the Group and of Management's intentions;\n- d) assessing the consistency of the business plan used to evaluate going concern with that used for impairment tests;\n- e) inquiring management on any other events or circumstances subsequent to December/uni00A031, 2022 that could call into question its forecasts;\n- f) assessing the appropriateness of the liquidity and going concern disclosures in Note/uni00A01/uni00A0to the financial statements.",

Equity investments are recorded at their acquisition cost net of any impairment, based on their fair value taking into account their share of shareholders' equity, profitability outlook and reference stock market values.\n\nThe fair value estimate of these investments in subsidiaries requires Management to exercise judgment in its choice of items considered according to the nature of the investments concerned. Such items may correspond to historical items (shareholders' equity) or forecast items (profitability outlook and the economic environment in the countries considered).\n\nWe considered the determination of the fair value of equity investments and related receivables to be a key audit matter because of i) uncertainties inherent to certain assumptions and particularly the achievement of forecasts in the context of the Ukrainian crisis, and ii) the potential importance of a reversal or recognition of impairment of long-term investments in the Company's accounts.\n\n## Specific verifications\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations.\n\n## Information given in the management report and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to the Shareholders\n\nWe have no matters to report as to the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information given in the management report of the Board of Directors and in the other documents with respect to the financial position and the financial statements provided to Shareholders.\n\nWe attest the fair presentation and the consistency with the financial statements of the information relating to payment deadlines mentioned in Article D./uni00A0441-6/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce).\n\n## Our response\n\nTo assess the reasonableness of estimated fair values of equity investments, based on the information communicated to us, our procedures mainly consisted in verifying that the estimate of the values determined by Management were based on an appropriate justification of the valuation method and figures used, and according to the investments concerned:\n\n- a) For valuations based on historical items:\n- - verifying that the shareholders' equity used is consistent with the financial statements of the entities audited or subjected to analytical procedures and that any equity adjustments have been appropriately documented;\n- b) For valuations based on forecast items:\n- -  obtaining the profitability outlook for the entities concerned,\n- -  assessing the consistency of the assumptions adopted with the economic environment on the reporting dates,\n- -  comparing the forecasts adopted for prior periods with actual outcomes in order to assess the extent of achievement of past objectives,\n- - verifying that the value resulting from cash flow forecasts was adjusted for the debt of the entity considered,\n- -  verifying the arithmetical accuracy of the computed fair values.\n\nIn addition to assessing the realizable value of equity securities, our work also consisted in assessing the recoverability of the related receivables based on analyses of the equity investments.\n\n## Information relating to corporate governance\n\nWe attest that the Board of Directors' report on corporate governance sets out the information required by Articles L./uni00A0225-37-4, L22-10-10 and L./uni00A022-10-9/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code.\n\nConcerning the information given in accordance with the requirements of Article L./uni00A022-10-9/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) relating to remunerations and benefits received by or awarded to the Directors and any other commitments made in their favor, we have verified the consistency with the financial statements, or with the underlying information used to prepare these financial statements and, where applicable, with the information obtained by your company from controlled companies included in the scope of consolidation.

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L./uni00A0823-10-1/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the a/ffairs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- a) identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,  as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control;\n- b) obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ffectiveness of the internal control;\n- c) evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements;\n- d) assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit\n\nParis-La D\u00e9fense, February/uni00A021, 2023 KPMG S.A.\n\nThe statutory auditors\n\nFrench original signed by\n\nVal\u00e9rie Besson Partner\n\n\u00c9ric Dupr\u00e9\n\nPartner\n\nevidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein;\n\n- e) evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit to the Audit Committee a report which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6/uni00A0of Regulation (EU) N\u00b0/uni00A0537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L./uni00A0822-10/uni00A0to L./uni00A0822-14/uni00A0of the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and in the French Code of Ethics (code de d\u00e9ontologie) for Statutory Auditors.

The Board of Directors, meeting on June/uni00A015, July/uni00A028 and December/uni00A08, 2022, previously authorized the conclusion of the following three agreements involving, directly or indirectly, the French State, which held 28.6% of the Company's share capital on the date the agreements were entered into:\n\n- > on June/uni00A016, 2022, redemption by the Company of (i)/uni00A0the remaining NR4 Deeply Subordinated Notes and the related interest, i.e. 3,619/uni00A0securities, for an amount of \u20ac365,856,109.85 and (ii)/uni00A06,308/uni00A0NR5 Deeply Subordinated Notes and the related interest for an amount of \u20ac637,941,854.52;\n- > on July/uni00A029, 2022, redemption by the Company of (i)/uni00A0the remaining NR5 Deeply Subordinated Notes and the related interest, i.e. 3,692/uni00A0securities, for an amount of \u20ac376,533,419.60 and (ii)/uni00A01,179/uni00A0NR6 Deeply Subordinated Notes and the related interest for an amount of \u20ac120,322,497.41; and\n- > on December/uni00A09, 2022, redemption by the Company of 2,871/uni00A0NR6 Deeply Subordinated Notes and the related interest for an amount of \u20ac300,845,400.57 (the 'Redemption').\n\nIt was decided, in agreement with the French State Shareholdings Agency (Agence des Participations de l'\u00c9tat) (the 'APE'), to set the redemption price of the securities as the sum of the nominal amount and the value of the coupons accrued at the Redemption dates. This corresponds to:\n\n- > an additional cost compared to the aggregate nominal amount of \u20ac7.0/uni00A0million for the 6,381/uni00A0NR4 Deeply Subordinated Notes used by the APE to subscribe to the capital increase with preferential subscription rights;\n- > an additional cost compared to the aggregate nominal amount of \u20ac4.0/uni00A0million for the 3,619/uni00A0NR4 Super-Subordinated Notes, and an aggregate \u20ac7.1/uni00A0million for the 6,308/uni00A0NR5 Super-Subordinated Notes, redeemed following receipt of the funds from the capital increase with preferential subscription rights;\n- > an additional cost compared to the aggregate nominal amount of \u20ac7.3/uni00A0million for the 3,692/uni00A0NR5;\n- > Deeply Subordinated Notes and an aggregate \u20ac2.4/uni00A0million for the 1,179/uni00A0NR6 Deeply Subordinated Notes, redeemed following Apollo's subscription to the securities issued by AFI Spare Engine Management/uni00A0SAS, a subsidiary of the Company;\n- > an additional cost compared to the aggregate nominal amount of \u20ac13.7/uni00A0million of the 2,871/uni00A0NR6 Super-subordinated Notes redeemed following a bond issue in November/uni00A02022.\n\n## Reasons why the agreement is beneficial for the Company\n\nThe Board of Directors considered that the redemptions were carried out in order to allow the Company to partially redeem the Undated Deeply Subordinated Notes issued by the Company on April/uni00A020, 2021 for a total amount of \u20ac3/uni00A0billion and fully subscribed by the French State, by way of setting of receivables that it held against the Company under the shareholder's current account agreement of May/uni00A06, 2020, between the French State and the Company.

The funds to make this early repayment came from the proceeds of the June/uni00A024, 2021 bond issues,\n- -  \u20ac800/uni00A0million as at May/uni00A06, 2023,\n- -  \u20ac1.35/uni00A0billion as at May/uni00A06, 2024, and\n- -  \u20ac1.35/uni00A0billion as at May/uni00A06, 2025;\n\n- > interest rate of the French State-backed loan: 3-month Euribor (with a floor at zero) with an annual margin of between 0.75% and 2.75%, it being specified that this margin will now apply according to the following schedule 1.50% from May/uni00A06, 2021 (inclusive) to May/uni00A06, 2022 (exclusive) and 2.75% from May/uni00A06, 2022;\n- > guarantee commission to be applied according to the following schedule: 1.0% from May/uni00A06, 2021 (inclusive) to May/uni00A06, 2023 (exclusive) and 2.0% from May/uni00A06, 2023. Until May/uni00A06, 2023 (exclusive), it will be calculated on the basis of the initial amount of \u20ac4/uni00A0billion. Thereafter, the calculation basis will be reduced by the above-mentioned repayments.\n\nMandatory repayment clauses ('Mandatory Prepayments') are provided for in the agreement, in particular in the case of debt issues resulting from capital market transactions on the bond market, up to a limit of 75% of the amounts raised, excluding hybrid instruments, convertible bonds or quasi-equity repayments to be made under bond and convertible bonds existing on the date of signature of the Amendment and whose maturity falls during the term of the French State-backed loan as extended.\n\nIt should be specified that, following the prepayment of \u20ac1/uni00A0billion on November/uni00A07, 2022, the total outstanding amount of the French State-backed loan was reduced to \u20ac2.5/uni00A0billion, with the following repayment profile:\n\n- > May 2024: partial repayment of \u20ac1.15/uni00A0billion, leaving an outstanding amount of \u20ac1.35/uni00A0billion;\n- > May 2025: final repayment of \u20ac1.35/uni00A0billion (there will be no outstanding debt after this date).\n\nThe investment expenses incurred by the Company in respect of the French State-backed loan amounted to \u20ac125/uni00A0million in 2022.\n\n## Framework Agreement between the Company, KLM and the Dutch State\n\n## Persons concerned\n\n- > the Dutch State, shareholder owning more than 10% of the voting rights;\n- > Dirk van den Berg, director appointed by the Annual General Shareholders' Meeting as proposed by the Dutch State; and\n- > Cees't Hart and Benjamin Smith, directors of both the Company and KLM.\n\n## Nature, purpose and conditions\n\nOn August/uni00A07, 2020, the Company entered into a Framework Agreement with KLM and the Dutch State, which holds 14% of the Company's share capital, within the framework of the financial support plan granted by the Dutch State to KLM, a subsidiary of the Company, in order to enable KLM to meet its emergency liquidity need following the Covid-19 pandemic crisis and to prepare for the future.\n\nThis financing, previously authorized on June/uni00A025, 2020 by the Company's Board of Directors, for a total amount of \u20ac3.4/uni00A0billion, was structured as follows:\n\n- > a \u20ac2.4/uni00A0billion revolving credit facility, granted to KLM by 11/uni00A0banks and 90% guaranteed by the Dutch State; and\n\n<!-- image -->",

KLM also undertook to suspend the payment of dividends to its shareholders until the two loans had been repaid in full.\n\nDuring the first half of 2022, KLM repaid the amounts made available under the revolving credit facility (\u20ac665/uni00A0million) and the subordinated loan (\u20ac277/uni00A0million), but the Framework Agreement was not terminated.\n\nAmendment to the financial settlement terms for the joint-ventures entered into with (i)/uni00A0 Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. and (ii)/uni00A0China Eastern Airlines Co.

In this respect, each party waives and agrees to permanently waive any rights it may have with respect to amounts due to it under the joint-venture agreement for 2020. The term of this waiver was extended to 2021 and 2022 by mutual agreement between the parties, due to the duration of the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on the joint-venture's operations; and\n- 2) the suspension of the financial conditions relating to the settlement (a financial mechanism to allocate the revenues generated by the joint-venture) provided for in the joint-venture agreement entered into with China Eastern Airlines Co. Ltd. on November/uni00A026, 2018.\n\nIn this context, each party agrees to waive all payments under the joint-venture agreement, as of February/uni00A01, 2020 and for a\n\nperiod to be mutually agreed between the parties depending on the duration of the e/ffects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the joint-venture.\n\nThis waiver was decided in order to avoid uncertain and potentially significant financial exposure for all partners, given the context of the health crisis. It continued to be implemented in 2022.\n\nGiven the amendment of the financial conditions relating to the settlement in the joint-venture agreements, it was not necessary to calculate the impact that would have resulted from the application of these conditions.\n\n## Transatlantic partnership between the Company, Delta Air Lines,/uni00A0Inc. and Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd.\n\n## Persons concerned\n\n- > Delta Air Lines/uni00A0Inc.

If a unanimous decision cannot be reached by the three Board directors in the Board of Directors for each of the Dutch Foundations, no resolution may be passed by the Board of the relevant Foundation, which consequently cannot then vote on the relevant resolutions in the KLM Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nAmongst the three Board directors for each of the foundations, one member is appointed by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, one by KLM and the third, acting in the capacity of Chair of the Foundation, is appointed by the first two directors, it being specified that the majority of the members of the Boards of Directors of each Foundation, including the Chair, must be Dutch residents.\n\n## Unilateral termination option for Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM at any time\n\nInitially incorporated in 2004 for a three-year period, the two SAK I and SAK II foundations were however extended for an unlimited period by a 2007 agreement. Nevertheless, this agreement provides that Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM may, at any time as of May/uni00A06, 2007 and at its sole discretion, terminate this administered shareholding structure for KLM shares through SAK I and SAK II and proceed to regroup the economic and voting rights attached to the KLM shares, thereby holding 93.84% of KLM's voting rights.\n\n## 6.3.2/emspace Agreements with the Dutch State\n\nTo enable the completion of the business combination and safeguard KLM's tra/ffic rights, airline status and the scale of its network and operations at Schiphol, Air/uni00A0France and KLM entered into the following agreements with the Dutch State.\n\n## Agreement for the acquisition of cumulative preference A shares held by the Dutch State\n\nOn October/uni00A016, 2003, Air/uni00A0France, KLM and the Dutch State signed an agreement pursuant to which the Dutch State agreed to decrease its interest in KLM proportionately to any reduction by the French State of its stake in Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM. To this end, the Dutch State will sell its cumulative preferential A shares to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM or to SAK I on behalf of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM\n\nas long as this foundation is maintained. In such case, SAK I will issue share certificates to the benefit of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM corresponding to the cumulative preferential A shares transferred to SAK I. These share certificates confer to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM the economic right attached to the transferred cumulative preferential A shares, i.e. a right to a dividend, the corresponding voting rights being exercised by SAK I until the share certificates have been exchanged by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM against the said shares.\n\nIn March/uni00A02005, pursuant to the agreement, 5,103,885/uni00A0cumulative preference A shares were transferred by the Dutch State to SAK I on behalf of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM, which received, in return, SAK I share certificates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6",

Having decided, in 2007, to maintain the SAK I and SAK II foundations, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM did not proceed with this exchange but could still do so at any time, in whole or in part. In addition, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM is free to decide to dissolve the foundations at any time and at its sole discretion.\n\nFurthermore, the Dutch State benefits from the right to transfer, at any time, as many cumulative preferential A shares as it wishes to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM.\n\nThese agreements relating to the cumulative preferential A shares remain in force.\n\n## Option for the Dutch State to subscribe for preferential KLM B shares\n\nThis option granted to the Dutch State lapsed in May/uni00A02010.\n\n## Assurances given to the Dutch State\n\n## Nature and duration of the assurance\n\n## -Unilateral termination option\n\nWithin the framework of the 2004 business combination, Air/uni00A0 France and KLM granted the Dutch State, for an initial eight-year period starting from the completion of the business combination (i.e. expiring in 2012), various assurances as to KLM's airline status, its air services and the scale of its passenger and cargo operations at Schiphol airport with a view to maintaining the quality of KLM's network at Schiphol which, according to the Dutch State, is of public interest, while at the same time taking into account the interests of the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group and its shareholders (the 'Assurances').\n\nIn return for these Assurances, the Dutch State undertook to take the importance of KLM's activities at Schiphol into consideration when defining its civil aviation policy. Furthermore, the Dutch State agreed to:\n\n- > maintain the existing portfolio of tra/ffic rights granted to KLM, other than those that have not been used by KLM over a cumulative period of twelve months;\n- > continue to review any future request submitted by KLM for the allocation of new tra/ffic rights on a fair and non-discriminatory basis.\n\nPursuant to an agreement entered into on May/uni00A025, 2010, the Dutch State, Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and KLM agreed to extend the Assurances given to the Dutch State, with the exclusion, however, of an assurance foreseeing that the combined growth should not\n\nnegatively impact KLM's operations in the passenger and cargo segment, beyond May/uni00A05, 2012 for an indefinite period, subject to Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM's right to terminate these Assurances, at its sole discretion, with prior notice of nine months. This agreement was confirmed by a meeting between, inter alia, the Minister for Transportation of the Netherlands, the Chairman and Chief Executive O/fficer of Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM and the President of the Management Board of KLM which took place on March/uni00A012, 2015.\n\n## Mechanism to ensure compliance with the Assurances\n\nAir/uni00A0France and KLM set up a Dutch foundation, known as the KLM Assurances Foundation (Stichting Assurances KLM - duration extended in 2010) to facilitate the provision of binding advice (bindend advise) on the interpretation of the Assurances granted to the Dutch State (the 'Advice'). These advices are issued by a KLM Assurances Foundation Committee in the event that a decision taken by the KLM Supervisory Board, KLM Management Board or Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors is considered to be in conflict with the Assurances given to the Dutch State.\n\nWhen giving its Advice, the KLM Assurances Foundation must act in the best interests of KLM, the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group and its shareholders.\n\nThe Committee is composed of three members:\n\n- > one member appointed by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM;\n- > one member appointed by the Dutch State; and\n- > one member jointly appointed by the first two members as well as by a Board member of the KLM Assurances Foundation appointed by KLM who is not a Committee member; it being specified that the member appointed by Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM has a double voting right for the appointment of the third Committee member.\n\nThe filing of a case with the Foundation's Committee relating to a decision taken by the KLM Supervisory Board, the KLM Management Board or the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors can be made by the Dutch State only in relation to the Assurances given to it.\n\nIf the KLM Assurances Foundation Committee issues an Advice indicating that the decision submitted to it contravenes the Assurances given to the Dutch State, the KLM Supervisory Board, the KLM Management Board or the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Board of Directors will be required to cancel or amend its decision as soon as possible and nullify the e/ffects of any measure taken in connection with the said decision, in accordance with the issued Advice. The Committee's decisions are adopted by majority vote of its members.\n\nAs at December/uni00A031, 2022, no Advice had been rendered by the KLM Assurances Foundation Committee.\n\n## 6.3.3/emspace Assurances given to KLM\n\nThe assurances granted to KLM have been null and void since May/uni00A06, 2009.",

A fourth treaty, the Rome Convention (1952), covers damage caused to third parties on the ground.\n\n## Freedoms of the air\n\nUnder a bilateral treaty, an air carrier has freedoms that allow it to operate in the air space and the territory of a State other than its State of origin. These eight freedoms are as follows:\n\n- > 1 st /uni00A0f reedom - A carrier that leaves from its State of origin has the right to overfly the air space of a foreign State;\n- > 2 nd /uni00A0 freedom - A carrier that leaves from its State of origin has the right to make a technical layover without unloading or loading passengers in a foreign State. This freedom is the 'transit right';\n- > 3 rd /uni00A0 freedom - A carrier that leaves from its State of origin has the right to unload passengers from its State of origin in a foreign State;\n- > 4 th /uni00A0freedom - A carrier that leaves from a foreign State has the right to load passengers in this foreign State and unload them in its State of origin;\n- > 5 th /uni00A0f reedom - A carrier that leaves from its State of origin has the right to unload and load passengers in two successive foreign States;\n- > 6 th /uni00A0freedom - A carrier that leaves from a foreign State has the right to load passengers in that State and unload them in its State of origin, then in another foreign State;\n- > 7 th /uni00A0freedom - A carrier that leaves from a foreign State has the right to load passengers in that State to unload them in another foreign State, without going through its State of origin;\n- > 8 th /uni00A0 freedom - A carrier that leaves from its State of origin has the right to load passengers in a foreign State, to unload them in another city in this same foreign State.\n\n## The Chicago Convention (1944)\n\nThe Convention relating to international civil aviation, known as the Chicago Convention, sets out the legal, regulatory and technical rules governing commercial aviation and its Member State signatories are required to implement a common legal framework governing their domestic air space and their relations with one another.\n\nSigned on December/uni00A07, 1944, the Chicago Convention established the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) as the instrument of cooperation between the 193/uni00A0signatory States in all areas of civil aviation.\n\n## The Montreal Convention (1999)\n\nThe Montreal Convention of May/uni00A01999, ratified to date by 136/uni00A0 States, aims to provide better protection for passengers suffering damages. This convention entered into force on June/uni00A028, 2004. It is based on several fundamental provisions, notably the principle of the unlimited liability of air transport companies in the event of physical injury with the implementation of a two-tier system:\n\n- > a first tier that sets an objective liability for the air transport company of up to 128,821/uni00A0Special Drawing Rights (SDR);\n- > a second tier, based on a presumption of fault for the air transport company, for which the airline may be exempt if it proves that it or its agents or o/fficials have not been negligent in any way or that the damages result exclusively from the acts of a third party.\n\n## The Rome Convention (1952)\n\nThe Rome Convention, signed in 1952, covers damages caused to third parties on the ground by foreign aircraft. This convention has not been ratified by France, the Netherlands or the United States. The ICAO's legal commission is currently involved in a major initiative to redraft the wording which would facilitate its ratification by making a distinction between everyday risk and terrorist risk.\n\nThe Convention intended to replace the Rome Convention, relating to compensation for damage caused to third parties following acts of unlawful interference with aircraft, signed in Montreal on May/uni00A02, 2009 by thirteen States, for the most part African, is still not applicable. It has only been ratified by three of the 35/uni00A0States required for its entry into force.\n\n6",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n6\n\n## The Tokyo Convention (1963)\n\nThe Tokyo Convention, in force since December/uni00A04, 1969, sets out the principles and establishes the procedures for handling o/ffences against penal law (except those of a political nature and based on racial or religious discrimination) and acts endangering the safety of the aircraft or that of the persons and property on board.\n\nOne of the specific characteristics of this Tokyo Convention is that it recognizes certain powers and immunities of aircraft commanders, exonerating them, under certain conditions, from responsibility for any harm potentially caused to individuals committing such unlawful acts.\n\nThe Tokyo Convention (ratified by France in 1970) is currently the subject of a revision process within the ICAO.\n\n## 6.4.2/emspace European  legislation\n\n## Single European air space\n\nWithin the European Union, these eight freedoms have been supplemented, since April/uni00A01, 1997, by common legislation that creates a homogeneous regulatory situation for all European carriers. All European airlines may freely operate and, in particular, perform cabotage operations within a single European air space. Furthermore, any resident of an EU Member State may hold a stake in the shares of any EU-registered airline, without limit, provided that the shareholder is not acting as a front for a beneficial owner who is not a citizen of an EU Member State. The existence of this legislation eliminates the need for bilateral agreements between EU Member States and does not prevent them from participating in the ICAO, nor does it conflict with the principles and regulations of the Chicago Convention.\n\n## Open Skies agreements between Europe and third-party countries\n\nBased on mandates issued by the Council of Ministers, the European Union and its Member States have signed air transport agreements with the following third-party countries:\n\n- > United States : the agreement signed in April/uni00A02007 was amended by a protocol of June/uni00A02010 enabling, notably, European airlines to operate an unlimited number of flights, aircraft and routes to the United States from any European airport with the freedom to set prices, and to operate their services within the framework of cooperation agreements with partners of their choice. This agreement does not change the US rules on ownership and control and, similarly, cabotage remains forbidden;\n- > Canada : the agreement signed in December/uni00A02009 o/ffers EC carriers similar opportunities to those figuring in the agreement with the United States and also includes the same restrictions;\n\nA Protocol to amend the Tokyo Convention was adopted in Montreal on April/uni00A04, 2014. It gathered the minimum of 22/uni00A0 ratifications required for its entry into force and is thus applicable in the States having ratified it. It was ratified by France at the beginning of 2021.\n\nThe Montreal Protocol expands the jurisdiction by recognizing, under certain conditions, the jurisdiction of the State of Landing and the State of the Operator over o/ffences and acts committed on board aircraft. The establishment of such jurisdiction over o/ffences is mandatory if the criteria stipulated in the Protocol are respected. Furthermore, the Protocol grants legal recognition and some protections to in-flight security o/fficers. It also contains provisions covering matters such as intra-State coordination, due process of law and fair treatment.\n\n- > European Union neighboring countries : the agreement signed with Morocco in December/uni00A02006 was the first in a series of agreements signed with European Union neighboring countries: Georgia and Jordan in December/uni00A02010, Moldavia in June/uni00A02012 and Israel in June/uni00A02013. These agreements foresee the liberalization of bilateral air relations subject to the relevant countries adopting the EU aviation-related acquis;\n- > Balkan States (Albania, Bosnia, Macedonia, UNMIK, Montenegro, Serbia) : the agreement signed in June/uni00A02006 aims to create a common air space. At the end of transition periods that vary by country, the Balkan airlines will benefit in Europe from the same tra/ffic rights as EC airlines. At this stage, only the 3 rd /uni00A0and 4 th /uni00A0freedom rights have been liberalized;\n- > Qatar : the agreement signed in November/uni00A02021 aims, by 2024 and at the end of transition periods that vary by country, to liberalize access to the EC market for Qatari carriers, in return for provisions aimed at guaranteeing the financial transparency of the relevant air carriers and establishing a fair competition framework. At this stage only the 3 rd /uni00A0 and 4 th /uni00A0freedom rights have been liberalized;\n- > ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) : the agreement signed in October/uni00A02022 is the world's first block-to-block agreement to allow ASEAN and EU airlines to operate an unlimited number of flights between the two regions. In addition, airlines from each country in one block will be allowed to o/ffer up to seven weekly passenger services and an unlimited number of cargo services to each country in the other block under fifth freedom tra/ffic rights, via any third country or to any third country beyond. Note that Malaysia has a derogatory regime postponing the application of the agreement as far as it is concerned.",

        "page_content": "In April/uni00A02002, the European Union also signed an air transport agreement with Switzerland giving Swiss carriers, which are assimilated with EU carriers, access to all the intra-Community rights with the exception of cabotage.\n\nAccess to the market between France and States other than those mentioned above for which there are existing agreements at European Community level remains governed by bilateral aviation agreements signed between France and these third-party States.\n\n## Community air transport policy\n\nThe regulation applicable to air transportation within the European Union is primarily of European Community origin. The aims as outlined in the work programs of the European Commission are to reinforce the competitiveness of European Community airlines while insisting on the need to reduce the air transport industry's environmental impact and offer a high degree of passenger protection/thinspace (1) . The principal positive measures consist of establishing a legal framework favoring fairer competition between EU and third-party carriers, the e/ffective implementation of the Single European Sky and a commitment to developing biofuels. The European Commission also proposed a series of measures known as the 'Better Airports' package, aimed at reducing the cost of infrastructure use within the European Union. The latter initiatives have only come to very partial fruition due to persistent disagreements within the European institutions. A new European Commission Aviation Strategy was published on December/uni00A07, 2015 but the concrete consequences of the proposed measures remain to be evaluated. This strategy should notably be reflected in the adoption of a new EC commercial defense instrument aimed at protecting European airlines against competition from subsidized air carriers from third-party countries.\n\n## Management of airport time slots within the context of the pandemic\n\nThe regulation concerning the allocation of time slots at European Union airports sets the minimum threshold for slot use at 80%, failing which the airline loses the historic right to utilize these slots. Within the framework of the emergence of Covid-19, the European Commission obtained, by means of a delegated act by Member States, the option to define extraordinary thresholds. For the Summer 2021 Season, the threshold had been set at 50% and was maintained at this level for the 2021/22/uni00A0Winter season.\n\nFor the 2022 Winter season, the EU Parliament and Council had opted for a gradual return to higher thresholds. Thus, on October/uni00A017, 2022, it was agreed that the minimum slot utilization rate would be set at 75% for the Winter 2022-2023 season. A return to 80% is planned for the summer 2023 season, unless the Commission adopts a delegated act in the event that a new crisis causes further disruption to air tra/ffic.\n\n## European Green Deal and 'Fit For 55' legislative package\n\nOn July/uni00A014, 2021, the European Commission presented a package of 15/uni00A0draft legislative proposals aimed at reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030. These draft proposals include four which directly impact the aviation sector:\n\n- > REFUELEU aims to set a mandatory minimum percentage of sustainable aviation fuel for flights on departure from all EU airports;\n- > The revised EU-ETS Directive is targeting the phasing out of free quotas for airlines in the EU Carbon Market;\n- > The Energy Tax Directive aims to implement a tax on fuel, and the removal of the current exemption for aviation;\n- > The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism is targeting the introduction of a Carbon Tari/ff on imported goods and services, and envisages its extension to airline operations over the medium term.\n\nAll these legislative proposals will continue to be debated at the European level during 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6\n\n6",

A European Regulation covers access to most so-called coordinated European airports (London, Paris, Frankfurt, Milan, Madrid, Amsterdam,/uni00A0etc.). Elsewhere in the world, the allocation of slots is generally done on the basis of recommendations issued by IATA in a Worldwide Slot Guidelines reference document. Countries nonetheless retain sovereignty for defining the modalities of slot allocation and may apply rules that di/ffer slightly from the IATA recommendations (e.g. China, Japan, United States, Dubai,/uni00A0etc.).\n\nFor airports within the European Union, each Member State with coordinated airports under its responsibility, after consulting the airlines that regularly use the airports concerned, their representative organizations and the airport authorities, must designate a coordinator or an entity to be responsible for the allocation of slots and the monitoring of their use. Such individuals or entities must have specialized knowledge of coordinating aircraft routes for air transport companies.\n\nSlots are allotted twice a year by the designated airport coordinator, at the same time as the airline flight schedules for the relevant IATA season.\n\nThe allocation procedure is as follows:\n\n- > airlines file their slot applications with the coordinator five months prior to the beginning of each season;\n- > the coordinator first allocates slots to airlines that already had slots the previous season (known as grandfather rights) for past operations;\n- > a pool is then created that regroups, for each coordination period, all the available slots, whether they are newly created, unused, abandoned by a carrier or have become available for any other reason;\n- > finally, the coordinator allocates half of the pooled slots to newcomers and the other half to the other operators.\n\nSince slots are first allocated to existing long-standing operators, and given the expansion plans of all the airlines, requests for new slots are rarely satisfied at saturated airports.\n\nAt the end of this preliminary allocation (pre-coordination) process, a conference attended by virtually all airport coordinators and airlines is organized in order to enable the airlines to:\n\n- > simultaneously coordinate the slots they are allocated on di/fferent airports so that when they operate flights between\n\ntwo coordinated airports they are granted compatible slots by each of them; and\n\n- > exchange slots among themselves in the event that the slots originally allocated by the airport coordinators are unsatisfactory.\n\nWithin the framework of the public health crisis linked to Covid-19, Regulation No.95/93/uni00A0was amended for the period from March/uni00A01, 2020 to October/uni00A024, 2020 to enable slots allocated for this period to be considered as having been operated by the air carrier to which they were initially granted. On October/uni00A014, 2020, in view of the continuing public health crisis and the weak demand for air transportation in the coming months, the European Commission decided to extend this exception from the requirement to the whole Winter scheduling season, i.e. until March/uni00A027, 2021. A further amendment to the Regulation enabling the easing of the conditions relating to the operation of slots and covering a period extending until the IATA Summer 2022 Season was adopted on February/uni00A016, 2021 (see also paragraph 3.1.2.3 'Loss of flight slots or lack of access to flight slots').\n\n## Reinforcement of passenger compensation rights\n\nSee section/uni00A03.1.2.4.\n\n## Framework for State Aid within the context of the public health crisis\n\nIn March/uni00A02020, the European Commission adopted a Temporary Framework to enable Member States to use the full flexibility foreseen under State Aid rules to support the economy and companies facing the consequences of the public health crisis. Recapitalization measures for companies by Member States were authorized within this framework until June/uni00A030, 2022. The implementation of measures to reinforce the Air/uni00A0France/thinspace-/thinspaceKLM Group's liquidity (consisting of the guarantee by the State of a \u20ac4/uni00A0billion bank loan (PGE) and a \u20ac3/uni00A0billion loan from the French State, together with the guarantee by the Dutch State of a \u20ac2.4/uni00A0billion revolving credit facility and a \u20ac1/uni00A0billion loan from the Dutch State) was submitted for prior approval to the European Commission pursuant to the rules on State Aid, applying the aforementioned Temporary Framework. Similarly, the capital-strengthening measures in which the French State participated during 2021 (\u20ac593/uni00A0million of shares subscribed during the capital increase and subscription to \u20ac3/uni00A0billion of Deeply Subordinated Notes) were the subject of prior approval by the European Commission on April/uni00A04, 2021.",

Codesharing may take two forms. In the first case, the two airlines purchase and sell seats to and from each other at an agreed price. The airline which has purchased the seats then markets them under its brand and at its fares. In the second case, under the system known as free flow, the two airlines are allowed to sell all the seats on the flights involved. Each airline retains the revenues generated on the flight it operates and remunerates the other airline for the number of seats the latter has sold on its aircraft.\n\n## = Combi\n\nAircraft whose main deck is equipped for the transportation of both passengers and cargo.
