Forward-looking statements are not statements of historical fact and may contain the terms 'may', 'will', 'should', 'continue', 'aims', 'estimates', 'projects', 'believes', 'intends', 'expects', 'plans', 'seeks' or 'anticipates', or words of similar meaning. Such statements are based on Management's current views and assumptions and, by nature, involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties; therefore, undue reliance should not be placed on them. Actual financial condition, results of operations, performance or events may di/ff er materially from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements, due to a number of factors including, without limitation, general economic and political conditions and competitive situation; future financial market performance and conditions, including fluctuations in exchange and interest rates; frequency and severity of insured loss events, and increases in loss expenses; mortality and morbidity levels and trends; persistency levels; changes in laws, regulations and standards; the impact of acquisitions and disposal, including related integration issues, and reorganization measures; and general competitive factors, in each case on a local, regional, national and/or global basis. Many of these factors may be more likely to occur, or more pronounced, as a result of catastrophic\n\nevents, including weather-related catastrophic events, pandemics, terrorist-related incidents or acts of war. Please refer to Part 5 'Risk Factors and Risk Management' of this Annual Report for a description of certain important factors, risks and uncertainties that may a/ff ect AXA's business and/or results of operations. AXA undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of these forward-looking statements, whether to reflect new information, future events or circumstances or otherwise, except as required by applicable laws and regulations.\n\nIn addition to the Consolidated Financial Statements, this Annual Report refers to certain non-GAAP financial measures, or alternative performance measures, used by Management in analyzing the Group's operating trends, financial performance and financial position and providing investors with additional information that Management believes to be useful and relevant regarding the Group's results. These non-GAAP financial measures generally have no standardized meaning and therefore may not be comparable to similarly labelled measures used by other companies. As a result, none of these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part 6 'Consolidated Financial Statements' of this Annual Report. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Group are defined in the Glossary set forth in Appendix V to this Annual Report.\n\nI\n\nI",

Thanks to its reduced exposure to financial risks and its strengthening of its Property & Casualty insurance activities, notably in commercial insurance and health, the Group has seen further growth in its business and earnings, while consolidating its solid positioning. This good financial health has enabled the Group to increase its return to shareholders while accelerating its development.\n\nFurthermore, at a time when the economic slowdown is further weakening the most vulnerable and climate change is threatening our planet, AXA has also become even more involved with those who are marginalized by these threats. The Group and all of its employees are strongly committed to translating our purpose, which is 'to act for human progress by protecting what matters', into action. In this respect, I am proud that this year AXA received the highest rating in the insurance sector in the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment.\n\nIn addition, the Group has accelerated the development of its inclusive insurance programs to o/ff er accessible and a/ff ordable products to\n\nI\n\nI\n\npopulations on the margins of insurance coverage. In 2022, more than 11 million people benefited from these advantageous o/ff ers, and we hope to extend this coverage to an additional 1 million beneficiaries in 2023. The Group has also continued to actively contribute to environmental matters, notably with the launch of the ' AXA Forests for Good ' program to help restore forest ecosystems.\n\nThe year 2022 also saw the transition of the chairmanship of your Board of Directors. A/f\\_t er six years in this position, Denis Duverne has passed the torch to me, having successfully supported the Group in its strategic reorientation. I would like to take this opportunity to warmly thank him for his work within the Group and then as Chairman of the Board.\n\nSince I took o/ff  ice in April 2022, I have set myself three main objectives.\n\nFirst, to further strengthen the cohesion of the Board of Directors and to deepen the dialogue with Thomas Buberl, the CEO, and his team.\n\nSecond, to ensure even closer monitoring of risks on the one hand, and of the sustainability strategy on the other. To this end, the Board's committees have been reorganized, with the transformation of the Finance Committee into a 'Finance & Risk Committee', and the Compensation & Governance Committee into a 'Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee'.\n\nFinally, to support Thomas Buberl and his team in the development of the new strategic plan to be implemented from 2024. This new plan will be an opportunity for AXA to enter a new phase of its development based /O.scn growth, financial strength and in service for the greater good.\n\nOn behalf of the members of the Board of Directors, I would like to thank Thomas Buberl, his team and all the Group's employees for their boundless engagement and their strong mobilization for the company and its development.\n\nAntoine Gosset-Grainville\n\nChairman of the Board of Directors",

Against this di/ff  icult backdrop, AXA once again demonstrated its strength, dynamism and the relevance of its mission: to act for human progress by protecting what matters.\n\nThe Group's 2022 performance was remarkable, with revenues up 2% to \u20ac102 billion and a 12% increase in underlying earnings per share. This reflects the strong momentum of our operating entities, notably in France and Europe, and the successful repositioning of AXA XL, which despite natural catastrophes and the war in Ukraine, recorded an operating profit of more than \u20ac1.2 billion for the second year in a row.\n\nThe quality of our results is also reflected in the trust placed in us by our 93 million customers. We have invested heavily to improve their experience, both in our agencies and online. These e/ff orts have paid o/ff and I am proud that more than 80% of our business lines now have a satisfaction rate (NPS - Net Promoter Score) that is greater than or equal to the market average, compared to 70% at the launch of the ' Driving Progress 2023 ' plan. Our clients' satisfaction is our first reward, and I would like to thank them for their loyalty.\n\nWith a Solvency II ratio of 215% as of December 31, 2022, the Group once again demonstrates the strength of its balance sheet. This allows us to pursue an attractive capital management policy, accelerated this year with the successful transformation of AXA SA into an internal reinsurer, and which has enabled us to launch a share buyback program that positions the Group's payout ratio to shareholders at a level similar to its major European competitors.\n\nThis solid performance allows us to fully play our role towards our stakeholders. In 2022, we paid out nearly \u20ac50 billion in claims to our clients and \u20ac5.9 billion in interest to remunerate their savings. AXA also supported the growth and transformation of the economy through more than \u20ac30 billion of reinvestments. In an increasingly complex and uncertain world, we are fully mobilized to help everyone move forward with peace of mind.\n\nWe continued to deploy our sustainability strategy in each of the Environment, Social and Governance areas, and were rewarded with the highest rating in the insurance sector in the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment.\n\nOur performance in 2022 therefore confirms our ability to achieve the objectives of our ' Driving Progress 2023 ' plan, which is entering its final phase, and we have begun to focus on an ambitious next strategic plan.\n\nFinally, 2022 was marked by the appointment of Antoine Gosset-Grainville as Chairman of the Board of Directors. I am grateful for the relationship of trust that we have built up over the past months and for his support.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to salute the exceptional work of our 145,000 employees, agents and partners, almost 30% of whom are also AXA shareholders. Their energy and commitment are our greatest strength and a tremendous source of pride for me.\n\nThomas Buberl Chief Executive O/ff icer\n\nI\n\nI",

Nevertheless, the challenging environment still poses various threats and opportunities for the insurance industry:\n\n- /uni25A0 Macroeconomic and geopolitical environments: (i) RussiaUkraine war increasing geopolitical tensions between blocks, thereby threatening global solidity and growth, (ii) surging energy prices in Europe, (iii) persistent and broadening inflation and instability on interest rates have triggered a rapid and synchronized tightening of monetary conditions, (iv) impact from climate change, and (v) uncertainty on the Chinese economy with a recent reopening accompanied by lingering COVID-19 concerns, which all heavily impacted the outlook of the global economy;\n- /uni25A0 Increasing pressure on the insurance industry: (i) increasing complexity and cost of regulation ( e.g. , IFRS 17/uni00A0 (1) coming into force from January 1, 2023, together with government interventionism, especially for European players ( e.g. , restrictions on foreign cloud providers), (ii) higher frequency and severity of emerging risks ( e.g. , natural catastrophes, cyber risks), and (iii) inflation challenging profitability even a/f\\_t  er raising prices;\n- /uni25A0 Growth opportunities: (i) new insurance needs that are triggered by the increase in the type of risks ( e.g. , climate change, energy transition, and cyber security) as well as continued evolution of global GDP's main growth drivers towards more digital, service and capital-light industries, (ii) rising interest rates and downturn of equity markets drive new customers towards investments in Life and Savings products, (iii) rising demand for Health and Protection insurance, and (iv) tech & data becoming more and more critical to bringing value-formoney services to customers, di/ff erentiating from peers and optimizing operations.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nIn this environment, we believe that ' Driving Progress 2023 ' and its underlying assumptions continue to support our business model resilience and help us grow our business sustainably. In 2022, AXA has been consistently executing its strategy with strong delivery across its five strategic priorities:\n\n- 1) Expand Health and Protection: (i) solid growth in Health revenues of 16% in 2022, (ii) distinctive digital assets ( e.g. , DHP/uni00A0 (2) ) deployed in six European countries and valueadded services ( e.g. , teleconsulting and homecare service providing seamless end-to-end healthcare journeys), and (iii) d ) development of more inclusive o/ff ers and products for our customers;\n- 2) Simplify customer experience and accelerate efficiency: (i) outperformance in NPS/uni00A0 (3) targets with 100% of LoBs/uni00A0 (4) at or above average, out of which 81% of our LoBs in Health and Protection are above average, (ii) digital platforms rolling out ( e.g. , Emma app launched in six Asian countries, Angel.fr), (iii) the delivery of customer journey digitalization objectives and digitally-enabled agent experience are well on track for all the entities, and (iv) overall acceleration on e/ff  iciency and product simplification ( e.g. , via cloudification, IT legacy decommissioning, straight-through processing, organizational simplification);\n- 3) Strengthen underwriting performance: (i) technical excellence with 2022 Property & Casualty combined ratio at 94.6%, improved by a strong price increase strategy and successful re-underwriting measures at AXA XL (notably significant reduction of CAT exposure in reinsurance), and (ii) a strategic program launched to develop a Digital Commercial Platform to better serve commercial customers;",

Future dividends will depend on a variety of factors including AXA's earnings,  financial condition, applicable capital and solvency requirements, prevailing financial market conditions and the general economic environment. Proposals for dividend payments are made at the discretion of the Board of Directors and are submitted for approval to the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nAXA's dividend policy is based on underlying earnings per share. AXA targets to pay aggregate dividends in a general range of 55%-65% of Underlying Earnings per share. The dividend\n\nproposed by the Board of Directors in any particular year may vary considerably depending on a variety of factors (as noted above) which may have an impact on this target from one year to another. In assessing the dividend to be paid in any given year, Management tries to strike the appropriate balance between (i) /uni00A0 prudent capital management, (ii) /uni00A0 reinvestment of previous results to support business development and (iii) /uni00A0 an attractive dividend for shareholders.\n\nA dividend of \u20ac1.70 per share for the 2022 fiscal year will be proposed to the Shareholders' Meeting to be held on April/uni00A027, 2023.\n\nThe following table sets forth information on the dividends declared and paid in respect of the last five fiscal years:\n\n|   Fiscal year | Distribution  (in Euro/uni00A0million)   | Number of shares  (on December/uni00A031)   | Net dividend  per/uni00A0share  (in Euro)   | Dividend per share  eligible for a tax relief  (in Euro)   | Gross dividend  per/uni00A0share  (in Euro)   | Gross dividend  per/uni00A0share  (in Euro)   |    |    |\n|---------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----|----|\n|          2018 | 3,249                                    | 2,424,916,626                               | 1.34/uni00A0 (b)                            | 1.34/uni00A0 (b)                                           | 1.34/uni00A0 (b)                              |                                               |    |    |\n|          2019 | 1,765                                    | 2,417,695,123                               | 0.73/uni00A0 (c)                            | 0.73/uni00A0 (c)                                           | 0.73/uni00A0 (c)                              |                                               |    |    |\n|          2020 | 3,458                                    | 2,418,389,408                               | 1.43/uni00A0 (d)                            | 1.43/uni00A0 (d)                                           | 1.43/uni00A0 (d)                              |                                               |    |    |\n|          2021 | 3,729                                    | 2,421,568,696                               | 1.54/uni00A0 (e)                            | 1.54/uni00A0 (e)                                           | 1.54/uni00A0 (e)                              |                                               |    |    |\n|          2022 | 3,998/uni00A0 (a)                        | 2,351,770,945                               | 1.70/uni00A0 (f)                            | 1.70/uni00A0 (f)                                           | 1.70/uni00A0 (f)                              |                                               |    |    |\n\nDividends not claimed within five years a/f\\_t er the payout date become the property of the French Public Treasury.\n\nFor further information on AXA's dividend, see Note/uni00A029.5 'Other items: Restriction on dividend payments to shareholders' in Part/uni00A06 'Consolidated Financial Statements' and Section/uni00A07.3 'General Information - Bylaws - Rights, preferences and restrictions attached to the shares' of this Annual Report.

For example, its portfolio includes Emma, the digital assistant that, in addition to making servicing requests simpler and more efficient, provides access to a comprehensive range of related services including wellness advice and support.\n\n## NEW PRODUCT INITIATIVES\n\nAXA continues to strengthen its position in Asian markets and improve its customer propositions with initiatives including:\n\n- /uni25A0 launching new products such as Health Unit-Linked in Japan, a new standalone critical illness endowment product in Indonesia, and new short-term Health products to drive the diversification of the Motor business in China;\n- /uni25A0 conducting Health & Productivity Management workshops with SMEs in Japan;\n- /uni25A0 renewing AXA multi-year agreement to provide general insurance products to HSBC's customers mainly in Hong Kong;\n- /uni25A0 developing a leadership position in the mental health space, e.g. , the Fit to Flourish and Make time for Me time campaigns throughout the regions;\n- /uni25A0 supporting AXA Group's initiative to make insurance accessible to emerging customers, notably in China, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand.\n\n## DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS\n\nIn Asian markets, AXA deploys a multichannel distribution strategy to maximize its customer reach. It has an extensive intermediated distribution network of tied agents, bancassurance joint ventures leading domestic banks (China, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand) and e/ff ective relationships with independent broker networks (Japan, China and Hong Kong). AXA also has successful direct distribution, particularly for Property & Casualty products in Japan and South Korea.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->",

Investor demand was strong with a book subscribed close to 3/uni00A0times.\n\nThe notes are rated A+/Stable by Standard & Poor's, A1/Stable by Moody's and A+/Positive by Fitch.\n\nThe settlement of the notes took place on October/uni00A012, 2022.\n\nThis issuance is part of AXA Group's funding plan for 2022 and the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including the refinancing of part of the Group's outstanding debt.\n\nThis issuance announced brings the total net debt issuance for the Group to ca. \u20ac1/uni00A0billion since January/uni00A01, 2022.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## OTHER\n\n## AXA published its Climate and Biodiversity Report 2022\n\nOn June/uni00A030, 2022, AXA announced the publication of the 7 th /uni00A0edition of its climate report, renamed Climate and Biodiversity Report/uni00A0 (4) . This report responds to legal obligations in terms of extra-financial reporting, notably the first year of implementation of the new A rticle/uni00A029 of the French Climate Law, as well as to the voluntary approach of two initiatives in which AXA plays a leading role, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) launched in June/uni00A02021.\n\nIn this report, AXA highlights the di/ff erent dimensions of its action to fight climate change and protect biodiversity: governance, strategy, risk management and quantitative indicators of the impact of its actions.\n\nThe report's key metric, the 'warming potential', which measures the impact of the Group's investments on global warming by 2050, continues to improve. As of December/uni00A031, 2021, it stood at 2.6\u00b0C, down 0.1\u00b0C compared to December/uni00A031, 2020, and below the market (2.9\u00b0C). Its calculation model has been strengthened since our 2020 Climate Report by integrating, for example, Scope/uni00A03/uni00A0 (5) emissions when available. The report also indicates a clear improvement in the carbon footprint of AXA's investment portfolio, with a 29% decrease in 2021 compared to 2019. Finally, the amount of green investments totaled \u20ac22.6/uni00A0billion, close to the target of \u20ac26/uni00A0billion by 2023. The report thus highlights the transition trajectory thus begun, but also underlines the e/ff orts that remain to be made to accelerate it.\n\nNew this year, the report details AXA's action to preserve biodiversity and its support for the creation of the TNFD. Today, more than 50% of the world's economic output depends on nature. The objective of the TNFD is therefore to direct financial flows towards investments in the sector that are beneficial to ecosystems and to ensure that each player integrates this risk into its activities. AXA is leading the way and reports on its first initiatives in this area, both in terms of commitment (policy to combat deforestation through its investments and insurance activities) and the experimentation of new metrics (corporate biodiversity footprint).\n\n2",

Externally, the consortium's members will raise awareness of biodiversity issues in schools thanks to this project. Internally, AXA will propose actions through AXA Hearts in Action and awareness-raising operations to its partners and employees.\n\nWith 'AXA Forests for Good' , the Group is strengthening its global forest protection plan. In 2021, AXA announced a \u20ac1.5/uni00A0billion investment program to support the sustainable management of forest ecosystems and the protection of biodiversity.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## AXA released its 2022 Future Risks Report: Climate change is becoming the number one/uni00A0concern around the world\n\nOn October/uni00A024, 2022, AXA released the ninth edition of its Future Risks Report. This global survey measures and ranks the evolution of perceptions of emerging risks. It is based on responses from a panel of 4,500 risk experts from 58/uni00A0countries and a representative sample of 20,000/uni00A0people from 15/uni00A0countries. This report is produced in partnership with the IPSOS research institute and the geopolitical analysis consultancy Eurasia Group.\n\nIn 2022, for the first time, climate risk tops the list of experts' concerns in all regions of the world and became the main concern of the general public in the United States. This replaces cyber risk that was identified as the leading concern in the United States in 2021 and the second highest concern in all other geographies.\n\nGeopolitical risks come in second place, overtaking cyber and pandemic risks. 95% of the experts surveyed expect geopolitical tensions to persist and spread throughout the world. As an indirect consequence, energy-related risks are now in fourth place, up from 17 th /uni00A0place in 2021.\n\nEconomic risks are increasing and fueling social tensions. For the first time, experts rank three economic risks in their top/uni00A010: financial instability, macroeconomic deterioration, and monetary and fiscal stress. Inflation is becoming an important concern for both experts and the general public.\n\nIn the general population, the feeling of vulnerability remains at a very high level (80% of respondents consider themselves more vulnerable than five years ago) and is even increasing in the face of certain risks such as climate change and the energy crisis. Furthermore, confidence in certain categories of decisionmakers to find solutions is worsening, particularly regarding public authorities (58% versus . 62% in 2021), private companies (45% versus 47% in 2021) and even scientists (66% versus 75% in 2021). This general trend can be explained by the fact that the public believes that the level of preparation of public authorities for certain risks - such as climate change, cyber or geopolitical tensions - is insu/ff icient.",

Energy prices surged as a result of sanctions and retaliatory measures on Russia, particularly on gas supply, triggering acceleration of inflation. In response, central banks accelerated their plans for tightening monetary policy by increasing interest rates. Even if GDP growth held up relatively well, the outlook deteriorated and the risk of recession in 2023 increased significantly.\n\nIn Europe, inflation hit 9.2% at year-end, primarily from higher energy prices. The economic activity, however, held up relatively well with GDP expanding in the first half (+0.6% in the first quarter and +0.8% in the second quarter) largely due to higher post COVID-19 demand. The European Central Bank (ECB) responded with policy rate hikes to alleviate the impacts of inflation, while most Eurozone economies put in place measures to protect purchasing power. These two e/ff ects drove a slight slowdown of GDP growth in the second half of the year. It levelled at +0.3% in the third quarter and posted a limited +0.1% expansion in the fourth quarter leading to an annual GDP growth of 3.5% versus 2021.\n\nThe United Kingdom was also impacted by the acceleration of inflation with the surge in energy prices as a consequence of the war in Ukraine. Despite continued policy rate hikes by the Bank of England, inflation reached 9% in April, and peaked at 11% in October. This weighed on economic activity with GDP down -0.1% in the second quarter ( versus +0.6% in the first quarter). The resignation of Prime Minister Boris Johnson and social tensions contributed to a decline in GDP of -0.3% in the third quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter last year, GDP was stable in the fourth quarter of 2022, and it reached a +4% annual growth by year-end.\n\nThe United States also saw a sharp rise in inflation with a peak by the end of June (+9%), led by supply-chain disruptions as well as rising energy and commodity costs in the first semester. Thanks to government measures including e/ff orts to protect purchasing power and to narrow the trade deficit, and to the Federal Reserve's action on its policy rate, inflation declined to 6.5% by year-end. As a result, a/f\\_t er two quarters of negative evolution in the first semester of 2022, the United States GDP staged a rebound in the second semester of the year with +0.8% annualized in the third quarter and +2.9% in the fourth quarter, leading to a +2.1% annual GDP growth.\n\nIn Asia, China faced economic difficulties caused by the continuation of its 'Zero COVID' strategy. In this context, its annualized GDP decreased by -2.7% in the second quarter but marked a rebound in the second half (+3.9% in the third quarter and +2.9% in the fourth quarter) thanks to the rapid recovery of industrial production, fiscal and monetary policy measures, and the exit from the 'Zero COVID' policy. These events led to a limited annual growth of +3%. In Japan, inflation also hit record highs in 2022 (+4%) with energy prices being again the primary cause. Japan's accommodative monetary policy led to a sharp depreciation of the Yen, with an impact on imports. While the recovery from the pandemic contributed to the growing level of GDP growth in the first half (-0.4% in the first quarter, +1.1% in the second quarter), the second half was marked by a slowdown (-0.3% in the third quarter, +0.2% in the fourth quarter), leading to a +1.1% annual GDP growth.\n\n## STOCK MARKETS\n\n| (main indexes, in pts)   | December/uni00A031 ,  2022   | December/uni00A031, 2022/ December/uni00A031, 2021   | December/uni00A031, 2021   | December/uni00A031, 2021/ December/uni00A031, 2020   |\n|--------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| CAC/uni00A040            | 6,474                        | -9%                                                  | 7,153                      | 29%                                                  |\n| Eurostoxx 50             | 3,794                        | -12%                                                 | 4,298                      | 21%                                                  |\n| F TSE  100               | 7,452                        | 1%                                                   | 7,385                      | 14%                                                  |\n| Nikkei                   | 26,095                       | -9%                                                  | 28,792                     | 5%                                                   |\n| S&P/uni00A0500           | 3,840                        | -19%                                                 | 4,766                      | 27%                                                  |\n| MSCI World               | 2,603                        | -19%                                                 | 3,232                      | 20%                                                  |\n| MSCI Emerging            | 956                          | -22%                                                 | 1,232                      | -5%                                                  |\n\nSource: Bloomberg.\n\nI\n\nI",

On the contrary, the United Kingdom's FTSE 250, that is more representative of the United Kingdom economy, dropped by -20%, in line with other major markets. The Japanese Nikkei index recorded a limited drop (-9%) thanks to the accommodative monetary policy of the Bank of Japan.

The UK 10-year Gilt yield closed at 3.67% but hit a high of 4.64% in October following political and financial tensions. On the other hand, the Bank of Japan maintained the same accommodative policy and 10-year Japanese yield increased by only +35/uni00A0bps over the year.\n\nCredit markets experienced a material repricing in 2022 in the context of higher uncertainties fuelled by inflationary pressure, interest rates hikes and fear of an economic slowdown. In the United States, the CDX IG spread increased from 50/uni00A0bps to 82/uni00A0bps and, in Europe, the iTraxx Main index spread nearly doubled from 48/uni00A0bps to 92/uni00A0bps. These trends were similar across most CDS indices, from Investment Grade to High Yield credit spreads, with underperformance in Europe due to its closer proximity to the war in Ukraine. Also, the China High Yield index spread remained under pressure for most of 2022 peaking at 3,100/uni00A0bps in mid-March. However, it improved markedly in the fourth quarter, the spreads tightening to 1,600/uni00A0bps by the end of December. Part of the improvement in the spread came from the dropout of defaulted names from the index.\n\nI\n\nI",

A/f\\_t er a catch-up year and historical records in 2021, the market found its pre-pandemic levels (\u20ac144.6/uni00A0billion of premiums in 2019). This year, the decrease is due to a drop in General Account products in a context of market volatility. Unit-Linked sales maintained 2021 levels with \u20ac57.7/uni00A0billion premiums, which represented a steady 40% of total premiums collected. On the Pension savings market, the Plan \u00c9pargne Retraite (PER) product continued last year's positive trend (reserves reaching ca. \u20ac73/uni00A0billion), covering up to 6.5/uni00A0million clients, while the sales of Eurocroissance products almost tripled year-on-year.\n\nThe French Protection & complementary Health insurance market witnessed the introduction of a new Credit insurance regulation (Loi Lemoine), which came into force in September. The law makes it possible to notably terminate a credit insurance policy and select another one with a di/ff erent credit insurer, at any time and without penalties. The implementation of a new Health regulation ( 100% Sant\u00e9 ) over the last two years, that modifies the terms of co-payment on dentals, eye care and hearing aids, has triggered a large increase in claims frequency that has been accompanied by an increase of the average costs.\n\nThe French Property & Casualty insurance market faced several challenges in 2022, such as rising inflation which led to an increase in the cost of automobile spare parts and the cost of repair, as\n\nI\n\nwell as persistent supply chain disruptions a/ff ecting motor and construction business lines. In addition, frequency and severity of climatic events soared and 2022 was strongly a/ff ected by hailstorms and droughts, making it the most expensive year since 1999 in terms of natural events.\n\nIn Europe (excluding France), Property and Casualty insurance markets have been impacted by climate change, primarily early 2022 by a series of winter storms including Eunice and Dudley but also in the summer marked by extreme heat and drought followed by severe thunderstorms with heavy hail. A/f\\_t er the unprecedented 2021 impacts, the severe weather events of 2022 highlight that natural catastrophes are increasing in frequency and severity. In addition, war in Ukraine, along with further COVID19-related lockdowns in China, has added to supply chain issues and increased inflationary pressures. It has been years since European markets have experienced such a level of inflation, adding a layer of uncertainty on the average cost notably in short term lines of business. This challenging inflationary context led insurers to implement mitigation actions on both pricing and claims management. In Life & Savings, the uncertainty related to the economic context led to a decline in activity with lower flows reflecting the customers' risk aversion towards financial markets and investments notably in the Unit-Linked market in Italy (-30.5% decrease in new business premiums in 2022). The rise in interest rates led Life insurers to focus on both in-force retention and new business strategy by managing policyholders' expectation. In Health, digitalization of services continued, notably through the strong development of teleconsultation.",

        "page_content": "In Japan, the Life insurance market further recovered from COVID-19 related disruption and improved by 10.5% in terms of GWP, with strong sales in foreign currency denominated products in the context of interest rate hikes. However, the seventh wave of COVID-19 infections led to significant claims payments and heavily impacted the profitability of main insurers, notably on Health products. To compensate the impact for insurers, a change of governmental guideline was published on September/uni00A026, 2022, to limit the claims payment to either hospitalized policyholders or the ones with a high-risk of illness profile. The Property & Casualty insurance market slightly increased by 0.4% as the drop in Personal accidents and Compulsory Automobile Liability Insurance businesses was o/ff set by the increase in Casualty, Marine and Motor.\n\nIn Hong Kong , the Property & Casualty insurance market remained overall stable while recording growth in General Liability and Workers' Compensation businesses. The Life & Savings insurance market reported a double-digit decline as a result of the continued border restrictions and containment measures in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in lower new business sales to Mainland Chinese Visitors. The Health insurance market experienced fierce competition. Tax-deductible voluntary Health insurance certified plans were still among the key products sold during tax season.\n\nMarket conditions in the United States Property insurance market remained stable, even in the a/f\\_t ermath of Hurricane Ian, which, by early estimates, may amount to a $50-70/uni00A0billion insurance event. While considered a relatively quiet year for Atlantic hurricane activity, 2022 nonetheless still saw 14 named events, including Hurricanes Ian and Nicole, both of which made landfall.\n\nIn the United States Casualty insurance market, rates continued to increase, but started showing signs of moderation. Capacity across the market is at an adequate level, although constraints were observed for certain risks ( e.g. , environmental) and coverages ( e.g. , Product Recall). With increasing Cyber risk, insurers have been re-assessing their risk appetite. The US casualty market is also facing the challenge of the impact of higher claims inflation - both economic and social.\n\nThe Reinsurance market remains well capitalized, though capacity was deployed selectively for certain risks. Demand for reinsurance capacity continues to grow, as primary carriers look for financial strength in an uncertain environment. Property premiums have increased the most in response to the e/ff ects of higher natural catastrophe activity and high inflation.\n\n## ACTIVITY REPORT AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\n2.2/uni00A0MARKET ENVIRONMENT\n\n## Main Emerging Markets\n\nIn Asia Emerging Markets , the Property & Casualty insurance market benefited from a strong growth in Motor sales across geographies, notably in China where the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission vigorously promoted the standardized development of the Motor insurance and Internet insurance markets, and directed the industry to accelerate the online transformation, and in Thailand, where higher Motor sales were combined with a deterioration of the industry combined ratio following unusually heavy rain and flooding, and an increase in labor cost and spare parts. The Life & Savings insurance market continued to experience sluggish growth in most geographies mostly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, whilst showing first signs of recovery with a turnaround of new business sales notably in China and Thailand. The pandemic also increased the awareness of Health products in 2022, addressing the protection gap, notably in China, where the overall market grew by 14.7% in 2022.\n\nIn International Emerging Markets , the Mexican insurance market grew by +8.5%. Property & Casualty is mainly growing thanks to the Motor business, with price increases that are pressured by the full recovery of mobility, and high-level inflation. Health market grew by +18.4% mainly in group business linked to pricing impacts. A/f\\_t er two years of strong impact of COVID-19 claims, the market almost recovered to 2019 pre-pandemic profitability levels. Life & Savings is positively driven by the sales of Unit-Linked products, while Group Life market continues to harden linked to the losses reported in the previous periods. As for Health, the markets recovered in 2022 with lower COVID-19 claims. The Colombian insurance market grew by 20%, driven by an increase in Property & Casualty business notably in Motor, Worker's compensation, SOAT (Personal accident), as well as in Group Life. Turkey saw hyperinflation, with an annual inflation of 64%. This exceptional situation resulted in an increase in average costs but was compensated by material price increases, with P&C gross written premium growing by +133%.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n2",

The War in Ukraine disrupted world markets and exacerbated supply chain issues as well as significant macroeconomic and market uncertainties. The resulting volatile environment jolted investor sentiment as witnessed by the widening of spreads and downward equity markets.

A reconciliation from Underlying earnings and Combined Ratio to the most directly reconcilable line item, subtotal, or total in the financial statements of the corresponding period is provided in the above tables. Underlying Return on Equity and Underlying earnings per share are reconciled to the financial statements in the table set forth on page/uni00A052 of this Annual Report, and the calculation methodology of the Debt Gearing is set out on page/uni00A049 of this Annual Report. For further information on any of the above-mentioned APMs, see the Glossary on pages/uni00A0519 to 523 of this Annual Report.\n\n## UNDERLYING EARNINGS\n\nUnderlying earnings represent the net income (Group share), before the impact of the following items net of policyholder participation, deferred acquisition costs, Value of Business inforce, taxes, and minority interests:\n\n- /uni25A0 realized gains and losses, change in impairment valuation allowances (on assets not designated under fair value option or trading assets) and cost at inception, intrinsic value and pay-o/ff   of derivatives used for the economic hedging of realized gains and impairments of equity securities (other than the funds backing contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders);\n- /uni25A0 profit or loss on financial assets accounted for under fair value option (excluding assets backing liabilities for which the financial risk is borne by the policyholder), foreign exchange impacts on assets and liabilities, and derivatives related to invested assets and liabilities;\n- /uni25A0 impairments of goodwill, impairments and amortization of intangibles related to customers and distribution agreements;\n- /uni25A0 integration costs related to newly acquired companies as well as restructuring costs related to productivity improvement plans; and\n- /uni25A0 exceptional operations (primarily changes in scope and discontinued operations).\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## UNDERLYING RETURN ON EQUITY\n\nThe Underlying Return on Equity (' Underlying RoE ') is calculated as underlying earnings net of financial charges related to undated and deeply subordinated debts (recorded through shareholders' equity as disclosed in Part 6.6 - Note 13 'Shareholders' Equity and Minority Interests' of this Annual Report) divided by the average of opening and closing shareholders' equity excluding:\n\n- /uni25A0 reserves relating to the change in the fair value through shareholders' equity as disclosed in Part/uni00A06.4 - 'Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity' of this Annual Report;\n- /uni25A0 undated and deeply subordinated debts as disclosed in Part 6.6 - Note 13 'Shareholders' Equity and Minority Interests' of this Annual Report) .\n\n## UNDERLYING EARNINGS PER SHARE\n\nUnderlying earnings per share corresponds to Group share Underlying earnings net of financial charges related to undated and deeply subordinated debts (recorded through shareholders' equity as disclosed in Part 6.6 - Note 13 'Shareholders' Equity and Minority Interests' of this Annual Report) divided by the weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares over the period. Shares held by AXA and its subsidiaries ( i.e. , treasury shares) are deducted for the calculation of outstanding shares.\n\n## COMBINED RATIO (APPLICABLE FOR/uni00A0PROPERTY & CASUALTY, HEALTH, AND/uni00A0PROTECTION)\n\nThe Combined Ratio is the sum of all accident year loss ratio net of reinsurance and the underlying expense ratio.\n\n- /uni25A0 All accident year loss ratio net of reinsurance is the ratio of:\n- \u00b7 all accident years claims charge gross of reinsurance + claims handling costs + result of reinsurance ceded on all accident years excluding the unwind of the discount rate used in calculating technical reserves; to\n- \u00b7 earned revenues gross of reinsurance.\n- /uni25A0 Expense ratio is the ratio of:\n- \u00b7 expenses (excluding claims handling costs, including changes in Value of Business In-force amortization); to\n- \u00b7 earned revenues gross of reinsurance.",

Debt Gearing is used by the Management to measure the financial leverage of the Group and the extent to which its operations are funded by creditors as opposed to shareholders. AXA's Debt\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## ACTIVITY REPORT AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\n2.3/uni00A0ACTIVITY REPORT\n\nGearing is calculated by dividing the gross debt (financing debt as disclosed in Part 6.6 - Note 17 'Financing debt' and undated and deeply subordinated debts as disclosed in Part 6.6 - Note/uni00A013 'Shareholders' equity and minority interests' of this Annual Report) by total capital employed (shareholders' equity excluding undated and deeply subordinated debts and reserves relating to the change in the fair value of financial instruments and of hedge accounting derivatives) plus gross debt.\n\n## Commentary on Group Earnings\n\n## UNDERLYING EARNINGS\n\nUnderlying earnings amounted to \u20ac7,264/uni00A0million, up \u20ac503/uni00A0million (+7%) versus 2021 on a reported basis.

On a constant exchange rate basis, management fees increased by 0.6/uni00A0bps due to a favorable change in product mix from a higher share of Alternative products.\n\nGross revenues increased by \u20ac+66/uni00A0million (+4%). On a comparable basis, gross revenues decreased by \u20ac-57/uni00A0million (-3%) to \u20ac1,589/uni00A0million mainly driven by (i)/uni00A0 the non-repeat of exceptional performance fees (\u20ac-41/uni00A0million), (ii)/uni00A0 lower management fees (\u20ac38/uni00A0million) due to the market context, partly o/ff set by (iii)/uni00A0 higher distribution fees (\u20ac+21/uni00A0million) coming from strong commercial momentum in Retail.\n\nUnderlying earnings before tax decreased by \u20ac-28/uni00A0million (-5%) to \u20ac513/uni00A0million. On a constant exchange rate basis, underlying earnings before tax decreased by \u20ac-33/uni00A0million (-6%) as a result of lower revenues, partly o/ff set by cost discipline.\n\nThe underlying cost income ratio increased by 0.7/uni00A0point to 66.6%. On a constant exchange rate basis, the underlying cost income ratio increased by 0.3/uni00A0point.\n\nIncome tax expenses decreased by \u20ac17/uni00A0million (-12%) to \u20ac-130/uni00A0million. On a constant exchange rate basis, income tax expenses decreased by \u20ac18/uni00A0million (-13%) mainly driven by lower underlying earnings as well as the decrease in the French corporate tax rate.\n\nIncome from affiliates and associates increased by \u20ac8/uni00A0million (+35%). On a constant exchange rate basis, income from a/ff iliates and associates increased by \u20ac7/uni00A0million (+30%) following the consolidation of Capza (\u20ac+6/uni00A0million), as AXA's ownership has increased from 46% to 66% in February/uni00A02022.\n\nUnderlying earnings marginally decreased by \u20ac-2/uni00A0million (-1%) to \u20ac400/uni00A0million.

On a constant exchange rate basis, net income increased by \u20ac28/uni00A0million (+8%) mainly driven by the (i)/uni00A0 favorable forex impact (\u20ac+15/uni00A0million), (ii)/uni00A0 lower restructuring costs (\u20ac+11/uni00A0million) due to the reorganization of Rosenberg in 2021, and (iii)/uni00A0 non-repeat of an unfavorable change in the fair value of a real estate fund (\u20ac+8/uni00A0million).\n\nI\n\nI",

The report of the Statutory Auditors on the Consolidated Financial Statements covers only the information included in Note/uni00A04.\n\nLiquidity management is a core part of the Group's financial planning and includes the management of our debt and the maturities of our debt instruments and, more generally, the Group's capital allocation strategy. Liquidity resources result mainly from Insurance and Asset Management operations, as well as from capital-raising activities and committed bank credit lines.\n\nOver the past several years, the Group has expanded its core operations (Insurance, Reinsurance, and Asset Management) through a combination of organic growth, direct investments, and acquisitions. This expansion has been funded primarily through a combination of (i) /uni00A0dividends received from operating subsidiaries, (ii) /uni00A0proceeds from the issuance of debt instruments (mainly subordinated debts) and internal borrowings, (iii) /uni00A0 the issuance of ordinary shares, and (iv) /uni00A0 proceeds from the sale of non-core businesses and assets.\n\nEach of the major operating subsidiaries of the Group is responsible for managing its own liquidity position, in coordination with the Company. The Company, as the holding company of the AXA Group, coordinates funding and liquidity management and, in this role, participates in financing the operations of certain of its subsidiaries. Certain of AXA's subsidiaries, including XL Group Limited, AXA Konzern/uni00A0AG, AXA UK/uni00A0Plc. and AXA Mediterranean Holding/uni00A0SA, are also holding companies and consequently, depend on dividends received from their own subsidiaries to meet their obligations. The Group's operating (re)insurance companies are required to meet multiple regulatory constraints and, in particular, minimum solvency ratios. The level of internal dividends paid by operating subsidiaries must therefore take into account these constraints. Cash positions also fluctuate as a result of cashsettled margin calls from counterparties related to collateral agreements on derivatives. While the use of derivatives has been decreasing at the Company level, the Company's statutory results may be significantly impacted by unrealized gains and losses on derivatives used to hedge, in particular, currency and interest rate risks. In addition, since it became a regulated reinsurer in 2022, the Company operates reinsurance activities whose liquidity resources and needs are monitored separately.\n\nI\n\nThe Company anticipates that cash dividends received from its operating subsidiaries and other financing sources available to the Company will continue to cover its operating expenses as a holding (including interest payments on its outstanding debts and borrowings) and dividend payments until the end of the current strategic plan and the Company's next strategic plan to be announced during the course of 2023. AXA expects that anticipated investments in subsidiaries and existing operations, future acquisitions and strategic investments and share repurchase transactions will be funded from available cash remaining a/f\\_t er payments of dividends and operating expenses, proceeds from the sale of non-strategic assets and businesses as well as future issuances of debt and/or equity instruments.\n\nRegulatory or governmental authorities may recommend or request holding companies of insurance groups or regulated reinsurers such as AXA to limit their dividend payments and many subsidiaries, particularly insurance entities, are subject to local regulatory restrictions on the amount of dividends they can pay to their shareholders. Since the completion of the Company's transformation into the Group Internal Reinsurer on June/uni00A030, 2022, the ACPR, while remaining the supervising authority for the Group, also has supervisory power over AXA as an ACPR-licensed reinsurance company. For more information on these restrictions, see Note/uni00A029.4 'Other items: restrictions on dividend payments to shareholders' in Part/uni00A06 'Consolidated Financial Statements' and paragraphs 'The Group's or its insurance or reinsurance entities failure to meet their solvency and capital adequacy requirements could have a material adverse e/ff ect on our business, liquidity, ratings, results of operations and financial condition', 'We are dependent on our subsidiaries to cover our operating expenses, make dividend payments and cover reinsurance claims that may exceed the amount of reinsurance reserves that are held at the Company level' and 'The Group and our businesses are subject to extensive regulation, regulatory supervision, adverse judicial decisions and emerging legal, regulatory and reputational risks in/uni202Fthe/uni202Fvarious jurisdictions in which we/uni202Foperate' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors'/uni00A0 (1) of this Annual Report.",

These funds are mainly used to pay policyholder benefits, claims and related expenses, policy surrenders and other operating expenses, as well as to purchase financial assets and meet potential collateral exchange obligations in relation to derivatives. The liquidity of the Group's insurance operations is a/ff  ected by, among other things, the overall quality of the Group's investments and the Group's ability to liquidate its financial assets in a timely manner and to meet policyholder benefits and insurance claims as they fall due. The Group regularly reviews the quality of its assets to ensure adequate liquidity in stress scenarios.\n\nInformation on projected payments and surrenders related to Life & Savings and Property & Casualty insurance contracts are disclosed in Note/uni00A014.10.1 'Payment and surrender projections' in Part/uni00A06 'Consolidated Financial Statements' of this Annual Report.\n\nInformation in this section should be read in conjunction with, in particular, sub-sections 'Market-related risks', 'Insurance and reinsurance Pricing and underwriting-related risks' and 'Operational risks' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors'/uni00A0 (1) of this Annual Report.\n\n## PROPERTY & CASUALTY (INCLUDING REINSURANCE AND HEALTH)\n\nLiquidity needs of Property & Casualty activities can be a/ff ected by actual claims experience. Property & Casualty Insurance's net cash flows are generally positive. They can be negative in the case of exceptional loss events, such as natural or man-made catastrophe events. A portion of these cash flows is invested in liquid, short-term bonds, and other listed securities in order to manage the liquidity risk that may arise from such events.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## LIFE & SAVINGS (INCLUDING HEALTH)\n\nLiquidity needs of Life & Savings activities can be a/ff ected by a number of factors including fluctuations in the level of surrenders, withdrawals, maturities and guarantees to policyholders.\n\nThe investment strategy of AXA's Life & Savings subsidiaries is designed to match the investment returns and estimated maturities of their investments with expected cash flows on their insurance contracts. Entities regularly monitor the valuation and duration of their investments and the performance of their financial assets. Financial market performance may a/ff ect the level of surrenders and withdrawals on Life insurance policies, as well as immediate and projected long-term cash needs. Group operating entities seek to adjust their investment portfolios to reflect such considerations and react in a targeted manner.\n\n## ASSET MANAGEMENT\n\nThe principal sources of liquidity for AXA's Asset Management subsidiaries are operating cash flows, repurchase agreements, borrowings from credit institutions, drawings on credit facilities and proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares (where applicable).\n\nThe financing needs of Asset Management subsidiaries arise principally from their activities, which require working capital, in particular to constitute seed money for new funds at AXA Investment Managers.\n\n2",

At year-end 2022, the Group had:\n\n- /uni25A0 a significant cash position across all business lines (information on cash flows from operations is provided in Note/uni00A012 'Cash and cash equivalents' in Part/uni00A06 'Consolidated Financial Statements' of this Annual Report). As of December/uni00A031, 2022, AXA's consolidated statement of financial position included cash and cash equivalents of \u20ac26.2/uni00A0billion, net of bank overdra/f\\_t s of \u20ac0.5/uni00A0billion;\n- /uni25A0 broad access to various markets via standardized debt programs: for example, at the end of 2022, this included a maximum capacity of \u20ac6.0/uni00A0billion of French commercial paper, $2.0/uni00A0billion of US commercial paper, \u20ac20.0/uni00A0billion under a Euro Medium Term Note ('EMTN') program (of which \u20ac18.3/uni00A0billion have already been issued), and \u20ac1.5/uni00A0billion of French titres n\u00e9gociables \u00e0 moyen terme ;\n- /uni25A0 a debt profile characterized by debt that is mostly subordinated, with a long maturity profile. In 2022, AXA/uni00A0SA issued \u20ac1.0/uni00A0billion of debt (net of repayments) and debt stood at \u20ac19.3/uni00A0billion at year-end 2022. Debt gearing/uni00A0 (1) increased (27.1% at year-end 2022, versus 26.4% at year-end 2021), driven by an increase of debt of \u20ac1.2/uni00A0billion/uni00A0 (2) . Interest coverage increased (15,6x at year-end 2022, versus 14.3x at year-end 2021), driven by higher Group Underlying earnings in 2022.\n\nAXA has put in place a robust liquidity Risk Management framework which is reviewed on a regular basis through a quarterly monitoring of liquidity and solvency requirements in stressed environments both at local and Group level. For additional information, please refer to Section/uni00A05.2 'Internal control and Risk Management'/uni00A0 (3) and Section/uni00A05.5 'Liquidity risk'/uni00A0 (4) of this Annual Report.\n\nAt year-end 2022, Group entities held, in the aggregate, more than \u20ac167/uni00A0billion of government and related bonds of which \u20ac99/uni00A0billion were issued by Eurozone countries, which enables them to address local liquidity needs through highly liquid assets.\n\nI\n\nAXA/uni00A0SA maintained a pool of liquid resources pertaining to its role as holding of the AXA Group, made of cash, money market instruments (including through the Group's cash pooling) and highly liquid fixed income investments as well as, following its transformation into a regulated reinsurer, a portfolio of investments backing its statutory reinsurance liabilities. AXA/uni00A0SA also maintained available credit facilities at \u20ac7.9 billion at year-end 2022 (\u20ac8.5 /uni00A0billion in 2021). AXA/uni00A0SA has its own liquidity requirements resulting mainly from solvency needs of entities under severe stress scenarios, its central reinsurance activities following the transformation of the Group's holding into the Group's main reinsurance captive and collateralized derivatives held by AXA/uni00A0SA. This derivatives book is monitored and managed on a daily basis by the Treasury Department. For additional information on the currencies in which our cash and cash equivalents are held, please refer to paragraph 'Exchange Rate Risk related to the operating activities of Group subsidiaries' in Section/uni00A05.3 'Market Risks' of this Annual Report. For additional information on the extent to which our borrowings are at fixed rates, please refer to Note/uni00A013.1.1 'Change in shareholders' equity Group share in 2022', Note/uni00A017 'Financing Debt' and Note/uni00A018.2 'Other Debt Instruments Issued, Notes and Bank Overdra/f\\_t s (Other than Financing Debt) by Issuance' in Part/uni00A06 'Consolidated Financial Statements' of this Annual Report. For additional information on the use of financial instruments for hedging purposes, please refer to Note/uni00A020 'Derivative instruments' in Part/uni00A06 'Consolidated Financial Statements' of this Annual Report.\n\nIn addition, as part of its risk control framework, the Company remains vigilant regarding contractual provisions, such as rating triggers or restrictive covenants in financing and other documentation that may give lenders, securityholders or other counterparties the right to accelerate repayment, demand collateral or seek other similar remedies under circumstances that could have a material adverse e/ff ect on the Group's consolidated financial position. At year-end 2022, AXA had no rating triggers and no financial covenants in its credit facilities.",

A failure of the Group and/or any of its (re)insurance entities to meet applicable regulatory capital requirements and/or a severe deterioration of its solvency position may result in the need for significant amounts of new capital. If such a failure occurs at any of the Group's (re)insurance subsidiaries, it could adversely a/ff ect the Group's liquidity position. For additional information, see paragraph 'The Group's or its (re)insurance entities' failure to meet their solvency and capital adequacy requirements could have a material adverse e/ff ect on our business, liquidity, ratings, results of operations and financial condition' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors'/uni00A0 (5) of this Annual Report.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThe Group and AXA/uni00A0SA on a solo basis maintained eligible own funds in excess of their Solvency Capital Requirement at all times during 2022 (in the case of AXA/uni00A0SA, subsequent to its receipt of its reinsurance license) and monitors compliance with such requirement on a continuous basis.\n\n## GROUP CAPITAL MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES\n\nThe AXA Group's capital management policy is based on the following principles:\n\n- /uni25A0 AXA aims at operating with a target Group Solvency/uni00A0II ratio of approximately 190%;\n- /uni25A0 AXA intends to pay dividends for an amount representing a payout ratio ranging from 55% to 65% of the Group's Underlying Earnings per share;\n- /uni25A0 finally, AXA applies strict financial discipline in its use of cash. AXA intends to buy back shares to at least neutralize the dilution resulting from employee share o/ff erings and the exercise of stock options or to neutralize the dilutive impact of certain disposals on the Group's Underlying Earnings per share. AXA may also use share buy-backs to return excess financial resources to its shareholders which would usually be assessed on an annual basis taking into account the Group's resources and prospects.",

        "page_content": "If the Group's Solvency/uni00A0II ratio were to deviate excessively below its target level of 190%, AXA may take measures to improve it, such as being more selective on growth initiatives, increasing reinsurance or reducing its appetite for investment risk. In all cases, AXA's policy is to maintain its Group Solvency/uni00A0II ratio above its risk appetite limit level of 140%.\n\nThe AXA Group has defined and implemented capital management standards in order to ensure that the Company and its subsidiaries are well positioned from a competitive point of view and maintain an adequate solvency ratio in accordance with local regulatory requirements. In addition, Management has developed various contingency plans. These plans may involve the use of reinsurance, sales of investment portfolios and/or other assets, measures to reduce capital strain of new business, or other measures. There can be no assurance, however, that these plans will be e/ff ective and achieve their objectives.\n\n## TIERING ANALYSIS OF CAPITAL\n\nSolvency/uni00A0II Eligible Own Funds ('EOF') relate to the Group's and AXA SA's (on a solo basis) available capital resources before the impact of any tiering eligibility restrictions and a/f\\_t er consideration of the potential non-availability of certain elements of capital.\n\nEligible Own Funds are split into three di/ff erent tiers, based on the quality of each component as defined under Solvency/uni00A0II regulations. The classification depends upon the extent to which the own fund item is immediately available to absorb losses including in case of a winding-up (permanent availability) and subordinated to all other obligations including towards policyholders and beneficiaries. Capital elements of the highest quality are classified in Tier/uni00A01. Eligibility limits apply to these components to cover the Group's and AXA SA's (on a solo basis) Solvency Capital Requirement ('SCR').\n\nFor compliance with the SCR, the following quantitative limits apply:/uni00A0(a) the eligible amount of Tier/uni00A01 items must be at least one half of the SCR,/uni00A0(b) the eligible amount of Tier/uni00A03 items must be less than 15% of the SCR, and/uni00A0(c) the sum of the eligible amounts of Tier/uni00A02 and Tier/uni00A03 items must not exceed 50% of the SCR.\n\nHybrid debt instruments eligible for Tier/uni00A01 must not exceed 20% of the total amount of Tier/uni00A01 capital.\n\n## DATED AND UNDATED SUBORDINATED DEBT DESCRIPTION\n\nDated and undated subordinated notes issued by the Company qualify as eligible own funds.\n\nSubordinated notes issued by the Company since January/uni00A018,/uni00A02015, have been structured to be eligible as own funds regulatory capital under Solvency/uni00A0II regulations. Subordinated notes issued prior to January/uni00A017, 2015, mostly benefit from the transitional provisions\n\n## ACTIVITY REPORT AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\n2.4/uni00A0LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nset forth in Directive 2014/51/EU (Omnibus/uni00A0II), which amended the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive, as they were previously eligible under the Solvency/uni00A0I regime and were issued prior to the entry into force of Delegated Regulation EU 2015/35 of October/uni00A010, 2014.\n\nThe Company has issued dated subordinated notes ('TSR'), undated subordinated notes ('TSDI') and undated deeply subordinated notes ('TSS'), which include provisions designed to allow the Company to ensure the continuity of its activities in the event its financial position deteriorates.\n\nCertain TSR include clauses which permit or force the Company to defer interest payments. In addition, redemption at maturity is subject to (i) /uni00A0 the prior approval by the Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (the 'ACPR'), and (ii) /uni00A0 the absence of any event/uni00A0(a) making the own funds of the Company and/or the Group insu/ff icient to cover its regulatory capital requirements, or/uni00A0 (b) pursuant to which the Company would have to take specified action in relation to payments under the notes due to its financial condition, or/uni00A0(c) having an adverse e/ff ect on its insurance subsidiaries' claim payments ability.\n\nPursuant to the terms and conditions of AXA's TSDI, the Company may, at its option, under certain circumstances and shall, in other circumstances, defer interest payment ( e.g. , no dividend declared or paid in the preceding Annual Shareholders' Meeting or receipt by the Company or by certain of its principal insurance subsidiaries of a regulatory demand to restore its or their solvency position as the case may be). Payment of deferred interest may become due in certain specified cases ( e.g. , payment of a dividend, notification of the end of a regulatory demand to restore solvency, liquidation of the Company or redemption of the TSDI).\n\nIn particular, most of the Company's TSS include loss absorption mechanisms which provide that under certain circumstances where the Company does not meet its regulatory capital requirements, the principal amount of each of the relevant TSS will be written down. In such event, interest will become payable on the reduced principal amount only. The principal may be reinstated when the Company returns to financial health, as defined under the terms and conditions of the TSS.\n\nIn addition, for most of the Company's TSS, upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the Company's consolidated net earnings and shareholders' equity, the Company is required to defer payment of interest. In such events, the Company may choose to pay such deferred interest by way of alternative coupon settlement mechanisms within five years (such as, issuance of new shares or other securities including TSS or preference shares, sale of treasury shares, or an increase in the principal amount of the relevant notes, subject to applicable limits), failing which the interest is forfeited. However, the settlement of deferred interest becomes due, on a best-e/ff orts basis, in certain circumstances including redemption of the notes, liquidation of the Company, payment of a dividend or interest on any other TSS, any share buy-back outside the Company's buy-back program, or any redemption or repurchase of other TSS.\n\nI\n\nI",

By exception subordinated debt instruments issued by Group subsidiaries are not deemed available at Group level when such instruments, although eligible to cover the issuing entity's SCR, cannot be deemed available to cover the Group's SCR .\n\nThe ACPR currently considers that AXA/uni00A0SA is not subject to requirements relating to financial conglomerates.\n\nFor additional information on regulation and capital requirements, please refer to Section/uni00A07.3 'General Information Regulation and Supervision - Regulatory Capital and Solvency Requirements' of this Annual Report (1) .",

In this context, AXA chose to adopt, in 2008, the Corporate Governance Code for French corporations (Code de gouvernement d'entreprises des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s cot\u00e9es) published by the Afep (Association fran\u00e7aise des entreprises priv\u00e9es) and the Medef (Mouvement des entreprises de France) (the 'Afep-Medef Code'). The Board of Directors believes that AXA's corporate governance practices (i) /uni00A0are in line with the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code (revised in December/uni00A02022 and available on AXA's website/uni00A0and its accompanying guide, and (ii) /uni00A0have followed the evolution of corporate governance practices in France and abroad, as well as the recommendations and standards of shareholders, regulators, the French High Committee for Corporate Governance (Haut Comit\u00e9 de Gouvernement d'Entreprise), proxy advisors, rating agencies and other stakeholders. www.axa.com)\n\n## PRESENTATION OF AXA'S GOVERNANCE\n\n## AXA's corporate governance framework\n\nSince April/uni00A02010, AXA has operated with a unitary Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board is assisted by three Board Committees: the Audit Committee, the Finance &/uni00A0Risk Committee and the Compensation, Governance &/uni00A0Sustainability Committee.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThe Board has adopted internal terms of reference (the 'Board's Terms of Reference') which notably detail the role and responsibilities of the Board and its Committees, as well as matters reserved for Board decisions. The Board's Terms of Reference include corporate governance requirements which, in certain instances, go beyond French regulatory requirements notably in relation to the role of the independent directors on the Board Committees.\n\n## Separation of the positions of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive O/ff icer\n\nThe Board decides whether to combine or separate the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive O/ff icer. In line with its practice since the appointment of Mr./uni00A0Thomas/uni00A0Buberl as Chief Executive O/ff icer in 2016, and the recommendations of the ACPR, the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive O/ff icer are split. Following Mr./uni00A0Denis/uni00A0Duverne's retirement, the Board on April/uni00A028, 2022 (i) /uni00A0 appointed Mr./uni00A0Antoine/uni00A0Gosset-Grainville as Chairman of the Board of Directors to replace Mr./uni00A0Denis/uni00A0Duverne, and (ii) /uni00A0renewed Mr./uni00A0Thomas/uni00A0Buberl's mandate as Chief Executive O/ff icer for a four-year/uni00A0term.",

It also broadens the analytical perspective of the issues discussed at Board meetings.\n\nConsequently, in view of the Group's global presence, the Board of Directors, assisted in this task by its Compensation, Governance &/uni00A0 Sustainability Committee, has set a target to have Board members with diverse nationalities and cultures to ensure a balanced and complementary Board, in terms of gender, expertise, experience and tenure.\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors are generally appointed for a four-year term. On December/uni00A031,/uni00A02022, the Board of Directors comprised seventeen members/uni00A0- nine/uni00A0women and eight/uni00A0men. An overview of the Board of Directors as well as the profile, experience and expertise of each director is provided in pages/uni00A0103 to/uni00A0111 of this Annual Report.\n\nThe objective of this diversity policy is to ensure that, over time, the Board of Directors continues to be composed of members with complementary skills and experience who are collectively able to support the Group's M anagement in executing its strategic plan and defining long-term objectives.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n3",

Candidates shortlisted by the Committee meet with its members, the Chairman of the Board, the Chair of the other Board Committees and the Chief Executive O/ff icer. The Committee then submits its recommendations to the Board of Directors.\n\nThe implementation of the Board of Directors diversity policy is reviewed and monitored each year as part of the Board's selfassessment process. In this respect, the Board notably assesses the selection process for directors and measures the progress made against the predefined diversity targets. The results of this self-assessment are also discussed once a year during a Board meeting.\n\n## RESULTS OBTAINED IN THE PAST YEAR\n\nIn 2022, the Board, having considered these diversity criteria, managed to reinforce the diversity of profiles and expertise amongst directors, while maintaining a balanced representation of men and women within the Board.\n\n## TARGETS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS' DIVERSITY POLICY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Criteria       | Targets                                                              | Implementation and results obtained in past years   | Implementation and results obtained in past years   | Implementation and results obtained in past years                                                                                                                              | Implementation and results obtained in past years   |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Gender balance | At least 40% of directors  of/uni00A0each/uni00A0gender (Target met) | Representation of women on the Board: /uni25A0      | 47                                                  | 9 women (stable compared to 2021) and 8 men (stable compared to 2021)                                                                                                          |                                                     |\n|                |                                                                      | 53                                                  |                                                     | 53  53                                                                                                                                                                         |                                                     |\n|                |                                                                      | requirements.                                       |                                                     | i.e., a rate of 43% of women and 57% of men (excluding directors representing the employees  and the director representing the employee-shareholders) in accordance with legal |                                                     |\n\nI\n\nI",

subsidiaries owned, directly or indirectly, by AXA does not automatically (i) /uni00A0place them in a situation of conflict of interest, or (ii) /uni00A0impair their independence in any way. The Board believes that allowing its members to sit on the b oards of certain Group subsidiaries is beneficial to the Board's overall knowledge and appreciation of the activity, operations, strategy and risk profile of the entire Group. Indeed, directors who hold directorships in subsidiaries may, where appropriate, provide the Board with useful insights and a precise and practical vision of the strategy, operational activities, processes and teams of the concerned subsidiaries, and more generally of the Group's business and organization. Directors who also serve on the b oards of Group subsidiaries, however, are required to abstain from participating in the debates and decisions of the AXA Board which could a/ff ect the interests of the entity in which they hold a directorship to prevent any conflict of interest or potential independence issues.\n\nOn February/uni00A022, 2023, the AXA Board of Directors determined that, on December/uni00A031, 2022, eleven of the seventeen/uni00A0Board members were independent after assessing the criteria of the Afep-Medef Code: Mmes/uni00A0Clotilde/uni00A0Delbos, Rachel/uni00A0Duan, Isabel/uni00A0Hudson, Angelien/uni00A0Kemna, Rachel Picard and Marie-France Tschudin and Messrs./uni00A0Jean-Pierre/uni00A0Clamadieu, Guillaume/uni00A0Faury, Ramon/uni00A0Fernandez, Andr\u00e9/uni00A0Fran\u00e7ois-Poncet and Antoine/uni00A0GossetGrainville.\n\nOne member of the Board of Directors (currently Mrs./uni00A0Helen/uni00A0Browne) is the AXA employee shareholders' representative. This representative is appointed by the shareholders every four years from a list of candidates selected by the Group's employee shareholders, following an internal selection process.\n\nIn addition, since June/uni00A02018, two directors representing the employees, Mmes/uni00A0Martine/uni00A0Bi\u00e8vre and Bettina/uni00A0Cramm, have been members of the AXA Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board of Directors does not have any non-voting members (censors).\n\nI\n\nAXA\n\nI\n\n3",

In addition, the Board inter alia:\n\n- /uni25A0 chooses the appropriate corporate governance framework;\n- /uni25A0 appoints and dismisses the Chairman, any Vice-Chairman/ Senior Independent Director, the Chief Executive O/ff icer, any Deputy Chief Executive O/ff icer, any dirigeant effectif (executive who e/ff ectively runs the Company as required by Solvency/uni00A0II), and determines their respective compensation;\n- /uni25A0 convenes Shareholders' Meetings;\n- /uni25A0 proposes directors for appointment to the Shareholders' Meeting and/or coopts directors to the Board;\n- /uni25A0 reviews and endorses (arr\u00eate) the Company's and the Group's half-year and annual financial statements;\n- /uni25A0 presents a report on corporate governance to the Shareholders' Meeting;\n- /uni25A0 fulfills all the obligations entrusted to it under Solvency/uni00A0II regulations;\n- /uni25A0 sets the risk appetite and overall risk tolerance limits for AXA/uni00A0SA;\n- /uni25A0 reviews the strategies and the policies on the taking, management and monitoring of risks as well as the conclusions of the internal assessment of risks and solvency (ORSA/uni00A0- Own Risk and Solvency Assessment/uni00A0-/uni00A0report);\n- /uni25A0 adopts and oversees the general principles of the Group's Remuneration policy;\n- /uni25A0 proposes Statutory Auditors for appointment to the Shareholders' Meeting and approves non-audit services.\n\nThe Chief Executive O/ff icer, who is also a Board member, is vested with the broadest powers to act in all circumstances on behalf of the Company and to represent the Company in its relationships with third parties. However, the Board of Directors has also reserved the right to approve certain material transactions as set out in its Terms of Reference, including disposals or acquisitions (over \u20ac500/uni00A0million), significant financing operations and any material transaction outside the strategy announced by the Company.\n\n## CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nIn accordance with French law, the Chairman's role is to organize and oversee the work of the Board of Directors. In this context, he sets the agenda of the Board meetings, holds regular discussions with the Chief Executive O/ff icer and the directors, requests any document or information necessary to help the Board of Directors for the preparation of its meetings, verifies the quality of the information provided and more generally, ensures that Board members are in a position to fulfill their role. Prior to each meeting, Board members receive documentation concerning matters to be reviewed, generally eight days in advance of Board meetings.\n\nThe Chairman convenes the members of the Board without directors who are members of the Executive Management being present, in particular to allow debates on the performance and compensation of the Executive Management and succession planning.\n\nMr./uni00A0Denis Duverne's mandate as Chairman of the Board of Directors having ended at the end of the April/uni00A028, 2022 Shareholders' Meeting, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee, unanimously decided to appoint Mr./uni00A0Antoine Gosset-Grainville as Chairman of the Board of Directors to replace him.\n\nBefore taking on his new role, Mr./uni00A0Antoine/uni00A0Gosset-Grainville worked closely with Mr./uni00A0Denis Duverne for over a year. In this context, the Board of Directors decided to align Mr./uni00A0Antoine Gosset-Grainville's mission with that of Mr./uni00A0Denis Duverne as follows/uni00A0 (2) :\n\n- /uni25A0 to promote the Company's values and culture in particular in relation to corporate responsibility and professional ethics;\n- /uni25A0 upon request by the Chief Executive O/ff icer, to represent the Company in its relations, nationally and internationally with public bodies, institutions, regulators, shareholders and the Company's main strategic partners and stakeholders;\n- /uni25A0 to consult with the Chief Executive O/ff icer on major topics and events relating to the Company (including the Company's strategy, major acquisition or divestment projects, significant financial transactions, major community projects and the appointment of the most senior executives of the Group);\n- /uni25A0 upon invitation of the Chief Executive O/ff icer, to take part in internal meetings with Group executives and teams to provide his opinion on strategic issues or projects; and\n- /uni25A0 to assist and advise the Chief Executive O/ff icer.\n\nTo ensure that the personal interests of the members of the Board of Directors and those of the Company are appropriately aligned, the Board's Terms of Reference provide that each member of the Board of Directors (with the exception of the directors representing the employees) must hold, within two years following his/her first appointment, a number of AXA shares with a value at least equal to the gross annual amount of his/her compensation (director's fees) earned in respect of the previous fiscal year/uni00A0 (1) .\n\n(2)\n\nThe role of the Chairman is set out in the Board's Terms of Reference which are available on AXA's website.\n\nI\n\nI",

Under French law, the Chief Executive O/ff icer is solely responsible for the Company's operational leadership and management.\n\n## SENIOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR\n\nFollowing its decision to split the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive O/ff icer in 2016, the Board of Directors decided to maintain the position of Senior Independent Director.\n\nThe Senior Independent Director (Mr./uni00A0Jean-Pierre/uni00A0Clamadieu), replaces the Chairman of the Board of Directors in the event of temporary incapacity or death, chairs meetings of the Board in the absence of the Chairman, acts, if need be, as spokesperson for the independent directors and informs the Chairman of any potential conflict of interest identified. The Senior Independent Director also reviews, with the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the agenda of Board meetings and the quality of information provided to the Board.\n\nIn addition, the Senior Independent Director may convene meetings of independent members of the Board, without the presence of the Chairman and Executive Management, in particular, to assess the performance of the Chairman, review his compensation and prepare his succession plan. He may also request the Chairman to convene the Board on a specific agenda.\n\nThe Senior Independent Director reports on his activities to the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nIn 2022, the Senior Independent Director, also acting as Chairman of the Compensation, Governance &/uni00A0Sustainability Committee:\n\n- /uni25A0 maintained regular dialogue with the Chairman of the Board and with the Executive Management ( i.e., the Chief Executive O/ff icer and the Deputy Chief Executive O/ff icers (Directeurs G\u00e9n\u00e9raux Adjoints) );\n- /uni25A0 was actively involved in the preparation of Board and Committees meetings, working closely with the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Executive Management;\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## 3.1/uni00A0CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE\n\n- /uni25A0 contributed to the selection process of the future members of the Board of Directors and its Committees;\n- /uni25A0 worked closely with the Chairman of the Board on the organization of the annual self-assessment of the Board;\n- /uni25A0 contributed to the review of all communications made to shareholders in particular on corporate governance topics and Executive Management compensation.\n\nHe reported on his activities at the Shareholders' Meeting of April/uni00A028, 2022.\n\n## BOARD ACTIVITIES IN 2022\n\nIn 2022, the Board of Directors met nine times and held four executive sessions without the presence of the Executive Management.\n\nIn 2022, the Board notably focused on:\n\n- /uni25A0 the review of the Group's strategy;\n- /uni25A0 the examination of the 2021 financial statements and the 2022 half-year financial statements;\n- /uni25A0 the capital management;\n- /uni25A0 the review of proposed significant disposals and acquisitions;\n- /uni25A0 the transformation of the Company into a licensed reinsurer in addition to its current activity as Group holding company;\n- /uni25A0 the review of the Board Committee reports;\n- /uni25A0 the  review  of  the  ORSA/uni00A0 -  Own  Risk  and  Solvency Assessment/uni00A0-/uni00A0report and AXA's Internal Model as well as other written policies required under Solvency/uni00A0II;\n- /uni25A0 the Group's Pre-emptive Recovery Plan;\n- /uni25A0 internal control and r isk m anagement;\n- /uni25A0 the setting of AXA SA's risk appetite;\n- /uni25A0 the review of the annual reinsurance programme;\n- /uni25A0 the review of the Group's Corporate Responsibility strategy and environmental policy;\n- /uni25A0 the approval of non-audit services;\n- /uni25A0 the self-assessment of the Board of Directors;\n- /uni25A0 the review of the Terms of Reference of the Board of Directors;\n- /uni25A0 the appointment of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the re-appointments and appointments as well as the independence of its members;\n- /uni25A0 the review of the composition of the Board and its Committees; and\n- /uni25A0 the succession plans for the Chairman of the Board and the Executive Management.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n3",

These sessions mainly focused on the Group's financial structure, strategy, governance, main activities, Solvency/uni00A0II regulations, reinsurance, r isk m anagement, Group IT security, cyber risk, and regulatory developments in the insurance sector.\n\n## SELF-ASSESSMENT OF THE BOARD OF/uni00A0DIRECTORS' ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Board of Directors conducts an annual self-assessment to review its composition, operating procedures, and overall functioning. The conclusions of this self-assessment are discussed annually at the Board of Directors.\n\nSince 2013, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance &/uni00A0Sustainability Committee, has periodically appointed an external consultant to carry out the Board's annual assessment.\n\nIn 2021, the Board self-assessment was carried out by a consultant (SpencerStuart) who collected each of the individual director's inputs, views and suggestions on the Board's work and its performance. Each director's view on other members' participation and contribution to the Board's work was also collected.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nIn 2022, the Board self-assessment was conducted internally, and all directors (except the Chairman of the Board) answered a self-assessment questionnaire and had a meeting with the Chairman of the Board to assess the e/ff ectiveness of the Board and each Board member's contribution. The conclusions of each director's personal contribution were shared by the Chairman of the Board who provided individual feedback during dedicated one-on-one meetings with each Board member.\n\nEach director also had a meeting with the Chairman of the Compensation, Governance &/uni00A0Sustainability Committee to collect his/her assessment and suggestions on the personal contribution of the Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\nDuring its December/uni00A02022 meeting, the Compensation, Governance &/uni00A0Sustainability Committee thoroughly reviewed (i) /uni00A0the conclusions of the Board self-assessment and (ii) /uni00A0the main areas for improvement and made recommendations to the Board of Directors who examined and approved them during the Board meeting of December/uni00A013,/uni00A02022.\n\nThe 2022 self-assessment demonstrated that the directors' perception of the overall functioning of the Board of Directors, including its dynamics and its performance, remained very positive.\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors nevertheless identified the following areas for improvement:\n\n- /uni25A0 dedicate more time in Board agendas to non-financial matters, especially to (i) /uni00A0 HR/Culture, (ii) /uni00A0 ESG, and (iii) /uni00A0 trends/future challenges;\n- /uni25A0 update the Board on the status of the main strategic action points during each meeting;\n- /uni25A0 maintain a yearly session dedicated to the equity story/market perspective;\n- /uni25A0 clarify the allocation of responsibility on ESG-related topics amongst Board's Committees; and\n- /uni25A0 closely monitor the composition of the Board and progressively reduce its size.",

However, under French law, Board Committees do not have any formal decision-making power and are advisory only.\n\nThe Committees may request external consulting expertise if necessary. They may also invite external participants to attend their meetings.\n\nAll Committees are composed of members with expertise in the relevant areas, and their composition is regularly reviewed by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe role, organization and responsibilities of each Committee are set out in the Board's Terms of Reference and in the Audit Committee Terms of Reference available on AXA's website.",

In this context, its main objective is to encourage the achievement of ambitious objectives and the creation of long-term value by setting challenging performance criteria.\n\nAXA's executive compensation structure is based on an in-depth analysis of market practices in France and abroad, within the financial services sector (insurance companies, banks, asset managers,/uni00A0etc.) and of other international groups.\n\nAXA Group's overall policy on executive compensation focuses on the variable part of the compensation package, which is the compensation at risk for beneficiaries. The structure of AXA's executive compensation is composed of a variable portion which represents a significant part of the aggregate compensation. This is designed to align executive compensation more directly with the operational strategy of the Group and the interests of the shareholders while encouraging performance:\n\n- /uni25A0 both on an individual and collective level; and\n- /uni25A0 over the short, medium, and long term.\n\n| Individual  Skills Individual  Performance   | Entity  Performance   | AXA Group  Performance   | AXA Share  Performance   |         |                      |                           | Performance  Shares                      |\n|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|---------|----------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n|                                              | Entity  Performance   | AXA Group  Performance   | AXA Share  Performance   |         |                      | Deferred Variable         | Performance  Shares                      |\n|                                              | Entity  Performance   | AXA Group  Performance   | AXA Share  Performance   |         | Annual Variable      | Annual Variable           | Performance  Shares                      |\n|                                              | Entity  Performance   | AXA Group  Performance   | AXA Share  Performance   | Current | Short term  (1 year) | Medium term (2 - 3 years) | Medium -  Long/uni00A0term (3 - 5 years) |\n\nI",

Their independence is assessed annually by the Board in accordance with the criteria set forth in the Afep-Medef Code. The Senior Independent Director is the Chairman of the Committee and presents the compensation policy of the Company each year at the Shareholders' Meeting.\n\nThe Committee meets frequently with the Group Executives and the departments of the Company including Group Human Resources and Group Legal. The Committee is empowered to undertake or commission specific reviews and to use external consulting expertise to the extent deemed appropriate. Thus, during the last few/uni00A0years, the Committee worked several times with a compensation-consulting firm in order to benefit from an external technical expertise and an independent overview in order to compare AXA's variable compensation practices with general market practices.\n\n## Solvency/uni00A0II Group Remuneration Policy\n\nSolvency/uni00A0II regulations came into force on January/uni00A01, 2016 and include a number of specific compensation and governance requirements applicable to European insurers and reinsurers. In this context, AXA has undertaken a comprehensive review of its existing compensation policies and practices against the requirements of Solvency/uni00A0II and has adopted a Remuneration Policy applicable to all AXA employees as of January/uni00A01, 2016. This Remuneration Policy is designed to support the Group's longterm business strategy and to align the interests of its employees with those of other stakeholders by (i) /uni00A0 establishing a clear link between performance and remuneration over the short, medium and long term, (ii) /uni00A0ensuring that the Group can o/ff er competitive compensation arrangements across the multiple markets in which it operates while avoiding potential conflicts of interest that may lead to undue risk taking for short-term gain, and (iii) /uni00A0 ensuring compliance with Solvency/uni00A0II regulations and any other applicable regulatory requirements.\n\nThe AXA Group Remuneration Policy is designed to:\n\n- /uni25A0 attract, develop, and motivate critical skills and best talents;\n- /uni25A0 drive superior performance;\n- /uni25A0 align compensation levels with business performance;\n- /uni25A0 ensure that employees are not incentivized to take inappropriate and/or excessive risks and that they operate within AXA's overall risk framework; and\n- /uni25A0 ensure compliance of the Group's practices with all applicable regulatory requirements.\n- It follows four main guiding principles:\n- /uni25A0 competitiveness and market consistency of the remuneration practices;\n- /uni25A0 fairness based on individual and collective performance, in order to ensure remuneration is reflecting employee's individual quantitative and qualitative achievements and impact;\n- /uni25A0 internal equity based on remuneration policies and procedures designed to ensure that employees are paid equitably based on objective and justifiable professional criteria (such as but not limited to role, skills, contribution or impact), and do not discriminate on the basis of factors irrelevant to the role duties;\n- /uni25A0 achievement of the Group's overall financial and operational objectives over the short, medium, and long term as well as execution against medium and long-term strategic objectives as a prerequisite to fund any mid-to-long term award.\n\nThe requirements set out in the Group Remuneration Policy may be supplemented in order to comply with local regulatory requirements or best practices. The Policy is reviewed and updated annually to mirror, as the case may be, changes in the internal organization and the nature, scale and complexity of the risks inherent to AXA's business and to reflect exchanges with the French insurance regulator ( Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (ACPR)).\n\n## Remuneration structure\n\nAXA applies a pay-for-performance approach which (i) /uni00A0promotes long-term sustainable performance by incorporating risk adjustment mechanisms in variable compensation schemes, and (ii) /uni00A0 recognizes employees who bring the greatest value to the firm on the basis of financial results while demonstrating individual leadership and behaviors. The intent of this approach is to attract and retain the best skills and talents, to foster employee engagement and to strengthen AXA's leadership.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n3",

Fixed remuneration primarily reflects the relevant organizational responsibility, professional experience, technical and leadership skills required of the role, criticality, or scarcity of skills, as well as the individual's capability to sustainably perform the duties of the role;\n- /uni25A0 a variable component which primarily reflects the business and individual performance, including performance in excess of that required to fulfil the role description. It comprises of an upfront cash element (annual cash bonus) and a deferred element recognizing the importance of aligning remuneration over long-term value creation. The deferred element is awarded through Performance Shares. This variable component depends on the Group's global performance, on the beneficiary's operating business performance, and on the achievement of the executive's individual objectives including demonstrated abilities for leadership. The variable portion is designed to represent a substantial component of the executive's global compensation and, where an executive attains or exceeds the set objectives, to position the compensation levels of AXA executives between the median and the third quartile (or, in certain cases, beyond the third quartile) of the market reference.\n\nThe target level of the executives' compensation and the structure of the elements which compose such compensation are based on a detailed analysis of market practices as well as potential applicable national and international regulations, and also take into consideration various other factors including the equity principles within the Group and the previous compensation level of the executive.\n\nEach year, AXA, with the assistance of specialized firms, conducts compensation reviews in order to ensure the competitiveness and consistency of executives' compensation and to measure the suitability of the Remuneration policies. In this context, three markets are used as a reference:\n\n- /uni25A0 a first market composed of 12/uni00A0companies in the French CAC/uni00A040/uni00A0index (companies selected to form the panel, which may vary from year-to-year, are comparable to AXA in terms of stock capitalization, revenues, sector, number of employees and/or geographic coverage);\n- /uni25A0 a second market composed exclusively of international financial companies comparable in size and scope to the AXA Group (mainly insurance companies and banks) which are principally based in the main European markets (France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Spain and Switzerland);\n- /uni25A0 a third market composed exclusively of international financial companies comparable in size and scope to the AXA Group (mainly insurance companies and banks) which are principally based in the United States and Asia.\n\n## Annual cash compensation\n\n## TOTAL TARGET COMPENSATION\n\n## Total target compensation of the Chief Executive O/ff icer\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer's total target compensation is composed of a fixed annual compensation and a target annual variable compensation.\n\nIn connection with the renewal of Mr./uni00A0Buberl's mandate as Chief Executive O/ff icer decided on April/uni00A028, 2022, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance &/uni00A0Sustainability Committee, reviewed his compensation package remained unchanged since 2016, and decided to increase, as of this date, his annual fixed compensation to \u20ac1,650,000 and his annual target variable compensation to \u20ac1,750,000, i.e. 106% of his fixed annual compensation/uni00A0 (1) . The total annual cash compensation target of the Chief Executive O/ff icer was therefore set at \u20ac3,400,000 as of April/uni00A028, 2022 and was adjusted on a pro rata temporis basis as of this date.\n\nThe Board of Directors decided that, in accordance with the Company's past practice, this new compensation package would remain unchanged for the Chief Executive O/ff icer's entire term of o/ff ice ( i.e., until 2026). When establishing the Chief Executive O/ff  icer's new compensation package, the Board therefore made sure that it was balanced and aligned with the interests of the shareholders in order for it to remain competitive throughout this period.\n\nThe total amount of compensation of the Chief Executive O/ff icer and the balance between its di/ff erent components (fixed and variable) are mainly based on a study by an external advisory firm (Willis Towers Watson) on compensation practices for similar positions within a sample of CAC/uni00A040/uni00A0companies as well as AXA's main European and international competitors (insurance companies, banks), and follows the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code, the G20, the European Commission and the Financial Stability Board in terms of compensation.\n\n## Total compensation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors, upon proposal from its Compensation, Governance &/uni00A0Sustainability Committee, decided to maintain unchanged the amount of Mr./uni00A0Denis Duverne's fixed annual compensation as Chairman of the Board of Directors at \u20ac1,200,000 for 2022. This annual fixed compensation was adjusted on a pro rata temporis basis until April/uni00A028, 2022, date on which Mr./uni00A0Denis Duverne's mandate as Chairman of the Board ended.\n\nThe mandate of Mr./uni00A0Denis Duverne, Chairman of the Board of Directors, having expired at the end of the Shareholders' Meeting of April/uni00A028, 2022, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance &/uni00A0Sustainability Committee, decided to appoint Mr./uni00A0Antoine Gosset-Grainville as his successor.

This metric is measured based on (i) /uni00A0 underlying earnings per share, (ii) /uni00A0 cash remittance, (iii) /uni00A0a sustainability indicator (reduction in Group carbon footprint in General Account assets), and (iv) /uni00A0 the Net Promoter Score (customer recommendation index). The relative weight of each indicator is respectively 45%, 25%, 15% and 15%.\n\nThe evolution of the choice and weight of the financial and extra-financial indicators of the Group performance is part of a global review destined to simplify and closer align this performance with the Group's strategic orientations, while taking into account regulatory constraints, including the further weight of extra-financial elements.\n\nThe financial and extra-financial indicators chosen to measure the Group performance are directly linked to the Group's strategic orientations. They reflect objectives for growth, capital management, sustainability and customer proximity and rely on the achievement of a predefined budget or target.\n\nI\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## 3.2/uni00A0EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND/uni00A0SHARE/uni00A0OWNERSHIP\n\nSome of these indicators (underlying earnings per share and cash remittance) are identical to share-based compensation indicators, in order to align part of the performance criteria of the short- and long-term compensation with the objectives of the strategic plan and to measure them on di/ff erent time scales through di/ff erent acquisition schedules.\n\n- /uni25A0 Individual performance for 30%, which is evaluated based on objectives specifically related to strategic initiatives set and reviewed each year.\n- The Chief Executive O/ff icer's individual performance is assessed based on (i) /uni00A0various indicators and qualitative and quantifiable objectives determined by the Board of Directors in a target letter agreed at the beginning of the year, and (ii) /uni00A0demonstrated leadership abilities. The target letter includes detailed objectives related to the Group's progress in the implementation of its strategic plan as well as other performance indicators and objectives assessing the achievement of global strategic initiatives and/or related to certain geographic areas, as well as progress on investments that are expected to contribute to the development of the Group's operations.\n\nTo evaluate Mr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl's individual performance in 2022, the Board of Directors assessed the achievement of the following objectives set in his target letter:\n\n- \u00b7 Execute strategic business priorities (achievement rate: 105%)\n- Over the course of 2022, the Group has made significant progress in implementing its strategic priorities, with major achievements in key markets, including:\n- \u00b7 AXA XL: important progress in re-underwriting its portfolio with a reduction of its overall risk profile, in particular with respect to the natural catastrophe risk. This reduction was evidenced by AXA XL's strong results despite a turbulent environment in 2022/uni00A0that included the war in Ukraine and very significant natural catastrophes. AXA XL has also completed a strategic review of potential new growth opportunities, including an initiative focused on the mid-market segments in Europe and in the US.\n- \u00b7 AXA IM performed well in 2022 despite the turbulent market environment and reinforced its franchise as a leading alternative asset manager with (i) /uni00A0 the acquisition of a controlling interest in private debt manager Capza, (ii) /uni00A0 the launch of AXA IM Prime, its new fund of funds business, and (iii) /uni00A0continued strong organic growth. At year-end 2022, AXA IM had/uni00A0\u20ac220/uni00A0billion/uni00A0of alternative assets under management.\n- \u00b7 FY2022 results confirmed the relevance of the Group's new global employee benefits (EB) strategy, with EB revenues above budget at +17% and strong momentum in all major entities.

Regular global surveys have enabled targeted adjustments and shown strong support from the Group's global employee population (81% confidence in the strategic direction, e-NPS (Employee Net Promoter) score at 35 as of November/uni00A02022).\n- \u00b7 The Group also enhanced its global health program, which includes access to telemedicine, coverage of certain serious\n\nI\n\nillnesses and prevention modules, now available to 85% of AXA employees.\n\n- \u00b7 Finally, AXA conducted a new global inclusion survey in 2022 which revealed continued progress with an inclusion NPS up 3/uni00A0points to 40 and 86% of employees feeling included.\n- \u00b7 Personal development of the Chief Executive Officer (achievement rate: 110%)\n- \u00b7 In 2022, Thomas Buberl enrolled in a peer-to-peer coaching program for international CEOs, while internally, leveraging on his two deputy CEOs to make time for coaching/development of other Management Committee members.\n- \u00b7 As COVID travel restrictions were progressively li/f\\_t ed, Thomas Buberl resumed visits to AXA entities worldwide, embedding meetings with talents during each of these visits.\n- \u00b7 Thomas Buberl also personally engaged to help drive greater gender diversity at the top, notably supporting the achievement of 40% of women in the Group's Global Leadership Network  as of January/uni00A02023.\n\nEach of these two metrics (Group Performance and Individual Performance) is evaluated separately so that the overall variable payout reflects performance against two distinct components assessed independently. Each of these two metrics is in any case capped at a 130% achievement rate.\n\nThe determination of the actual amount of variable compensation to be paid to the Chief Executive O/ff icer is based on the following additive formula: Variable compensation due = Target Variable compensation x (70% Group Performance + 30% Individual Performance).\n\nSince the 2020/uni00A0performance year, the weight of the Group Performance within the variable compensation assessment has increased to 70% (from 50% previously) leading to a decrease of the Individual Performance weight to 30%. Through this change, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance &/uni00A0Sustainability Committee, wanted to strengthen the formulaic/quantitative component of the Chief Executive O/ff icer's variable compensation, in line with market practices in France and abroad, as well as feedback received from a number of institutional investors. Similarly, in order to take into account the comments of some institutional investors, the level of transparency of each Group Performance indicator has been improved to indicate not only the target for each criterion but also the relevant floor and cap as well as the related level of payout.",

The Board of Directors also decided to (i) eliminate the payout floor (previously set at 80% of the deferred\n\nI\n\nI\n\namount) to emphasize the 'at risk' nature of this component, and\n\n(ii) /uni00A0increase the payout cap (from 120% to 130%) in the event of superior share price performance.\n\nUnder this mechanism, the Chief Executive O/ff icer's deferred amount of annual effective variable compensation for the 2022/uni00A0fiscal year will be paid out in three tranches, in 2024, 2025/uni00A0and 2026. The actual amount to be paid will vary depending on the performance of the AXA share price over the deferral period and will be subject to a cap at 130% of the deferred amount; provided, however that no deferred variable compensation would be paid",

In this context, the number of LTIs granted is set so that the executives are between the median and the 3 rd /uni00A0quartile of market references considering the global amount of the variable part (comprised of one part in cash and one part in LTIs). The Compensation, Governance &/uni00A0Sustainability Committee and the Board of Directors however ensure that the Performance Shares granted to the Group executives and valued in accordance with IFRS standards are not disproportionate compared to the aggregate compensation and shares granted to the executives concerned.\n\nThese Performance Shares are integrally subject to performance conditions (please refer to pages/uni00A0137 /uni00A0and following) and therefore do not guarantee any grant or minimal gain for the beneficiaries.\n\nAll the amounts presented in this Section/uni00A03.2/uni00A0are gross amounts and before taxation.\n\n## SUMMARY OF COMPENSATION, OPTIONS AND PERFORMANCE SHARES GRANTED TO/uni00A0MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE MEMBERS\n\n## MEMBERS OF THE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE\n\n|                                                               | Year 2021   | Year 2021                                       | Year 2021                                    | Year 2021                                                       | Year 2021                                                                      | Year 2021   | Year 2022         | Year 2022                                                                                     | Year 2022                                                        | Year 2022                                                                      | Year 2022              |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| (in Euro)                                                     | Country     | Compen- sation granted in  respect of  the year | Value of  options  granted  during  the year | Value of  performance  shares  granted  during  the/uni202Fyear | Value of  international  performance  shares  granted  during  the/uni202Fyear | Total       |                   | Compen- sation  granted in  respect of  the year Value of  options  granted  during  the year | Value of  performance  shares  granted  during  the /uni202Fyear | Value of  international  performance  shares  granted  during  the/uni202Fyear | Total                  |\n| Thomas  Buberl Chief Executive  O/ff icer                     | France      | 3,176,645/uni00A0 (a)                           | -                                            | 1,938,986                                                       | -                                                                              | 5,115,631   | 3,421,342/uni00A0 | (a) -                                                                                         | 1,910,398                                                        | -                                                                              | 5,331,740 /uni00A0 (b) |\n| Total of the other  Management Committee  members/uni00A0 (c) |             | 20,183,821                                      | -                                            | 2,609,825                                                       | 4,174,232                                                                      | 26,967,877  | 23,981,808        | -                                                                                             | 6,473,424                                                        | 4,963,255                                                                      | 35,418,487             |\n\nOn each date of grant, the fair value of stock options and Performance Shares is determined in accordance with IFRS standards.

This compensation consists of \u20ac500,386 of fixed compensation and \u20ac381,000/uni00A0of variable compensation.\n\n- /uni25A0 a fixed amount determined by the Board of Directors shall be paid annually to the Senior Independent Director (set at \u20ac80,000);\n- /uni25A0 65% of the remaining amount shall be allocated to the Board as follows: 40% shall be divided equally among Board members and paid as a fixed fee, and 60% shall be paid according to Board attendance;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\nMrs./uni00A0Angelien Kemna received in 2022/uni00A0directors' fees of \u20ac90,000/uni00A0in respect of her non-executive mandate in a Group subsidiary (AXA Investment Managers/uni00A0SA).\n\nIn 2022, since his appointment as director on the AXA Board of Directors, Mr. G\u00e9rald Harlin received a gross amount of \u20ac103,407 with respect to his non-executive mandates in Group subsidiaries (AXA Investment Managers SA, AXA XL US, AXA France IARD and AXA France Vie).\n\n## Shares subject to performance conditions (Performance/uni00A0shares and international performance shares, restricted shares and international restricted shares)\n\nShares subject to performance conditions are designed to recognize and motivate the Group's best talents and core skills by aligning the individuals' interests with the overall performance of the AXA Group, and the corresponding operational entity/ business unit as well as with the stock performance of the AXA share over the medium-long term. Shares subject to performance conditions generally result in low shareholder dilution due to the possibility to deliver existing shares, this choice being the one made up to this date.\n\nSince 2022, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance &/uni00A0Sustainability Committee, may grant Performance Shares to Senior Management/uni00A0 (1) , including members of the Management Committee and Restricted Shares to other beneficiaries.\n\nPerformance Shares and Restricted Shares are usually granted to beneficiaries residing in France, while International Performance Shares and international Restricted Shares are generally granted to beneficiaries residing outside of France.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## GRANT PROCEDURE\n\nWithin the multi-annual cap authorized by the Shareholders' Meeting, the Board of Directors approves all programs of shares subject to performance conditions prior to their implementation.\n\nEach year, the Board of Directors, acting upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance &/uni00A0Sustainability Committee, approves a pool of global performance shares to be granted subject to performance.\n\nThe recommendations for grants of shares subject to performance conditions are made by the management of each operating business and by the Group's functional department heads. These recommendations are reviewed by the Executive Management to ensure a global coherence and respect of the Group's internal equity principles. The amount and nature of individual share grants (in the form of Performance Shares or Restricted Shares) subject to performance conditions are then decided by the Board of Directors, provided that individual grants to the Chief Executive O/ff icer and\n\n## 3.2/uni00A0EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND/uni00A0SHARE/uni00A0OWNERSHIP\n\n- /uni25A0 the remaining 35% shall be allocated by the Board of Directors to the Board Committees as follows: 25% to the Finance &/uni00A0 Risk Committee, 25% to the Compensation, Governance &/uni00A0Sustainability Committee, and 50% to the Audit Committee. Each Committee shall then allocate such amount to its members as follows: 40% shall be divided equally amongst members and paid as a fixed fee, and 60% shall be paid according to Committee attendance, with the Chair of the Committee receiving in each case a double fee.\n\n3",

Furthermore, the grant to AXA executive o/ff icers shall depend on the level of achievement of the strategic objectives previously defined by the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Company, in line with market best practices, applies a regular and consistent formula to determine the number of shares to be granted each year to the beneficiaries.\n\nThe Board of Directors also decided that the total number of performance shares granted to the Company's executive o/ff icers each year may not exceed 10% of the aggregate number of shares subject to performance conditions (Performance Shares and Restricted Shares) granted during the same year, to avoid an excessive concentration of performance shares granted to the executive o/ff icers.\n\nSince 2020, the annual grant of shares subject to performance conditions occurs in March in order to simplify the structure of the senior executives' total variable compensation, so that they are granted (i) /uni00A0a variable compensation in the form of cash (annual bonus), and (ii) /uni00A0shares during the same month.\n\n## RULES REGARDING SHARES SUBJECT TO/uni00A0 PERFORMANCE  CONDITIONS\n\nEach beneficiary receives an initial preliminary allocation of shares subject to performance conditions (Performance Shares or Restricted Shares) which is then used as a reference to calculate the number of shares that will be definitely granted at the end of a 3-year performance period.\n\n(1)\n\nI\n\nI\n\nDuring the performance period, all shares subject to performance conditions initially granted are integrally subject to performance criteria regardless of the beneficiary's status.\n\n## Performance Shares SNFP\n\nFor the Performance Shares granted in 2022, the Board of Directors has reviewed, upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance &/uni00A0Sustainability Committee, the nature of the performance conditions as well as the level of corresponding targets, allowing an alignment with the strategic orientations of the Group whilst meeting with regulatory requirements, including a greater consideration of extra-financial criteria. Therefore, the Board of Directors resolved to replace the performance criterion relating to the carbon footprint of the Group's General Account assets, being used as a performance condition for the Chief Executive O/ff icer's variable cash compensation, with a new criterion, also counting for 10%, and related to Inclusion and Diversity (portion of women within the Group's executive population)/uni00A0 (1) .\n\nFor the Performance Shares granted in 2022, the global performance rate was calculated as follows: 30% performance of the operating business (cash remittance) + 30% performance of the operating business (underlying earnings) + 10% sustainability strategy (S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment) (DJSI) + 10% sustainability strategy (operations carbon emission) + 10% sustainability strategy (Inclusion and Diversity/uni00A0- portion of women within the Group's executive population) + 10% Group financial relative performance (TSR), all capped at 130%.",

The Performance Shares granted to the Chief Executive O/ff icer will remain acquired at the end of a three-year acquisition period, with the entirety of the acquired shares restricted from sale during a two-year holding period.\n\nThe amounts corresponding to International Performance Shares and International Restricted Shares are operating expenses during the vesting period. They do not create any dilution for shareholders as no new shares are issued. The payment is made in shares. Should this type of payment not be possible for legal, tax or any other reason, the payment could be made in cash.\n\n## Restricted Shares\n\nSince 2022, the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation from its Compensation, Governance &/uni00A0Sustainability Committee, may grant Restricted Shares to Group employees who are not senior managers. For Restricted Shares beneficiaries, the sole performance condition is the achievement of an average result of AXA's score in the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment/uni00A0(DJSI), calculated over the performance period,\n\n## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\n\n## 3.2/uni00A0EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND/uni00A0SHARE/uni00A0OWNERSHIP\n\ngreater than or equal to the 75 th /uni00A0percentile. Should AXA's average score, calculated over the performance period, be equal to the 50 th /uni00A0percentile, only half of the shares initially granted would be acquired. Finally, should AXA's average score, calculated over the performance period, be lower than the 50 th /uni00A0percentile, no shares would be granted. This scheme does not guarantee a minimum gain to the beneficiaries. Among the di/ff erent performance levels, the number of shares definitively granted is calculated on a linear basis depending on the achieved performance.\n\nFor Performance Shares and Restricted Shares, the achievement rate of the performance criterion (performance rate) is used to determine the number of AXA shares that will be definitively acquired by the beneficiaries at the end of the acquisition period, under the condition that the beneficiary is still employed by the AXA Group. The number of AXA shares definitively granted shall therefore be equal to the number of rights to AXA shares initially granted multiplied by the performance rate, which may not exceed 130% for the Performance Shares and 100% for the Restricted Shares. Furthermore, for the Performances Shares and Restricted Shares, should no dividend be proposed for payment (outside regulatory constraints) by the Board of Directors to the Company shareholders for any of the fiscal years of the performance period, the number of shares definitively acquired would be automatically divided by two.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n3",

The purpose of these grants was to associate them with AXA's share price performance and encourage their performance over the long term. In 2019, a/f\\_t er having progressively reduced the number of stock options beneficiaries over the past few years, AXA's Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance &/uni00A0Sustainability Committee, in order to simplify AXA's compensation policy and in line with market practice and feedback received from a number of institutional investors, decided to cease awarding stock options to corporate o/ff icers and AXA employees.\n\nPrevious plans are still valid until their expiration (maximum duration period of 10/uni00A0years). They were granted at market value, with no discount, and become exercisable by tranches, generally in thirds between 3/uni00A0and 5/uni00A0years following the grant date.\n\nPursuant to the stock option plan rules, beneficiaries who resign from the Group lose the right to exercise their options.\n\nOn December/uni00A031, 2022, 149/uni00A0AXA employees held a total of 7,724,593/uni00A0outstanding options, representing  0.33% of the Company's share capital on the same date.\n\n## PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS\n\nAll options granted to all members of the Management Committee until 2018/uni00A0were subject to performance condition. This performance condition also applied to the last tranche of each option grant ( i.e., the last third of the options granted) for all other beneficiaries of options.\n\nI\n\nI",

No option submitted to such performance condition can be exercised as long as this criterion has not been reached. This external performance condition subjects the acquisition of the right to exercise the options to the achievement of a fully objective and public performance and allows to measure the relative performance of AXA compared to its main European competitors over a period of at least three/uni00A0years.\n\nIf the performance condition has not been met at the expiry date of the options, these options are automatically cancelled.\n\nFurthermore, the Board of Directors decided that a second performance condition would apply to all options granted in 2017/uni00A0and 2018, pursuant to which beneficiaries would not be able to exercise their stock options in the event the net income of the Group is negative, and for as long as it remains.\n\n## STOCK OPTIONS PLAN SUMMARY\n\n| Date of the Shareholders' Meeting                           | 27/04/2011                                          | 27/04/2011                                          | 27/04/2011                                          | 27/04/2011                                          | 23/04/2014                                          | 23/04/2014                                          |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Grant date (Board of Directors  or/uni00A0Management Board) | 16/03/2012                                          | 13/06/2012                                          | 22/03/2013                                          | 24/03/2014                                          | 19/06/2015                                          | 06/06/2016                                          |\n| Total number of beneficiaries                               | 467                                                 | 1                                                   | 162                                                 | 158                                                 | 148                                                 | 158                                                 |\n| Total number of shares to be subscribed/uni00A0 (a)         | 4,508,380                                           | 76,089                                              | 3,480,637                                           | 3,100,000                                           | 3,014,469                                           | 3,323,259                                           |\n| or purchased, from which to be subscribed                   |                                                     |                                                     |                                                     |                                                     |                                                     |                                                     |\n| or purchased by:                                            |                                                     |                                                     |                                                     |                                                     |                                                     |                                                     |\n| Corporate o/ff icers:                                       |                                                     |                                                     |                                                     |                                                     |                                                     |                                                     |\n| Thomas Buberl                                               | -

These shares shall be held during his entire term of o/ff ice as Chief Executive O/ff icer;\n- /uni25A0 for Performance Shares granted, the Chief Executive O/ff icer must, at every Performance Share acquisition date, hold in registered form at least 25% of the Performance Shares acquired during his entire term of o/ff ice as Chief Executive O/ff icer.\n\nThese restrictions do not apply if the Chief Executive O/ff icer complies with his Minimum Shareholding Requirement.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n3",

Mr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl, as well as all other employees of AXA Group entities in France, participate in a mandatory and collective supplementary pension scheme with defined contributions (collective insurance contract/uni00A0-/uni00A0 contrat d'assurance de Groupe as defined in A rticle/uni00A0L.141- 1/uni00A0of the French Insurance Code). This AXA pension fund was implemented in 2011/uni00A0and benefits to the employees of AXA Group entities in France falling within the scope of the Collective Agreement of December/uni00A018, 2009. The individual employer contribution rate is set at 0.75% of the total gross compensation, which is not capped. The contribution base is the same as the one used for contributions related to the Social Security General Scheme. Contributions are subject to 9.7% social charges (9.2% for CSG and 0.5% for CRDS).\n\n## Retirement performance shares\n\nSince December/uni00A02016, AXA has implemented a retirement performance shares plan which benefits all executive employees (directeurs) of AXA Group entities in France including the Chief Executive O/ff icer, Mr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl.\n\nIt provides beneficiaries with portable pension benefits until retirement in line with Directive 2014/50/UE/of the European Parliament and of the Council of April/uni00A016, 2014,/uni00A0on minimum requirements for enhancing worker mobility between Member States by improving the acquisition and preservation of supplementary pension rights.\n\nThese performance shares are subject to (i) /uni00A0an acquisition period of three/uni00A0years, and (ii) /uni00A0 an obligation to hold the shares until retirement, provided that the beneficiaries may sell all or part of their shares for diversification purposes (following the three-year acquisition period), as long as the sale proceeds are invested in a long-term savings plan until the beneficiary's retirement.\n\nI\n\nThe definitive acquisition of these performance shares is subject to (i) /uni00A0 the beneficiary's presence in the AXA Group on December/uni00A031/uni00A0of the year during which the grant is decided, and (ii) /uni00A0the achievement of a performance condition related to the average AXA Group Solvency/uni00A0II ratio calculated during the performance period.\n\nFor all beneficiaries, to benefit from the totality of performance shares initially granted, the average AXA Group Solvency/uni00A0II ratio calculated during the performance period must be greater than or equal to 170%. However, if the average ratio is 150%, only half of the shares initially granted will be acquired. No shares will be acquired if the average ratio is below 150%. No minimum number of shares is guaranteed.\n\nBetween these performance levels, the number of shares definitely acquired is calculated on a linear basis depending on the achieved performance.\n\nIn the event that no dividend would be proposed for payment (outside regulatory constraint) by the Board of Directors to the Company shareholders for any of the fiscal years of the performance period, the number of shares definitively acquired shall be automatically divided by two.\n\nThe Board of Directors also decided that no more than 10% of the total number of shares granted during any fiscal year should be granted to AXA's executive o/ff icers, to avoid an excessive concentration of retirement performance shares granted to the executive o/ff icers.\n\nOn December/uni00A013, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a grant of retirement performance shares. Accordingly, 635,282 retirement performance shares were granted to 491 o/ff icers, which represent 0.027% of the outstanding share capital on the date of the grant, of which 18,381/uni00A0retirement performance shares were granted to AXA's Chief Executive O/ff icer representing 2.9% of the total grant.\n\nAll retirement performance shares granted are subject to the performance conditions described above and calculated over a three-year period beginning on January/uni00A01, 2022 and ending on December/uni00A031, 2024.",

In this context, the Board of Directors was concerned that the decision of Mr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl to renounce his employment contract in accordance with the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code would jeopardize the continuity of his accrued and future social benefits.\n\nAs a result, on August/uni00A02, 2016, the Board of Directors took the following decisions:\n\n- /uni25A0 the Board of Directors authorized that, following the termination of his employment contract, Mr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl would continue to have social benefits (Health insurance, Life insurance, Disability insurance,/uni00A0etc.) on terms equivalent to those of all other Group senior employees of the AXA Group in France;\n- /uni25A0 the Board of Directors authorized a contractual severance benefit for Mr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl designed to replicate the benefits to which he would have been entitled as AXA employee under the 1993/uni00A0collective agreement covering director-level employees of the insurance sector, but with the addition of performance conditions in accordance with the Afep-Medef recommendations. A severance benefit would be applicable, except in the case of gross or willful misconduct, solely in the event of dismissal or non-renewal further to the Board of Directors' decision. The payment of the severance benefit would be subject to the three following performance conditions as determined by the Board of Directors during its August/uni00A02, 2016, meeting: (i) /uni00A0achievement, for at least 2/uni00A0of the 3/uni00A0preceding\n\nfiscal/uni00A0years, of the objectives set for the beneficiary's variable compensation and corresponding to the payment of at least 60% of his variable compensation target, (ii) /uni00A0evolution of the AXA share price at least equal to the stock reference index of the insurance sector (SXIP) (in percentage) over a 3-year period preceding the termination of the term of o/ff ice, and (iii) /uni00A0the average consolidated adjusted ROE over the 3/uni00A0preceding/uni00A0years higher than or equal to 5%.\n\nThe amount of severance benefit to be paid to the beneficiary would be adjusted in accordance with the level of achievement against these performance conditions: 100% of the severance benefit will be paid if at least two of the three performance conditions are met; 40% of the severance benefit will be paid if only one performance condition is met; and no severance benefit shall be paid if none of the performance conditions are met. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if only two of the three performance conditions are met, the amount of severance benefit will be reduced by 50% if performance condition (i) /uni00A0above is not met or if AXA's consolidated net income for the preceding fiscal year is negative.\n\nNo severance benefit will be paid if the beneficiary is entitled to a pension scheme within the 6/uni00A0months following his termination.\n\nThe initial amount of the severance benefit is equal to 12/uni00A0months of the average compensation (fixed and variable) paid during the 24-month period preceding termination. One month should then be added to the initial amount of the severance benefit for each additional year of future service up to a maximum cap of 24/uni00A0months.\n\nThese commitments were approved by AXA's Shareholders' Meeting . They took e/ff ect upon Mr./uni00A0Thomas Buberl's e/ff ective renunciation of his employment contract on September/uni00A01, 2016, and will continue as such for the duration of his mandate and under any potential renewed mandates.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n3",

The Committee is also empowered to undertake or commission specific reviews by external experts when deemed appropriate. Such reviews allow the Committee to benefit from a technical expertise and independent insights in comparing AXA's compensation practices with general market practice.\n\n## COMPENSATION POLICY FOR THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\n## Guiding principles of AXA's compensation policy\n\nAXA's compensation policy is designed to support the Company's long-term business strategy and to align the interests of its management with those of its shareholders and all other stakeholders by (i) /uni00A0establishing a close relation between performance and compensation over the short, medium and long term, (ii) /uni00A0 ensuring that the Group can o/ff er competitive compensation that is consistent with the various markets in which it operates while avoiding potential conflicts of interests that may lead to undue risk/uni00A0taking for short-term gain, and (iii) /uni00A0ensuring compliance of the Company's practices with all applicable regulatory requirements.\n\nAXA's compensation policy notably aims to:\n\n- /uni25A0 attract, develop and motivate critical skills and best talents;\n- /uni25A0 drive superior performance; and\n- /uni25A0 align compensation levels with the Company's results.\n\n## Structure and criteria for determining the/uni00A0Chief Executive O/ff icer's compensation\n\nIn this context, the compensation policy for the Chief Executive O/ff icer is based on a pay-for-performance approach which (i) /uni00A0requires the achievement of challenging financial and operational targets that are defined and aligned with the Group's strategy, (ii) /uni00A0promotes long-term sustainable performance while incorporating risk adjustment measures in performance metrics, and (iii) /uni00A0 determines the e/ff  ective amount of the actual individual compensation on the basis of both financial and extra-financial results.\n\nThus, the 'at-risk' portion of the Chief Executive O/ff icer's total compensation (variable cash compensation and share-based compensation) represents a significant component of his compensation structure to align his compensation more directly with the operational strategy of the Group and the interests of the shareholders.\n\nThe di/ff erent components of the Chief Executive O/ff icer's total compensation are presented in detail herea/f\\_t er:\n\n## FIXED ANNUAL COMPENSATION OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\nThe determination of the amount of the Chief Executive O/ff icer's fixed compensation is based on an in-depth analysis of market practices as well as applicable national and international regulations. It also takes into consideration various other factors such as experience, skills, as well as the criticality and scarcity of such skills, and the Group's fairness principles or the individual's compensation history.\n\nThe Board of Directors, relying in particular on a study carried out by an independent external advisory firm (Willis Towers Watson) regarding compensation practices for similar functions in a panel of CAC/uni00A040 companies as well as AXA's main European and international competitors (insurance companies, banks), and upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance &/uni00A0Sustainability Committee, decided to maintain unchanged, for 2023, the amount of the Chief Executive O/ff icer's annual fixed compensation, at \u20ac1.65/uni00A0million.\n\nI\n\nI",

No minimum payment is guaranteed to the Chief Executive O/ff icer.\n\nIn order to determine the Chief Executive O/ff icer's target annual variable compensation, the Board of Directors sought to establish a balanced structure between the fixed part and the variable part of his cash compensation.\n\nThus, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance &/uni00A0Sustainability Committee, and following a comparative review of national, European, international and industry practices, decided to maintain unchanged, for 2023, the Chief Executive O/ff icer's target annual variable compensation, at \u20ac1.75/uni00A0million, i.e., 106% of the amount of his fixed annual compensation.\n\nThe Chief Executive O/ff icer's total e/ff ective variable compensation may not exceed 130% of his target variable compensation, i.e., 138% of his fixed annual compensation.\n\nThe evaluation of the Chief Executive O/ff icer's individual performance with respect to the 2023 fiscal year will be based on the following two components, each of them capped at a 130% achievement rate:\n\n- /uni25A0 T he Group's performance, evaluated on the basis of (i) /uni00A0underlying earnings per share, (ii) /uni00A0cash remittance, (iii) /uni00A0the reduction in Group carbon footprint in General Account assets, and (iv) /uni00A0the Net Promoter Score (customer recommendation index). The relative weight of each indicator will, respectively, be 45%, 25%, 15% and 15%. Each of the indicators will be capped at a 130% achievement rate.\n- T he financial and extra-financial indicators chosen to measure the Group performance are directly linked to the Group's strategic orientations. They reflect objectives for growth, capital management, sustainability and customer proximity and rely on the achievement of a predefined budget or target. Some of these indicators (underlying earnings per share and cash remittance) are identical to sharebased compensation indicators in order to align part of the performance criteria of the short- and long-term compensation with the objectives of the strategic plan and to measure them on di/ff erent time scales through di/ff erent acquisition schedules.\n- /uni25A0 I ndividual performance, based on (i) /uni00A0 various indicators and qualitative and quantifiable objectives determined by the Board o f Directors in a target letter drawn up at the beginning of the year, and (ii) /uni00A0 demonstrated leadership abilities by the Chief Executive O/ff icer. The target letter includes detailed objectives related to the Group's progress in the implementation of its strategic plan as well as other performance indicators and objectives assessing the achievement of global strategic initiatives or related to certain geographic areas, as well as progress on investments that are expected to contribute to the development of the Group's operations.\n- With respect to the 2023 fiscal year, the Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance &/uni00A0Sustainability Committee, set the four following objectives: (i) /uni00A0successfully deliver on the last year of 'Driving Progress 2023' /uni00A0strategic plan, especially on the financial targets and ESG objectives (weighing for 35%), (ii) /uni00A0 design AXA Group's new strategic plan 2024-2026 (weighing for 15%), (iii) /uni00A0manage continued stability in the Management Committee with solid succession plans and drive progress on D&I amongst leadership teams (weighing for 25%), and (iv) /uni00A0 continue to assess opportunities to optimize the perimeter of the Group, including in-force transactions, simplification initiatives and bolt-on acquisitions (weighing for 25%).\n\nEach of these two components will be evaluated separately so that the Chief Executive O/ff icer's overall variable pay-out reflects his performance against two distinct components assessed independently.\n\nWith respect to the 2023 fiscal year, the determination of the actual amount of variable compensation to be paid to the Chief Executive O/ff icer will therefore be based on the addition of two components: the Group performance for 70% and the individual performance for 30%.\n\nTo ensure that AXA remains aligned with current market practice and regulations within the financial industry, both in France and abroad, the Board of Directors decided to continue to use a deferral mechanism with respect to the Chief Executive O/ff icer's variable annual compensation.\n\nUnder this mechanism, the payment of 30% of his actual variable annual compensation will be deferred over a 3-year period paid out in 3 tranches and will remain subject to performance conditions. The deferred amount e/ff ectively paid out will vary accordingly depending on the performance of the AXA share price over the deferral period, i.e., 3-year, within the limit of a cap at 130% of the deferred amount but without a floor. No deferred variable compensation would be paid (i) /uni00A0 in the event that the Group's underlying earnings are negative for the year ending immediately prior to the year of the scheduled payout, or (ii) /uni00A0 in case of resignation or dismissal, for gross or willful misconduct prior to the payout date.\n\nIn case of significant change a/ff ecting the calculation of the Group's economic parameters (significant patrimonial transaction approved by the Board of Directors, change in accounting standards\u2026), the Board would be able to calculate the parameters mutatis mutandis, i.e., without taking into account extraordinary external elements.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n3",

However, the value of the performance shares granted to the Chief Executive O/ff icer as determined in accordance with the IFRS standards may not in any event exceed half of his total compensation.\n\nThe Board of Directors also decided that the number of LTI allocated to the Company's corporate o/ff icers may not exceed 10% of the total number of LTI granted to all beneficiaries within the Group.\n\nThe performance shares granted to the Chief Executive O/ff icer are entirely subject to demanding internal and external performance conditions (the details of which are presented in Section/uni00A03.2 of this Annual Report), which are assessed over a period of three years (followed by a two-year holding period), and do not guarantee a minimum grant or gain. Moreover, the performance shares plan rules provide that should the Chief Executive O/ff icer leave his position/uni00A0 (1) at any time before the end of the performance period, any performance shares initially granted would be irremediably lost, unless otherwise decided by the Board of Directors in a motivated decision disclosed at the time of the o/ff icer's departure (in such case, all or part of the performance shares could be maintained and the vesting calendar and performance conditions of the performance shares set at the grant date would remain unchanged).\n\nIn order to align the Chief Executive O/ff icer's compensation more directly with the Group's long-term performance and the interests of shareholders, the Board of Directors, upon proposal from its Compensation, Governance &/uni00A0Sustainability Committee, has decided that the total value of the performance shares to be granted to the Chief Executive O/ff icer during 2023, shall not exceed 180% of the amount of his target annual variable compensation. Through this change, the Board of Directors sought to (i) /uni00A0give significant importance to the Chief Executive O/ff icer' share-based compensation, which will represent almost 50% of his total compensation, and (ii) /uni00A0strengthen the at-risk portion of his total compensation (variable cash compensation and share-based compensation) so that it represents the vast majority (approximately 75%) of his total compensation.\n\n## EXCEPTIONAL COMPENSATION OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\nThe Board of Directors does not contemplate granting any exceptional compensation to the Chief Executive O/ff icer.\n\n## CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S DIRECTORS' FEES\n\nThe Chief Executive O/ff icer, who is also a member of the Board of Directors of the Company, is not entitled to payment of any directors' fees from the Company.\n\n## BENEFITS IN KIND GRANTED TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\nThe only benefit in kind granted to the Chief Executive O/ff icer is the use of a company car.\n\n## ELEMENTS OF COMPENSATION RELATING TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S RETIREMENT\n\nThe Chief Executive O/ff icer does not participate in any pension schemes with defined benefits.\n\nAs all other executives of AXA Group entities in France, he participates in the retirement performance share plan, under which grants are made on an annual basis.\n\nThe retirement performance shares granted under such plans are subject to (i) /uni00A0 an acquisition period of three years, and (ii) /uni00A0an undertaking not to sell the retirement performance shares before the date on which the beneficiary retires, subject to the option o/ff ered to the beneficiaries, for diversification purposes, to sell their shares (a/f\\_t er the end of the acquisition period of three years) as long as the proceeds of such sale are invested in a long-term savings plan until the beneficiary retires.\n\n(1)\n\nI\n\nI",

No minimum grant or gain is guaranteed to the Chief Executive O/ff icer under this scheme.\n\nThe Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance &/uni00A0Sustainability Committee, decided that the total value of the retirement performance shares to be granted to the Chief Executive O/ff icer during 2023 shall not exceed 15% of his fixed and cash variable annual compensation.\n\n## REGULATED COMMITMENTS MADE TO THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER\n\nThe commitments made to the benefit of the Chief Executive O/ff icer regarding social benefits and unemployment benefits are presented in more detail in this Annual Report.\n\n## Appointment of a new Chief Executive O/ff icer a/f\\_t  er the Shareholders' Meeting to be held on/uni00A0April/uni00A027,/uni00A02023\n\nFor purposes of this policy only, and in accordance with applicable regulations, the Board of Directors also considered the hypothetical appointment of a new Chief Executive O/ff icer following the Shareholders' Meeting to be held on April/uni00A027, 2023.\n\nUnder such circumstances, the compensation structure applicable to a new Chief Executive O/ff icer would comply with this policy and the Board of Directors would perform a comprehensive review of the situation of the relevant executive, provided that:\n\n- /uni25A0 the amount and criteria of his compensation would be determined in accordance with existing practices within the Company by reference to compensation practices for similar functions in a sample of CAC/uni00A040 companies and in the main European companies in the financial sector; and\n- /uni25A0 the experience, skills and individual compensation history of the executive would also be considered.\n\nFinally, should the Chief Executive O/ff icer be recruited externally, the Board of Directors would retain the right to grant to the newly appointed executive a lump sum (in cash and/or in shares), the amount of which, in accordance with the recommendations set forth in the Afep-Medef Code, may not under any circumstances exceed the amount of the benefits the executive would have had to forgo by resigning from his previous position.\n\n***\n\nFor further information on the Chief Executive O/ff icer's compensation, please see Section/uni00A03.2 of this Annual Report.\n\n## COMPENSATION POLICY FOR THE CHAIRMAN OF/uni00A0THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\n## Structure and criteria for determining the Chairman of the Board of Directors' compensation\n\nThe Board of Directors, upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance &/uni00A0Sustainability Committee, and in accordance with the recommendations set forth in the Afep-Medef Code, has considered that the most appropriate compensation structure for the Chairman of the Board of Directors would be the payment of a sole fixed compensation.\n\nIn determining the fixed annual compensation of its Chairman, the Board of Directors consulted an independent external advisory firm (Willis Towers Watson) in order to identify compensation practices for similar functions in a sample of CAC/uni00A040 companies and in the main European companies in the financial sector.\n\nThe Board of Directors also took into account the experience and expertise of Mr./uni00A0Antoine Gosset-Grainville, as well as the extensive role it decided to entrust him with as Chairman of the Board of Directors. This role is presented in detail in the Board's Terms of Reference as well as in Section/uni00A03.1 of this Annual Report and goes beyond the statutory duties of a Chairman under French law.\n\nAccordingly, the Board of Directors decided, upon recommendation from its Compensation, Governance &/uni00A0Sustainability Committee, to maintain the amount of the fixed annual compensation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors unchanged, for 2023, i.e., at \u20ac925,000.\n\nHaving considered that the most appropriate compensation structure for the Chairman of the Board of Directors would be a fixed compensation only, the Board of Directors has resolved, consequently, that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will not benefit from any variable compensation, any directors' fees, any performance share grants, any other long-term compensation element, or any benefit in kind.\n\nIn addition, the Board of Directors does not contemplate granting any exceptional compensation to the Chairman of the Board of Directors.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n3",

Details are presented in Sections/uni00A03.1 'Corporate governance structure' and 3.2 'Executive compensation and share ownership' of this Annual Report describing corporate governance mechanisms and containing information about executives' compensation.\n\nThe Company implements all the recommendations of the Afep-Medef Code. However, in order to take into account certain specificities of its business and governance practices, AXA has decided, while remaining in line with the principles of the AfepMedef Code, to adapt the following provision of the Code:\n\n- /uni25A0 Section/uni00A0 10.5.1 of the Afep-Medef Code relating to the independence of parent company directors holding a directorship in a Group subsidiary: although certain members of the AXA Board of Directors hold or have held during the last five years non-executive directorships in one or more Group subsidiaries owned directly or indirectly by AXA, the Company considers that this does not automatically (i) /uni00A0place them in a situation of conflict of interest, or (ii) /uni00A0impair their independence in any way. The Board believes that allowing its members to sit on the Boards of certain Group subsidiaries is beneficial to the Board's overall knowledge and appreciation of the activity, operations, strategy, and risk profile of the entire Group. Indeed, directors who hold directorships in subsidiaries may, where appropriate, provide the Board with useful insights and a precise and practical vision of the strategy, operational activities, processes, and teams of the concerned subsidiaries, and more generally, of the Group's business and organization. Directors who also serve on the Boards of Group subsidiaries, however, are required to abstain from participating in the debates and decisions of the AXA Board which could a/ff ect the interests of the entity in which they hold a directorship to prevent any conflict of interest or potential independence issues.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n3",

This statement includes the AXA Group's business model and information on its principal extra-financial risks ('sustainability risks') related to environmental, employer responsibility, society, human rights, and tax development strategy implemented by the AXA Group. For more information on the risks to which the Group is exposed, please refer to Section/uni00A05.1/uni00A0'Risk factors' of this Annual Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\nFurther detailed information on the AXA Group's sustainability policies and practices is also available in the 'Integrated Report', AXA SA's annual 'Climate & Biodiversity Report' , the online 'Group Human Capital Report'/uni00A0 (3) and on the AXA Group's website in the 'Commitments' Section. (www. axa.com),\n\nIn this Section/uni00A04 of the Annual Report, unless provided otherwise, 'ESG' and 'sustainability', as used in the context of describing criteria, risks, or objectives, refer to environmental, social and governance matters.\n\n## AXA Group's purpose entails sustainable value creation\n\nSustainability is viewed as both a risk and an opportunity for AXA Group: it allows AXA Group to take steps to reduce social and environmental risks, while at the same time, opening market opportunities in emerging business segments and helping drive innovation. Sustainability is also an increasingly regulated area: in 2021, AXA Group notably started implementing the new European Union Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and Taxonomy Regulation (refer to Section/uni00A04.3 'Climate change and biodiversity', sub-Section/uni00A0'Climate, biodiversity and ESG-related 'outreach' and engagement' and Section/uni00A04.7 'Transversal information' of this Annual Report).\n\nAXA Group's purpose 'Act for human progress by protecting what matters', which was announced in June/uni00A02020, highlights the creation of sustainable value for the environment and for society thanks to several factors: the Group's ability to invest in the global economy and to provide protection services to its individual and corporate customers, its expertise in improving resilience against risks, but also the responsible management of its di/ff erent\n\nstakeholders' interests. By leveraging its understanding of risks to help better protect the basic needs of individuals and communities (environmental protection, access to healthcare, prosperity, and quality of life), AXA Group's goal is to enable these individuals and communities to progress.\n\nAXA Group is also committed to being a responsible employer by creating a workplace that fosters diversity and equal opportunity for all, promotes engagement, encourages professional development, and supports employee well-being.\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic posed a number of challenges, it also presented a unique opportunity for the Group to reinforce its commitment to being an inclusive and purpose driven employer with the implementation of a new, flexible 'S mart W orking' policy for its global workforce and the launch of a global employee well-being program focused on both physical and mental health.\n\nFor more information on AXA Group's business model, please refer to the Section/uni00A0'Certain preliminary information about this Annual Report', sub-Section/uni00A0'Sustainable value creation'.\n\nI\n\nI",

Recognizing the fundamental importance of ESG for the Group's business and its customers, the Management Committee dedicated a pillar of this strategic plan to the Group's ESG ambition: 'Sustain our Climate leadership position' /uni00A0- please refer to Section/uni00A0'Certain preliminary information about this Annual Report', sub-Section/uni00A0'Strategic orientations' of this Annual Report. All lines of business are therefore concerned by this priority and the Group is well positioned as an investor, as an insurer and as a global corporate actor to promote its ESG ambitions.\n\nThe framework of the Group's sustainability strategy is focused on two/uni00A0priorities: climate change and inclusive protection.\n\nAXA Group has implemented a set of indicators to measure and track its progress in every aspect of its activities: the 'AXA\n\nfor Progress Index'. Launched in April/uni00A02021/uni00A0during the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, this Index is a set of seven commitments, translated into targets and shared across the Group to further embed sustainable development in its activities: as an investor, as an insurer and as an exemplary company.\n\nIn 2022, the Group's sustainability strategy aimed to fulfill two main goals: to act against climate change and to develop health and protection activities as an inclusive insurer. AXA Group announced its targets for the insurance pillar of the 'AXA for Progress Index' (please refer to Section/uni00A04.3 'Climate change and biodiversity', sub-Section/uni00A0'Climate and biodiversity matters as an insurer/uni00A0Green products and business' and Section/uni00A04.4 'Inclusive insurer', sub-Section/uni00A0'Business-related societal challenges').\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSpecific working groups have been set up with key stakeholders across the Group to define the action plans to achieve its commitments for 2023/uni00A0and beyond. The results of the seven\n\ncommitments within the Index are published annually since 2021.

The Board of Directors therefore decided to update its Terms of Reference, notably to rename the Compensation &/uni00A0 Governance Committee the Compensation, Governance &/uni00A0 Sustainability Committee to underline its leading role on sustainability matters and specify each Committee's duties on these subjects.\n\nMore specifically, the Board of Directors' (i) /uni00A0 Compensation, Governance &/uni00A0Sustainability Committee reviews, at least once a year, the Group's s ustainability s trategy as well as material sustainability-related commitments disclosed publicly and reports to the Board of Directors in this regard, (ii) /uni00A0 Audit Committee monitors the process for the preparation and control of the Group's extra-financial information, reviews the Group's extra-financial performance statement and  AXA SA's Climate &/uni00A0Biodiversity Report, and (iii) /uni00A0 Finance &/uni00A0Risk Committee reviews the Group's risk appetite framework for extra-financial exposures as well as its responsible investment policy.\n\nFor more information on the AXA Group's governance regarding sustainability matters, please refer to the Board of Directors and Audit Committee Terms of Reference on the AXA Group's website ( and as well as Section/uni00A03.1 'Corporate governance structure ' of this Annual Report. https://www.axa.com/en/about-us/board-of-directors https://www.axa.com/en/about-us/audit-committee) ,\n\nAt the executive level, the Group's Management Committee has a role overseeing material sustainability-related initiatives across the Group.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThe Group Management Committee is supported by the 'Role in Society Steering Committee' (RISSC). This Committee is charged with developing and overseeing the operational implementation of the Group's s ustainability s trategy and reviewing material sustainability-related issues faced by the Group as well as monitoring material sustainability-related initiatives across the Group. The RISSC meets monthly and is co-chaired by the Group Chief Risk O/ff  icer, Group Chief Investment O/ff icer, and Group Chief Communication, Brand and Sustainability O/ff icer. The RISSC reports back to the Group Management Committee  on a regular basis concerning material sustainability-related decisions taken or to be taken and issues considered on which Group Management Committee guidance and/or decisions are needed.\n\nFurthermore, the Audit Risk and Compliance Committee (ARCC) is charged with reviewing all material audit, risk and compliance issues, faced by the Group. The ARCC meets monthly and is chaired by the Group General Counsel. The ARCC reports back to the Group Management Committee on a regular basis concerning material sustainability-related risks faced by the Group and mandatory sustainability-related reporting. For more information, please refer to Section/uni00A05.2 'Internal Control and Risk Management' of this present Annual Report.'\n\nIn addition, the Group's s ustainability s trategy and sustainabilityrelated initiatives are presented at least once a year to the Group's social partners.\n\nAcross the local entities, a network of s ustainability Executives oversees the implementation of the s ustainability s trategy and promotes best practices.\n\nThe Group also maintains a regular dialogue with NGOs through meetings or responses to requests ( e.g. questionnaires). In addition, AXA Group participates in more than 50/uni00A0coalitions, working groups and pledges, gathering both NGOs and public authorities, around climate change and biodiversity, as well as inclusion themes (please refer to Sections/uni00A04.3/uni00A0'Climate c hange and b iodiversity' and 4.4/uni00A0'Inclusive i nsurer' of this Annual Report). External stakeholders are also regularly invited to dialogue sessions with the members of the di/ff erent governance bodies described above. These numerous exchanges enable the Group to integrate major and emerging issues into its strategy.",

Risk factors for each area related to sustainability (employer responsibility, environment, society impact, business behavior including respect for human rights, and stakeholder engagement) are identified, based on sustainability risks studied in prior/uni00A0years, and in the 2022/uni00A0Future Risks Report, which outlines major trends on the risk landscape for society at large (see Section/uni00A05.8, paragraph 'Emerging risks' of this Annual Report and Those risks have been cross-referenced with the AXA Group Operational Risk Profile (for more information refer to Section/uni00A05.7/uni00A0'Operational risks ') and compared to the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment. www.axa.com/en/ press/publications/future-risks-report-2022) .\n\nThese risks are internally assessed by an expert panel. The assessment is conducted, using the AXA Group Operational Risks guidelines to rate potential frequency and severity. Impacts of each risk on stakeholders' interests and expectations have been considered. In the first instance, those risks are assessed by Risk experts, identified based on their knowledge of specific sustainability risks. Then, cross-sectoral experts assess the relevance of those ratings during the first stage. Those internal experts are identified based on their transversal knowledge of the extra-financial risk universe.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## ESG ratings\n\nThe Group's Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) performance is evaluated by specialized rating agencies. The Group generally ranks close to the top in its industry and is also\n\nincluded in the main international sustainability indexes. These ratings are described in further detail in Section/uni00A01/uni00A0'The AXA Group' of this Annual Report.\n\nI\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY RISK MAPPING IN 2022\n\nThe sustainability risk mapping has been approved by the Group Audit Risk &/uni00A0Compliance Committee (the ARCC/uni00A0 (2) ) which assessed 18/uni00A0sustainability risks (detailed in Section/uni00A04.7 'Transversal information/uni00A0- 2022 Key indicators') for AXA Group in 2022 around five main themes/uni00A0 (3) :\n\n- /uni25A0 governance: stakeholder engagement;\n- /uni25A0 responsible employer: safe environment, inclusion &/uni00A0diversity, talent management/loss of key sta/ff ;\n- /uni25A0 climate change and biodiversity: AXA Group's impact on climate change as an investor, impact of climate change on AXA Group as an investor, AXA Group's impact on climate change as an insurer, impact of climate change on AXA Group as an insurer, AXA Group's impact on biodiversity, AXA Group's own operations' impact on climate change, impact of climate change on AXA Group's own operations;\n- /uni25A0 inclusive  insurer: inclusive  insurance,  partnership &/uni00A0philanthropy; and,\n- /uni25A0 business behavior: anti-bribery &/uni00A0fight against corruption, business conduct, responsible data use, data privacy, and data security, responsible procurement, and tax policy.\n\nIn the following chapters, AXA Group defines each of these risks, describes the policy and mitigation initiatives, and exposes the indicators (KPIs or qualitative results). Since 2021, the 'AXA for Progress Index' framework has replaced the correspondence table issued in 2020/uni00A0focusing on Climate risks that are more specifically monitored as part of the strategic plan 'Driving Progress 2023' implementation.\n\nI\n\n4",

Introduced in 2021, and with full implementation in 2022, Smart Working is AXA Group global program on hybrid working, that empowers people to split their working time between the o/ff ice and home. This implementation of Smart Working has significantly changed the organization and is a key lever for AXA to accelerate empowerment. The program enables teams to have the autonomy and accountability to perform at their best in a hybrid context.\n\nPurpose at work is the second dimension at the heart of AXA's people strategy, with a particularly strong focus on continuing to invest in competence-building and career/job opportunities.\n\nHealth and Inclusion have been as well a strong area of focus in 2022, with the full roll-out of programs designed to address specific social risks and enable AXA to be at the forefront of innovation in terms of care and inclusion. A global health and wellbeing program is now in place, making AXA a pioneer in health prevention and services o/ff ered to employees. 2022 was finally marked by progress made on gender representation in AXA's 'Global Leadership Network' (GLN)/uni00A0- the organization's top 250/uni00A0executives/uni00A0- and the second edition of its Inclusion Survey, which proves to be a powerful tool to measure, share feedback with teams, and accelerate progress on inclusion and diversity.\n\n## HIGHLIGHT AND KEY FIGURES: GEOGRAPHICAL FOOTPRINT DISTRIBUTION/uni00A0 (a) AND/uni00A0AVERAGE AGE/uni00A0 (b)\n\n| Continents   | Headcount   | Distribution   | Evolution         |   Average age |\n|--------------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| Europe       | 64,078      | 58.1%          | (+0.1/uni00A0pt)  |          43.6 |\n| Asia-Pacific | 26,632      | 24.1%          | (-2.7/uni00A0pts) |          38.5 |\n| Americas     | 12,665      | 11.5%          | (+0.6/uni00A0pt)  |          39.4 |\n| Africa       | 6,927       | 6.3%           | (+0.5/uni00A0pt)  |          34.3 |\n| TOTAL        | 110,302     | -              | -                 |          41.3 |\n\n- (a) Open-ended and fixed-term contract headcount.\n- (b) Open-ended contract average age.\n- AXA's overall salaried workforce on December/uni00A031, 2022, was 110,302/uni00A0employees (open-ended and fixed-term contracts), which represents a decrease of 0.2% compared to/uni00A02021.

While AXA and its employees have embraced the flexibility that comes with remote work, spending time together in person is an anchor of AXA's culture. For AXA, the o/ff ice remains a crucial place to collaborate, socialize, share ideas, and feel part of a wider organization.\n\nThis is why, while 2020/uni00A0saw AXA transition to full remote working during the pandemic, 2021 and 2022 saw AXA introduce a new Smart Working program that combines in-o/ff ice and at-home work. The exact split varies between roles and local AXA entities, but a typical week might consist of two days working from home and three spent in the o/ff ice. The long-term goal is to perfect a framework that lets teams decide between themselves when to meet physically and when to work virtually. AXA will continue to listen, measure, and fine-tune the approach to hit this goal.\n\nTo bring employees back to the o/ff ice, many AXA entities invested in their workspaces. For example, large reconfiguration projects are underway in three local entities in Europe. They are creating more flexible spaces and bigger meeting rooms, along with networking areas, open-air terraces, and other spaces that foster community and wellbeing. The 'one roof policy'  has been brought to life in three countries - Japan, Mexico, and the UK - who have regrouped the various entities within these countries to reside in one building, to make team collaboration easier, and build a sense of collective identity and purpose .\n\nO/ff  ice activities like art auctions, a/f\\_t er-work events, and cooking demonstrations have been reinforced to continue investing in building a better employee experience.\n\n## Smart Working survey\n\nAXA Group global Smart Working survey measured employees' reactions to the move from 2020's stay-at-home policy to the new system of hybrid work. The survey investigates how Smart Working operates for each employee and their team, and how they feel about it. 73% of employees participated in the survey in 2022, and 95% of respondents reported that Smart Working had been introduced to their workplace. 88% felt positive about Smart Working, and 86% said their team had been supported during their transition to Smart Working. The positive results of\n\nI\n\nI\n\nthe survey have shown to us that this phase of implementation has been a success. The comments of our people have been extremely critical to fuel our thinking on new initiatives to be taken to continue to reinforce AXA as an inspiring place to work.\n\n## Team agreements\n\nTeams know best what combination of remote and in-o/ff ice work leads to productivity, creativity, and wellbeing. AXA is empowering its teams to use that knowledge by putting in place 'team agreements'.\n\nTeams are encouraged to regularly renegotiate their agreements to adapt to any changes. They are also asked to hold at least one physical 'anchor day' per week, when everyone from a team works together in the o/ff ice. Managers, meanwhile, are being up-skilled through the AXA Managers Academy (see next section) on how to support team agreements, maintain team connections, and disconnect a/f\\_t er work.\n\nAt the local level, entities such as in Spain or in the UK &/uni00A0Ireland have used channels like 'town halls' (whole-entity meetings), newsletters, or manager briefings to reinforce the practice of team agreements. Practical tools like workshops, digital training, templates, and team agreement session facilitators have also been on o/ff er to help get team agreements in place.\n\nThe Group is aiming for every team worldwide to have a team agreement set up by 2023. So far, 79% of team managers say they have one in place, although this figure varies across entities (57-100%). Results from the Smart Working survey suggest the approach is working for most employees: 87% feel connected to their team, 74% say their team spends the right amount of inperson time together, and 91% feel included in remote meetings.\n\n## STRENGTHENING AND ENGAGING THE/uni00A0AXA/uni00A0TEAM\n\n## Global Pulse Surveys\n\nThe Global Pulse Surveys are an important tool to check how AXA Group employees feel about AXA/uni00A0- both its business and its culture. The survey measures, for example, how confident they are in AXA's strategic direction, and how connected they feel to their teams.",

That means important information and training is available to all new hires, wherever they are in the world, and that people feel part of the whole of AXA, as well as the entity they are joining. This is especially valuable for younger workers.\n\n## Helping young people enter and progress in/uni00A0the workplace\n\nYoung people have been hit hard by the current economic crisis. To support them and to help them join the working world, AXA has designed initiatives like mentoring/uni00A0 (1) or early realization programs targeting young people from families with low incomes and who have fewer employment prospects.\n\nMany AXA entities, especially in Europe, put more mentorships in place in 2022, and created new communities of young AXA workers. Those entities have also partnered with associations to create professional opportunities for young people, at AXA and beyond. The hope is to continue and grow these initiatives across AXA.\n\n## INVESTING IN DEVELOPMENT OF/uni00A0OUR/uni00A0PEOPLE\n\n## Learning &/uni00A0Development\n\nIn 2022, 100% of AXA Group employees were trained at least once. By constantly up-skilling and re-skilling, AXA is helping its employees navigate the potential pitfalls that come with the rapidly changing world of work. AXA is providing all workers/uni00A0- from the\n\ntop level of executives down to junior recruits/uni00A0- with online and on-site opportunities to develop their skills, adapt to changing times, and find the jobs that best suit them within AXA.\n\nThree academies/uni00A0- the AXA Climate Academy, the AXA Managers Academy, and the AXA Leadership Academy/uni00A0- were developed in 2021 to address goals on sustainability and adaptation to the post-pandemic world. These training programs are already showing significant achievements in 2022 and are critical to Smart Working, workplace wellness, inclusion, and giving employees a sense of purpose and empowerment.\n\n## AXA Climate Academy\n\nAs part of its sustainability agenda, AXA Group has committed to training all of its employees on climate change by the end of 2023. To achieve this, AXA launched the AXA Climate Academy near the end of 2021. It is a learning program designed to give employees better awareness and understanding of the science behind climate change. It covers why climate is a growing concern for companies and customers, the main types of climate change risks, and how climate change impacts the whole value chain for insurance and investments.\n\nThe program is available in 11/uni00A0languages and includes a series of bite-sized learning videos and activities. The final module is a guide to the concrete actions that teams can take collectively and individually to combat climate change. Completing the training earns participants achievement certificates. They can share these on social networks like LinkedIn, along with the hashtag #WeCommitToClimate, to further promote the campaign.\n\nThe bulk of the AXA Climate Academy rollout happened in 2022 and, as of December/uni00A02022, 87% of AXA employees/uni00A0 (2) have been certified (including sales representatives). Feedback from learners was extremely positive with 4,220/uni00A0employees giving the AXA Climate Academy an average score of 4.6/5.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

One entity in Belgium organized climate workshops for employees' children and interested schools, with 80/uni00A0workshops teaching approximately 2,000/uni00A0children. One AXA entity has o/ff ered all employees the possibility to obtain both the CFA Certificate in ESG Investing and the new CFA Climate &/uni00A0Investing Certificate/uni00A0 (1) .\n\n## AXA Managers Academy\n\n2022 saw the launch of the AXA Managers Academy, set up to help AXA's managers reinforce their skillset in the new world of work.\n\nEvery year, new learning journeys will be introduced, with 2022's focusing on Smart Working. It embeds AXA's expectations of how managers should lead their teams. These new skills empower managers to continue leading, coaching, and supporting their team adjusting to di/ff erent individuals and contexts. So far, the Managers Academy has trained almost 4,000/uni00A0managers across 12 entities in seven languages.\n\nThe first learning journey of AXA Managers Academy/uni00A0- delivered in 2022/uni00A0- was on Managing teams in Smart Working. The courses are delivered both via live events and self-learning sessions. Participants also have opportunities to learn from each other's experiences. AXA entities can tailor modules, localizing them to better suit their needs. In 2023 the focus will be on 'Leading for Growth':\n\n- /uni25A0 energizing the team around AXA's purpose, values &/uni00A0strategy;\n- /uni25A0 delivering results by setting a clear vision and goals for team; driving collaboration within and across teams; creating trust and accountability;\n- /uni25A0 adopting a 'manager to coach' mindset; fostering team dynamics; supporting skills development and mobility;\n- /uni25A0 caring for your team; managing well-being and resilience.\n\n## Reinforcing leaders' capabilities\n\n2022 saw the launch of the Leadership Academy, and its flagship first learning journey 'Lead the Way'. The Academy is AXA's executive development program for the 'Global Leadership Network' (GLN)/uni00A0- the organization's top 250/uni00A0executives. Leaders'\n\nI\n\nI\n\nfeedback has been extremely positive, and more than 100/uni00A0have already been trained. AXA hopes to build on this work with new learning journeys in 2023 and beyond.\n\nAXA has also created a new Executive Leadership Model for the GLN, which clarifies what it takes to succeed in the most senior leadership positions across the AXA Group. It was deployed across all entities during 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, AXA has continued its Executive Development process for senior leadership. Every 3-4/uni00A0years, GLN members have mandatory development sessions with a team of executive assessors and coaches. In 2022, the new Executive Leadership Model was integrated into the process, and it remains an essential part of AXA's approach to developing its leaders.\n\n## The next generation of leaders\n\nFor the past few years, AXA has operated global sponsorship programs to enable talented individuals, the majority of them women, to be supported in their development to take on GLN-level roles. The AXA Evolve program provides 12/uni00A0months of assessments, sponsorship, development, and feedback, and is designed to help executives reach more senior positions. In 2022, a cohort of 20/uni00A0Top 2000/uni00A0executives completed their run with Evolve. With 60% female participants, Evolve is a key enabler in supporting the increase of the proportion of women at the executive level. Similar programs are run every year across our major operating companies.\n\nOn top of this program, all Management Committee members and other members of the Partners Group took part in AXA's 'Thrive' initiative to show their commitment to the development and advancement of women at AXA. This saw them mentoring talented women from across AXA to coincide with International Women's Day. The 44 mentees, who showed outstanding performance and the potential to advance, reported that they found the experience empowering and inspiring.\n\nThis Group initiative inspired entities around the world to set up more mentoring opportunities of their own. 20/uni00A0entities in Europe, the Americas, Asia, and Africa who responded to AXA's survey reported that over 230/uni00A0employees were mentored on or around International Women's Day. Thrive will continue in 2023, with even higher numbers of talents involved.",

Which is why AXA launched the Inclusion Survey in 2021, measuring whether employees feel welcomed and fairly treated regardless of their characteristics. The survey is voluntary and anonymous. It helps to:\n\n- /uni25A0 raise awareness, and promote a culture of inclusion;\n- /uni25A0 o/ff er employees a safe setting to reflect on and share their feelings about inclusion, and a way to influence AXA's culture;\n- /uni25A0 concretely measure AXA's progress towards inclusion and diversity (I&D) with KPIs.\n\nThe survey can be adapted to the cultural nuances of di/ff erent AXA entities. It ran in 50/uni00A0countries in 2022, with China participating for the first time.\n\n2022 saw a 4.5% increase in survey participation compared to 2021, with 60.5% of employees invited to participate responding to the survey. It also saw an 11% increase in verbatim responses from AXA employees/uni00A0- 17,121 total. AXA's inclusion Net Promoter Score (iNPS) increased by three points from 37 in 2021 to 40/uni00A0in 2022.\n\n## Disability inclusion\n\nAXA recently committed to a new disability campaign/uni00A0- Generation Valuable/uni00A0- with the Valuable 500, the world's largest network of CEOs committed to disability inclusion. At the same time, it launched a new internal initiative known as 'Exchange', which brings together employees who have a connection to disability (for example, people who have a disability themselves, or care for someone who does) and executives. This initiative aims to help executives understand the challenges that employees with\n\ndisabilities face. And it is a chance for executives and employees to combine their experience and ideas, and build solutions for better disability inclusion across AXA.\n\nLocal AXA entities have also launched their own initiatives to make their workplaces more inclusive for people with disabilities. Three have put in place people and programs to make sure employees with disabilities have the physical and digital tools they need to do their jobs well. Some entities trained their executives to better understand the experience of their employees with disabilities. Others have focused on neurodiversity and created internships for autistic students.\n\n## Working towards gender balance\n\nThe Group is fully committed to continue to progress towards gender parity at all levels of the organization with a strong focus from managers and leaders across all the organization. This is illustrated by AXA Group commitment to reaching gender parity amongst the GLN by the end of 2023. Annually, AXA monitors its Gender Pay Gap, which mainly reflects gender balance within organizational structures. A gender pay gap is a broad measure of the difference between the average pay of all women in the organization and the average pay of all men in the same organization, regardless of their role, seniority, level, or location. In 2021, the average global gender pay gap was assessed at 24% on fixed remuneration and at 30% on total compensation. AXA continues to roll out and strengthen inclusive processes and goals through various action plans (including progress on equal opportunities such as mentoring, recruitment and promotions, further detailed in the Annual Report). Such e/ff orts truly embody AXA's purpose and culture as an inclusive employer, which AXA is accelerating on.\n\n2022 saw progress towards gender balance in our GLN population. The proportion of women in top executive positions is at 39%, up 3/uni00A0points from 2021.\n\n|       | Management Committee/uni00A0 (a)   | Management Committee/uni00A0 (a)   | Management Committee/uni00A0 (a)   | Partners Group/uni00A0 (b)   | Partners Group/uni00A0 (b)   | Partners Group/uni00A0 (b)   | Global Leadership Network/uni00A0 (c)   | Global Leadership Network/uni00A0 (c)   | Global Leadership Network/uni00A0 (c)   |\n|-------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n|       | 2022                               | 2021                               | 2020                               | 2022                         | 2021                         | 2020                         | 2022                                    | 2021                                    | 2020                                    |\n| Women | 20%                                | 21%                                | 15%                                | 24%                          | 27%                          | 27%                          | 39%                                     | 36%                                     | 34%                                     |\n| Men   | 80%                                | 79%                                | 85%                                | 76%                          | 73%                          | 73%                          | 61%                                     | 64%                                     | 66%                                     |\n| TOTAL | 15                                 | 14                                 | 13                                 | 41                           | 45                           | 48                           | 237                                     | 243                                     | 253                                     |\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

Entities annually monitor and address unjustified pay gaps, with dedicated budgets to close any remaining unjustified equal pay gaps.\n\nIn 2022, AXA developed a new equal pay methodology applicable to all entities through a regression analysis to ensure a consistent and robust approach to equal pay assessments, while also anticipating regulatory developments (including the EU Directive on Pay Transparency). Group standards and processes across entities (recruitment, compensation, reviews, and promotions) have also been strengthened to ensure gaps do not arise or reappear in the future.\n\nReporting on ethnicity, especially ethnicity pay gaps, has been harder to address across locations mainly because of local regulations along with a cultural reluctance in some countries to request and report on ethnicity. Only one entity was able to request data on ethnicity and embraced the opportunity to gain some insight on ethnicity-related issues.\n\nMoreover, AXA's Group Management Committee and Chief Executive O/ff icers gave specific attention to internal coherence and market positioning since the last three compensation review rounds, which resulted in closing the average market gap between the female and male Group's Leadership Network (GLN) population.\n\n## Reinforcing AXA's fair pay policy\n\nAXA has reinforced its Fair Pay approach by considering that not only should employees' pay be fair and competitive, but also at a level determined su/ff icient for the location they work in. A living wage goes beyond current statutory minimum wages/uni00A0- it aims to prevent individuals from falling into poverty, although some countries like Ireland have commenced the process to transpose living wages into their domestic law. The living wage is more comprehensive and defines the minimum wage needed for employees and their families to cover core needs depending on their working location, including housing, food, and access to healthcare and education. AXA contracted with the Fair Wage Network to conduct an analysis by the end of 2023 in all of the Group's countries of operation to assess the alignment of employees' pay with local living wages.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## Rewarding AXA employees for sustainability achievements\n\nTo engage employees on AXA's purpose and maintain its leadership position in sustainability, AXA keeps building Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria into its total rewards o/ff er. The Group has reinforced the ESG print within its culture and values through short-term and long-term incentives:\n\n- /uni25A0 the Global Leadership Network (GLN) are assessed on qualitative climate and diversity objectives, which are included in their annual target letters;\n- /uni25A0 a quantitative climate objective is included in the AXA Group performance grid, impacting around 2,000/uni00A0employees' variable remuneration payout;\n- /uni25A0 long-term incentives include ESG criteria (climate and diversity objectives in performance shares plan, AXA ranking in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index in both performance shares and restricted shares plans), covering a population of around 6,000/uni00A0employees every year.\n\nAXA's ambition is also to increase the weight of sustainability criteria in profit sharing agreements to 30% by 2023 (prevalent in certain European countries, impacting over 20,000/uni00A0employees every year). At the same time, it will ensure that employees are empowered to personally take inclusive and tangible action. In 2022, around 60% of France-based AXA entities had profit-sharing schemes with at least 20% of their performance conditions being related to ESG. AXA XL is taking the challenge a step further by targeting 40% of performance conditions in their Profit-Sharing agreement, including a specific criterion for employees' training on climate.\n\n## HEALTH AND WELLBEING IN A WORLD OF/uni00A0HYBRID WORK\n\n## Healthy You\n\nAXA launched a global health and wellbeing program in November/uni00A02020, branded 'Healthy You'. The program was rolled out thanks to a partnership between AXA Group and employee trade union representatives. The Healthy You program was reflected in a Charter signed by the European Works Council and AXA Group.\n\nThe Healthy You Program was extended in 2021 to include additional care and support services. 2022 was a critical year of implementation of those services with a rollout that will be fully completed by the end of 2023.\n\nAs part of the Healthy You Program, AXA launched its first global medical check-up campaign in 2021. More than 33,000/uni00A0employees participated in this campaign. The main health risks identified that",

        "page_content": "year thanks to the global check-up campaign were cardiovascular diseases, musculoskeletal disorders, and stress. To directly address these risks, 2022's Health Days focused on nutrition, ergonomics, and social reconnection through group and local initiatives. 3,000/uni00A0employees viewed the conference on The Great Reconnection. Aimed at addressing stress, the conference focused on social relationships, their positive impact on wellbeing, and why we need to be intentional in building and sustaining them. 3,000/uni00A0also viewed the Health Nutrition &/uni00A0Cooking Class, aimed at supporting cardiovascular health. And the five videos on ergonomics (to address musculoskeletal disorders) were each viewed around 3,000/uni00A0times. Local entities had the flexibility to give more focus to their own specific risks. They held on-site initiatives, including advice from health experts and medical screenings.\n\nThe Healthy You Program includes the following services:\n\n- /uni25A0 an in-person medical check-up for all employees over 40/uni00A0years old every four years. More than 23,000/uni00A0employees have used this service in 2022. A digital check-up is also provided to all employees every two years;\n- /uni25A0 on-site health-related prevention and awareness days;\n- /uni25A0 an annual flu vaccination campaign;\n- /uni25A0 an Employee Assistance Program with 24-hour mental health and psychological support;\n- /uni25A0 medical teleconsultation services;\n- /uni25A0 digital programs focusing on prevention, and raising awareness on topics related to health and wellbeing;\n- /uni25A0 a second medical opinion service for employees with a critical illness;\n- /uni25A0 financial support (covering at least 75% of medical expenses) as well as mental health support for employees with cancer.\n\nThe AXA Group pays particular attention to providing access to information regarding the benefits, services and entitlements proposed to employees in the various entities.\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\n## 4.2/uni00A0EMPLOYER RESPONSIBILITY\n\n## Mental health\n\nSince 2020, AXA has ensured an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) with 24-hour mental health and psychological support across all geographies. EAPs provide practical and impartial psychological support to employees on everyday matters ranging from home and family concerns to financial and legal issues.\n\nIn every global Pulse survey, AXA asks its employees to share insight on their current wellbeing so that it can better assess and understand how its employees are feeling, whether this is changing over time, and determine actions to support their wellbeing. AXA continues to invest in training as a tool to reduce bias and stigma. As of October/uni00A030, 2022, 6,912 managers were trained to recognize common mental health conditions and to signpost the support available at AXA, providing them with the confidence needed to respond to any challenges that may arise within their team. AXA entities have also introduced locally relevant training programs, with one French entity using role play as a way for employees to learn more about workplace bias and what can be done to address it.\n\nAXA recognizes that raising awareness is also about making a positive, lasting impact on employee mental health. At the local level, entities have been sharing articles, expert insights, and interactive health tools to provide employees with a range of ways to practice self-care. East Asian AXA entities launched Fit to Flourish, with research identifying 10/uni00A0key skills that support peak mind heath such as self-acceptance, connectedness, pride in achievement, and physical health behaviors.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Climate change as a sustainability risk is considered in this Section/uni00A04.3, with a double materiality lens, for AXA Group's investment and insurance activities, and AXA Group's own operations. AXA Group has developed policies and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\ndefined indicators to track progress in reducing the adverse impacts associated with these risks.\n\nAXA Group follows the guidance of the voluntary disclosure requirements of the 'Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures' (TCFD)/uni00A0 (1) , which focus exclusively on climate-related factors. Since becoming a licensed reinsurer of life and Property &/uni00A0Casualty business, AXA/uni00A0SA is also subject to the disclosure requirements set out in the French regulations implementing article/uni00A029 of the Law No./uni00A02019-1147 of November/uni00A08, 2019, regarding energy and climate, which considers more broadly, ESG issues. For more detailed information, please refer to AXA SA's annual 'Climate and Biodiversity Report'/uni00A0 (2) that will be published on the AXA Group's website in the second quarter of 2023. (www.axa.com)\n\n## Risks and impacts in relation to climate change and/uni00A0biodiversity\n\nThe Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which was published in the EU O/ff icial Journal in December/uni00A02022 introduces the concept of 'double materiality' in the context of corporate sustainability reporting in the EU. Unlike single materiality which only considers how various sustainability matters a/ff  ect a company, double materiality also considers the impacts a company's activities on sustainability matters; in this manner,\n\nthe risks to the undertaking and the impacts of the undertaking each represent one materiality perspective.\n\nOf the various sustainability risks identified by AXA Group as material, the impact of climate change on AXA Group and AXA Group's impact on the environment and sustainability matters more broadly continue to be identified as  key sustainability risks in 2022, as described in the Section/uni00A04.1 'AXA Group's sustainability strategy/uni00A0-/uni00A0Sustainability risk assessment' of this Annual Report.\n\nI\n\nI",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## Risk of climate change on AXA Group's activities\n\nClimate change risks are usually understood to comprise the following key risk drivers impacting companies' valuation and profitability :\n\n- /uni25A0 physical risk refers to the direct impacts of climate change on persons and property, such as those arising from rising temperatures, the increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, fires, rising sea levels and changes in exposure to vector-borne diseases. For (re)insurers, the physical risks may significantly impact business and the (re) insurance industry more broadly, including with respect to risk perception, pricing and modelling assumptions, the need for new insurance products, the amount, frequency, and quantum of claims. Physical risk has a direct impact on undertakings, both through the impairments in value associated with assets held by (re)insurers and through changes in the frequency and cost of these risks on the liability side of the balance sheet;\n- /uni25A0 transition risk stems from a change in the behaviour and strategies of industrial actors, market participants and customers in response to climate change and as a result of the implementation of climate related policy, regulatory and technological developments including as a result of the crosssectoral structural changes stemming from the transition towards a low-carbon economy. Transition risk has an impact on (re)insurance products, underwriting and impairs the value of investments held by (re)insurers; and\n- /uni25A0 liability risk can result from both the physical and transition risks of climate change, including because of potential disputes, claims for compensation and legal proceedings brought against insured, companies (re)insurers are invested and potentially directly against insurers; seeking damages for contribution to climate change or for inaccurate or insu/ff icient disclosure around material financial or operational risks. There is an increasing risk of other forms of climate-related litigation, in particular claims by shareholders and other stakeholders for socalled 'greenwashing' actions, misrepresentation, misleading conduct, mis-selling, fraud, breaches of fundamental human rights, breaches of fiduciary duties and breaches of disclosure obligations in listing rules or other corporate regimes, or for having deficient controls or processes in place.\n\n## ASSESSING THE FINANCIAL RISK OF/uni00A0CLIMATE CHANGE\n\nClimate change could have a negative impact on AXA Group's assets and investment activities, as well as on its balance sheet liabilities and insurance activities.\n\nFor this reason, Risk Management frameworks must be adapted to the specificities of climate risks, whose trajectories and impacts are particularly uncertain. In this regard, scenario analysis and climate stress tests based on di/ff erent trajectories of future climatic, macroeconomic, and financial conditions are relevant tools to conduct a forward-looking assessment of potential vulnerabilities related to climate change risks. The development of climate scenario analyses and stress testing has been accelerating, particularly through the 'pilot climate exercise' launched in June/uni00A02020/uni00A0by the ACPR/uni00A0 (1 ) . AXA Group contributed to this exploratory exercise and sees the use of climate scenario analysis as an opportunity to map out potential long-term implications of climate change on its investment portfolios and insurance business. Through this type of active cooperation with supervisory authorities and industry peers, AXA Group aims to improve its framework aimed at addressing medium to very long-term climate change risks, although the exercise is highly uncertain, and many methodological challenges remain.\n\nAs part of AXA Group's ORSA (Own Risk and Solvency Assessment), the ACPR scenarios published in connection with the 2020/uni00A0pilot climate exercise have been supplemented to better reflect AXA Group's own risk profile. In particular, Property &/uni00A0Casualty (P&C) physical risks have been assessed through modular approaches (from simple to sophisticated modeling) to encompass the three drivers of natural risks (changes in hazard, exposure, and vulnerability) and assess potential impacts ( i.e., evolution of Modelled Average Annual Losses (AAL) of forward-looking scenarios in a range of uncertainty (pessimistic versus optimistic views).\n\nBased on representative risks to which the Group is exposed (flooding in Europe, hurricanes in the USA, urban atmospheric pollution and vector-borne diseases in France, climate-related financial risks), the estimated financial impacts on the Group using ACPR and AXA Group's ORSA scenarios are relatively limited:\n\n- /uni25A0 investments: in terms of investments, the impact of financial market scenarios on AXA Group's in-scope investments, being corporate bonds and equities in AXA Group's General Account assets, is low. This is notably due to AXA Group's low exposure to carbon-intensive sectors likely to be the most a/ffected by the climate transition;\n\nI\n\nI\n\n(1 )\n\n4",

The evolution of AXA Group's future P&C natural catastrophes (Nat Cat) claims remains largely driven by changes in AXA Group's future exposures (demographic changes, wealth growth) rather than an increase in the climate hazard itself; and\n- /uni25A0 health &/uni00A0protection: in terms of health and Life insurance, the ACPR's 'climate pilot exercise' again showed that the main impact stems notably from higher mortality due to the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\ndeterioration of air quality. Nevertheless, the impact was expected to be limited because, even using a very conservative approach, the assessed impact would be absorbed through management actions such as realistic repricing.\n\nAXA Group also explores the potential impacts of climate change on its investments with a model developed by MSCI (applicable only to corporate bonds and equity and real assets) where risks and opportunities are combined and translated into a 'Climate Value-at-Risk' indicator (please refer to the Section/uni00A0'Consideration of Climate in Portfolio Management' below).\n\n## Impacts of AXA Group's activities on the environment\n\nBeyond this approach, as an investor, as an insurer and as responsible company, AXA Group seeks to mitigate the adverse e/ff ects of its activities on the environment (and sustainability matters more broadly), notably through the following actions:\n\n- /uni25A0 applying its Risk Management framework to identify potential climate impacts and integrating ESG criteria into its insurance business processes and investment strategy;\n- /uni25A0 supporting the overall concept of 'net zero' by committing to align its investments and insurance activities with the COP21 Paris Agreement;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## Risks and impacts on biodiversity loss\n\nAXA views the biodiversity challenge as a natural extension of its climate e/ff orts. Biodiversity loss endangers 'ecosystem services', which poses risks to society and businesses that depend on them, and in turn investors and insurers that rely on a well-functioning economy. Furthermore, the IPBES/uni00A0 (1) , the IPCC and the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) all identify climate change as a key driver of changes to nature and by extension, biodiversity/uni00A0 (2) .\n\nAXA Group therefore identified its impact on biodiversity as a main sustainability risk in 2022, as outlined in Section/uni00A04.1 'AXA Group's sustainability strategy' of this Annual Report.\n\nAs a result, AXA Group has announced a series of initiatives, designed to contribute to the protection of ecosystems, and act on the nexus between climate and nature. For more detailed information on those developments, please refer to the AXA SA's annual 'Climate and Biodiversity Report'.\n\nI\n\n## UNDERSTAND AXA GROUP'S IMPACT ON/uni00A0BIODIVERSITY\n\nWhile the erosion of biodiversity and its main causes are well known, the precise quantification of a company's impacts on biodiversity, and the risks it runs, remain to be defined./uni00A0This is why AXA Group is continuing its e/ff orts working with peers to accelerate the quantification of risks and impacts related to biodiversity:\n\n- /uni25A0 in partnership with the WWF, in 2019, AXA Group released the 'Into the Wild/uni00A0- Integrating nature into investment strategies' report/uni00A0 (3) at the G7 Ministerial meetings.

This provider has developed its own metric/uni00A0- the Corporate Biodiversity Footprint (CBF)/uni00A0- based on the concept of Mean Species Abundance (MSA), to calculate the degradation of ecosystems caused by business activities in an investment portfolio.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the AXA SA's annual 'Climate and Biodiversity Report'.\n\n## Climate and biodiversity matters as an investor\n\n## DEFINITIONS AND GOVERNANCE\n\nThe Group defines Responsible Investment (RI) as the integration of ESG considerations into investment processes, including ownership practices. Thus, the Group's objective is to align investments with its sustainability agenda of protecting people over the long term and creating stronger and more sustainable societies. This agenda is in line with its interests as a global insurer and investor.\n\nTo this end, the Group has developed a global RI strategy covering the Group's General Account assets, and for its Unit Linked o/ff ering, where relevant. The implementation of this strategy is overseen by a specific RI governance, the Group's Responsible Investment Committee (RIC), which is chaired by the Group's Chief Investment O/ff  icer and includes representatives from AXA's asset managers, Sustainable Development, Risk Management and Communications teams. Ultimately, the RIC reports to the Group Investment Committee, chaired by the Group Chief Financial O/ff icer, and sensitive and/or strategic climate finance-related decisions debated in the RIC are approved by the RISSC (please refer to Section/uni00A04.1 'AXA Group's sustainability strategy/uni00A0- Sustainability governance &/uni00A0Stakeholder dialogue' of this Annual Report). The Group's RI strategy is supported by the RI Center of Expertise, a transversal working group which includes representatives from its local investment teams and sustainability network.\n\n## CONSIDERATION OF CLIMATE IN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT\n\n## Impact of AXA Group's investments on climate: Carbon footprint\n\nAXA Group publishes the carbon footprint of its investments using three di/ff erent approaches/uni00A0 (1) :\n\n- /uni25A0 normalized per revenue;\n- /uni25A0 in absolute terms; and\n- /uni25A0 normalized per Enterprise Value.\n\nThe carbon footprint normalized per Enterprise Value approach was chosen by Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (NZAOA) members, partly because of the robustness of the CO2 reporting methods and partly because of the availability of data. As part of its participation in NZAOA, AXA Group commits to publishing intermediate targets every five years to track progress towards 'net zero' by 2050.\n\nIn December/uni00A02020, AXA Group announced its 'intermediate target' of a 20% reduction in the carbon footprint of AXA Group's General Account assets between 2019 and 2025 ( e.g., 20% cumulative reduction for corporate debt and listed equities, excluding emerging market issuers and entities; and real estate assets where possible), using the NZAOA/uni00A02025 Target Setting Protocol.\n\nBetween 2019 and 2022, AXA Group's balance sheet carbon intensity per Enterprise Value (tCO2/EV m\u20ac) fell -35%, and by -6% in 2022 alone. This target is part of the 'AXA for Progress Index' and is presented in further detail in the AXA SA's annual 'Climate and Biodiversity Report'.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nAdditionally, AXA Group continues its investigation of the concept of an 'investment temperature' to develop its knowledge of the impact of AXA Group's investments on climate change (climate impact). This approach labelled 'warming potential' in MSCI's methodology, captures the climate-related aspects of a company's activities, including its direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions, technology developments, and 'green revenue' opportunities. AXA Group's analysis shows that in-scope AXA Group's General Account assets, being sovereign debt, corporate bonds, and equity, had a +2.6\u00b0C 'warming potential' at the end of 2021/uni00A0 (1) . This is below the benchmark/uni00A0 (2) of +3\u00b0C, but nonetheless shows that investors are operating in a carbon-intensive economy that is not aligned with the COP21 Paris Agreement yet.\n\n## Climate risk on AXA Group's Corporate Investments: Climate  Value-at-Risk\n\nIn 2022, AXA Group continued to explore a model developed by MSCI for its corporate assets only to assess selected physical and transition risks and opportunities.\n\nThis model represents an estimate of how the value of corporate bonds and listed equities in AXA Group's General Account Assets investment portfolio might be impacted by climate policy risk, technology transition opportunities and extreme weather events on a 15-year time horizon. This model currently only applies to corporate bonds and listed equities and is under continuous development. Annual updates to this model allow AXA Group to expand the range of measured climate-related financial risks of AXA Group's investments and to assess them more precisely. In 2021, the model was updated to include additional physical risks (river low flow and wildfires) for all scenarios.\n\nTo assess future potential costs/benefits for companies in a given climate scenario (+1.5\u00b0C, +2\u00b0C or +3\u00b0C), policy risks, technological opportunities and physical risks are combined into a single Climate Value-at-Risk/uni00A0 (3) metric. AXA Group applied this Climate Value-at-Risk model to its corporate bonds and listed equities investments under +1.5\u00b0C, +2\u00b0C and +3\u00b0C scenarios using an average and an aggressive physical scenario.\n\nAccording to the Climate Value-at-Risk methodology, the climate change impact on the valuation of the companies in which AXA Group invests represents an aggregated risk of 11%/uni00A0 (4 ) of the market value of AXA Group's investment portfolio under the best scenario (+1.5\u00b0C).\n\n## INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS\n\nOver time, the Group has developed specific 'sector guidelines' to address certain activities in sectors that may pose certain risks to AXA Group as an investor and insurer. Among them, Coal, Oil and gas and Ecosystem conversion and deforestation policies, which apply to both investment and underwriting activities, aim to contribute to the transition toward a more sustainable and less carbon-intensive economy.\n\nThese policies are published on AXA Group's website (www.axa.com/ en/about-us/investments#tab=responsible-investment).\n\n## AXA Group Coal Policy\n\nCoal is by far the most carbon-intensive form of energy and as such coal-based power generation is seen as the industry the most at risk in terms of such 'asset stranding'.\n\nAXA Group bans investments, for General Accounts and in UnitLinked assets in fully controlled mandates, in the following companies:\n\n- /uni25A0 power generation companies with coal share of power production (energy mix) over 30% and/or coal 'expansion plans' producing more than 300/uni00A0MW and/or over 10/uni00A0GW of coal-based power installed capacity;\n- /uni25A0 mining companies with coal share of revenues over 30% and/ or with annual coal production over 20/uni00A0million/uni00A0tons and/or developing new coal mines; and\n- /uni25A0 certain coal industry partners, defined as manufacturers ( e.g., equipment suppliers) and infrastructure players ( e.g., port terminals, dedicated railways) developing significant new coal assets.\n\nIn addition, AXA Group is committed to a long-term 'exit' strategy reducing exposure to the thermal coal industry to zero by 2030/uni00A0in the European Union and OECD countries, and by 2040/uni00A0in the rest of the world, as suggested by the main climate scenarios (such as the IEA 'Beyond +2\u00b0C' scenario). This approach is applied both to its investments and underwriting activities (please refer to Section/uni00A0'Climate and biodiversity matters as an insurer' below).\n\nFull details of the AXA Group Coal Policy are available at https:// www.axa.com.\n\nThe AXA Group Coal Policy is currently under review and is expected to be updated in the course of 2023.\n\nI\n\nI",

Only companies with Norwegian operations in the AMAP Region will be excluded from the scope of restrictions, given their high environmental standards and lower operational carbon footprint. AXA Group will exclude new direct investments in companies deriving more than 10% of their production from the AMAP Region or producing more than 5% of the worldwide volume of AMAPbased Oil &/uni00A0Gas;\n- /uni25A0 oil sands: AXA Group has adopted a more stringent policy by ceasing direct investments in companies producing more than 5% of the worldwide volume of oil sands; and\n- /uni25A0 fracking/shale Oil and Gas : AXA Group will no longer directly invest in companies deriving more than 30% of their production from fracking/shale Oil and Gas.\n\nThe main database used is the 'Global Oil &/uni00A0Gas Exit List' (GOGEL)/uni00A0 (1) released in 2022.\n\nFull details of the AXA Group Energy Policy are available at https:// www.axa.com.\n\nThe AXA Group Energy Policy is currently under review and is expected to be updated in the course of 2023.\n\n## AXA Group Ecosystem conversion and/uni00A0Deforestation policy\n\nThe policy on the protection of ecosystems and deforestation seeks to address risks related to deforestation and protected areas of key biodiversity value. Curbing deforestation conserves water resources, prevents flooding, controls soil erosion, and preserves habitats and biodiversity, in addition to preserving key carbon sinks.\n\nThis policy is implemented at Group level and is subject to the oversight of the Responsible Investment Committee and the Group Underwriting Committee. In the course of 2022, this policy has\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\n## 4.3/uni00A0CLIMATE CHANGE AND BIODIVERSITY\n\nbeen implemented by all AXA entities. In the case of the asset management entities of the Group, the policy has been applied to the extent that they manage General Accounts assets.\n\nFull details of the current AXA Group Ecosystem conversion and Deforestation Policy is available at https://www.axa.com.\n\nThe AXA Group Ecosystem conversion and Deforestation Policy is currently under review and is expected to be updated in the course of 2023.\n\n## GREEN INVESTMENTS AND SUSTAINABILITY LINKED BONDS\n\nTo support its green investment strategy, AXA Group has developed an internal framework defining 'green' investments based on external labels, certifications, and environmental standards as appropriate. Green investments are defined as: green bonds, infrastructure debt &/uni00A0equity, impact investments, real estate, and commercial real estate loans. AXA Group's green investment strategy is detailed in AXA SA's annual 'Climate and Biodiversity Report'. Green investments encourage various sectors to strengthen their climate strategy.\n\nIn November/uni00A02019, AXA Group committed to invest through its General Account assets, \u20ac24/uni00A0billion in green investments by 2023. In 2021, this target was increased to \u20ac26/uni00A0billion. As of December/uni00A02022, AXA Group's green investments reached \u20ac25.1/uni00A0billion (\u20ac22.6/uni00A0billion end of 2021).\n\nIn 2021, AXA Group set a \u20ac300/uni00A0million target to develop publicly listed transition bonds and Sustainability-Linked Bonds (SLBs). The focus of SLBs is on financing companies with credible plans to transition to Net-Zero. SLBs di/ffer from green bonds in that, they are not 'use-of-proceeds' instruments but rather, are general purpose bonds. Unlike conventional debt however, these bonds incorporate targets linked to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) factors, which are measured through Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and assessed against predefined Sustainability Performance Targets (SPTs). As such, they represent a new opportunity to fund the climate transition and other environmental and social challenges.\n\nIn 2021, AXA Group also committed to a new 'Natural Capital' target of \u20ac1.5/uni00A0billion dedicated to reforestation by supporting forestry management projects in developed markets and nature-based solutions through initiatives such as a/ff orestation, restoration and avoided deforestation which outcome can o/f\\_t en be measured through the production of carbon credits with the objective being to sequestrate/avoid 25/uni00A0M t CO2 on an annual basis.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

These engagement activities are carried out either directly by the Group or by AXA Investment Managers (AXA IM) on behalf of the Group and third-party clients.\n\nAXA IM's key climate engagement objectives and indicators are shaped by the TCFD framework, which has established itself as the de facto reporting framework on this issue.

The Group Emerging Risk Steering Board issues recommendations to adapt its business o/ff er and underwriting policies.\n\n## CONSIDERATION OF CLIMATE IN/uni00A0INSURANCE PORTFOLIO\n\nAXA Group actively supports coalitions that bring collective solutions to issues requiring industry-wide cooperation. This is why AXA Group publicly supported the creation of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA) to collectively extend its investment commitment to 'net-zero' to its insurance business.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nChaired by AXA Group since February/uni00A02021, the NZIA revealed its commitments at the G20/uni00A0in July/uni00A02021, with the main commitment to transition insurance and reinsurance underwriting portfolios to 'net-zero' greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In January/uni00A02023 the NZIA launched its first Target-setting protocol. The objective of the Protocol is to enable NZIA members to begin setting science-based, interim decarbonization targets for their respective insurance and reinsurance underwriting portfolios in line with the COP21 Paris Agreement.\n\n## UNDERWRITING RESTRICTIONS\n\nAXA Group strives to incorporate ESG criteria (including those related to climate and biodiversity) in its underwriting activities, consistent with its investment strategy, though sector guidelines (please refer to Section/uni00A0'Investments restrictions' above), notably on Coal, Oil and Gas, and Ecosystem conversion and Deforestation.\n\n## AXA Group Coal Policy\n\nThe underwriting restrictions ban Property and Construction covers for coal mines and coal plants. It also includes coal-related restrictions at client-level, mirroring, as appropriate, the criteria that apply to investments. Full details of the current AXA Group Coal Policy is available at https://www.axa.com.\n\nThe AXA Group Coal Policy is currently under review and is expected to be updated in the course of 2023.\n\n- /uni25A0 perform scenario analysis using a scenario where global warming is limited to the COP21 Paris Agreement goal of 'well below 2\u00b0C; and\n- /uni25A0 align executive remuneration to climate change objectives.\n\nIn the specific case of coal, AXA Group encourages the transition through active shareholder engagement, as an investor, and client communication, as an insurer, with the concerned companies in order to encourage them to develop and disclose an exit or closure plan.\n\nFor more information, please refer to AXA IM's annual Active Ownership and Stewardship report, published on AXA IM's website ( https://axa-im.com).",

The impact of AXA Group's operations on climate change is identified as one of the key sustainability risks in 2022 (as explained in Section/uni00A04.1 'AXA Group's sustainability strategy/uni00A0- Sustainability risk assessment' of this Annual Report). AXA Group's own operations may have a negative impact on climate through its GHG emissions from\n\nheating and cooling, IT equipment and data centers, car fleet, and business travel. To reduce its impact and make sure it actively reduces its GHG/uni00A0emissions, AXA Group has set up an environmental management system for the entire Group. The annual environmental reporting enables AXA Group to track the progress made against a set of targets that are regularly updated to reflect the Group's ambition. Entities are coordinated and have assigned targets but also benefit from regular training, bestpractice sharing, and guidelines. The results of this policy are displayed in detail in the following section with the GHG/uni00A0emissions from energy, car fleet, business travel and IT.\n\nAXA's own operations 2019-2025 targets and 2022 performance are summarized in the table below:\n\n| (in Euro million)

AXA Group aims at reducing the footprint of its operations on all the 'Scopes' of its greenhouse gas emissions/uni00A0 (1) :\n\n- /uni25A0 Scope/uni00A01: emissions related to fuel combustion on AXA Group's sites (gas, heating oil\u2026) as well by vehicle fleet;\n- /uni25A0 Scope/uni00A02: emissions from purchased energy (mainly electricity consumed in AXA Group buildings); and\n- /uni25A0 Scope/uni00A03: emissions from business travel and IT activities.\n\nThese objectives are based on the approach promoted by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which AXA Group joined in 2015. More specifically, AXA Group has chosen the 'Sectoral Approach to Decarbonization' to define its 2019-2025/uni00A0objectives, aimed at achieving the goals of the COP21 Paris Agreement. AXA Group has submitted to the SBTi a target of -31% for Scope/uni00A01 and 2/uni00A0perimeters. These targets have been set for each entity of AXA Group to help them steer their emissions at the local level. Moreover, internal operations-related carbon footprint reduction is now a criterion in the Long-Term Incentive (LTI), for profit-sharing attribution as well as entities' CEO target letters/uni00A0- please refer to Section/uni00A03.2/uni00A0'Executive compensation and share ownership' and Section/uni00A04.2/uni00A0'Employer Responsibility' of this Annual Report.\n\nThis objective is part of a broader framework that integrates the new measures related to AXA Group's IT activities and which translates into an overall reduction of the Group's GHG/uni00A0emissions of 20% by 2025/uni00A0compared to 2019/uni00A0(Scope/uni00A01, Scope/uni00A02 and Scope/uni00A03 business travel and IT equipment manufacturing and services). With the goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2025, AXA Group's GHG emissions reduction is one of the components of the 'AXA Progress Index', as explained in Section/uni00A04.1 'AXA Group's sustainability strategy' of this Annual Report.\n\nPlease note that AXA Group does not set a target for employee commuting as the various constraints related to commuting (personal choice of employees, location, infrastructure,/uni00A0etc.) are not within the control of AXA Group.\n\nBesides, it should be noted that, in addition to the emissions associated to its own operations, the overall Scope/uni00A03 GHG emissions of AXA Group include the financed emissions, which correspond to the carbon footprint of General Account assets, and the insurance associated emissions that are currently evaluated in the context of the Net Zero Insurance Alliance. For further details, please refer to Section/uni00A04.3 'Climate and biodiversity matters as an investor/uni00A0- Consideration of climate in investment\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\n## 4.3/uni00A0CLIMATE CHANGE AND BIODIVERSITY\n\nportfolio management/uni00A0- Impact of AXA Group's investments on climate: Carbon footprint'/uni00A0and to Section/uni00A0'Climate and biodiversity matters as an insurer/uni00A0- Consideration of climate in insurance portfolio' above.\n\n## 2022 environmental performance\n\n## GHG EMISSIONS: ANALYSIS BY SCOPE\n\nGHG emissions related to energy consumption, car fleet, business travel and IT decreased by 48% between 2019/uni00A0and 2022/uni00A0and amounted to 112,728/uni00A0tons equivalent CO2/uni00A0(t CO2 eq) in 2022, well below the 2022/uni00A0target of 185,267/uni00A0t/uni00A0CO2 eq which has been set to achieve a 20% reduction target between 2019 and 2025. A/f\\_t er two years of substantially reduced GHG emissions due to the containment measures and travel restrictions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the reopening of o/ff ices and the resumption of business travel have led to a sharp increase in emissions compared to 2021 (+33%), which nevertheless remains below pre-pandemic levels.\n\nIn 2022, 39% of the Group's GHG/uni00A0emissions were related to energy consumption, 24% to IT, 21% to business travel (air and rail), and 16% to AXA Group's vehicle fleet.\n\n## Scope/uni00A01/uni00A0GHG emissions\n\nAXA Group's Scope/uni00A01 emissions include the GHG emissions generated by gas and heating oil burned on site, as well as the fuel used by the Group's automobile fleets. The calculation of CO2/uni00A0eq emissions related to primary energy consumption for buildings is done using ADEME emission factors or those communicated by the supplier for renewable energies such as biogas. For car fleet emissions, an emission factor per kilometer is applied based on the vehicle's emission range. To consider regulatory changes vehicles acquired or leased from 2020/uni00A0onwards are classified according to the WLTP/uni00A0 (2) standard.\n\nIn 2022, Scope/uni00A01 GHG emissions amounted to 23,280/uni00A0t/uni00A0CO2 eq, in line with 2021 results. AXA Group's target for 2022 was 32,860/uni00A0t/uni00A0CO2 eq and was set to achieve the 25% reduction target between 2019 and 2025. Compared to 2021, the increase of consumption in some sites was mainly driven by the return to the o/ff ices a/f\\_t er the COVID-19 crisis and was compensated by the e/ff orts performed by other sites to optimize their energy consumption and reduce o/ff ice space.\n\nThe use of the vehicle fleet in 2022 has increased compared to 2021, with a switch to low emitting vehicle in some countries, limiting the increase in CO2 emissions to 8%.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

In cases where the primary source of energy is well identified, ADEME emissions factors were used. In cases where this information is not available, AXA Group used either the emission factor provided by the electricity suppliers, also called M arket-B ased, or the average emission factor for electricity in the country concerned, also called L ocation-based (source ADEME or European Environment Agency for European countries).\n\nFor other secondary energy sources (heating and cooling networks), AXA Group used the emission factors provided by ADEME or directly by the supplier when the energy was produced from a renewable primary source.\n\nIn 2022, Scope/uni00A02 GHG emissions amounted to 39,370/uni00A0t/uni00A0CO2 eq, which represented a decrease of 37% compared to 2019 and was even lower than the target of 50,728,/uni00A0t/uni00A0CO2 eq that was set by AXA Group for 2022, to achieve a 35% decrease between 2019 and 2025. As compared to 2021, the Scope/uni00A02 GHG emission increased by 23%, mainly due to the increase in consumption resulting from the return to the buildings a/f\\_t er the COVID-19 pandemic, and the inclusion in the reporting scope of additional data centers in Asia and America.\n\n## Scope/uni00A03/uni00A0GHG/uni00A0emissions\n\nWhile AXA Group's Scope/uni00A03 GHG emissions include GHG emissions related to business travel, digital equipment consumption (computers, fixed and cell phones, storage tools, cloud storage servers) and employee commuting, AXA Group's Scope/uni00A03 target for the period 2019-2025 only includes business travel. For business travel, AXA Group used the emission factors provided by ADEME and the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural A/ff airs (DEFRA).\n\nIn 2022, AXA Group's Scope/uni00A03 business travel emissions amounted to 23,279/uni00A0t/uni00A0CO2 eq. They significantly increased compared to 2021 (+502%) due to the end of border restrictions and the fast resumption of business travel, which could not take place during the pandemic. Yet, the emissions associated to business travel decreased by 74% compared to 2019, well beyond the 2025 target of 18% reduction (corresponding to a yearly target of 82,149/uni00A0t/uni00A0CO2\n\nI\n\nI\n\neq for 2022). A/f\\_t er a sharp decline of business travel in 2021 due to the COVID-19 crisis, the significant increase in 2022 reflects the return to normal conditions with the removal of the travel restrictions. Nevertheless, the performance against the yearly target confirms sustained changes of habit.\n\nAXA Group also measures the carbon emissions related to its employee commuting, even though such indirect emissions may be outside of the scope of the Group's responsibilities. In 2022, the results are calculated on the basis of responses collected from 31 entities, then extrapolated to the entire Group. It is estimated that AXA Group employees commuted a total of 1,242/uni00A0million of kilometers, out of which 46% travelled by public transport, 5% by company cars, and 45% by personal vehicles and the rest by foot or bicycle. Scope/uni00A03 employee commuting emissions are estimated at 117,472/uni00A0t CO2 eq/uni00A0in 2022, decreasing by 5% versus 2019. Employee commuting-related CO2/uni00A0emissions per FTE decreased by 3% compared to 2019/uni00A0(representing 1.15/uni00A0t CO2 eq/uni00A0per FTE in 2022). This decrease in emission was linked to a decrease of commuting due to hybrid work mode scheme put in place in most AXA Group entities/uni00A0- refer to Section/uni00A04.2/uni00A0'Employer Responsibility'.\n\nIT Scope/uni00A03 GHG emissions (equipment manufacturi ng and services) amounted to 26,798/uni00A0t/uni00A0CO2 eq/uni00A0in 2022, an increase compared to 25,720/uni00A0t/uni00A0CO2 eq in 2021, mainly due to scope extension. The monitoring of Scope/uni00A03 GHG emissions related to AXA Group's IT impacts is part of a broader program aiming at steering the impact of AXA Group's digital activities (refer to paragraph 'Environmental impact related to the use of digital equipment').\n\nTotal AXA Group's Scope/uni00A03 emissions (business travel, commuting and digital equipment and services) amounted to 167,549/uni00A0t/uni00A0CO2 eq in 2022.\n\n## ANALYSIS PER CONSUMPTION ITEMS\n\n2022 was marked by the end of COVID-19 measures and the return to the o/ff ice, whose e/ff ects were partly o/ff set by a continued increase in hybrid working arrangements in all AXA Group entities with the implementation of 'Smart Working', and energy sobriety plans deployed in Europe. Those changes had significant impacts on all AXA Group's energy consumption indicators, presented in the table below.",

In 2022 total energy mix consisted of electricity (77%), gas (8%), carbon neutral/ renewable steam (7%), steam (3%), biogas (3%), chilled water (2%)  and heating oil (less than 1%) .\n\nAXA Group's total energy consumption was 236,986/uni00A0MWh for 2022, rather stable compared to 2021 (+1%) and represented a decrease of 22% as compared to 2019. This consumption was lower than the 2022/uni00A0target of 289,823/uni00A0MWh that was set by AXA Group for 2022 to achieve a 10% decrease between 2019 and 2025. In 2022, consumption increased in some sites driven by the return to the o/ff ice a/f\\_t  er the COVID-19 crisis however some entities have continued e/ff orts to save energy and reduce o/ff ice space.\n\nIn 2022, 79 out of the 206 o/ff ice sites included in the environmental reporting received an environmental certificate under building certification programs such as BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology), LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design), HQE (High Quality Environmental Standard),/uni00A0etc. This represented 38% of sites compared to 34% in 2021.\n\nIn parallel with the certification of the buildings, the entities also implement energy saving measures in their buildings in order to reduce their GHG emissions. On the one hand, for most of these entities, these measures take the form of the installation of centralized air conditioning systems, the reduction of heating or cooling when necessary and the establishment of minimum and maximum temperature thresholds. And on the other hand, these measures are also accompanied by investments in more sober equipment such as Low-Energy Lighting (LED), double glazing to reduce energy losses and lighting by motion detector to save electricity and use light according to use.\n\nIn 2022, 61% of the electricity consumed by AXA Group was coming from renewable energy sources (hydro, wind, solar, geothermal, biomass) which shows a slight decrease of 5% compared to 2021/uni00A0(64%). This is mainly explained by changes in the geographical consumption mix, with a decrease in electricity consumption in Europe (following the implementation of sobriety plans) where the share of renewable electricity is higher, compensated by an increase in America and Asia (inclusion of some data centers) where entities still need to enhance their sourcing of renewable energy. AXA Group's 'RE100' objective is to reach 100% by 2025,/uni00A0and 7/uni00A0entities have already achieved 100% renewable electricity in 2022.\n\n## Business travel\n\nBusiness travel measured in kilometers increased by 375% between 2021/uni00A0and 2022, from 28/uni00A0million km in 2021/uni00A0to 133/uni00A0million km in 2022, mainly explained by the removal of travel restrictions a/f\\_t er the COVID-19 crisis (as explained in 'Scope/uni00A03 GHG e missions' above). However, the number of kilometers has significantly decreased as compared to 2019 (-66%) due to reduction on business travel in policies applied in many entities across AXA Group.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## Vehicle fleet\n\nAXA Group's fleet is made up of commercial and corporate vehicles. The standards for calculating vehicle emissions are evolving with the deployment of the WLTP standards. Vehicles acquired or leased from 2020/uni00A0onwards are classified according to these new standards.\n\nIn 2022, the total distance traveled by the AXA Group's vehicle fleet was 161/uni00A0million of km, up 13% from 2021, but reduced by 27% as compared to 2019, which was not impacted by COVID-19 measures.\n\nAXA Group entities are striving to reduce the impact of their vehicle fleet. As part of this e/ff ort, some entities are increasing the e/ff iciency of their vehicle fleet by o/ff ering a wide range of low-emission electric vehicles.\n\nAs a result, in 2022, 31% of the kilometers traveled by AXA Group's vehicle fleet were covered by hybrid and electric cars, compared to 25% in 2021, an increase of nearly 23%.\n\n## Paper\n\nAXA Group's paper usage includes o/ff ice paper and marketing and distribution paper (brochures,/uni00A0etc.) and is measured per employee. AXA Group's total paper consumption was 48/uni00A0kg/ FTE in 2022/uni00A0 versus 62/uni00A0kg/FTE in 2021, i.e., a decrease of 22%. 2022/uni00A0target was 55/uni00A0kg/FTE (AXA Group target is 20% reduction between 2019/uni00A0and 2025/uni00A0target).\n\nAXA Group also strives to increase the volume of paper from recycled sources or sustainably managed forests. In 2022, 69% of o/ff ice paper was procured from recycled sources compared to 65% in 2021.\n\n## Water consumption\n\nAXA Group's water consumption was 3.9 /uni00A0m 3 /FTE, representing an increase of/uni00A022% compared to 2021. The target for 2022/uni00A0was 6.7/uni00A0m 3 /FTE (target is 10% reduction between 2019/uni00A0and 2025). This reduction in water consumption compared with the target reflects better water management initiatives by the entities (dualflush toilets, automatic faucet shut-o/ff s, faucet aerators, leak detection,/uni00A0etc.), but the increase compared to previous year is due to the return to the o/ff ice a/f\\_t er COVID-19 crisis.\n\n## Waste management\n\nAXA Group contributes to waste reduction and sorting for recycling.\n\nThe amount of unsorted waste was 23/uni00A0kg/FTE in 2022, representing an increase of 22% compared to 2021, mainly due to the return to the o/ff ices a/f\\_t er the COVID-19 crisis. The target for 2022 was 36/uni00A0kg /FTE (the reduction target is 10% between 2019 and 2025). The performance against yearly target is due to local initiatives, in some entities, to reduce waste and develop sorting.\n\nThe total amount of waste generated by AXA Group was 4,834/uni00A0tons in 2022 compared to 4,289/uni00A0tons in 2021, representing an increase of 13%; the recycling rate (sorted waste/total waste) was 45% in 2022, decreasing by 9% compared to 2021.",

However, for several years now, the growing environmental impact of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) is acknowledged. Therefore, AXA Group's IT Department launched the 'Digital Sustainability' program in 2020. This program aims at measuring the environmental impact of ICT and at identifying levers to reduce it. In 2022, the program has moved onto the next step to:\n\n- /uni25A0 continuously improve measurement accuracy with a broader scope now covering AXA XL, AXA IM, AXA Partners, AXA GO Spain, AXA GO Asia; more accurate inventories on workplace; more accurate data from service providers. Since the beginning, AXA Group is in the process of consolidating its ICT footprint and improving data accuracy with improvements still to come that may impact the measurement;\n- /uni25A0 secure contribution to the 20% reduction of AXA Group's CO2/uni00A0emissions (energy, car fleet and business travel, and IT equipment and services) with the inclusion of/uni00A0the 'Digital Sustainability' program/uni00A0in/uni00A0Global IT Programs' governance and strengthening the role of Digital Sustainability Leaders of entities across the world, thanks to dedicated teams and locally-defined targets to track the implementation of levers in their operations;\n- /uni25A0 work on reducing the pressure on demand for new equipment by extending equipment lifespan, minimizing the number of devices per employee, considering 'Bring your own device' practices or the purchase of reconditioned equipment;\n- /uni25A0 secure timely clo ud migration, decommissioning of replaced servers and assess the potential impact of new projects in terms of CO2 emissions. AXA Group expects better performance from cloud computing hyperscalers compared to data centers it operates directly. Despite the progr ess already achieved, the Group lacks readily available and reliable data on electricity consumption, quantitative data for digital waste management, and information on equipment lifecycle policy and their footprint to confirm this assumption (AXA Group is relying on the hyperscalers to report on the cloud CO2 performance);\n- /uni25A0 improve the Group's enterprise architecture, software development, data science and data management practices to make them more sustainable. This lever is important to optimize the Group's activities but requires time to produce quantitative results;\n- /uni25A0 onboard procurement teams &/uni00A0IT suppliers through dedicated global meetings and continuous discussions to improve the measurement accuracy;\n- /uni25A0 raise climate change awareness among employees leveraging the AXA Climate Academy (refer to Section/uni00A04.2/uni00A0'Employer Responsibility' of this Annual Report); and\n\nI\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\n## 4.3/uni00A0CLIMATE CHANGE AND BIODIVERSITY\n\n- /uni25A0 renew the partnership with The Shi/f\\_t  Project Lean-ICT program for the next two years to get scientific support for the Group's approach and encourage the shi/f\\_t  of the IT market toward more sustainable business models.\n\nAXA Group's digit al footprint was 36,870/uni00A0t/uni00A0CO2 eq in 2022 (M arketbased); this is a significant increase compared to 2021 due to changes in the methodology and increase of the scope in 2022. On a comparable r eporting scope basis, the digital footprint has increased by 6% compared to 2021, and 7% compared to 2019, mainly reflecting more accurate inventories for workstations, consequently resulting in an increase of the considered devices.\n\nThis footprint is divided into four main categories:\n\n- /uni25A0 40,874/uni00A0MWh corresponding to 5,947/uni00A0t CO2 eq (M arket-based)/uni00A0 (1) related to electricity consumption of servers directly used and operated by AXA Group Operations in its data centers. The increase in 2022 is due to a broader scope now covering AXA XL, AXA IM, AXA Partners, AXA GO Spain, AXA GO Asia. We observed a 9% decrease in electricity consumption and a 6% decrease in market-based CO2 eq emissions between 2021 and 2022 on comparable scope due to the transfer of services from AXA Group data centers to the cloud;\n- /uni25A0 12,854/uni00A0MWh corresponding to 4,126/uni00A0t CO2  eq/uni00A0(L ocation-based )/uni00A0 (1) linked to the electricity consumption of the terminals used by employees and contractors involved in activities (computers, monitors, cell phones, tablets). The calculation method is based on internal inventories and manufacturers' data. The measurement includes a subset of Scope/uni00A02 (for consumption in AXA Group buildings) as well as a Scope/uni00A03 part in the case of remote work. The quality of inventories has improved with an increase by 10% of the number of tracked mobile terminals since 2021, especially on monitors. As a consequence, there was a 22% increase in electricity consumption between 2021 and 2022/uni00A0on a comparable scope, as well as a 4% increase in GHG emissions;\n- /uni25A0 21,320/uni00A0 t CO2 eq related to the manufacturing of digital equipment used by AXA Group. The calculation method is based on inventories, manufacturers' data, and public data, as well as the average equipment lifespan (Scope/uni00A03 emissions). A 10% increase in CO2 eq emissions as compared to 2021 on a comparable basis  was observed mainly due to a more accurate inventory on workstation equipment;  and\n- /uni25A0 5,478/uni00A0t CO2 eq/uni00A0in connection with the purchase of cloud computing services by AXA Group from its main providers: Amazon, Microso/f\\_t  Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Microso/f\\_t O365, Orange and Salesforce. The reporting scope was extended to AXA XL in 2022. Emission sources are either based on information from service providers or on estimates/ extrapolations when no measurement of emissions related to the manufacturing of equipment is provided. In 2022, the CDP calculation was completely replaced by service providers' data\n\nI\n\n4",

In addition, we observed a decrease in CO2 eq emissions between 2021 and 2022 despite an increase in electricity consumption. Service providers explain this result is an outcome of improved e/ff  iciency as well as the fact that the grids they operate on emit less carbon year over year without providing detailed proof such as information on electricity consumption, electricity mix hypothesis, equipment life cycle. In the current measurement, the Group observed a 9% increase of CO2/uni00A0eq emissions (marketbased) between 2019 and 2022 on a comparable basis due to increased electricity consumption,/uni00A0and a 6% decrease between 2021/uni00A0and 2022 on a comparable basis.\n\n## Carbon neutrality and o/ff setting\n\nBy o/ff setting 2020/uni00A0GHG emissions related to energy, car fleet, business travel and IT equipment and services AXA Group's operations have been carbon neutral since 2021. To compensate the full year 2022 carbon footprint of its operations (112,728/uni00A0t/uni00A0CO2 eq), AXA Group selected two projects: one to promote rural biogas development in China and another one aiming at restoring and reserving peatlands in Indonesia. In China, the project supports nearly 1M low-income rural households with advanced biogas digesters and smoke-free biogas cooking stoves. In Indonesia, the project protects vital habitat for a range of flora and fauna including 5 critically endangered, 8/uni00A0endangered and 31 vulnerable species.\n\n## CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACT ON AXA GROUP'S OWN OPERATIONS\n\nClimate change may also impact AXA Group's own operations mostly via the physical risks incurred by its buildings and the disruption in activities they can cause. Climate hazards can also impact the health and safety of the Group's employees. This risk has been identified in the ESG risk assessment conducted in 2022 (refer to the Section/uni00A04.1/uni00A0'AXA Group sustainability strategy/uni00A0- Sustainability risk assessment' of this Annual Report). Information in this Section/uni00A0should be read in conjunction with Section/uni00A05.7/uni00A0'Operational r isk' of this Annual Report as climate risks are part of the broader Operational Risks.\n\nOperational resilience seeks to ensure the continuity of services to AXA Group's customers, through the protection of its employees and operations in case of major events including climate hazards. AXA Group's operational resilience teams are working to reduce those risks and ensure the appropriate level of readiness to effectively respond. A dedicated governance oversees the management of crisis events across the Group.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThe following initiatives and policies are deployed in all the entities:\n\n- /uni25A0 map, via a monitoring dashboard of natural disasters, the di/ff erent types of natural disasters threatening AXA Group's operations and implement the relevant protection measures;\n- /uni25A0 following Group guidelines, entities identify the critical business processes, dependencies (both internal and with third parties) and associated resources that must be maintained throughout a crisis, to ensure continuity of operations and mitigate the impact on the Group's customers;\n- /uni25A0 entities prepare recovery plans for their business-critical process, to address the e/ff ects of disruptive events such as the loss of buildings, people, technology and critical third parties;\n- /uni25A0 High Risk Scenario Plans are developed for the top risks that entities are exposed to, addressing both tactical and strategic considerations required to respond e/ff ectively;\n- /uni25A0 AXA Group entities' Incident and Crisis Management Teams are trained on regular basis and conduct exercises to ensure they are well rehearsed to respond e/ff ectively and protect the Group's employees, customers, critical operations, regulatory compliance, financial performance and reputation;\n- /uni25A0 regular coordination and enhancement of multi-entity Crisis planning for Group High Risk Scenarios:/uni00A0pandemic, catastrophic event impacting a business-critical operation, flood, cyberattacks &/uni00A0civil unrest; and\n- /uni25A0 implementation of an information crisis management tool to ensure an e/ff ective response, even in a scenario where communication infrastructure may be impacted.\n\nIn 2022, the Group organized a Climate Resilience Seminar bringing together all expertise within AXA Group to enhance its resilience to Climate Change related risks and define a clear roadmap to be launched in 2023.\n\nAXA Group also started the development of the Flood Readiness Guidelines, with the aim of making the expertise and knowledge publicly available, supporting the broader community resilience to potentially critical climate related hazards.\n\nIn order to regularly measure and monitor the evolution of its business continuity capabilities, which is a fundamental operational resilience building block to ensure readiness to climate change risks, the Group measures the number of entities that have tested all business continuity plans for high and mission critical business processes. By 2022, 95% of entities have completed all these tests, with an annual target of 100%.",

In 2021, the AXA Group strengthened its sustainability strategy with a pillar dedicated to i nclusive p rotection and the integration of a dedicated indicator in the 'AXA for Progress Index' (refer to Section/uni00A04.1 'AXA Group's sustainability strategy' of this Annual Report)/uni00A0 (1) . The Inclusive Protection initiative aims to address the protection gap of vulnerable communities through business\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nopportunities adapted to local conditions. In addition, the AXA Group also pursues its solidarity actions through partnerships and philanthropic activities.\n\nThe risks related to 'Inclusive Insurer' and 'Partnership and Philanthropy' are part of the sustainability risk assessment conducted in 2022. Please refer to Section/uni00A04.1 'AXA Group's sustainability strategy/uni00A0- Sustainability risk assessment' of this Annual Report. The policies, initiatives and indicators associated with these risks are detailed below.\n\n## Business-related societal challenges\n\nThe AXA Group strives to make insurance accessible to all. The pooling of risks, which is at the heart of insurance, creates a system of mutual support and reinforces a sense of community. As such, insurance is an essential factor in economic development and progress. However, some populations find themselves more vulnerable to risks by not having access to insurance products and services because of their financial situation, their geographical location, their age, gender, health condition,/uni00A0etc. The AXA Group's objective is to extend the scope of insurance to populations that are traditionally less well protected, notably through the following initiatives:\n\n- /uni25A0 the  I nclusive  P  rotection   program;\n- /uni25A0 promotion of financial inclusion through AXA Emerging Customers;\n- /uni25A0 parametric insurance solutions to protect vulnerable populations from the e/ff ects of climate change, with AXA Climate;\n- /uni25A0 insurance solutions and opportunities for women with the 'Women in Insurance' initiative;\n- /uni25A0 dedicated product labels such as Assurance citoyenne ('Citizen insurance'); and\n- /uni25A0 inclusive economy and social related outreach and engagement.\n\nI\n\n## INCLUSIVE PROTECTION\n\nIn 2021, the Group launched its Inclusive Protection program with the objective of better protecting underserved populations with insurance coverage or services. Our goal is to: (i) /uni00A0foster integration of more inclusive criteria and practices in our di/ff erent business lines, (ii) /uni00A0share best practices, and (iii) /uni00A0report accordingly. Inclusive Protection targets both individual clients and businesses, across all sectors of activity, in developed and emerging markets.\n\nThe AXA Group defines an i nclusive p rotection o/ff er as a product ( e.g., designed or customized) or a related service that addresses a vulnerability to meet the needs of the underserved population, in order to bridge a protection gap. AXA's framework defines the vulnerabilities to be considered. These can be caused by 1) structural or 2) occupational situations:\n\n- /uni25A0 structural vulnerabilities: monetary/revenues, territorial disparities, gender and age, chronic diseases, lack of access to health and protection;\n- /uni25A0 occupational vulnerabilities: micro-entrepreneurs, gig economy workers and migrant workers.\n\nIn 2022, the AXA Group reached 11/uni00A0million customers with its i nclusive p rotection program. This figure includes the Inclusive Protection's scopes of AXA Emerging Customers (10.1/uni00A0million), 'Women in Insurance', AXA Climate and other local entities' o/ff ers consolidated within the Inclusive Protection target of reaching 12/uni00A0million customers by 2023.\n\nI\n\n4",

To reach these clients, a wide range of distribution partnerships have been put in place with both traditional actors like banks and microfinance institutions, to more alternative ones, like mobile network operators, digital financial services providers, retailers, public actors, and remittance companies.\n\nAXA Emerging Customers' insurance solutions address financial exclusion by:\n\n- /uni25A0 enabling vulnerable segments of the population to access insurance products and services that contribute to their financial health and accompany them in their economic progression;\n- /uni25A0 providing them with a safety net against unexpected events that can lead to falling into poverty.\n\nThis approach requires the design of products and services that are accessible, a/ff ordable, and relevant to the reality of these otherwise unserved or underserved customers.\n\nDuring 2022, the AXA Emerging Customers business continued its expansion into new markets, including Brazil, Turkey, Colombia and France. In the past years, e/ff orts focused on protecting segments that were hard hit by the COVID-19 crisis including independent workers, migrant workers, and micro, small and medium enterprises.\n\nIn 2022, Emerging Customers protected nearly 10.1/uni00A0million customers across 14 markets in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe.\n\nAXA Emerging Customers also addresses customers segments whose financial resilience and working conditions were impacted by the economic crisis. Some examples include providing microfinance services in Egypt, Indonesia, Colombia, and Mexico, and protection services for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and independent workers in Turkey, France, the Philippines, and Mexico.\n\nFurthermore, AXA Emerging Customers collaborates across AXA's entities to create solutions at the intersection of financial, health and climate risks. In the Philippines, for example, a service for microentrepreneurs included accident, business protection, and natural catastrophe coverage. It is distributed through a partnership with one of the largest pawn shop networks in the country.\n\n## PARAMETRIC INSURANCE\n\nAXA Climate's o/ff er is built on best-in-class climate expertise, fully leveraging satellite technology in order to support economic players engaged in sustainable transitions. To achieve its mission,\n\nI\n\nI\n\nAXA Climate has developed a comprehensive set of businesses and services around climate change: from parametric insurance against climate risk, operational alerting, climate consultancy for industries, public sector, agriculture, and financial services, to training to enhance skills and engage employees in making the sustainable transition a success. In 2022, AXA Climate has generated \u20ac18/uni00A0million of gross revenues and employed 150/uni00A0people.\n\nVulnerable communities are specifically impacted by climate change. AXA Climate is able to provide parametric insurance solutions that trigger quick and automatic payouts within a few days a/f\\_t  er a natural catastrophe or an extreme weather event has struck to prevent them from falling into poverty. For instance, in 2022, AXA Climate collaborated with AXA Emerging Customers to provide parametric drought and flood coverage for smallholder farmers in Mexico, a segment that contributes significantly to agricultural production but disproportionately faces poverty.\n\nAXA Climate works closely with governments and international organizations to develop public-private partnerships in emerging markets. Public-private partnerships represent over half AXA Climate's portfolio. AXA Climate's public clients include all major international sovereign risk pools which provide governments protection against natural disaster risks including tropical cyclone, earthquake, excess rainfall, and drought. AXA Climate also works with governments in the agriculture sector to protect farmers against yield losses due to multiple climate risks. As an example, AXA Climate supports the National Agriculture insurance scheme in India which allows more than 43/uni00A0million farmers to benefit from agricultural insurance. Moreover, AXA Climate also works with the public sector on Agriculture insurance projects at smaller scale in Pakistan, Vietnam, Taiwan, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Zambia, Ethiopia, and Mozambique where it protects over half a million farmers.\n\n## WOMEN IN INSURANCE\n\nWomen, especially in emerging countries, are less well insured than men, despite representing a significant portion of the economy. In 2014, the AXA Group published a report called 'SheForShield'/uni00A0 (1) in collaboration with the International Financial Corporation, which studied women's insurance behaviors, needs and expectations. Since then, the AXA Group has developed the 'Women in Insurance' initiative aimed at increasing women's access to insurance products and services as customers, as entrepreneurs and as distributors, with the following two key priorities:\n\n- /uni25A0 improving access to healthcare solutions which take into account women's specific health and prevention needs. This can also be connected to the Group's involvement in supporting women in science, for example with the AXA Research Fund (refer to the AXA Research Fund section below for more details); and",

This partnership enables the AXA Group to disseminate its expertise, gather best practices, and take part in projects such as the yearly Gender Equity barometer/uni00A0 (1) which highlights disparities between perception and reality on gender-related topics in G7/uni00A0countries since 2020.\n\nIn addition, the AXA Group is a member of Financial Alliance for Women, a coalition of financial institutions which work together to make the business case for women's economic advancement through peer learning, research, and advocacy.\n\n## INTEGRATING SOCIETAL ISSUES IN/uni00A0THE/uni00A0PRODUCT RANGE\n\nIn 2015, AXA France took a voluntary commitment to answer to French clients' requests for more responsible products and created the Offre citoyenne ('Citizen insurance') label, which guarantees that all new insurance contracts o/ff ers benefit clients as well as positively impact society. In 2019, this initiative was adapted and deployed on AXA France's s avings contracts under the Offre citoyenne ('Citizen Savings') label. The approach is based on an assessment toolkit built in collaboration with a panel of external stakeholders and audited yearly by an independent third party.\n\nCitizen engagements are communicated through four pillars: 'Trust' ( e.g., simple contracts for readability and transparency),\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n'Prevention' ( e.g., preventive services or financial education to minimize the risks our clients are facing for themselves, their goods and their savings), 'Environment' ( e.g., investment decisions based on environmental impact; environmental services or o/ff ers for Damages insurance), and 'Inclusion and solidarity' ( e.g., product accessibility for populations usually excluded from insurance mechanisms, investments in French and European Small and Medium Enterprises).\n\nIn 2022, AXA France distributed 85 di/ff erent labelled products in total. Since 2015, 10.2/uni00A0million labelled contracts have been sold.\n\n## INCLUSIVE ECONOMY AND SOCIAL RELATED OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT\n\n## Business for Inclusive Growth (B4IG) and/uni00A0Inclusive economy coalition\n\nThe AXA Group has been a member of the 'Business for Inclusive Growth' (B4IG) coalition since 2019. This OECD-led coalition of private companies contributes to fighting social inequalities by working closely with policymakers to move inclusion up on the agendas at both the global and local levels. In 2022, the AXA Group took part in the 'Access to goods and services' and 'Diversity and Inclusion' working groups.\n\nAXA France is also a member of the 'Inclusive economy coalition', launched in 2018 by CEOs of major French companies, including AXA France, to act in favor of a more inclusive economy. This collective commitment is one of the private sector's responses to social vulnerabilities such as employment (apprenticeships, training), accessible products and services, and inclusive business.\n\n## Tobacco Free Pledge\n\nSince 2016, the AXA Group has been engaged in e/ff orts to divest/uni00A0 (2) from and end insurance coverage for the tobacco industry. In 2020, these e/ff orts were o/ff icially certified through the 'Tobacco Free Pledge' label, which attests to the AXA Group's constant commitment in the fight against tobacco. Tobacco is one of the world's leading causes of death and long-term non-communicable diseases, including cancer, heart disease and chronic respiratory illnesses, and is responsible for more than 8/uni00A0million deaths per year/uni00A0 (3) . The AXA Group believes that supporting an industry which is the main cause of long-term non-communicable diseases, including cancer, heart disease and chronic respiratory illnesses, is incompatible with its role as one of the world's health insurers.\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n4",

These policies aim at reducing a potential risk of misalignment between our corporate citizenship strategy and the overall sustainability strategy as revealed in the ESG risk assessment.\n\nThanks to the AXA Community Investment Survey, the share of activities aligned with the sustainability strategy can be monitored. In 2022, 78% of the \u20ac24.5/uni00A0million of cash donations made by AXA (excluding donations made by Mutuelles AXA and those made for humanitarian emergencies which are covered by an ad hoc budget) and 92% of the 56,500/uni00A0volunteering acts performed by AXA employees were done in support to climate or inclusion protection causes versus 78% of cash donations and 78% of volunteering acts in 2021. The target being that a minimum of 50% of philanthropic donations must be aligned with the sustainability pillars climate and i nclusive p rotection, except donations made by Mutuelles AXA and those in favor of humanitarian emergencies. The contributing entities to the Community Investment Survey represent 99% of AXA's average FTEs (same as 2021).\n\n## PHILANTHOPY\n\n## Support climate and the environment\n\nAXA/uni00A0SA has rolled out between 2019 and 2022, a three-year global partnership with WWF to address climate and biodiversity. Through this program, WWF supported AXA/uni00A0SA in its e/ff orts to ensure that natural capital is better considered in all AXA's activities (please refer to Section/uni00A04.3 'Climate change and biodiversity'). In addition, the philanthropy component of this program contributed directly to the preservation of ecosystems in New Caledonia and Mexico.\n\nIn New Caledonia, three local associations dedicated to the monitoring and evaluation of c oral r eefs health status were supported. In Mexico, the 'Reforestation in the Copalita watershed' project enabled the production of 30,000/uni00A0shoots of local species for reforestation, 30/uni00A0hectares of local trees were planted and 58/uni00A0people from local communities were trained in agroecology representing 11 local producers. This training emphasized the\n\nI\n\nI\n\nautonomy of women by encouraging them to participate in decision-making and in the implementation of techniques for the conservation and restoration of their plots.\n\nIn France, in 2022, AXA/uni00A0SA, AXA IM Alts, and AXA France initiated a three/uni00A0 year partnership with a consortium of scientists, NGOs, and forestry experts (namely INRAE, Agro ParisTech, France Nature Environnement and Reforest'action ) called AXA Forests for Good. The partnership uses AXA's forestry assets destroyed by bark beetle attacks (600/uni00A0hectares out of the 15,000/uni00A0hectares owned in France by AXA France) as an opportunity to experiment with new methods of forest restoration and management, including mixed species plantations. Ultimately, AXA Forest for Good aims at proposing a more e/ff  ective and sustainable way to restore damaged plantations and promote the multifunctionality of harvested forests ( i.e., host for biodiversity, carbon sink, biomaterials, influence the water cycle and human well-being). This initiative is intended to be shared with forest ecosystem stakeholders and the broader public.\n\n## Support Inclusive Protection\n\nStarting in 2020, AXA/uni00A0SA has rolled out a three-year partnership with UNICEF on a program to respond to the global issue of obesity, working on early childhood eating habits in the Philippines and Brazil. To reach children below five, UNICEF acts on their immediate environment, namely mothers and the health and education professionals around them. Training, communication, and advocacy activities with authorities have been implemented by local UNICEF teams.\n\nIn 2022, the program achieved the following:\n\n- /uni25A0 Philippines: UNICEF developed a school nutrition and food environment assessment tool. This tool was then field-tested in selected schools in late 2022. 80/uni00A0teachers and daycare workers received training on Parenting E/ff ectiveness Services (PES), covering general child health and well-being, maternal health, and healthy environments with a focus on nutrition, water, hygiene and sanitation. In addition, 145 health facilities in three regions received follow-up and supervision a/f\\_t er the training. In August/uni00A02022, the fourth Healthy Food Coalition was held. During this event UNICEF presented a strategy for the regulation of the marketing of processed foods to local authorities and provided feedback on the nutrition profile template which will serve as the basis for the development of the nutrition label on packages; and\n- /uni25A0 Brazil: 282,564/uni00A0people received messages to improve their own nutrition and that of their children/babies. 10,861 women in three maternity hospitals received information and materials ( e.g. , booklets) on breastfeeding and healthy eating for children. 4,722 adolescents (parents/pregnant teens) were trained on healthy eating for themselves and their children.",

We also undertook several initiatives to support the humanitarian crisis triggered by the war by lending its support to two major nongovernmental organizations: UNICEF and the UN Refugee Agency.\n\nAXA/uni00A0SA supported UNICEF/uni00A0 (1) with a \u20ac1.5/uni00A0million donation to help families fleeing Ukraine a/f\\_t er the outbreak of the war. This donation was used, among other things, to build temporary centers for refugees. By December/uni00A02022, 40/uni00A0centers have been deployed in border countries enabling 234,000/uni00A0children and healthcare workers to benefit from basic care, as well as psychological support. An internal fundraising campaign was also carried out, raising \u20ac73,000/uni00A0thanks to the support of AXA Group's employees.\n\nAXA/uni00A0SA has also increased its financial support through a donation of \u20ac1/uni00A0million to the UNHCR to help people inside Ukraine and border countries with their day-to-day needs, as well as protection and shelter initiatives.\n\n## Arts and heritage protection and conservation\n\nAligned with its values of protecting and passing on heritage, AXA/uni00A0SA engages in significant world heritage conservation actions. In recent years AXA/uni00A0SA has supported several projects in France including the following:\n\n- /uni25A0 from 2021 to 2022, AXA/uni00A0SA has supported the renovation and restoration of the Arc de Triomphe;\n- /uni25A0 from 2019 to 2022, we partnered with the Palace of Versailles to help restore and renovate the apartments of Madame du Barry/uni00A0 (2) ;\n- /uni25A0 AXA/uni00A0SA also supports the reconstruction of the cathedral NotreDame de Paris a/f\\_t er its partial destruction as a result of a fire in 2019; and\n- /uni25A0 in 2022, AXA/uni00A0SA became the exclusive sponsor of Institut de recherche et coordination acoustique/musique (IRCAM), the world's largest public research center dedicated to both musical expression and scientific research. AXA/uni00A0SA is committing for the first time to the protection and transmission of intangible and sound heritage.\n\nAXA entities, such as AXA France and AXA Spain, are also involved in philanthropy actions, promoting access to heritage and culture for all. For instance, since 2019, AXA France has been supporting the Patrimony Foundation. As for AXA Spain, its collaboration with the Prado Museum began in 1998, making it the first private entity in Spain to become a benefactor of the Museum.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AXA RESEARCH FUND\n\nThe AXA Research Fund (AXARF or the Fund) is committed to supporting science for societal progress. The Fund supports top-tier research projects on key areas of risks and engages in dissemination e/ff orts based on science to better inform decisionmaking. With a global commitment of \u20ac250/uni00A0million since its launch in 2008, the AXA Research Fund has funded around 689/uni00A0projects to-date that explore solutions to global societal challenges in the areas of climate and environment, health, and socio-economic risk. The selection of research projects is overseen by an independent Scientific Board and based on excellence and innovation.\n\nIn 2022, in the field of e nvironmental risks, the AXA Chair in Plastic waste upcycling by CO2 valorization at the University of Mons (Belgium) was selected to receive a fund of \u20ac1/uni00A0million over five /uni00A0years.\n\nTo further support the c limate priority of the Group's strategic plan 'Driving Progress 2023', as part of the UNESCO Ocean Decade Joint Call for Fellows on Coastal Livelihood endowed with \u20ac1/uni00A0million, the AXA Research Fund selected eight postdoctoral fellowship projects in May/uni00A02022, whose research will address flooding, tsunami risk, sustainable fisheries, and the involvement of local communities in the development of adaptation strategies.\n\nIn November/uni00A02022, following a c all for p rojects on the h ealth i mpacts of c limate c hange, an additional \u20ac1/uni00A0million was granted to eight post-doctoral fellowship projects, who will work on improving assessment and designing new climate adaptation approaches to those risks.\n\nIn the field of biodiversity, the AXA Research Fund launched a partnership with the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) to support climate and biodiversity science in the Global South by financing 12 young researchers on the IPBES 'Nexus Assessment' studying the links between biodiversity, water, food, and health in the context of climate change &/uni00A0biodiversity loss with an endowment of \u20ac252,000.\n\nBy engaging its active community of scientists from varied disciplines and backgrounds, the AXARF carried out visible dissemination initiatives allowing for regular media exposure of supported research. The Fund coordinated a series of webinars, master classes, publications, and articles with partners such as The Conversation. Academic insights and perspectives on critical issues related to extreme weather events, decision-making under uncertainty, macroeconomics, biodiversity, cybersecurity, and domestic violence were shared and debated with an aim to support decision making.

Under this umbrella, employees carry out activities on themes aligned with the two pillars of our sustainability strategy: c limate c hange and i nclusive p rotection. Since 2020, an international sponsorship Committee has been set up to anchor the program even more strongly within the various entities.\n\nIn 2022, AXA Group's employees were involved in a wide variety of activities (4,819 in total) and performed 56,500/uni00A0acts of volunteering (compared to 45,163 in 2021). Through the AXA Hearts in Action program, the Group seeks to promote all forms of employee engagement, particularly skills-based philanthropy. In 2022, AXA France continued to develop the 'AXA Comp\u00e9tences Solidaires ' program: 130/uni00A0employees volunteered in partner associations ( versus 140/uni00A0in 2021).\n\nAXA Group's employees volunteered 317,750/uni00A0hours during and outside of working hours (compared to 268,480/uni00A0hours in 2021), in support of solidarity projects. Most of these volunteer hours\n\nI\n\nI\n\nwere spent during working hours: 161,168 hours for Comp\u00e9tences Solidaires and 92,607 hours for other activities, for a total of 253,775 hours (compared to 209,051 hours in 2021).\n\nIn total, the salaries paid for the hours spent on volunteering missions during working hours represent the equivalent of a donation of \u20ac9.4/uni00A0million ( versus \u20ac7.3/uni00A0million in 2021).\n\nIn addition to this amount, general management expenses incurred to support the AXA Hearts in Action activities in all entities amounted to a total of \u20ac8.8/uni00A0million in 2022 (compared to \u20ac6.3/uni00A0million in 2021). In-kind donations were also provided to non-profits or NGOs for a total estimated amount of \u20ac1.5/uni00A0million in 2022 ( versus \u20ac1.1/uni00A0million in 2021) in addition to the Group's \u20ac43/uni00A0million cash donation including the AXA Research Fund, AXA Hearts in Action and Mutuelles AXA. Among the \u20ac43/uni00A0million of cash donations, 14/uni00A0million come from Mutuelles AXA.\n\nMost of this support is for community investments, representing 84.5% of AXA Group's total citizen investments (volunteer hours, cash donations, in-kind donations); 13% are invested in charitable donations and 2.5% for commercial initiatives (compared to 84%, 14% and 2% respectively in 2021).\n\nFor the past 12/uni00A0years, we have been organizing the AXA Week for Good to highlight the community investment of AXA employees. During the 2022 edition of the AXA Week for Good, 679 activities were coordinated and a total of 15,400/uni00A0volunteers were mobilized across the Group ( versus 459 activities and 11,055 unique volunteers in 2021). The Global Challenge organized by several entities carried out activities with an environmental impact, involving 5,268/uni00A0volunteers ( versus 3,500/uni00A0in 2021) within the Group.",

This commitment is designed to ensure compliance with laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where the Group operates, to earn the continued trust of its clients, shareholders, employees, and business partners, but also frequently extends beyond legal obligations particularly in the Group's priority areas.\n\nThe 2022 sustainability risk assessment presented in Section/uni00A04.1 'AXA Group's sustainability strategy/uni00A0- Sustainability risk assessment' assessed the following business behavior risks: antibribery &/uni00A0fight against corruption, business conduct, responsible data use, data privacy and data security, sustainable procurement, and tax policy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## Business ethics\n\n## COMPLIANCE &/uni00A0ETHICS CODE\n\nAXA Group Compliance &/uni00A0Ethics Code seeks to establish Groupwide rules and guidelines to ensure that AXA Group companies and employees have a common understanding of the compliance and ethical standards the Group requires. The Code covers a variety of matters, including specific rules concerning conflicts of interest, anti-bribery and corruption, insider trading, management of confidential information,/uni00A0etc. The Code is available on the Group's website/uni00A0 (1) . In 2019, the Group launched an updated version of AXA Group Compliance &/uni00A0Ethics Code. The updated Code includes subjects that have become increasingly important in recent years: Health &/uni00A0Safety at work, Protection and Responsible use of Customer Data, Engagement with Social Media, Prevention of Discrimination and Harassment, and Fair and Professional Treatment of customers. The content and style of the Code have also been revised to make it more accessible.\n\n## ANTI-BRIBERY &/uni00A0FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION\n\nIn order to tackle the risk of bribery and corruption, AXA Group has introduced a Group Anti-Bribery &/uni00A0Corruption Policy (ABC Policy) that establishes the minimum standards for anti-bribery &/uni00A0corruption that must be implemented by AXA entities. This policy has been regularly updated to take account of new regulations\n\nThe policies presented below cover these business behavior risks. Associated indicators are explained in the following paragraphs.\n\nand notably the French law known as 'Sapin/uni00A0II' n\u00b02016-1691 of December/uni00A09, 2016, on transparency and the fight against corruption and the modernization of the economy. A/uni00A0Group/uni00A0Anti-Bribery o/ff icer oversees the global ABC program at Group level and monitors its implementation in all the entities. AXA entities have designated local Anti-Bribery o/ff icers to implement their local programs in accordance with Group's ABC standards.\n\nAXA Group Standards certification by entities' CEOs includes an 'anti-bribery and fight against corruption' Section. Our objective is to achieve a consistent anti-bribery and anti-corruption program across the Group's entities, which includes the necessary requirements that comply with International Standards (including Sapin/uni00A0II Law) and prevent corruption risks.\n\nAs a result, each year since 2018, 100% of CEOs within the scope of AXA Group Standards certification process have certified their level of compliance with the anti-bribery &/uni00A0corruption section (in line with the 100% target).\n\n## BUSINESS CONDUCT\n\nAs mentioned above, business conduct was assessed in the 2022 sustainability risk assessment, and more specifically the risk of miss-selling or non-transparent selling practices, mismanagement of claims, resulting in a low protection of customers in their interactions with AXA Group and life of their contract, and resulting in a loss of trust.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

AXA Group has taken actions to comply with these requirements in each of its businesses where such measures are in place and to globally spread and implement a customer protection culture across the Group. In addition, the Group demonstrates a strong commitment in its Compliance and Ethics Code, which applies to all employees and subsidiaries worldwide, to treat its customers fairly and professionally, by being honest and accountable when promoting products and services.\n\nSince 2021, a set of recommendations on key customer protection topics have been shared with the objective of reinforcing uniformity of practices within the Group and, at the same time, continuously improving customer consideration wherever they may be. Key customer protection issues include vulnerable customers, customer information, digitalization, and complaints handling. These recommendations guide each entity in implementing responsible practices based on transparency, honesty, and fairness for the customer.\n\nA compliance program of customer protection reviews has been reinforced since 2019. It consists of reviewing how local entities manage customer protection topics and the processes in place, especially regarding customer information, sales practices, or salesforce training. In 2022, five entities had a customer protection compliance review on their business practices. These reviews,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\ncurrently focused on most of the European entities, will be progressively extended to non-European entities on a risk-based approach.\n\nCompliance risks, including business conduct, are also assessed on an annual basis. The results and any necessary mitigation actions are shared with senior management. Internal verification processes have been implemented to monitor the e/ff ectiveness of such controls and cover entities' own operations and those of proprietary sales channels.\n\nAnother key initiative in managing business conduct is the product governance process (Product Approval Process, 'PAP') which oversees the design, approval, and review of new or significantly modified products. The PAP is applicable to all entities of AXA Group with underwriting activities and focuses notably on the customer dimension, ensuring the product is built starting from the customers' needs and expectations, with a definition of the target market and a selection of adequate distribution channels. This process also aims at ensuring that all new products entering the scope of application (all entities with underwriting activities) of the PAP respect the principles of 'value for customer'. It includes notably a mandatory compliance checklist.\n\nEvery year since 2018, 100% of CEOs have certified on the compliance level of the Group entities in scope of the AXA Standards certification process (in line with the 100% target), which engaged them to conduct a PAP and all Life &/uni00A0Savings, Health and Property &/uni00A0Casualty products have been subject to the AXA's Product Approval Process.\n\n## Responsible data use, data privacy and data security\n\nAs mentioned above, responsible data use, data privacy and data security were part of the 2022 sustainability risk assessment and more specifically:\n\n- /uni25A0 data protection: risk of not being compliant with data protection legislation; and\n- /uni25A0 data security: risk of data breach or cyber-attack, given the sensitivity and volume of data managed by the Group and the consequences for stakeholders' privacy rights.\n\nTo address the risks identified above, the Group has implemented various initiatives to promote the use of data to address societal challenges and to ensure the protection of customer data through a strong security strategy as well as a responsible usage of artificial intelligence.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## DATA PRIVACY\n\nAXA Group was the first insurance group to adopt privacy-related Binding Corporate Rules, approved by European data protection authorities and constituting an internationally approved data privacy contractual framework for customer, employee, and other stakeholder personal data processing. Entities that are applying Binding Corporate Rules represent 99% of the Group's revenues in 2022 (also 99% in 2021 and 2020) in line with the 99% target. These rules and the Group's Data Privacy Declaration, whereby the Group undertakes not to sell the personal data of its customers, are available on AXA website/uni00A0 (4) .",

        "page_content": "The Group implemented the General Data Protection Regulation and is also implementing similar regulations recently adopted in countries outside the European Union.\n\nIn 2022, out of 95/uni00A0million customers, the Group received 471 customer's complaints on Data Privacy, equivalent to 0.0005% customers ( versus 1,127 complaints in 2021, equivalent to 0.0012% of customers and 1,112/uni00A0complaints in 2020, equivalent to 0.0011% of customers). This ratio is under the target of 0.0100% (which means less than 9,500/uni00A0complaints for 95,000,000/uni00A0clients).\n\n## A SECURITY STRATEGY DESIGNED TO GUARANTEE THE PROTECTION OF DATA\n\nWith the massive digitization of society, cyber risk is considered today one of the top operational risks that citizens and companies must face.\n\nTo respond to this threat, and as a responsible insurer, AXA Group has developed a risk-based security strategy that strengthens its business resilience, transforming security from a necessity to an advantage for its entities. Security is managed holistically by the corporate function, Group Security. It gathers the four /uni00A0security key disciplines: Information Security/Cyber Security, Operational Resilience, Physical Security and Health &/uni00A0Safety.\n\nAXA Group has implemented its new security strategy, aiming at strengthening security maturity within AXA's entities, while maintaining the most mature ones within the first quartile of the most secure companies in the financial industry. The maturity level of these entities is assessed, based notably on the ISO/uni00A027001 norms. In 2022, the Group successfully achieved a maturity score of 3.30/uni00A0out of 5, with an increase of 0.18 over the previous year's results (for a scope representing the Group's 20/uni00A0most mature entities), contributing to the goal of remaining among the safest organizations in our sector. This security strategy, called 'One Security' strategy, uses a risk-based approach that ensures that we continuously consider and adapt to the evolution of risks and threats.\n\nThis robust level of security is also ensured by the commitment of the Group's employees, who are the first line of defense against cyberattacks. Yearly training on the topic of security (including physical security, health &/uni00A0safety, operational resilience &/uni00A0 information security), data protection and cybersecurity are deployed across the Group. In 2022, 100% of salaried employees have been trained and certified.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, an additional focus was raised in respect of the protection of the Group's data against the cyber threat called 'ransomware'. The 'One Security' strategic program led the definition of a set of instructions towards Group's entities and initiated the strengthening of AXA's capabilities in terms of attack containment, threat eradication and recovery of IT Operations.\n\n## RESPONSIBLE USAGE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\n\nIn 2021, AXA Group launched a Responsible Artificial Intelligence Circle/uni00A0- a light and agile, multi-stakeholder governance body that aims to foster and govern the adoption of trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the Group. This Circle brings together relevant stakeholders from various departments involved in the ownership, development, and governance of AI systems at AXA Group. They collaborate to build operational tools and internal guidance on responsible AI in line with the Group's Responsible AI principles and the latest regulatory framework.\n\nAXA Group has also been working closely with regulators ( e.g., EIOPA Digital Ethics Committee, and MAS Veritas initiative) and leading research centers (such as Sorbonne University and Stanford University) to design state-of-the-art solutions, that respect ethical principles, and can be used for e/ff ective AI governance in the insurance industry. This cooperation is central to building and implementing new internal and operational guidelines covering the sustainable and responsible use of AI within the Group.\n\nWithin the French association Impact AI, AXA Group, along with other members (industrial partners, consulting, and tech companies) is leading the Impact AI's Responsible AI Committee tasked with analyzing the perception of AI and the development of a 'trustworthy AI', producing several white papers on this topic.\n\nIn addition, the Group leads both fundamental and applied research in the area of Responsible AI practices. Researchers investigate technical solutions, applicable across different segments of the insurance value chain, to mitigate risks related to AI applications' fairness, explainability, robustness and safety. These e/ff orts support the Group's business transformation in developing and adopting AI solutions in line with the Group direction on the responsible use of data & AI.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4",

A study was carried out in 2022, with the help of an independent firm which used a three-step methodology:\n\n- /uni25A0 first, relevant rights to be assessed (based on overarching Charters, labor rights core conventions and specific conventions/uni00A0 (2) ) were prioritized.

The purpose of the campaign was to strengthen, increase consistency and simplify the process across the Group.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

Awareness sessions were held in order to remind entities of requirements related to the duty of care (devoir de vigilance), and the applicable penalties in the event of non-compliance with legal obligations. Correspondents of the Procurement network attended these sessions in 2022.\n\nIn addition, the AXA Group relies on a reporting process for Group entities which is based on pre-existing procedures and monitoring tools and, in particular, on an internal review conducted by the Sustainability central team. Each year, the principal operating entities are asked to conduct an internal risk assessment to identify any gaps with the vigilance plan.\n\nFollowing the assessment conducted in 2022, gaps were identified, and the relevant entities shall implement improvement action plans, including the following:\n\n- /uni25A0 the systematic inclusion of the sustainability clause as reviewed by the Group  in procurement contracts;\n- /uni25A0 the strengthening of supplier monitoring in high ESG risk categories through EcoVadis;\n- /uni25A0 the raising of human rights awareness among employees, such as the inclusion of people with temporary or permanent disabilities; and\n- /uni25A0 the adjustment of local alert procedures to cover matters related to human rights and the environment.\n\n## SUSTAINABLE PROCUREMENT BUSINESS\n\nIntegrating Group Sustainability strategy and commitments into its management of suppliers is an on-going activity for AXA Group. This alignment means that AXA Group integrates sustainability considerations to select and monitor its suppliers. This approach is articulated around two axes:\n\n- /uni25A0 Responsible people &/uni00A0processes: the AXA Group personnel working in a procurement department must sign the Group's Code of Professional Conduct but also a dedicated and reinforced Code of Ethics, which promotes fairness and neutrality, confidentiality, and transparency of sourcing decisions. The personnel is also trained to the AXA Group's Sustainability strategy and its Sustainable Procurement policy through awareness sessions given by the network of Sustainable Procurement personnel identified in our various entities.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## /uni25A0 Responsible vendors:\n\n- \u00b7 An ESG criteria grid has been shared since 2021 across the Procurement teams and integrated into the Group's calls for tenders. Criteria may vary depending on purchases categories. As an example, they may involve the EcoVadis rating, the carbon emissions of suppliers' products and services, or their responsible procurement policy.\n- \u00b7 The AXA Group requires its vendors to include a 'Sustainability clause' in their contracts. It includes, complying with the principles of the ILO (prohibiting the use of child/forced labour, promoting employee health &/uni00A0safety and freedom of expression, and non-discrimination). 96.20% of the procurement contracts entered or renewed in 2022/uni00A0included this sustainability clause ( versus 96.81% in 2021).\n- \u00b7 The AXA Group implemented an assessment of the extrafinancial risks of its suppliers, identified thanks to an internal Risk Matrix by procurement category (please refer to Section/uni00A0'Vigilance Plan/uni00A0- Identification and Evaluation of Risks to Human Rights and the Environment/uni00A0- Environment/uni00A0As a Responsible Business Partner' above). 72.55% of the vendors evaluated in 2022/uni00A0shared a Bronze or higher EcoVadis scoring ( versus 72.5% in 2021).\n- \u00b7 The Group is striving to implement best practices to meet its objective of reducing carbon emissions by 20% by 2025. The/uni00A0AXA Group has therefore implemented locally new sustainable ways of buying, e.g., greening of car fleets, purchases of green energy in o/ff ices and data centers, deployment of new measures for IT purchases ( e.g. , by asking key IT providers to provide the carbon footprint related to the Group's purchases of their services and products ). All these best practices applied locally are shared by the Sustainable Procurement community in order to promote a wider deployment.\n\nSince 2018, the/uni00A0AXA Group uses a dedicated Vendor Risk program to reinforce its operational control and Risk Management of third parties. Please refer to Section/uni00A05.7/uni00A0'Operational Risk' of this Annual Report for further information on this program.\n\nThe AXA Group is evaluated every year by S&P Corporate Sustainability Assessment score (CSA score used to define the Dow Jones Sustainability Index). Please refer to Section/uni00A01.1 'Socially Responsible Investments (SRI) ratings' for further details about ratings. Furthermore, the AXA Group received a 'Platinum' score in its latest EcoVadis evaluation.",

It is the framework used to compare AXA to other companies of the financial and insurance sector (AXA Tier/uni00A01 entities are all part of the first quartile of the most secured companies of the sector).\n\nPercentage of employees trained and certified (security, data protection and cybersecurity training): share of salaried and non-salaried employees trained and certified during the year on the topic of security (including physical security, health &/uni00A0safety, operational resilience &/uni00A0information security), data protection and cybersecurity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nI\n\n## Reporting methodology\n\nAn assessment of the employer responsibility, environmental, societal, business behavior and human rights impacts of the Group's activities has enabled the appropriate performance indicators to be defined in accordance with the requirements of the French Commercial Code.\n\n## SCOPE OF SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND/uni00A0SOCIETAL REPORTING\n\nFor the perimeters defined below, indicators are fully consolidated, unless otherwise indicated:\n\n## Scope of social indicators\n\nThe social data provided in Section/uni00A04.2/uni00A0'Employer Responsibility' of this Annual Report are collected from 259/uni00A0active entities of the AXA Group, in which AXA holds, directly or indirectly, management control, as of December/uni00A031, 2022, included in the consolidation scope of AXA.\n\n## Scope of environmental indicators\n\nEnvironmental reporting's scope is based on the same scope as Social reporting but AXA Group's sites with less than 50/uni00A0Full\n\n## SUSTAINABILITY\n\nPercentage of the Group Tax footprint covered in the Tax transparency report published during the year (relating to N-1): share of the Group Tax footprint covered in the Tax transparency report published in 2022 (relating to 2021). This Tax footprint corresponds to the detail of the various taxes paid (direct and indirect) by geography where the AXA Group operates.\n\nPercentage of procurement contracts entered or renewed with the sustainability clause: share of procurement contracts entered or renewed with the mandatory sustainability clause which includes, in particular, complying with the principles of the ILO (prohibiting the use of child/forced labor, promoting employee health &/uni00A0safety and freedom of expression, and nondiscrimination).\n\nTime Employees (FTEs) are not included in the data collection process. These sites are part of an extrapolation process. In 2022, environmental indicators were collected for 92,695/uni00A0FTEs working on AXA Group's sites (unless otherwise indicated) and were then extrapolated, continent by continent, to cover all 115,842/uni00A0FTEs (all types of contracts/uni00A0- average annual personnel) working at AXA Group in 2022 according to the social reporting.\n\n## Scope of societal indicators\n\nIn 2022, AXA's entities contributing to the Community Investment Survey, as described in Section/uni00A04.4/uni00A0'Inclusive insurer' of this Annual Report, represent 101,425 FTEs working on AXA sites, meaning a coverage rate of 99%.\n\n## PERIOD\n\nThe indicators cover the period from January/uni00A01, 2022 to December/uni00A031,/uni00A02022, unless mentioned otherwise. To facilitate collection and processing, some data may be collected early in the/uni00A0year. The data for any remaining/uni00A0months (maximum 6/uni00A0 months) is then estimated in accordance with the Group's defined methodology.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4",

This process is updated and communicated to each entity on a/uni00A0yearly basis. Social data are provided by local correspondents into an IT tool dedicated to the social data reporting process. Consistency checks and quality controls are carried out before and during the data collection process, as well as evaluations by an independent third party on some legal entities and the overall process. A validation process of this reporting is also performed locally. There is no estimation or extrapolation made on data provided. Regarding data published in ratios and percentages, numerator and denominator are realigned for each calculation to exclude entities with empty data points.\n\n## Environmental data reporting\n\nEnvironmental data has been collected since 2002, through a dedicated reporting tool filled out by the network of more than 356/uni00A0environmental managers from AXA Group's sites with more than 50/uni00A0FTEs and data centers owned by AXA. The reporting procedure includes guidelines for reporting and controlling, and calculation rules. AXA Group monitors its environmental footprint reduction towards its targets. The reporting procedure is updated annually, and contributors are trained each/uni00A0year. For each site, contributors specify whether the data has been measured or estimated based on the calculation rules defined in the Group's reporting procedures. In 2022, environmental data was collected for 80% of total FTEs, and the remaining 20% has been extrapolated. Reported data is validated locally by the entity CFOs. For more information, please refer to Section/uni00A04.3/uni00A0'Climate change and biodiversity' of this Annual Report and to the footnotes of environmental data tables.\n\n## Societal data collection\n\nSocietal  engagement  data  which  is  presented  in Section/uni00A04.4/uni00A0'Inclusive insurer/uni00A0- Corporate philanthropy and engagement' of this Annual Report is collected through a dedicated reporting tool with specific definitions for engagement practices. The number of unique volunteers is an estimate based on local entity knowledge of volunteering activities.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## LIMITATIONS\n\nReporting on certain indicators may have limitations due to circumstances sometimes outside of our control such as:\n\n- /uni25A0 the absence of nationally and/or internationally recognized definitions, concerning the di/ff erent categories of employment contracts;\n- /uni25A0 headcount accounting may di/ff er from one entity to another depending on local management rules and the availability of data (particularly with regard to long-term absences);\n- /uni25A0 the necessary estimates, the representativeness of the measurements made, or the limited availability of external data required for calculations as the required annual update of emission factors;\n- /uni25A0 the practical procedures for collecting and entering this information;\n- /uni25A0 lack of standardization of methodologies, resulting in incomparable data year-on-year ( e.g., Warming Potential, CVaR); and\n- /uni25A0 delays from third-party data providers, notably in respect of information relating to the carbon footprint of investee companies in the context of measuring our scope/uni00A03 emissions.\n\nTherefore, whenever possible, definitions, methodologies and, where applicable, the associated margins of uncertainty are specified for the concerned indicators.\n\nThe sustainability themes 'circular economy', 'food waste', 'waste prevention and management', 'fight against food insecurity', 'respect of animals' well-being', 'fair and sustainable food supply', 'use of soils', 'consumption of raw materials' and 'promoting the practice of physical activities and sports for people with disabilities' are not considered as main sustainability risks for AXA and are not included in AXA's extra-financial performance statement.\n\n## USE OF INTERNATIONAL BENCHMARKS\n\nTo develop its sustainability strategy and extra-financial performance statement, AXA voluntarily uses certain international benchmarks, as described in this chapter. These include, for example, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (as developed  in Section 4.1 'AXA Group's sustainability strategy' ), the Greenhouse Gas Protocol ( calculation of CO2/uni00A0emissions, and the Science Based Target Initiative ( its carbon footprint. Other benchmarks are highlighted in the relevant sections, where appropriate. https://ghgprotocol.org) for the https://sciencebasedtargets.org) for the reduction of",

Any of these risks could materially affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations, cause the trading price of our ordinary shares to decline materially or our actual results to di/ff er materially from those expected or those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.\n\nThis section presents the significant risks specific to the Group to which we believe it is exposed as of the filing date of this Annual Report with the AMF. The risks described below are not the only risks the Group faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, not specific to the Group or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely a/ff  ect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. These include but are not limited to the consequences of the ongoing war in Ukraine (together with its geopolitical and economic e/ff ects), which adversely impacted the Group during 2022 and may result in adverse impacts in future periods. These risks are presented herein based on currently available information and are subject to a constantly evolving context. Finally, we may change our perception of the impact of one or more risks on the Group at any time, particularly in the event of one or more new internal and/or external developments.\n\nThe Company's Risk Management processes, procedures and controls are described in Section/uni00A05.2 'Internal control and Risk Management' of this Annual Report, which should be read in conjunction with this Section/uni00A05.1. While Management devotes very substantial resources to Risk Management on an ongoing\n\nI\n\nI\n\nbasis, the Group's Risk Management activities, like all control systems, are subject to inherent limitations and cannot provide absolute assurance or render the Group immune in any respect from the risks described in this Part  5  or the losses that may be incurred in connection with these risks.\n\nWhere the risks described in this Section/uni00A05.1 have given rise to quantifiable and material financial impacts and/or material contingent liabilities, those financial impacts and/or contingent liabilities are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements, in accordance with applicable accounting principles. You should also refer to Section/uni00A05.3 et seq . of this Annual Report for quantitative information on the material risks to which the Group is exposed. For the avoidance of doubt, references to 'insurance', 'reinsurance', 'Property &/uni00A0Casualty' and 'Life &/uni00A0Savings' in this Section/uni00A0also refer to 'Health' activities, as appropriate.\n\nIn presenting the risks set forth in this Section  5.1 , Management has identified the primary categories of risk and the most material risks in a manner that corresponds to M anagement's current view as to the materiality of such risk factors for the AXA Group, based on the perceived likelihood of the occurrence of such risks and the expected magnitude of their negative impact. As more fully described below, such categories include marketrelated risks, credit- and liquidity-related risks, insurance and reinsurance pricing and underwriting-related risks, operational risks, regulatory-related risks, and risks related to the ownership of the Company's shares. Further, there can be no assurance that M anagement's assessment of the relative importance of such risk factors may not change over time, whether to reflect new information, events, circumstances or otherwise.",

For additional information on the sensitivity of our Solvency/uni00A0II ratio to capital market conditions, please refer to the AXA Group's SFCR, available on AXA's website (www.axa.com)/uni00A0 (1) .\n\nFinancial markets have been significantly impacted by the war in Ukraine in 2022 and its e/ff ects on the supply of energy and other critical commodities, the resulting sanctions imposed on Russia by the international community, trade restrictions, disruptions to global supply chains and elevated energy and raw material prices. The impact on Europe has been particularly severe, given Europe's dependence on Russian energy commodities. The protraction, and potential further escalation (including involvement of other countries), of the conflict, combined with OPEC member countries' inability and unwillingness to increase production, could add further pressure to the current inflationary trend or result in elevated and extended periods of instability in financial markets, which may have a material adverse e/ff ect on the results and operations and the financial condition of the Group. Central banks have already had to react forcefully to the inflation shock by increasing interest rates and introducing other counter-inflationary measures. As of early 2023, it seems likely that even more central bank policy action will be needed throughout the year to manage inflation, as (i) /uni00A0 labor markets everywhere in the developed world remain tight (shortages of labor), which triggers significant labor cost increases, and (ii) /uni00A0in some regions, Europe in particular, underlying inflation has not started to moderate, despite some cooling (though still elevated by historical standards) energy prices. This may wrong-foot financial markets, which have been expecting a fairly swi/f\\_t     pivot by central banks in 2023 (for example, interest rate cuts as soon as the second half of 2023). While the economy has been resilient so far, an extended period of elevated interest rates, further interest rate increases or additional monetary tightening may trigger a significant slowdown in aggregate demand for finished goods and services, to the point that the prospect of a recession in the United States or in Europe cannot be excluded.\n\n5.1/uni00A0RISK FACTORS\n\nThe war in Ukraine compounded the market volatility resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in 2020/uni00A0and resulted in market volatility through 2021 and 2022, as well as governmental measures to contain the pandemic and address the related health crisis. Even if the picture has improved globally, AXA continues to closely monitor the Group's exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic and its wide-ranging consequences. The process of emerging from restrictive COVID-19 policies by major economic actors has had significant consequences on inflation at the global level, which had already been fueled by fiscal stimulus to combat the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including resulting supply chain challenges and readjustments.\n\nA wide variety of other factors have adversely a/ff ected, and could negatively impact in the future, economic growth prospects and contribute to high levels of volatility in financial markets. These factors include, among others, concerns over a persistent slowdown or reversal in economic growth and levels of consumer confidence generally; current market conditions, including asset valuations and volatility, that may lead to an abrupt and significant repricing in financial markets; the strengthening or weakening of foreign currencies against the Euro (in particular the US Dollar, which was especially strong throughout much of 2022); the availability and cost of credit; the stability and solvency of certain financial institutions and other companies, including related systemic credit risk concerns; continuing concerns over certain sovereign debt issuers; inflation or deflation in certain markets; central bank intervention in the financial markets, through interest rate adjustments, the winding-down or cessation of quantitative easing or similar programs; disruptions in the global supply chain and elevated energy and raw material prices; changes in reference rates, including the phasing out of the London Interbank O/ff ered Rate (LIBOR) and reforms to and potential changes a/ff ecting EURIBOR and other indices; volatile energy costs; adverse geopolitical events (including acts of terrorism or military conflicts) and rising geopolitical tensions in various regions and countries (such as Russia, Ukraine, China, Iran, Turkey, Latin America, Libya, Syria, Iraq, North Korea or Afghanistan); the protraction or escalation of existing military conflicts; the imposition, or significant enhancement, of international sanctions against certain countries (in particular, Russia) and connected entities; the continuation or escalation of trade-related disputes between China and the United States and European Union , related disruption to global supply and value chains, the prospect, and potential impact, of any 'decoupling' of China from the global economy, and China-related geopolitical tensions; and any other new or rising trade tensions, 'trade wars', and other governmental measures, either enacted\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

In addition, specific concerns regarding the Eurozone, including the financial condition of certain EU sovereign debt issuers, uncertainty regarding membership in the European Union, relationships between European institutions and certain EU Member States, potential structural reforms or other changes made to the Euro, the Eurozone or the European Union, have resulted in significant disruptions in financial markets in recent years and could have similar e/ff ects in the future. Moreover, the United Kingdom has experienced a number of fiscal and political challenges recently, including a turbulent period in September/uni00A02022 during which UK bond prices temporarily collapsed and the pound sterling fell to a record low against the US Dollar, testing the liquidity of UK pension funds. There can be no assurance that European or UK fiscal or political instability will not have an adverse e/ff ect on the Group's business and financial condition.\n\nThese factors and others have had and will likely continue to have an adverse e/ff ect on our revenues and results of operations, in part because we have a large investment portfolio. Our investment income is an important part of our profitability, and our sales of insurance and Asset Management products (as well as the level of product surrenders and lapses) are dependent upon financial markets performance, customer behavior and confidence as well as other related factors. Our ability to make a profit on insurance and investment products, for example, depends in part on the returns on investments supporting our obligations under those products, and the value of specific investments may fluctuate substantially depending on the foregoing conditions. In addition, certain types of insurance and investment products that we o/ff er expose us to risks associated with fluctuations in financial markets, including certain types of interest-sensitive or variable products such as guaranteed annuities or variable annuities, which have crediting or other guaranteed rates or guaranteed minimum benefits not necessarily related to prevailing market interest rates or investment returns on underlying assets. Although we use hedging techniques to help mitigate our exposure under certain of these guarantees, not all risks can be e/ff ectively hedged against and volatility in the financial markets, combined with unanticipated policyholder behavior and uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and consequences of the ongoing war in Ukraine, as well as inflation and/or possible recession, may increase our cost of risk and/or negatively a/ff ect our ability to hedge against certain of these risks, which may in turn adversely a/ff ect our profitability.\n\nMore generally, to the extent the economic environment in the jurisdictions in which we do business may become\n\nI\n\nI\n\ncharacterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending (due to factors including but not limited to inflation or recession), the demand for our financial and insurance products could be adversely a/ff ected. In addition, in such circumstances, we may experience an elevated incidence of lapses or surrenders on certain types of policies or funds, and our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether. While Management has put in place measures to respond to inflation that include (among other things) prudent monitoring of Group insurance reserves to address inflation-related risks, as  an insurance undertaking, the Group is exposed to inflation risk. Inflation increased considerably in 2022 and is expected to remain at elevated levels in 2023, which has impacted and may continue to impact our businesses, in particular our Property &/uni00A0Casualty business, including due to the increasing cost of new and replacement parts and materials, our claims experience, reserves and our profitability (based on the lag in repricing) and both our Property &/uni00A0Casualty and Life &/uni00A0Savings businesses due to annuities, some of which are indexed to inflation (for example in the context of Workers' Compensation and Motor business). In addition, governments, supervisors, regulators, and courts may adopt policyholder-favorable stances to ensure the a/ff ordability of coverage for policyholders, which may negatively impact our financial condition. The probability and magnitude of these risks increased due to recessionary trends in  global economic activity. These developments could accordingly have a material adverse e/ff  ect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Changes in interest rates and credit spreads may adversely a/ff  ect our business, results of operations, solvency, and financial condition\n\nOur exposure to interest-rate risk relates primarily to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may negatively a/ff ect the value of our assets (particularly fixed-income investments) and our ability to realize gains or avoid losses from the sale of those assets, all of which also ultimately a/ff ect earnings.\n\nDuring periods of increasing interest rates, such as 2022, the estimated fair value of certain of our fixed-income investments may  decrease,  which  could  negatively  impact  our  net income and Solvency/uni00A0II ratio. Furthermore, surrenders of l ife insurance policies and fixed annuity contracts may accelerate as policyholders seek higher returns, which may cause us to accelerate amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs or to",

Similarly, our fee income may decrease due to a decline in the value of our asset managers' fixed-income assets under management and Unit-Linked reserves, which could result in lower management fees and have an adverse impact on Asset Management net inflows. In addition, we may be required, as an issuer of securities, to pay higher interest rates on debt securities, debt, and bank facilities, and we may face an increase in the cost of our repurchase agreements and the cost of derivative hedging transactions, which may increase our interest expenses.\n\nConversely, negative interest rates and low levels of interest rates generally, such as those experienced in recent prior years, have impacted in the past, and may negatively impact again, our net investment income and the profitability of our Life &/uni00A0Savings business. In-force l ife insurance and annuity products may become comparatively more attractive to customers in a declining interest-rate environment, resulting in an increase in our liabilities (in particular in relation to flexible-premium products), asset-liability duration mismatches (as more policies and contracts remain in-force from year-to-year) and an increase in provisions for guarantees included in l ife insurance and annuity products.\n\nAccordingly, during a period of declining interest rates or a prolonged period of low interest rates, our profitability may su/ff er as the result of a decrease in the spread between interest rates credited to insurance policyholders and annuity contract owners, and the rates  we are able to earn on our fixed-income investment portfolio. In addition, certain regulatory capital and reserve requirements are based on formulas and models that consider interest rates, such as the Group's Internal Model, and an extended period of low interest rates may increase the regulatory capital we are required to hold and the amount of assets we must maintain to support our reserves, while decreasing the amount of our Eligible Own Funds (EOF), which could have an adverse impact on our Solvency/uni00A0II ratio. For a description of the sensitivity of our EOF to changes in interest rates, please refer to Section 6.6 -/uni00A0Note/uni00A04.2/uni00A0 'Market risks (including sensitivity analysis)' of this Annual Report.\n\nOur exposure to changes in credit spreads primarily relates to the impact of such changes on market prices and cash flow variability. A widening of credit spreads will generally reduce the value of the fixed-income securities we hold (including credit derivatives where we assume credit exposure) and increase our investment income associated with purchases of new fixed-income securities in our investment portfolios; and, as an issuer of fixed-income securities, we may face increased interest expenses. Conversely, credit spread tightening will generally increase the value of fixed-income securities we hold and reduce\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1/uni00A0RISK FACTORS\n\nour investment income associated with new purchases of fixedincome securities in our investment portfolios.\n\nFor additional information on the sensitivity of our Solvency/uni00A0II ratio to financial shocks on interest rates and corporate bond spreads, please refer to the AXA Group's SFCR, available on AXA's website (www.axa.com)/uni00A0 (1) .\n\nAlthough we take measures, including hedging through derivative instruments, to manage the economic risks of investing in a changing interest-rate environment, we may not be able to mitigate the interest rate risk of our assets relative to our liabilities. Accordingly, ongoing volatility in interest rates and credit spreads, individually or in tandem with other factors, could have a material adverse e/ff ect on our solvency position, and on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows through realized losses, impairments, and changes in unrealized gains and loss positions.\n\n## Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly a/ff  ect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and solvency\n\nDue to the geographical diversity of our business and notably the fact that significant subsidiaries of the Group are located in the United States, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Japan, and Hong Kong, we are exposed to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations since a significant portion of our shareholdings and investments, revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than Euro, while our Consolidated Financial Statements are established in Euro. Likewise, the part of our debt and other obligations (including certain reinsurance treaties and retrocession agreements to which we are a party) denominated in currencies other than Euro is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nEquity of Group entities is expressed primarily in Euro, US Dollar, British Pound Sterling, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, and Hong Kong Dollar. Fluctuations in the exchange rates used to convert foreign currencies into Euro, and in particular, fluctuations in the/uni00A0US Dollar against the Euro, have had, and may have in the future, a negative impact on the S hareholders' equity Group share and Underlying earnings Group share. We have not implemented a policy of fully hedging the changes in the value of the equity of our subsidiaries with equity denominated in foreign currencies. For more information about the impact of the fluctuations in the exchange rates of US Dollar, British Pound Sterling, Swiss Franc, Japanese Yen, and Hong Kong Dollar into Euro, please refer to Section/uni00A0 5.3/uni00A0 'Market r isks' of this Annual Report.\n\nSimilarly, fluctuations in exchange rates may have an impact on the Group's net income as a result of the translation of foreign currency transactions, the settlement of foreign currency\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

For more information about the main hedging positions of AXA/uni00A0SA with respect to foreign currencies, please refer to Section/uni00A0 5.3/uni00A0 'Market r isks' of this Annual Report.\n\nWhile we seek to manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations through hedging, fluctuations in exchange rates may have a significant impact on our Euro-denominated results of operations, cash flows, gearing ratio, shareholders' equity, and solvency. In addition, the currency hedges we use to manage foreign exchange rate risk may in themselves impact our cash and liquidity position.\n\n## Inflation or deflation in our principal markets would have multiple impacts on the Group and may negatively a/ff  ect our business, solvency position and results of operations\n\nWe are exposed to inflation risk in certain of our principal markets, especially in Europe and the United States, (i) /uni00A0through our holdings of fixed interest rate and other instruments, and (ii) /uni00A0as a result of the potential for claim payments and expenses to rise faster than anticipated in our reserving and pricing assumptions.\n\nThe Group's assets are exposed to increases in inflation and/ or  inflation forecasts, which could result in increases in interest rates (as has happened in recent periods as a result of market anticipation as well as actions by central banks to rein in rapidly increasing inflation) and lead to a decrease in the market value of bonds held in our investment portfolio. Increases in inflation could also have an impact on the creditworthiness of bond issuers and could result in an increase in credit spreads (please refer to the paragraph above 'Changes in interest rates and credit spreads may adversely a/ff ect our business, results of operations, solvency, and financial condition'). All of these factors could lead to a decline in the value of the bonds we hold, which could have an adverse e/ff ect on the profitability of our investment portfolio and on our revenues. Depending on the relevant macroeconomic context, increases in inflation could also have a negative impact on risk premiums and share prices, which could result in a decline in the market value of the Group's equity portfolio.\n\nInflation in the costs of claims, labor costs, cost of energy and raw materials, medical costs, new/replacement parts and materials, construction costs and tort issues and/or inflation due in particular to disruptions in the global supply chain impact the Property &/uni00A0Casualty industry. The impact of inflation on claim\n\nI\n\nI\n\ncosts could be more pronounced for certain of our claims that are indexed to inflation and those Property &/uni00A0Casualty lines of business that are considered 'long- tail', such as general Liability, Workers' Compensation and professional Liability, and other specialty lines of our AXA XL business, as they require a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims for a given accident year. In addition, lags in re-pricing in our Property &/uni00A0Casualty business, when combined with inflation, could reduce our profitability. Inflation driven in the short term by supply chain disruptions and shortages a/ff ecting raw materials and goods may negatively impact the results of our operations, especially for our short-tail lines of business. Changes in the level of inflation could also result in an increased level of uncertainty in our estimation of claims reserves, particularly for long- tail lines of business, which could have a significant adverse e/ff ect on our solvency, results, financial position, or cash flows.\n\nA significant decline in the market value of the Group's asset portfolio and an increase in the costs of claims could also lead to a decrease in the Group's shareholders' equity.\n\nWhile inflation increased considerably in 2022 and is expected to remain at elevated levels in 2023, in particular in the United States and to a lesser extent in Europe, we are also exposed to deflation risk, which materialized in the Eurozone in recent years. Deflation may erode collateral values and diminish the quality of certain investment assets and may negatively impact customer behavior or otherwise negatively a/ff ect our business and results of operations.\n\n## Adverse business and market conditions, as well as accounting rules, may impact the recoverability of goodwill, amortization of intangibles and/or reduce deferred tax assets and deferred policyholders' participation assets, which could materially a/ff ect our results of operations and/uni00A0financial position\n\nBusiness and market conditions as well as accounting rules may impact the amount of goodwill we carry in our consolidated balance sheet, the pattern of amortization of intangible assets and the value of our deferred tax assets and deferred participation assets. The value of certain of our businesses is significantly impacted by such factors as the state of the financial markets, particularly equity markets, and ongoing operating performance.",

During periods of market disruption, a larger portion of our investment assets may be valued using these models and methodologies as a result of less frequent trading or less observable market data with respect to certain asset classes that were previously actively traded in liquid markets. There can be no assurance that our valuations on the basis of these models and methodologies represent, for example, the price for which a security may ultimately be sold or sold at any specific point in time. In addition, the valuations of certain assets may be adversely a/ff ected by external factors and developments that were not systematically taken into account in earlier models and methodologies, such as climaterelated transition risks, which may cause the market and prices for certain investments with a high carbon footprint (also known as 'stranded assets'), to decrease over time . For further information on our climate-related transition risk analysis, please refer to Section/uni00A0 4.3 'Climate change and biodiversity ' of this Annual Report. The choice of models, methodologies and/or assumptions may have a material impact on the estimated fair value amounts and could have a material adverse e/ff ect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe determination of the amount of allowances and impairments that we recognize with respect to the invested assets we hold varies by investment type, and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. In considering impairments, Manag ement considers a wide range of factors, including those described in Section/uni00A0 6.6 -/uni00A0Note/uni00A01.8.2 'Financial instruments classification'  of this Annual Report, and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the investment assets and the prospects for near-term recovery. For certain asset classes, particularly debt instruments, Manag ement's evaluation involves a variety of assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer of the instrument and its future earnings potential. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in allowances and\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1/uni00A0RISK FACTORS\n\nimpairments as such evaluations are revised. There can be no assurance, however, that M anagement has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken and allowances reflected in our financial statements, especially in light of uncertainties surrounding the impacts of systemic risks, and those relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing war in Ukraine, and the need for and timing of any additional impairments and/or allowances may have a material adverse e/ff ect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## CREDIT AND LIQUIDITY-RELATED RISKS\n\n## Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly a/ff  ect our ability to meet liquidity needs, our access to capital and increase our cost of capital\n\nIn recent years, the capital and credit markets have at times experienced high levels of volatility and disruption which, during certain periods, have significantly limited the availability of additional liquidity in the markets and credit capacity for most issuers, including the AXA Group. For more information about the contractual maturities of debt instruments held by the Group, please refer to Section/uni00A0 6.6 -/uni00A0Note/uni00A09.5 'Contractual maturities of debt instruments and loans and exposure to interest rate risk' of this Annual Report.\n\nWe need liquidity to pay our operating expenses (including claims and surrenders), dividends and interests on our debts and to refinance certain maturing debts and other liabilities. In addition, we need liquidity in connection with derivatives transactions to which we are party which require us to transfer cash collateral and/or subject us to margin calls in certain circumstances. The availability of additional financing to supplement internal liquidity resources will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that customers or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long-term or short-term financial prospects if we incur large technical or investment losses or if the level of our business activity decreases due to a market downturn or recession. While M anagement has put in place a liquidity Risk Management framework that includes active monitoring of the Group's liquidity position and contingency plans for accessing liquidity, liquidity constraints over a prolonged period may have a material adverse e/ff ect on our business, results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

Rating agencies review their ratings and rating criteria and methodologies on a recurring basis, and they may change or withdraw their ratings at any time, based on relevant factors that may not be entirely within our control and/or a/ff ect the insurance and reinsurance industry generally. Consequently, our current ratings may not be maintained in the future and no undue reliance should be placed on such ratings, which should not be considered as recommendations to purchase, sell, or hold any securities we have issued.\n\nA downgrade or the potential for a downgrade in our ratings could have an adverse e/ff ect on us, including (i) /uni00A0 damaging our competitive position, (ii) /uni00A0 negatively impacting our ability to underwrite new insurance policies, (iii) /uni00A0 increasing the levels of surrenders and termination rates of our in-force policies, (iv) /uni00A0 increasing our reinsurance costs, (v) /uni00A0 triggering termination provisions or collateral delivery requirements, or requiring us to return unearned premiums to cedants, under certain of our reinsurance and retrocessional agreements, (vi) /uni00A0 negatively impacting our ability to obtain financing and/or increasing our cost of financing, (vii) /uni00A0 harming our relationships with creditors or trading counterparties and/or (viii) /uni00A0adversely a/ff ecting public confidence in us. Any of these developments could have a material adverse e/ff ect on our business, liquidity position, results of operations, revenues and financial condition.\n\n## The financial condition and conduct of our counterparties could negatively impact the Group\n\nWe have significant exposure to third parties that owe us money, securities, or other assets and which may fail to perform or default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, lack of liquidity, operational failure, fraud, or other reasons. Such third parties include private sector and government (or government-backed) issuers whose securities we hold in our investment portfolios (including mortgage-backed, assetbacked, government bonds and other types of securities), borrowers under mortgages and other loans that we extend, reinsurers and capital market counterparties to which we have ceded (directly or indirectly) our insurance risks and to which our exposure is particularly significant, customers, ceding companies, service providers, partners, trading counterparties, counterparties under swap and other derivative contracts, and\n\nI\n\nI\n\nother counterparties including brokers and dealers, commercial and investment banks, hedge funds, other investment funds, clearing agents and market exchanges. We may also have exposures to such counterparties under insurance policies that we have written, including in respect of D&O, surety, and similar coverages. Moreover, we are exposed to counterparty risk with respect to certain policies we write that provide coverage to our policyholders for their credit risk exposures to third parties. Under our reinsurance and retrocessional arrangements (including similar protection afforded through risk transfer transactions to capital markets), other insurers, reinsurers or capital market counterparties assume a portion of the losses and related expenses under policies we issue, although we remain liable as the direct insurer or reinsurer on all risks reinsured. While we evaluate periodically the financial condition of our reinsurers, retrocessionaires and capital market counterparties to minimize our exposure to significant losses from reinsurer/ retrocessionaire/capital market counterparty insolvencies, such counterparties may become financially unsound by the time their financial obligations to us become due and force us to recapture the reinsured or retroceded business. In some cases, counterparty risk is mitigated by collateral to support the third party's financial obligations to us. However, there may be impediments to or delays in our accessing the collateral, and the collateral may not be sufficient to fully protect us in the event of a counterparty default.

We make assumptions about these factors in estimating our risk exposures, determining the pricing of our products, establishing our technical provisions and employee benefits reserves and reporting capital levels and business results. These assumptions are based on various modeling techniques ( e.g. , scenarios, predictive, stochastic and/or forecasting), using both proprietary and third-party models, data analytics and related analyses. Model outputs and related analyses are subject to various assumptions, uncertainties, model errors and the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis (including availability, use, accuracy, and relevance of historical, internal and industry data) and incorporate numerous assumptions and forecasts about market conditions (such as interest rates, inflation, and currency exchange rates), capital requirements, loss frequency and severity, and policyholder behavior. The use of such models can also be affected by operational risks, including input, data, and human error. Adverse experience relative to such assumptions (in particular in the context of pandemics or major natural and man-made catastrophe events and systemic risks ( e.g., cyber), use of and reliance on incomplete, inaccurate or incomplete models, or inherent product defects may result in an increase in the pricing of our insurance products or the need for us to strengthen our product reserves, which may in turn have an adverse e/ff ect on our results of operations and financial condition, or lead to litigation.\n\nIn our businesses and in the Company's function as the main operational internal reinsurer of the Group, we establish reserves for claims (reported and unreported) and claims expenses\n\nin accordance with industry practices, as well as accounting, actuarial and regulatory requirements. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on our assessment of facts and circumstances then known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, actuarial experience on past events, legal liability, and other factors. In particular, the amount of reserves net of reinsurance is also determined based on assumptions as to the availability of reinsurance/retrocession coverage, the applicability of such coverage to potential losses, including, for example, with respect to our ability to aggregate those losses in accordance with the relevant policy terms as well as the recoverability of any reinsurance receivables. Prolonged inflation could drive up our claims costs and have a material impact on our reserves and solvency, particularly in our Personal lines business (and especially our Motor business) where inflationary trends are combined with greater competition and pricing pressures. While we continually review the adequacy of our claims reserves, because the establishment of claims reserves is an inherently uncertain and complex process involving numerous estimates, including the impacts of any regulatory and legislative changes, court interpretations, medical condition of claimants, emerging trends and theories of liability, including with respect to environmental, cyber, medical and products liability exposures, and changes in economic conditions (including inflation changes and discount rates used for evaluation of settlements), there can be no assurance that ultimate losses will not materially exceed our claims reserves and have a material adverse e/ff ect on our results of operations. The impact of certain of these factors, such as social inflation, particularly in the United States (increased litigation, expanded theories of liability, higher jury awards and settlement expectations), as well as mass tort claims related to exposure to harmful products or substances ( e.g., asbestos, opioids, talc, glyphosate, lead paint), on our estimation of claims reserves and ultimate costs for claims is di/ff icult to assess and could be material. Our estimation may also be more di/ff icult during times of adverse economic conditions due to unexpected changes in behavior of claimants and policyholders, including an increase in fraudulent reporting of exposures and/or losses, reduced maintenance of insured properties or increased frequency of small claims.\n\nIn our Life &/uni00A0Savings business, our earnings depend significantly upon the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we use in setting the prices for our products and establishing the liabilities for obligations\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

In certain cases, product features such as minimum guarantees or options to swap between underlying funds in certain savings products may with time result in higher realized losses than anticipated in initial assumptions. In particular, assessing the impact of minimum guarantees which are contained within certain of our Life &/uni00A0 Savings products and the adequacy test performed on the reserves for life policies (which encompasses the recoverability of DAC, VBI and deferred policyholder participation assets) involve a significant degree of M anagement judgment.\n\nWhile we use both our own experience and industry data to develop products and to estimate future policy benefits, including information used in pricing the insurance products and establishing the related actuarial liabilities, there can be no assurance that actual experience will match these estimates and that systemic risks and other risks relating to pandemics or major natural or man-made catastrophe events would not result in loss experience inconsistent with our pricing and reserve assumptions. Furthermore, while our New Business Value (NBV) and European Embedded Value (EEV) calculations are done on a market consistent basis, changes in assumptions used in calculating these measures may have a material adverse e/ff  ect on the level of our NBV and/or EEV. For example, our NBV is sensitive to interest rate movements and, consequently, an adverse evolution of interest rates relative to our assumptions may have a significant impact on our NBV and a corresponding impact on the trading price of our securities.\n\n## The Group is exposed to risks related to climate change both directly through its own operations and indirectly through its insurance and investment activities\n\nThe most significant climate change risks that have and may in the future have a material impact on our business are physical risks, transition risks, and liability risks. Physical risks refer to the direct impacts of climate change on people (life and health) and property, such as those arising from rising temperatures, the increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, fires, rising sea levels and changes in exposure to vectorborne diseases. Such physical risks may significantly impact our business and the insurance and reinsurance industry more broadly, including with respect to risk perception, pricing and modelling assumptions, the need for new insurance products, the amount and quantum of claims and the value of our investments,\n\nI\n\nI\n\nall of which may create unforeseen risks and costs not currently known to us. Transition risks refer to the risks relating to the modification of behavior and strategies of industrial actors, market participants and customers in response to climate change and related policy, regulatory and technological developments, including as a result of the cross-sectoral structural changes stemming from the transition towards a low-carbon economy. Such transition risks could impact our insurance products, underwriting and the value of our investments. In addition, both the physical and transition risks of climate change increasingly result in liability risks, including potential disputes, claims for compensation and legal proceedings brought against those we insure and potentially directly against AXA, seeking damages for contribution to climate change or for inaccurate or insu/ff icient disclosure around material financial or operational risks. The Group is also exposed to an increasing risk of other forms of climate-related litigation, in particular claims by shareholders and other stakeholders for so-called 'greenwashing' actions, misrepresentation, misleading conduct, mis-selling, fraud, breaches of fundamental human rights, breaches of fiduciary duties and breaches of disclosure obligations in listing rules or other corporate regimes, or for having deficient controls or processes in place.\n\nLiability risks related to climate change could lead to increased claims and defense costs or materially adversely affect the value of our investments, financial condition, and results of operations. Our reputation or corporate brand could also be negatively impacted by such liability risks, or as a result of changing customer or societal perceptions of organizations that we either insure or invest in due to their actions (or lack thereof) with respect to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) practices and regulatory compliance or climate change.\n\nFor additional information on regulatory and litigation risks related to climate change, please refer to the paragraphs below 'The Group and our businesses are subject to extensive regulation, regulatory supervision, adverse judicial decisions, and emerging legal, regulatory, and reputational risks in the various jurisdictions in which we operate ' (in particular subparagraph 'Risks relating to p olicy and r egulatory i nitiatives on c limate c hange, s ustainability and ESG') and 'Increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from investors, customers, regulators and other stakeholders regarding environmental, social and governance matters and climate change may  impact our business and results of operations'.",

Over the past several years, changing weather patterns and climatic conditions, including as a result of climate change, have added to the unpredictability of natural disasters and to the frequency and severity thereof and created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. Catastrophic events are inherently unpredictable. Our exposure to natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, hailstorms, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, freezes, floods, explosions, wildfires, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), and infectious diseases , depends on various factors and is often more pronounced in certain geographic areas, including major urban centers, with a high concentration of customers, employees and/or insured property and assets.\n\nOther catastrophic events. We are also exposed to other types of disasters including man-made disasters which refer to those resulting from negligent or deliberate human actions, such as ransomware and other disruptive forms of cyber-attacks, systemic cyber failures, terrorist attacks, military actions, and power grid and other core infrastructure ( e.g., telephony or Internet infrastructure ) failures, as well as any new significant systemic risks (such as those relating to cyber security).\n\nImpact of catastrophic events. The AXA Group is underwrites risks in most regions of the globe (Europe, North and Latin America, Asia-Pacific) which are all exposed to natural and man-made catastrophes. While we seek to manage the AXA Group's exposure through underwriting actions (both in our insurance operations and our inward reinsurance) and/or ceded reinsurance/retrocession coverage, there can be no assurance that the occurrence of catastrophic events will not have a material adverse impact on our operations, results, financial condition, cash flows or solvency position.\n\nCatastrophic events could result in substantial volatility in or adversely affect our operations, results, financial condition, cash flows or solvency position, including as a result of claims occurring at higher levels or materially earlier than anticipated; losses resulting from disruptions in our operations or failures of our counterparties to perform; or declines in value of our investment portfolio. We monitor the evolution of these risks closely and generally seek to manage our exposure to them through individual risk selection, modelling and monitoring\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1/uni00A0RISK FACTORS\n\noverall exposures and risk accumulation, purchase of third-party reinsurance and risk transfer transactions to capital markets. In some cases, we may reduce our exposure and/or risk appetites. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to adequately anticipate such evolution, as a single catastrophic event, an accumulation of losses resulting from several events or an unusual frequency of smaller losses in a particular period may a/ff ect multiple geographic areas and lines of business, and the actual frequency or severity of catastrophic events could exceed our initial projections, due to impacts from outsized major storms or other c limate-related events . Accounting principles and rules preventing insurers and reinsurers from reserving for catastrophic events until they occur may also augment the impact of such events.\n\nWhile we seek to reduce our exposure to catastrophic events through diversification and incremental reinsurance, we have experienced, and could in the future experience, material losses from these types of risks, which may exceed our reinsurance and retrocessional protection (or similar protection a/ff orded through risk transfer transactions to capital markets), or such protection may otherwise be inadequate to protect us against losses or reinsurance receivables may not be recoverable as expected.\n\nThe frequency and severity of catastrophic events may also lead to an increase in AXA's net exposure as a hardening reinsurance market may limit or prevent us from obtaining adequate types and amounts of reinsurance/retrocession (or entering into adequate risk transfer transactions to capital markets) for certain risks or regions, which may result in an unexpected gap between our underwriting commitments and our reinsurance/ retrocessional coverage. Catastrophic events have created, and may create in the future, significant volatility and uncertainty in reinsurance capacity and pricing and impact our ability to obtain ceded reinsurance/retrocessional coverage for our business.\n\nFurthermore,  we  may  be  unable  to  obtain  appropriate reinsurance/retrocession coverage with respect to exposures to certain systemic risks and other risks such as the ongoing war in Ukraine and similar events, which may result in an increase of our net exposures to such risks or require us to decrease our relevant underwriting commitments.\n\nIn addition, legislative and regulatory initiatives implemented, and court decisions rendered, following major catastrophes may adversely impact our results, financial condition, cash flows or solvency position, in particular where they seek to expand the intended scope of coverage for catastrophe-related claims beyond policy terms, including through policyholder-friendly or otherwise broad interpretation of policy wording or retroactive extension of policy coverage.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

Any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to write future business or result in the assumption of more risk with respect to the policies we issue. We may also incur unexpected costs as a result of one or more reinsurers' insolvency, inability or unwillingness to make timely payments under the terms of our contracts or in an amount equal to the relevant reinsurance recoverables, or inability or unwillingness to maintain collateral on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, the terms of the reinsurance treaties may evolve, which may prevent us from renewing on the same or substantially the same terms or limit our coverage for certain exposures under our policies and lead to a reduction in actual coverage or to exclusions that imply a larger net risk retained by AXA.\n\nHistorically, Property &/uni00A0Casualty insurers and reinsurers have experienced significant fluctuations in operating results due to volatile and sometimes unpredictable developments, many of which are beyond the direct control of the insurer/reinsurer, including competition, frequency or severity of loss events, levels of underwriting capacity by region or product line, general economic conditions, systemic risks, pandemics and related governmental measures, as well as other factors, including the development of the insurance-linked securities market and other alternatives to traditional Property &/uni00A0Casualty insurance and reinsurance products. Changes in customer expectations for appropriate premium levels, the frequency or severity of claims or other loss events, including losses incurred by our ceding insurers and reinsurers, the hardening of the reinsurance market or other factors a/ff ecting the Property &/uni00A0Casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses may have an adverse e/ff ect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nFurthermore, there may be uncertainty surrounding  reinsurance/ retrocessional  coverage for losses. Reinsurance/retrocessional coverage for losses may be more difficult to obtain, as our reinsurers may challenge the applicability of coverage, seek to rely on exclusions or seek to limit our ability to aggregate these losses in accordance with policy terms, any of which may require us to pursue arbitration/litigation and involve significant time and cost to enforce our coverage. The amount of reinsurance recovery available to us may be adversely impacted in respect of these losses.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## Our Risk Management programs may be inadequate to protect us against the full extent of the exposure or losses we seek to mitigate and may leave us exposed to unidentified, unanticipated, or incorrectly quantified risks that could result in significant losses\n\nWe employ a range of Risk Management strategies, including reinsurance for own account and capital markets solutions (such as catastrophe bonds), in order to avoid or limit losses and liabilities. The failure of any of our Risk Management strategies or our inability to review or adapt our Risk Management strategies could result in significant losses and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\nWe use derivatives (including equity futures, treasury bond futures, interest rate swaps and swaptions and equity options) to hedge certain, but not all, risks under guarantees provided to our clients or stemming from our assets. In particular, to hedge a significant widening of credit spreads, we use credit swaps to notably mitigate our exposure to a high deterioration of the credit quality of our asset portfolio. In certain cases, however, we may not be able to apply these techniques to e/ff ectively hedge our risks as intended or expected or may choose not to hedge certain risks because the derivative markets in question may not be of su/ff icient size or liquidity, the cost of hedging may be too expensive (as a result of adverse market conditions or otherwise), the nature of the risk itself may limit our ability to e/ff ectively hedge or for other reasons. This may result in higher realized losses and unanticipated cash needs to collateralize or settle transactions. Hedging counterparties may also fail to perform their obligations, resulting in unhedged exposures and losses on positions that are not collateralized.\n\nFurthermore, the operation of our hedging program is based on models involving numerous estimates and M anagement judgments, including, among others, volatility and interest rates, and correlation among various market movements. These models or their underlying estimates and assumptions could prove inadequate for certain market environments, especially when financial markets experience high volatility, for instance as a result of unprecedented shocks like the war in Ukraine and similar events, pandemics and related governmental actions, such as the lockdown measures implemented in various jurisdictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our hedging program may change over time and there can be no assurance that actual experience will not di/ff er materially from our assumptions, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.",

We are also exposed to risks arising from potential failures in, or non-compliance with, Group and entity policies concerning such matters as internal controls and procedures and financial reporting policies, as well as from employee misconduct or negligence and fraud. While we take measures to manage such risk, operational risk is part of the business environment in which we operate and we may incur losses from time to time due to these types of risks, as well as impairments to our liquidity, disruption of our businesses, deterioration of our solvency position, legal claims, regulatory sanctions, or damage to our reputation. The risk of operational failure or termination of any of the clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries we use to facilitate our securities transactions could have similar adverse e/ff ects.\n\nOur business is highly dependent on the e/ff ective operation of our information technology, telecommunications, electronic data, and other operational systems. We rely on these systems to perform necessary business functions, including providing insurance quotes, processing applications and claims, providing information and support to customers and distributors, administering complex products, conducting actuarial analyses, and keeping financial records. We also use computer systems to store, retrieve, evaluate, and utilize significant amounts of sensitive customer, employee and company data and information, including proprietary and confidential information. Some of these systems, in turn, rely on third-party systems. Systems failures or outages or cyber-attacks, or the failure by third-party technology providers to maintain their services or to meet their contractual obligations, could compromise our ability to perform necessary business functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our customers and business partners.

For example, the COVID-19 pandemic, including related governmental measures, increased the probability and magnitude of operational risks associated with employee health problems, business continuity plans related to delays or failures in external services and measures impacting working practices (such as extensive remote working arrangements or requirements), as well as creating shortages in multiple labor markets. Remote working patterns and higher rates of turnover more broadly could lead to di/ff iculty in obtaining and retaining talent. A failure to implement appropriate management of such heightened operational risks may adversely a/ff ect the Group's brand and reputation as well as its results of operations.\n\nFor additional information on the risks relating to the protection, processing, and transfer of personal data (including customer and employee data), please refer to the paragraph below 'The evolving and complex regulatory environment surrounding data protection and transfer worldwide could increase our costs and adversely impact our business'.\n\n## Cyber-attacks or other security breaches of our computer systems, technologies, or networks, or those of our third-party providers, could disrupt our businesses, result in damage to our reputation or significant financial losses, and expose us to potential regulatory sanctions\n\nThe increasing frequency and sophistication of ransomware and other disruptive forms of cyber-attacks directed at major financial institutions and other corporations recently has made clear the significance of these cyber risks and the operational, financial, and reputational damage that they can potentially inflict. In recent years, this has led to an increased regulatory focus on risks of security breaches stemming from the growing reliance of the financial sector on information and communication technology. For further information on the relevant regulatory frameworks, please refer to 'Information and Communication Technology (ICT)' in Section/uni00A07.3 'General Information -/uni00A0Regulation and Supervision -/uni00A0 Other significant legislative and regulatory frameworks' of this Annual Report.\n\nDespite the Group's implementation of a variety of security measures, the Group's data, systems, and technologies, as well as the services we provide or rely on (including mobile and cloud services), have been and may in the future be subject to unauthorized intrusions, such as physical or electronic breakins, ransomware, and other disruptive forms of cyber-attacks,\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

Exposure to these threats has widened due to a growing reliance on digital infrastructure, including from extended remote working arrangements put in place across the Group.  For example, a smart working strategy that combines remote working and o/ff ice presence was adopted in 2021 by AXA's main entities employing over 70% of the AXA Group's employees and was implemented globally by all of the Group's entities in 2022. Management has put in place internal controls and procedures designed to protect client data as well as the Group's assets from hacking or other types of unauthorized intrusions into the Group's computer systems, technologies and networks. There can be no assurance, however, that these controls and procedures will be su/ff icient, properly implemented, or e/ff ective, and prevent all attempted intrusions into the Group's systems, technologies, or networks. Any such intrusion could result in operational disruption, financial losses, unauthorized access to, tampering or loss of sensitive personal data and/or proprietary information, in addition to the diversion of significant Group resources and attention from its ordinary business activities, including the time and attention of Management. Unauthorized intrusions and compromises that have taken place, and any attempted intrusions in the future, could also lead to regulatory actions, proceedings, or sanctions against us.

This strategic plan is being implemented through a number of major initiatives, including in our Health and Protection business and across our Property &/uni00A0Casualty Commercial lines, all of which are further described under the caption 'Strategic Orientations' on pages 6 and 7 and in Section/uni00A02.6 'Outlook' of this Annual Report. All of these actions have been designed to deliver sustained earnings growth, driven by all our geographies, and a clear path to dividend growth, supported by enhanced cash generation, a strong balance sheet and disciplined capital management.  Furthermore, as announced in our 'Driving Progress 2023' strategic plan, we intend to reduce the carbon footprint of our General Account assets ( i.e., corporate fixed income; listed equities; real estate assets) by 20% by 2025. This new non-financial target complements the Group's commitment to contain the 'warming potential' of its investment portfolio to below 1.5\u00b0C by 2050/uni00A0and its objective to reach \u20ac26/uni00A0billion in green investments by 2023. For more information about our 'Driving Progress 2023' strategic plan and AXA's sustainability strategy, please refer to Section/uni00A04.1 'AXA Group's s ustainability strategy' of this Annual Report. There can be no assurance, however, that any or all of our strategic initiatives will be successful, or that the process of achieving their implementation will not cause material disruption to our business operations, management, personnel, brand, and reputation.\n\nThe 'Driving Progress 2023' strategic plan is based on a number of assumptions, covering, inter alia, the macroeconomic environment and the development of the Group's activities. These assumptions are based on various modeling techniques and forecasts regarding several factors ( e.g., interest rates, inflation, capital requirements, claims expenses, gross domestic product). As a result, the financial targets we intend to achieve as part of our 2020-2023/uni00A0strategic plan and any subsequent strategic plans may be negatively affected by an adverse experience relative to such assumptions. Any failure to achieve such financial targets could materially impact our results of operations, share price and competitive position.",

In the case of adverse developments relating to an acquired company, modifications to our expected strategy with respect to such company, or more generally our overall strategy, might have to be considered. In addition, we may be subject to, or engage in, litigation in connection with or as a result of acquisitions or joint ventures, which could have an adverse e/ff ect on our results of operations.\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1/uni00A0RISK FACTORS\n\nWe  have  carried  out  and  may  carry  out  in  the  future divestitures, reorganizations of existing businesses and internal reorganizations, which may result in increased regulatory burdens or adverse e/ff ects on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Such divestitures and reorganizations, which may take the form of share or asset sales or merger, as well as reinsurance transactions, may not be carried out within the expected timeframe or at all, due to the failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals or other reasons; the anticipated profit and/or positive effect on our overall risk profile, our Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) and Solvency/uni00A0II ratio (on a Group basis or AXA/uni00A0SA solo basis), or local solvency and capital adequacy requirements, from any such transactions may not be realized; or we may incur a loss on such transactions. Divestments of equity participations we hold may also be exposed to volatility and other market-related or geopolitical risks, which could impact the carrying value of our remaining stake in such companies, including related goodwill, and adversely a/ff ect our results of operations. All of such factors may be exacerbated by/uni00A0economic conditions relating to reinsurance pricing and market capacity. For additional information on the impact of divestitures, acquisitions, and other transactions on goodwill, please refer to Section/uni00A0 6.6 -/uni00A0Note/uni00A05 'Goodwill'/uni00A0 of this Annual Report.\n\nFrom time to time, we may a lso consider acquisitions of or investments in other companies, including through joint ventures. Any such acquisition or investment may be subject to approvals from regulatory authorities in certain countries, including as a result of foreign investment regulations and controls, which may lead to the transfer of certain assets or branches of activity and/or commitments or restrictions a/ff ecting the conduct of our business. We may experience di/ff iculty or delay in acquiring and integrating such investments, which may result in costs, litigation or otherwise impact the intended benefit of the transaction, which could have an adverse e/ff ect on our results of operations.\n\nWe may also be exposed to liabilities and risks that were not known or assessed correctly at the time of the transaction and/or need to address capital, regulatory, compliance, tax or accounting issues or disagreements that arise a/f\\_t er transactions have closed, which may not be covered by, or exceed the amounts of, any indemnities provided to us by the sellers or that we provided to acquirors, and could adversely a/ff ect our business and results of operations.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

In addition, development of alternative distribution channels, claims management or underwriting services for certain types of insurance, reinsurance, and securities products, including through the Internet, may result in increasing competition as well as pressure on margins for certain types of products. Continued consolidation of the insurance and reinsurance sector may also result in increased competition.\n\nThese competitive pressures could result in increased pricing pressures on a number of our products and services, particularly as competitors seek to win market share, and may harm our ability to maintain or increase our profitability.\n\n## The failure to respond e/ff  ectively to various emerging technological changes may a/ff ect our business and profitability\n\nWe face an ongoing challenge of effectively adapting to a constantly changing technological landscape. If we are not e/ff  ective in anticipating the impact on our business of changing technologies, such as driverless cars, drones, connected devices, artificial intelligence or robot-advisors, our ability to successfully operate our business may be impaired. Technologies could disrupt the demand for our products or services from current customers, create coverage issues or impact the frequency or severity of losses. These changes could also a/ff ect our ability to accurately price our products and might significantly a/ff ect our margins in certain lines of business. For example, the advent of driverless cars, connected devices and usage-based insurance could materially alter the way that automobile, health, or other Personal lines insurance is marketed, priced and underwritten. In addition, the market for coverage for\n\nI\n\nI\n\nrenewable energy infrastructure and for so-called 'cyber risks', including ransomware and other cyber-related risk, or similar emerging threats, is a rapidly evolving one, and any failure by us to provide innovative products relative to our competitors or new entrants in the market, or to price those products e/ff ectively and competitively, may result in a competitive disadvantage.\n\nIn addition, the rapid increase in the nature, volume and availability of data in recent years, whether resulting from connected customers, so-called 'big data', 'blockchain', cloud computing, increased mobile Internet access, personalization of genetic data, asymmetric information with respect to genetic testing, artificial intelligence or otherwise, may have unanticipated and adverse impacts on our business, for example by changing the nature of insurance underwriting, pricing and claims handling; by allowing customers and competitors to tailor coverage in ways that we do not currently o/ff er; or by potentially exposing us to increased 'moral hazard' in business lines where we are unable for regulatory or other reasons to adjust pricing or coverage to reflect individual risk profiles. Data-driven changes in the industry, which are at an early stage and di/ff icult to predict, could adversely impact our business going forward, including through the expense and e/ff ort that we will need to incur in order to ensure that our employees, systems, and processes are able to e/ff iciently adapt to and manage such changes as they arise.\n\nFurthermore, if we are unable to e/ff ectively use and update or replace our key technology systems as they become obsolete or as emerging technology renders them competitively ine/ff icient, or if we fail to develop the talent and skills of our human resources to meet the new technological challenges, and to attract and assimilate new talents into our Group consistent with our business goals, our business, prospects, competitive position, and financial condition could be adversely a/ff ected.\n\n## We operate through arrangements with third parties, including delegation of underwriting and claims authority, which exposes us to operational and regulatory risks and could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition\n\nWe have entered into contractual outsourcing arrangements with third-party service providers for a wide variety of services required in connection with the day-to-day operation of our insurance, reinsurance, and Asset Management businesses (including policy administration, claims-related services, securities pricing, and other services) and our product distribution. Such arrangements expose us to operational and regulatory risks incurred by these",

If we do not delegate appropriately to relevant third parties or these third parties do not abide by the terms of our policies or licenses, amend material terms of the policies without our approval, do not price appropriately or fail to reserve relevant assumptions or otherwise breach their contractual obligations to us, we could be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions, or other similar restrictions for breach of outsourcing/licensing requirements and be liable under the policies issued by breaching third parties. Furthermore, we may be exposed to additional exposure to such risks, in particular due to legislative or regulatory measures or judicial decisions, such as those imposing customer-friendly interpretation of policy wording, which may apply to policies that were bound on our behalf by certain of these third parties.\n\nFurthermore, as with other reinsurers, in our reinsurance business we do not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under our reinsurance treaties and we largely rely on original underwriting decisions made by ceding companies. As a result, if ceding companies did not adequately evaluate the risks insured, the premiums ceded to us may not compensate us for the risks we reinsure and the losses we may incur, which may adversely a/ff ect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe carry out certain of our operations through joint ventures and other partnership arrangements with third parties that we do not control. These arrangements expose us, in particular, to the failure of any of our partners to meets its contractual obligations or to comply with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nThere can be no assurance that any of our contractual arrangements with third parties will not expose us to operational, financial, and reputational risk, which could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.

On September/uni00A022, 2021, the European Commission published its proposed directive amending Directive 2009/138/EC (the 'Solvency/uni00A0II Directive') and explained its overall intentions on the most important aspects of the forthcoming level/uni00A02 amendments (in particular with respect to risk margin). On June/uni00A017, 2022, the Council of the European Union agreed on its position and published a compromise text, with proposed amendments to the Solvency/uni00A0II framework. For more information about the proposed directive amending the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive, please refer to Section/uni00A07.3 'General Information -/uni00A0Regulation and Supervision -/uni00A0Regulatory Capital and Solvency Requirements -/uni00A0 Solvency/uni00A0II review' of this Annual Report and the paragraph below 'The Group and our businesses are subject to extensive regulation, regulatory supervision, adverse judicial decisions, and emerging legal, regulatory, and reputational risks in the various jurisdictions in which we operate'. Any changes to the Solvency/uni00A0II framework resulting in an increase of own funds that insurers and reinsurers are required to hold with respect to insurance policies or insurance-based investment products may require us to take actions to preserve our solvency level and business model, which might in turn have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, relationships with customers, capacity to pay dividends, as well as our brand and reputation. It is di/ff icult to predict the ultimate outcome of the proposed changes to current requirements, the impacts of which could include additional regulatory costs and operational constraints, as well as changes to our Internal Model, which may significantly and adversely a/ff ect our Solvency/uni00A0II ratio and EOF, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\nIn  addition,  supervisory  authorities  may  become  more conservative in the interpretation, application and enforcement of relevant regulations, as a result of which they may, for example, impose increased reserving requirements for certain types of insurers and reinsurers or certain types of risks, greater liquidity requirements (including capital conservations measures\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

In particular, the ACPR, the French insurance supervisory authority, may impose changes to the Internal Model we use to calculate our SCR or change its view regarding our methodologies and/ or the integration method of some of our entities, which may adversely a/ff ect our Solvency/uni00A0II ratio. For additional information on our Internal Model and Solvency/uni00A0II ratio, please refer to Section/uni00A05.2/uni00A0Internal control and Risk Management -/uni00A0 Internal Model '     of  this  Annual  Report/uni00A0 (1) .\n\nIn the event of a failure by the Group, the Company (which, since 2022, is an ACPR-licensed reinsurance company following the internal reinsurance transformation as described in Section/uni00A02.1 'Operating highlights' of this Annual Report) or any of our insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries to meet applicable regulatory  capital  requirements,  insurance  supervisory authorities have broad authority to exercise various regulatory and administrative powers at an early stage, including limiting or prohibiting certain activities or operations (such as the acceptance of premiums), prohibiting or on the contrary ordering asset or portfolio disposals, restricting payment of dividends or other shareholder distributions, suspending managers, and/or putting a company under special oversight.\n\nIn addition, under the French recovery and resolution framework for the insurance sector (the/uni00A0'French Resolution Framework'), the ACPR is empowered to use resolution tools in order to maintain continuity of critical functions of insurance holding companies, and insurance and reinsurance companies (of which the Company is both an insurance holding company and a reinsurance company) that are failing or likely to fail. These tools include portfolio transfers, the establishment of a bridge institution or the establishment of a liability management structure, as well as associated resolution actions such as temporary stays on certain payments. Furthermore, the proposed directive published by the European Commission on September/uni00A022, 2021, to establish a framework for recovery and resolution of insurance and reinsurance companies aims at harmonizing national laws on recovery and resolution of insurers and reinsurers. For more information about the proposed framework, please refer to Section/uni00A07.3 'General Information -/uni00A0Regulation and Supervision -/uni00A0Regulatory Capital and Solvency Requirements -/uni00A0Recovery and resolutions regimes for insurers and reinsurers' of this Annual Report.\n\nA failure of the Company , the Group and/or any of its insurance or reinsurance entities to meet its regulatory capital requirements and/or a deterioration of its/their solvency position(s) may also result in the need for significant amounts of new capital. In addition, in certain cases, the Company may be required to provide guarantees or capital commitments with respect to its insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries, whether at the\n\nI\n\nI\n\nrequest of supervisory authorities or certain counterparties, which may be reflected in our financial statements as offbalance sheet commitments. There can be no assurance that any of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's or the Group's liquidity position, financial condition, and results of operations. For additional information on the Company's o/ff -balance sheet commitments, please refer to Section/uni00A06.6 -/uni00A0Note/uni00A05 'Off-balance sheet commitments' in Appendix/uni00A0III 'AXA Parent Company Financial Statements' of this Annual Report.\n\nRegulatory restrictions that inhibit our ability to freely move excess capital among our subsidiaries or which otherwise restrict fungibility of the AXA Group's capital resources may, depending on the nature and extent of the restrictions, adversely affect the capital position of our operating insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries, which may have a consequent negative impact on the perception of the AXA's Group financial strength.\n\nAdditional regulatory developments regarding solvency capital requirements may adversely affect our prudential regime as well as increase associated costs. There can be no assurance that contingency plans developed by M anagement will be e/ff ective to achieve their objectives and any failure by us and/ or our insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements and to maintain regulatory capital at competitive levels could have a material adverse e/ff ect on our business, liquidity, credit ratings, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## We are dependent on our subsidiaries to cover our operating expenses and make dividend payments\n\nOur principal sources of funds are (i) /uni00A0dividends from subsidiaries, (ii) /uni00A0 reinsurance premiums paid by certain of the Group's European Property &/uni00A0Casualty carriers to the Company in its function as the main operational internal reinsurer of the Group, and (iii) /uni00A0funds that may be raised from time to time through the issuance of debt or equity securities or through bank or other borrowings and other intra-group arrangements. These funds enable us to cover our operating expenses and make Company dividend payments, among other things.\n\nRegulatory and other legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from all our subsidiaries. In particular, our principal insurance subsidiaries and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the amount of dividends and debt repayments that can be paid to us and our a/ff iliates.

Our\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1/uni00A0RISK FACTORS\n\nregulatory environment is evolving rapidly and supervisory authorities around the world are assuming an increasingly active and extended role in interpreting and enforcing regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, resulting in significant compliance challenges. We have highlighted below some of the more recent and noteworthy regulatory developments that we anticipate may impact our business in the coming periods; further details regarding these and related regulatory and supervisory matters also appear in Section/uni00A0 7.3 'General Information -/uni00A0Regulation and Supervision'  of this Annual Report. The following summarizes recent developments impacting our required levels of capital and surplus; anti-money laundering and related anti-corruption measures; regulatory pronouncements with respect to interest rate and other 'benchmarks', as well as climate change-related initiatives; changes to IFRS; and potential developments at Lloyd's.\n\nCapital standards and restrictions on distributions to shareholders. The multiplicity of di/ff erent regulatory regimes, capital standards and reporting requirements resulting from work on new capital standards led by the IAIS, such as the Insurance Capital Standard, and the development by the IAIS of the ComFrame, which will apply to IAIGs, including the/uni00A0Company as a regulated reinsurer, as well as potential changes to applicable solvency and capital adequacy requirements, such as the regulatory framework established under the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive, could increase operational complexity, regulatory costs and competition. In this regard, a review of the Solvency/uni00A0II framework by the European Commission is currently ongoing. For more information about the proposed directive amending the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive, please refer to Section/uni00A07.3 'General Information -/uni00A0Regulation and Supervision -/uni00A0Regulatory Capital and Solvency Requirements -/uni00A0Solvency/uni00A0II review' of this Annual Report. In addition, given the steps taken by the European Central Bank (the 'ECB'), EIOPA, the ACPR, the European Systemic Risk Board and other supervisory authorities in previous years to regulate dividend distributions and share repurchases by financial institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic, there can be no assurance that additional restrictions on dividends or other distributions by financial institutions will not be implemented in the future and, if so, how such restrictions will be interpreted and applied by competent supervisory authorities. For additional information on our dividend policy and previous dividend payments, please refer to Section/uni00A01.1 'Key Figures -/uni00A0Dividends and d ividend p olicy' and Section/uni00A07.3 'General Information -/uni00A0 Bylaws -/uni00A0Rights, p references and r estrictions a ttached to the s hares' of this Annual Report.\n\nCustomer protection matters.

In the European Union, these initiatives, including Directive (EU) 2016/97 on insurance distribution (as amended, 'IDD'), Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments (as amended, 'MiFID/uni00A0II') and Regulation (EU) 1286/2014 on key information documents for packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (as amended, the 'PRIIPs Regulation'), and similar initiatives are under review (or in the course of implementation) in other jurisdictions in which the Group operates. These initiatives, as well as future or revised guidance issued by regulatory authorities (such as the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), EIOPA, the AMF and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)) and other emerging social and reputational trends, may increase our legal and compliance costs, limit or restrict our ability to do business or expose us to civil, criminal or regulatory actions, proceedings or sanctions, all of which may adversely impact our brand or reputation. For further information, please refer to 'Evolution of the regulatory and litigation environment' in Section/uni00A07.3 'General Information -/uni00A0Regulation and Supervision -/uni00A0Other significant legislative and regulatory frameworks' of this Annual Report.\n\nAML and other compliance matters. In recent years there has also been a significant increase in legislative and regulatory initiatives and enforcement actions in the areas of financial crime compliance, including Anti-Money Laundering (AML), international trade sanctions and anti-bribery laws and regulations ( e.g., the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act of 2010, French Law No./uni00A02016-1691 of December/uni00A09, 2016 (also known as 'Sapin/uni00A0II')), which have resulted in the need for enhanced control on transactions. As a result, the financial crime compliance programs of financial institutions remain a major focus for regulatory and law enforcement authorities, while regulatory measures in this area continue to be further amended, expanded, and strengthened. For instance, in France, Orders No./uni00A02020-1342 of November/uni00A04, 2020, and No./uni00A02020-115 of February/uni00A012, 2020, imposed enhanced requirements on French financial institutions, including the reinforcement of internal procedures to implement asset-freezing measures, and prevent and detect acts of corruption and influence-peddling committed in France and abroad. Furthermore, in certain jurisdictions the relevant AML, anti-corruption and sanctions rules may be enforced on an extraterritorial basis, which could expose our operations to additional or conflicting requirements. In addition, increased cooperation among authorities globally may, in the event we become subject to enforcement proceedings, or are otherwise found to be non-compliant in this area, result in more severe sanctions or monetary penalties.\n\nBenchmark  reforms. Reforms to interest rate, equity, foreign exchange rate and other types of indices (also known as\n\nI\n\nI\n\n'benchmarks') were enacted in 2016 by the European Parliament and the Council. Several interbank market benchmarks have since been designated as critical benchmarks, including LIBOR, EURIBOR and EONIA under applicable local benchmark regulations, and their related benchmark methodologies made subject to review. Certain critical benchmarks have been discontinued, including EONIA, which ceased to be published on January/uni00A03, 2022, and LIBOR (publication of most LIBOR settings ceased on December/uni00A031, 2021, and publication of certain USD LIBOR settings is expected to cease on June/uni00A030, 2023). In this context, Regulation (EU) 2021/168 was published on February/uni00A010, 2021, and allows the European Commission to impose a statutory replacement for certain critical benchmarks, whose cessation might result in significant disruption to the operation of financial markets in the EU. For more information about Regulation (EU) 2021/168 and benchmark regulations generally, please refer to 'Reform and potential changes to reference rates and indices (benchmarks)' in Section  7.3 'General Information -/uni00A0Regulation and Supervision -/uni00A0Other significant legislative and regulatory frameworks'  of this Annual Report.\n\nBecause these reforms are a/ff ecting the whole financial services sector, the transition to new benchmarks creates industry-wide risks, to which the Group is therefore exposed. AXA is conducting a Group-wide project to manage this transition and the impacts of future benchmark changes, which could have implications for our capital models, Risk Management e/ff orts, investment strategies and product design, among others. Implementation of these and any future regulations, amendments to existing regulations, or future or revised guidance issued by regulatory authorities (such as the ESMA, EIOPA, the AMF, the ACPR and the FCA) can be expected to increase the Group's costs in relation to operations, information systems, legal and compliance, and may also limit or restrict the Group's ability to do business or expose us to civil, criminal or regulatory actions, proceedings or sanctions, which may adversely impact our brand or reputation.\n\nRisks relating to policy and regulatory initiatives on climate change, sustainability and ESG. Policy and regulatory initiatives and frameworks, including at French, European Union, and international levels, regarding climate change and sustainability, create increasing legal, regulatory, and reputational risks. These initiatives and frameworks include: (i) /uni00A0disclosure requirements, such as those resulting from/uni00A0 (a) at the French level, article/uni00A029 of Law No./uni00A02019-1147 dated November/uni00A08, 2019, on energy and climate (the 'Energy-Climate Law' or 'ECL') and/uni00A0 (b) in the European Union, Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (the 'Taxonomy Regulation'), Directive (EU) 2022/2464 (the/uni00A0'Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive' or 'CSRD'), Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (the 'Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation' or 'SFDR'); (ii) /uni00A0 conduct rules",

There is also a geopolitical element to this risk, as governments and regulators in di/ff erent jurisdictions take varied and o/f\\_t en divergent approaches to the energy transition, climate policy and 'net-zero' initiatives. These di/ff erences could have economic consequences, undermine the ability to fulfil our commitments, undermine the ability to support the energy transition, expose us to risk of litigation and adversely a/ff ect the value of our business or of our investments. For further information on climate-, ESGand sustainable finance-related regulatory initiatives, please refer to 'Climate and sustainable finance-related regulatory initiatives' in Section/uni00A07.3 'General Information Regulation and Supervision -/uni00A0 Other significant legislative and regulatory frameworks' and on investment-related climate risk analysis, please refer to Section/uni00A04.3 'Climate change and biodiversity -/uni00A0Risks and impacts in relation to climate change and biodiversity ' of this Annual Report.\n\n- Financial Instruments, which became effective for annual Changes  to  IFRS. Changes  to  IFRS,  as  developed  and promulgated from time to time by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), may significantly impact insurers and other financial institutions, including AXA, that prepare their consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS. In particular, the Group has undertaken the simultaneous implementation of IFRS/uni00A017 -/uni00A0Insurance Contracts and IFRS/uni00A09\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1/uni00A0RISK FACTORS\n\nperiods beginning on or after January/uni00A01, 2023, following the adoption of IFRS/uni00A017 by the European Union on November/uni00A019, 2021. These changes will significantly affect the accounting treatment of insurance liabilities and financial assets. For further information on these two standards, please refer to 'Evolution of a ccounting s tandards' in Section/uni00A07.3 'General Information - Regulation and Supervision -/uni00A0Other significant legislative and regulatory frameworks' of this Annual Report. There can be no assurance that the above-mentioned changes to IFRS, or any changes to IFRS that may be adopted in the future, will not have a material adverse e/ff ect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic-related judicial decisions. In certain jurisdictions, notably the United Kingdom, courts have rendered decisions in favor of policyholders' interests, including by adopting a policyholder-friendly interpretation of certain business interruption policy provisions. Other judicial decisions may be rendered, or legislative proposals enacted to the e/ff ect of implementing premium deferrals or refunds, customer-friendly interpretation of policy wording and/or retroactive extension of policy coverage or restricting our ability to cancel or non-renew insurance policies or collect premiums thereunder in accordance with their terms. This may require the Group to cover losses resulting from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, even though such losses were not covered under the terms of the relevant policy. As a result, we may be exposed to higher-than-expected losses. In addition, we may be required to materially amend certain of our existing policy wordings or otherwise change our underwriting and pricing policies and practices to take account of changing judicial and regulatory developments. There can be no assurance that any of the foregoing developments will not have an adverse e/ff ect on the Group's financial condition and results of operations or adversely impact our brand or reputation.\n\nRegulations for underwriting syndicates and related risks. Following the acquisition of XL group in 2018, we have been managing, through AXA XL Underwriting Agencies Limited, Syndicate 2003, a large underwriting syndicate at Lloyd's and, as a result of which, are exposed to a variety of Lloyd's-related regulatory risks. For instance, the Council of Lloyd's has wide discretionary powers to regulate members of Lloyd's, and may vary the method by which the capital solvency ratio is calculated, or impose additional or special levies on members. In addition, if Lloyd's fails to satisfy the FCA's and the Prudential Regulation Authority's annual solvency test in any given year, Syndicate 2003 could be required to cease or reduce underwriting through Lloyd's. A downgrading of the Lloyd's market could also impair Syndicate 2003's ability to trade in certain classes of business at current levels.

As a Lloyd's syndicate providing coverage to US policyholders and covering US risks, we could also be required by US regulators to increase the level of funding required as minimum deposits for the protection of US policyholders. Any Lloyd's-related risks could have an adverse e/ff ect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe expect the scope and extent of applicable laws and regulations, as well as regulatory oversight, to continue to increase over the coming years. While M anagement proactively manages legal and regulatory risks and has adopted policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we do business, we cannot predict with any certainty the potential effects that a change in applicable laws or regulations, their interpretation or enforcement (or of the potential e/ff ects of any new regulation or legislation in the future), or any determination we make regarding compliance with conflicting regulations, may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any failure by us to remain in compliance with regulations applicable to us could result in fines, penalties, injunctions, or other similar restrictions, any of which could negatively impact our earnings and reputation. For a description of the regulations and supervision framework applicable to the Group, please refer to Section  7.3 'General Information -/uni00A0Regulation and Supervision'  of this Annual Report.\n\nWe may also be adversely a/ff ected by a change in applicable laws or regulations, their interpretation or enforcement impacting, or regulatory decisions, authorizations or approvals relating to, third parties with which we do business. For instance, certain of our letter of credit facilities for cedants are e/ff ective only if the banks issuing the letters of credit are on the list of banks approved by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the 'NAIC'). If some or all of the issuing banks under our credit facilities cease to be NAIC approved and we are unable to replace them with NAIC approved banks, our letter of credit facility capacity could be significantly diminished, especially in situations of adverse capital and credit market conditions where the cost of replacement facilities may be significantly increased or prohibitive. Please refer to the paragraph above 'Adverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly a/ff ect our ability to meet liquidity needs, our access to capital and increase our cost of capital'.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## As a global business, we are exposed to various local political, regulatory, financial, and social risks and challenges\n\nAs a global business we are exposed to a wide variety of local political, regulatory, business, and financial risks and challenges, which may a/ff ect the demand for our products and services, the value of our investment portfolios, the levels of capital and surplus that we are required to hold, the credit quality of our counterparties and the way we are able to do business in particular countries and markets.\n\nThese risks include, for example, political, social or economic instability in the countries in which we operate, including the risk of nationalization, protectionist and nationalist measures, expropriation, price controls, capital controls, inflation, counterinflationary measures, political polarization, restrictions on foreign trade and investment (such as changes to authorized levels of foreign ownership, which may affect our ability to conduct business in certain countries through joint ventures), the imposition, or significant enhancement, of international sanctions against certain countries (such as Russia in the context of the war in Ukraine) and connected entities (which may a/ff ect our ability to exercise our rights of ownership and conduct business through joint ventures in the relevant countries as well as our ability to do business with certain counterparts),  export controls, tari/ff s and subsidies, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (especially the US Dollar), credit risks of our local borrowers and counterparties, risk of recession, lack of local business experience in certain markets, risks associated with exposure to insurance industry insolvencies through policyholder guarantee funds or similar mechanisms and, in certain cases, risks associated with the potential incompatibility with foreign partners, especially in countries in which we are conducting business through joint ventures or other entities that we do not control.\n\nThese risks also include the risk of governments, supervisors, regulators and courts in the countries in which we operate adopting policyholder-favorable stances such as the mandatory provision of certain types of coverage, restrictions on cancellation or non-renewal of policies, extension of coverage (such as by extension of scope and/or period), and the imposition of pricing constraints/obligations to ensure the a/ff ordability of coverage for policyholders, in each case resulting in a deviation from the original terms and conditions of those policies (including potentially retroactively) and a deviation in the economic balance of these insurance policies as initially agreed with the relevant policyholders.\n\nIn addition, pressures on households and social cohesion at the local or regional level in the form of reduced economic security (including as a result of inflation) and rising inequality, pressures on healthcare systems (such as those arising from the COVID-19",

These issues may be exacerbated by factors including but not limited to broader economic and financial market conditions, impacts from climate change, pandemics and infectious diseases, and geopolitical conflict and/or tensions, political polarization, protectionist and nationalist measures or trade wars.\n\nThere  can  be  no  assurance  that  any  of  the  foregoing developments will not have an adverse e/ff ect on the Group's financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## We have been and may become in the future subject to lawsuits, regulatory investigations and/or other proceedings which may a/ff ect our business, brand, reputation, relations with regulators and/or results of operations\n\nWe are a party to numerous lawsuits (both class actions and individual lawsuits) in our corporate capacity and in our capacity as an insurer/reinsurer and involved in various regulatory investigations and examinations, and other actions arising in the various jurisdictions where we and our subsidiaries do business. Please refer to Section  6.6 -/uni00A0Note/uni00A031 'Litigations'  of this Annual Report. We may be involved in similar proceedings in the future.\n\nCertain of these lawsuits and investigations seek significant or unspecified amounts of damages, including punitive damages (notably in the United States), and may involve allegations of bad-faith denials of coverage, which could potentially increase the overall amounts due, if any, in connection with such matters. C ertain of the regulatory authorities involved in these proceedings have substantial powers over the conduct and operations of our business. The introduction of a class action system in France in 2014 and similar developments in certain other European jurisdictions, as well as the adoption of Directive (EU) 2020/1828 dated November/uni00A025, 2020, on representative actions for the protection of the collective interests of consumers\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1/uni00A0RISK FACTORS\n\nat the EU level, have increased and are likely to continue to increase litigation, risks and costs. We face significant legal risks in our businesses, and the amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings, as well as the volume of claims, against global financial institutions remains high. Furthermore, the increasing number of legislative and regulatory requirements, including tighter controls and higher capital requirements, consumer protection, enhancement of regulatory requirements for the oversight and disclosure of climate, ESG and sustainable finance-related initiatives as well as social and reputational trends may expose us to additional civil, criminal or regulatory actions, investigations, proceedings or sanctions, which could restrict business or have an adverse e/ff ect on the Group. For additional information, please refer to Section/uni00A07.3 'General Information -/uni00A0Regulation and Supervision' of this Annual Report and to the paragraph below 'Increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from investors, customers, regulators, and other stakeholders regarding environmental, social and governance matters, and climate change may impact our business and results of operations'.\n\nIn addition, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the opioids crisis in the United States and the ongoing war in Ukraine, coverage lawsuits have been brought against insurers, including the AXA Group or its subsidiaries in multiple jurisdictions, many of which are ongoing. For additional information in relation to the COVID-19 claims please refer to the sub-paragraph  'COVID-19 pandemic-related judicial decisions' in the paragraph above 'The Group and our businesses are subject to extensive regulation, regulatory supervision, adverse judicial decisions, and emerging legal, regulatory, and reputational risks in the various jurisdictions in which we operate' and Section 6.6 - Note 31  ' Litigations' of this Annual Report. The extent of the reinsurance coverage on these claims may vary depending, among other things, on the resolution of the coverage issues under the primary policies. We may also be involved in proceedings with our reinsurers regarding coverage.

There has been a wideranging increase of ESG-related rules and guidance and an enhancement of disclosure regimes designed to ensure that companies are transparent about their climate and ESG-related risks, strategy, targets, and goals, and how they are organizing themselves to address ESG challenges, which expose us to new or additional risks. Several organizations that provide information to investors have developed ratings for evaluating companies on their approach to different ESG matters, and unfavorable ratings of our company or our industry may lead to negative investor sentiment and the diversion of investment to other companies or industries. In 2019 we committed to contain the 'warming potential' of our investment portfolio to below 1.5\u00b0C by 2050/uni00A0and we announced, in our 'Driving Progress 2023' strategic plan, that we intend to reduce the carbon footprint of our General Account assets ( i.e. , corporate fixed income; listed equities; real estate assets) by 20% by 2025. We have joined several net zero alliances and other initiatives and partnerships which require us to make additional commitments and set climate-related targets. If we are unable to meet these targets, standards, or expectations, whether established by us or third parties, it could result in adverse publicity, reputational harm, or loss of customer and/or investor confidence, which could adversely a/ff ect our business and results of operations. We will face additional risks, including regulatory scrutiny, climaterelated litigation and 'greenwashing' claims, if we are perceived to inadequately disclose or mislead stakeholders in respect of our climate strategy, targets and goals, the climate impact of a product or service, the actual or perceived impact of the net zero or other alliances we may be a party to, the commitments of our customers or if there is a deficiency in the controls or processes we have in place. There is also a geopolitical element to this\n\nI\n\nI\n\nrisk, as governments and regulators in di/ff erent jurisdictions take varied and o/f\\_t en divergent approaches to the energy transition. For more information about our 'Driving Progress 2023' strategic plan and AXA's sustainability strategy, please refer to Section/uni00A04.1 'AXA Group's s ustainability strategy' of this Annual Report.\n\nIn recent years, activist campaigns by shareholders, activist funds, non-governmental and other organizations, have been directed against numerous public companies. These campaigns have focused on strategic and business reorientations, changes in management and compensation, Board representation and other matters. A relatively recent development with respect to activism is ESG-focused campaigns. These initiatives seek to require companies to, among other things, disclose significant information in relation to ESG-related actions and commitments and other matters. On the other hand, in certain jurisdictions, we may also face actions by individuals, companies, governments or non-governmental organizations claiming that ESG-related commitments, activities and alliances are incompatible with investor expectations, our corporate purpose or other laws and regulations. The ESG regulatory framework is evolving rapidly and has been, and likely will continue to be, the subject of conflicting political and social objectives, which may have legal, regulatory, compliance and reputational consequences for us. Responding to any activist claims can be costly and timeconsuming and may adversely a/ff ect our business by, among other things, diverting the attention of our Board of Directors, senior management, and employees away from the execution of business strategies. These campaigns raise new and potentially substantial risks for targeted companies, and could negatively a/ff  ect our share price, reputation, and brand.\n\n## The evolving and complex regulatory environment surrounding data protection and transfer worldwide could increase our costs and adversely impact our business\n\nCollection, transfer, and protection of significant amounts of sensitive data are critical to the operation of our business. Regulations in this area are quickly evolving around the world, which could adversely a/ff ect our business if we fail to adapt our rules, internal controls, and strategy to the emerging regulatory environment.\n\nRegulation (EU) 2016/679 dated April/uni00A027, 2016, on the protection and movement of personal data (as amended, the 'GDPR') entered into force on May/uni00A025, 2018. GDPR significantly modified the EU data protection framework and, in particular, imposed new restrictions on data usage/processing (including profiling), disclosure to customers and a stronger enforcement regime,",

Similar data protection regulations to GDPR have entered into force in many other jurisdictions, including certain US states, China, Brazil, Algeria, Egypt, and Thailand. While we have adopted and regularly review a global Data Privacy Organization/Governance policy designed to manage risks related to data protection, there can be no assurance that our existing or planned data protection rules, including our privacy-related Group Binding Corporate Rules, and governance organization will not need to be updated or replaced to comply with new laws and regulations and regulatory guidance applicable in the European Union or other jurisdictions where we operate or may operate in the future.\n\nThere is a risk that data collected by the Group and its third-party service providers is not processed in accordance with notices provided to, or obligations imposed by, data subjects, regulators or other counterparties, or in compliance with applicable dataprivacy laws. The Group's IT and other systems may also in future be exposed to hacking and unauthorized intrusions, such as physical or electronic break-ins, unauthorized tampering or security breaches or other intentional or unintentional acts by parties acting from within or outside the Group, which could result in sensitive data (including customer and employee data) being stolen, lost or misused. Remote working arrangements and the accelerated digitalization of our operations may increase these threats. Negligence or failure to implement and follow internal Group policies, in particular regarding encryption of data, or to fail to perform adequate internal data collection/processing controls, may also facilitate hacking and other intrusions and result in breaches of GDPR and other applicable laws.\n\nAny failure to comply with applicable data protection laws, and data the/f\\_t , loss, or misuse, a/ff ecting any Group entity or a third-party service provider, could result in significant regulatory sanctions, penalties, injunctions or other similar restrictions, damage to our reputation, need to compensate customers, customer litigation (including class actions and individual lawsuits), and consequently have a material adverse e/ff ect on our business, results of operations and prospects.\n\nFollowing the European Union Court of Justice's decision in 2015 to invalidate the European Commission's Safe Harbor, which had allowed, under certain conditions, the transfer of personal information from EU companies to US companies, transatlantic data flows continued using other mechanisms such as standard contractual clauses between companies and binding corporate rules for transfers within multinational corporate groups. While we currently believe that we can continue using such mechanisms to transfer data to the United States and to other non-EU jurisdictions and add supplementary measures\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.1/uni00A0RISK FACTORS\n\nas required, there is no guarantee that such mechanisms will not be subject to future challenge or to stricter scrutiny by the competent authorities, or that further changes in applicable regulations will not potentially increase our legal and compliance costs, or result in regulatory sanctions or damage to our brand or reputation. In December/uni00A02022, the European Commission announced a dra/f\\_t  adequacy decision for the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (the 'EU-US DPF'), a data transfer mechanism that would replace the invalidated EU-US Privacy Shield. As with the EU-US Privacy Shield, the EU-US DPF is limited to entities subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission or Department of Transportation, though other US statutory bodies recognized by the EU may be included in future annexes of the EU-US DPF. Because of this, the AXA Group believes that it may continue to rely on standard contractual clauses and binding corporate rules as data transfer mechanisms to transfer data from the EU to the United States and other non-EU jurisdictions, but the EU-US DPF is in development and there is no guarantee that it will be approved in its current form.\n\n## Changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations or uncertainties in the interpretation of certain tax laws may result in adverse consequences to our business and our results of operations\n\nAs a global company operating in numerous jurisdictions, we are subject to various tax regimes and regulations. Changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations could result in administrative actions, litigation, higher tax expenses, payments, and compliance costs.\n\nUncertainties in the interpretation or future developments of tax regimes may a/ff ect our tax liability, return on investments and business operations. We have been and may increasingly become exposed to the risk of tax audits and investigations (both administrative and criminal) in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The international tax environment continues to change as a result of actions taken by the OECD, the European Union and national governments intended to address concerns over perceived international tax avoidance techniques. In addition, the introduction of new or more restrictive regulations related to tax matters in the countries where the Group operates could significantly increase compliance costs. For example, contemplated tax measures adopted in connection with the American Rescue Plan, resulting from the Global Anti-Base Erosion OECD initiative (aimed at ensuring that large multinational enterprise groups pay a minimum level of corporate tax), or EU VAT reform for insurance companies, could increase AXA\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

Risk Management independence and comprehensiveness:\n\n- Chief Risk O/ff icers are independent from operations (first line of defense) and Internal Audit Department (third line of defense). The Risk Management Department, together with the Compliance and Internal Control Departments, constitute the second line of defense, whose objective is to develop, coordinate and monitor a consistent risk framework across the Group;\n- 2. C ommon risk appetite framework: Chief Risk O/ff icers are responsible for ensuring that senior management reviews and approves the risks to which the relevant entity or business unit is exposed, understands the consequences of an adverse development in such risks and have action plans that can be implemented in case of unfavorable developments;\n- 3. S ystematic second opinion on key processes: Chief Risk Officers provide a systematic and independent second opinion on product approval process, reserves, reinsurance, investments and ALM and challenge on operational risks and strategic plan;\n- 4. E xtensive use of internal model based on a robust economic capital metric : the Internal Model is intended to offer a concrete and powerful tool to control and measure exposure to most risks, in line with the Solvency/uni00A0II framework. The Internal Model is designed as a consistent and comprehensive Risk Management tool, which also forms an important element in the capital management and planning process;\n- 5. P roactive Risk Management: Chief Risk Officers are responsible for early detection of risks. This is ensured through challenge of and constant dialogue with the relevant business and supported by the AXA Group's emerging Risks Management framework.\n\nGRM oversees the operating entities' adherence to the ERM, supported by the local Risk Management teams. It coordinates\n\nRisk Management for the Group, steers the local Risk Management Departments, and strives to develop a risk culture throughout the Group.\n\n## GROUP COMPLIANCE FUNCTION\n\nThe Group Compliance function is responsible for advising Executive Management and the Board of Directors on applicable compliance laws, regulations, and administrative provisions, and on the impact of regulatory change on AXA Group's operations. The Group Compliance function provides expertise, advice, and support to AXA entities to assess significant compliance matters, analyzes the major compliance risks and contributes to designing solutions to mitigate the risks to which the Group is exposed. The Group Compliance function manages a wide range of compliance related matters including (i) /uni00A0 financial crime (which includes anti-bribery and corruption, anti-money laundering  and international sanctions/embargo compliance), (ii) data privacy, (iii) /uni00A0 customer protection and conduct, (iv) compliance &/uni00A0ethics, (v) /uni00A0 the monitoring of other major compliance and regulatory risks, and (vi) /uni00A0 regular reporting of significant compliance and regulatory matters to Executive Management, the Board of Directors and regulators.\n\nThe Group Chief Compliance O/ff icer reports to the Group Deputy Chief Executive O/ff icer &/uni00A0Group General Secretary.\n\nThe compliance activities within the Group are set out in a number of standards and policies which set the minimum requirements expected to be achieved by AXA entities and their Compliance functions.\n\nThe compliance section of the Group Standards contains standards and policies on significant risk areas affecting compliance activities and sets out the high-level controls and monitoring principles to which the entities must adhere. Adherence  to  the  Standards  and  Policies  (Compliance Governance, Anti-Money Laundering, Sanctions, Anti-Bribery, Cross Border, Data Privacy) is mandatory.

It is designed to ensure that AXA continues to provide its customers with suitable advice, products, and services to meet their needs. It will be rolled out across the Group in 2023.\n\nThe  Group  Compliance  function  undertakes  an  annual Compliance Risk Assessment exercise  which requires entities to identify the most significant compliance risks to which they are exposed. Based on this assessment an Annual Compliance Plan is developed for the following year. Using the same methodology and to comply with the French extraterritorial law (Sapin/uni00A0II) and ACPR requirements, a separate Anti-Bribery and Corruption Risk Assessment and Anti-Money Laundering Risk Assessment have also been implemented across AXA entities. These risk assessments enable entities to identify in a more granular manner the associated risks.\n\nThe Group Compliance function has implemented a number of monitoring processes. For example, the Compliance In-Depth Review (CIDR) which is an ongoing program of structured onsite Compliance reviews conducted by the Group Compliance Department to AXA Group Companies worldwide. The main purpose of these reviews is to measure adherence to the Group Standards and Policies, to define improvement action plans, to provide experienced advice, including on compliance technical aspects, and to rate the entity's maturity level against other Group companies. This program was introduced in 2009/uni00A0using a risk-based approach. In 2022, the backlog of CIDRs created by the travel restrictions imposed following the COVID-19 crisis was fully caught-up.\n\nOn a regular basis, the Group Compliance function reports to the Group Audit Risk &/uni00A0Compliance Committee, the Audit Committee, and the Board of Directors (as required) on significant compliance matters. These include major regulatory changes that have compliance implications, results of the Compliance Risk Assessment, and any other significant issues that require escalation.\n\n## GROUP INTERNAL CONTROL FUNCTION\n\nTo further strengthen its control environment, the AXA Group established in 2017/uni00A0a centralized Internal Control function within the second line of defense independent from business operations. The Group Head of Internal Control is reporting to the Group Head of Operational Risk and Internal Control. The Group Internal Control Department is responsible for the development of a standardized methodology and framework for internal control and for oversight of its implementation in the AXA Group's subsidiaries. For more information on the internal control at local level, please refer to the paragraph 'Risk Management and internal control at local level' below.\n\nThe Internal Control framework of the AXA Group:\n\n- /uni25A0 is based on the principle of proportionality and takes into account the nature, scale and complexity of the entities' operations;\n- /uni25A0 is aligned with the COSO 'Internal Control/uni00A0-/uni00A0Integrated Framework' of the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Tradeway Commission;\n\nI\n\nI\n\n- /uni25A0 is an integral part of the Risk Management thus providing the Executive Management with a view of the risk and control environment;\n- /uni25A0 is underpinned by the Group Internal Control Standard and Group Solvency/uni00A0II Internal Control Policy, first approved by the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors of AXA/uni00A0SA in December/uni00A02017;\n- /uni25A0 encompasses Internal Financial Control, implemented since 2010/uni00A0to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting (ICOFR), and extended to Solvency/uni00A0II in 2014/uni00A0to contribute to the Internal Model validation process. For more information on Internal Financial Control, please refer to the paragraphs 'Financial reporting, disclosure, controls and procedures' and 'Internal Model validation' below.\n\nOn a regular basis, the Group internal control reports to the Group Operational and Information Audit, Risk, Compliance Committee and to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\n## Third line of defense: Group Internal Audit function\n\nThe Group's Internal Audit function provides the Group Audit Committee and the Group's Management Committee with independent and objective assurance on the e/ff ectiveness of the overall control environment across the Group.\n\nThe Global Head of Internal Audit reports to the Chair of the AXA Group Audit Committee and to the Group Deputy Chief Executive O/ff  icer and General Secretary.\n\nAll Internal Audit teams across the Group report to the Global Head of Internal Audit whilst also having a direct and unfettered reporting line to their local Audit Committee Chair and an administrative reporting line within their local management structure.\n\nThe Group's Internal Audit function exists to help the Board and Executive Management protect the assets, reputation, and sustainability of the organization by providing an independent and objective assurance activity designed to add value and improve the organization's operations. It helps the organization meet its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to challenge Executive Management and evaluate the e/ff ectiveness of Risk Management, control, and governance processes.\n\nGroup Internal Audit sets an annual plan of work, based on an assessment of both the inherent risk and the adequacy of controls as well as consideration of the audit cycle. The plan is formally reviewed, and its performance formally monitored by the Group Audit Committee.\n\nOver the audit cycle, all applicable audit universe components for each entity are expected to be audited. Any exceptions identified are notified to the Audit Committee.\n\nA report is issued at the conclusion of each audit assignment to the relevant senior management. The results of the audits and resolution status of internal audit issues are presented to the relevant Audit Committee and Executive Management Committee on a regular basis.",

The Audit Committees have a critical role in reviewing financial results and other financial information prepared by the management of these subsidiaries, financial reporting and control processes, critical accounting policies, specific accounting issues, key risks, and systems of internal control, fraud, and similar issues.\n\nIn addition, the Group has established Standards that apply to AXA/uni00A0SA and entities (including Joint ventures) where AXA has the majority of the voting rights or has a minority interest but exercises control through other means such as management. They are mandatory for all entities (including AXA/uni00A0SA) within scope unless otherwise indicated. The Standards focus on critical requirements and form part of the overall Risk Management framework which allow the Group to have a clear understanding of risks, both locally and Group-wide.\n\nChief Executive O/ff icers are required to certify annually to the Group Chief Executive O/ff icer that to the best of their knowledge their entities comply with the Standards. Entity Boards must be formally informed of the Annual Certifications, together with any material breaches, areas of non-compliance and corresponding mitigation plans in order to monitor progress of remedial actions.\n\nPlease note that in the following paragraphs AXA/uni00A0SA is included within the scope of local entities.\n\nRisk Management: Risk Management is a local responsibility, in accordance with GRM standards and guidelines. The roles and responsibilities of local Risk Management teams are validated jointly by the Executive Committees of local entities and the Group Chief Risk O/ff icer to ensure the alignment of central and local interests.\n\nThe minimum missions required for local Risk Management teams are:\n\n- /uni25A0 coordinating the second line of defense locally (which covers among others Compliance, Internal Control, Security) through a specific system of governance framework;\n- /uni25A0 ensuring that the risk appetite is implemented with respect to all risks consistently with the Group's risk appetite, with enhanced reporting, risk limits and decision processes;\n- /uni25A0 providing a second opinion on key processes, such as the definition of characteristics for new products before launch, reserves, ALM studies &/uni00A0asset allocation and reinsurance strategies;\n- /uni25A0 with respect to the Internal Model, Risk Management checking the adequacy of the local risk profile, and implementing, testing and validating the Internal Model.\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.2/uni00A0INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\nLocal Chief Risk O/ff icers head the local Risk Management teams within each operational entity, and report both to their local Chief Executive O/ff icer and to the Group Chief Risk O/ff icer. They are independent from operations and Internal Audit Departments. Local Chief Risk O/ff icers regularly report to the local Board of Directors (or to a sub-Committee) on Risk Management matters.\n\nTheir teams are responsible for controlling and managing risks within Group policies and limits, and for validating investment or underwriting decisions through local Risk Committees. The Group Chief Risk O/ff icer chairs the Chief Risk O/ff icers' meeting composed of the Chief Risk O/ff icers of AXA's main subsidiaries, which meets on a quarterly basis and have monthly calls.\n\nInternal Control : Internal Control is a local responsibility in accordance with the Internal Control Standard and Policy. Entities are expected to:\n\n- /uni25A0 define and document their controls and control procedures covering all important risks and processes (First line responsibility);\n- /uni25A0 regularly verify and challenge the e/ff ectiveness of the control environment (Second line responsibility);\n- /uni25A0 implement a comprehensive monitoring and reporting on internal control deficiencies at a senior level of the organization to ensure that these are rectified in an adequate and timely manner.\n\nLocal Heads of Internal Control (or equivalent) are independent from operations and report preferably to their local Chief Risk O/ff  icer. Local Heads of Internal Control (or equivalent) regularly report to the local Risk Committee and to their local Audit Committee on Internal Control matters.\n\nCompliance: the local Compliance functions are expected to undertake an annual Compliance Risk Assessment to identify the major compliance risks to which the business is exposed. Based on the Compliance Risk Assessment, an Annual Compliance Plan must be developed at the end of each year for the following year. The local Compliance function must directly report on a regular basis to local senior management and the local Audit Committee (or equivalent body), on significant compliance matters, including key compliance risks, major regulatory changes that have compliance implications, the Annual Compliance Plan, outstanding Compliance In-Depth Review action points and any other significant issues that require escalation.\n\nActuarial function: the local Actuarial function holders report both to local Finance, Risk, or the Chief Executive O/ff icer and to the Group Actuarial function holder.

This tool is managed and updated by a dedicated team. This system is also used to deliver the management reporting information and the Solvency/uni00A0II Own Funds. The process through which this management reporting information and the Solvency/uni00A0II Own Funds are produced and validated is the same as the one used to prepare consolidated financial information.\n\n## Operating control mechanisms\n\nAt entity level, AXA's subsidiaries are responsible for recording and controlling accounting and financial data that comply with the AXA Group Accounting Manual and reflect consolidation rules under IFRS accounting standards. In this respect, the Chief Financial O/ff icer of each entity signs o/ff  on the accuracy of their respective contribution to the consolidated figures reported through 'Magnitude' and their compliance with both the AXA Group Accounting Manual and instructions in all frameworks produced (IFRS, European Embedded Value, actuarial indicators, and Solvency/uni00A0II Own Funds) within the internal financial control program.\n\nAt PBRC level, accounting, financial and economic information reported by entities are analyzed by teams that liaise with subsidiaries on a full-time basis. In particular, these teams analyze the compliance with the AXA Group Accounting Manual and Group actuarial standards.",

It is designed to ensure consistency and quality in AXA Group's financial reporting and provide an overall framework for the annual IFC program precising the scope of application and governance.\n\nThe entities in IFC scope are required to document their significant processes and key controls, as well as the rationale of how the associated risk of material misstatement due to error or fraud can be reduced to an acceptable level. This is performed under the supervision of the Chief Financial O/ff icer, sponsor of the IFC program. The independent Internal Financial Control function, anchored within Risk Management for most entities, is in charge of testing the design and operational e/ff ectiveness of those key controls, and ensuring that identified control deficiencies are remediated.\n\nAt each year-end, the in-scope entities must perform an evaluation of their ICOFR as part of an internal certification process, involving formal sign-o/ff  by process owners and with a formal management report from the entity's Chief Financial O/ff icer and Chief Risk O/ff icer stating their conclusion as to the e/ff  ectiveness of the entity's ICOFR.\n\n## Disclosure controls and procedures\n\nThe Group has implemented a formal internal review and sign-o/ff process pursuant to which all Management Committee members, Chief Financial O/ff icers and certain other senior executives are required to certify various matters covered in AXA's Universal Registration Document.\n\nThis process is based on the following four pillars:\n\n- 1. Chief Financial Officer Sign-Off Certificates, which are required to be submitted by all local Chief Financial O/ff icers to PBRC, together with the required subsidiary financial reporting and consolidation information;\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.2/uni00A0INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n- 2. IFC Management reports are required to be submitted by the Chief Financial O/ff icer or another senior executive of every in-scope entity, as part of the IFC program dedicated to ICOFR;\n- 3. Disclosure Controls &/uni00A0Procedures certificates, which are required to be submitted by AXA's Management Committee members, Chief Financial O/ff icers and certain other senior executives pursuant to which each of these executives is required to review the Group's Universal Registration Document and formally certify (i) /uni00A0 the accuracy and completeness of the information in the Annual Report with respect to the companies under his/her responsibility, and (ii) /uni00A0the e/ff  ectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures and ICOFR at companies under his/her responsibility (with specific disclosure of any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses). In addition, as part of this 'sub-certification' process, these executives are required to review and comment on a number of cross-sectional disclosures in the Universal Registration Document relating to risk and other matters;\n- 4. Chief Financial Officer Sign-Off certificates on the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements: PBRC provides Chief Financial O/ff icers with the contribution of the entities under their responsibility to the Consolidated Financial Statements in order to facilitate their certification on the accuracy and completeness of the information in the Universal Registration Document of the Group.\n\nFor further information, please refer to Appendix/uni00A0I 'Management's annual evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting' of this Annual Report.\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\nThe Group has established a comprehensive system of Internal Control procedures and mechanisms that management believes appropriate and adapted to its business and the global scale of its operations.\n\nHowever, all Internal Control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations and cannot provide absolute certainty or guarantee against the materialization of risks and control failures. Even systems determined to be e/ff ective by the management may not prevent or detect all human errors, all system malfunctions, all fraud, or all misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

At Group level, the Group Chief Risk O/ff icer is responsible for developing the ORSA policy, implementing the ORSA process and coordinating the ORSA reporting.\n\nThe ORSA policy defines minimum standards for assessing and reporting own risks and Solvency to be applied across the Group. Adherence to this policy is expected to be promoted and monitored by all entity heads of Risk Management Department (Chief Risk O/ff icers).\n\nThe Group ORSA report is reviewed annually by the Solvency/uni00A0II Committee and presented, first, to the ARCC, and then to the Audit and the Finance & Risk Committees, before being submitted to the Board of Directors, which approves the conclusions of the Group ORSA report and authorizes its filing with the ACPR.\n\nBeyond the annual ORSA report, a quarterly assessment is performed to update the Group's risk profile against Risk Appetite limits and adapt management actions accordingly. This information is reported to the ARCC which regularly reviews all material audit, risk and compliance issues faced by the Group and to the Finance &/uni00A0Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.\n\n## PURPOSE AND CONTENT\n\nORSA encompasses processes to identify, assess, monitor, manage and report the short to medium term risks to which the Group is exposed and to ensure the adequacy of the level of own funds within the Group Solvency targets, taking into account the Group's risk profile, as well as approved risk appetite limits and business strategy. As an important component of the Risk Management system, it is intended to give a comprehensive and complete vision of the risks embedded in the businesses of the Group on a continuous basis.\n\n## (1)\n\nORSA mainly encompasses Risk Management and financial activities, which are organized around the following processes:\n\n- /uni25A0 Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) &/uni00A0Eligible Own Funds (EOF) quarterly calculation;\n- /uni25A0 liquidity risk reporting;\n- /uni25A0 strategic planning and financial projections;\n- /uni25A0 risk appetite process;\n- /uni25A0 stress and scenario testing analysis and monitoring; and\n- /uni25A0 reputation, regulatory, emerging and strategic risk assessment and review.\n\nThe ORSA report provides an assessment on:\n\n- /uni25A0 the overall Solvency needs through the measurement of quantifiable risks considering risk mitigation actions implemented in current economic context and approved business strategy and within approved risk appetite limits. Stress scenario analyses are performed to ensure adequacy of the economic capital assessed. This is supported by the Enterprise Risk Management system, including the identification,  monitoring  and  management  of  nonquantifiable risks;\n- /uni25A0 the compliance, on a continuous basis, with (i) /uni00A0 regulatory capital requirements, through the assessment of the ability to meet capital requirements using the approved Internal Model, in compliance with the Solvency/uni00A0II regulatory standard, as well as (ii) /uni00A0 requirements regarding technical provisions. Stress scenario analyses are performed to ensure adequacy of the economic capital assessed. Also, the extensive use of the Internal Model outputs for key decision-making processes provides a feedback loop for improving the modelling according to the evolution of the risk profile;\n- /uni25A0 the significance with which the risk profile of the AXA Group deviates from the assumptions underlying the SCR calculated on the basis of the Internal Model. Extensive validation tests are performed to assess the relevance of the Internal Model and the model error. Limitations of the Internal Model and evolution plan resulting from the validation activities are presented.\n\nI\n\nI",

The internal model of the Group (the 'Internal Model') is used in its Risk Management systems and decisionmaking processes. The ACPR has approved the use by the Group of its Internal Model to calculate its SCR since Solvency/uni00A0II is in force. The Internal Model encompasses the use of AXA Group's economic capital model on all material entities.\n\nAXA continues to review regularly the scope, underlying methodologies and assumptions of the Internal Model and will adjust its SCR accordingly. In addition, AXA's Internal Model has been and may be revised from time to time in accordance with applicable regulations. However, any major change to the Internal Model would be subject to the prior approval of the ACPR, which may require adjustments to the level of SCR. In addition, the Group monitors EIOPA's work program which, through its objectives, is also expected to continue to carry out consistency reviews of European insurers' internal models. Such review may lead to further regulatory changes to increase convergence and to strengthen oversight of cross-border groups, as well as changes to internal models and Solvency/uni00A0II capital requirements.\n\nThe Group's main goal in using its Internal Model as opposed to the Solvency/uni00A0II standard formula is to better reflect the Group's risk profile in its SCR. This is reflected through several objectives:\n\n- /uni25A0 taking into account local specificities -/uni00A0the Group is a global company, and caters to a wide range of insurance markets with a variety of products o/ff ered targeting certain demographics and with di/ff ering risk exposures. It is therefore appropriate, to the extent possible, to calibrate stresses specific for these risk profiles and to allow for the benefits of diversification of risks which arise as a result of being spread over these markets;\n- /uni25A0 addressing shortcomings inherent to the standard formula\n- - based on its expertise, the Group can improve on the\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.2/uni00A0INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\napproach of the standard formula (which is naturally constrained by its general scope, and which does not cover all measurable risks) and have models more appropriate to the scope of the Group; and\n\n- /uni25A0 allowing for better evolution of the model over time -/uni00A0as the Group's experience increases, business expands to new markets and product innovations create di/ff erent risks to consider, the flexibility of an internal model allows the specificities of these developments to be reflected.\n\nThe Internal Model is based on a common definition of risks used consistently throughout the Group. It aims to ensure that the Company risk mapping is comprehensive and is followed in a consistent way across the Company and that e/ff icient procedures and reporting are in place so that roles and responsibilities are allocated to identify, measure, monitor, manage and report key risks.\n\nThe Group risk grid/uni00A0 (2) aims to identify all material risks applicable to the Company's insurance businesses. The Internal Model is intended to capture all material risks to which the Group is exposed from the risk assessment performed at sub-risk level to the overall aggregation of risk categories.\n\nThe underlying methodologies and assumptions used in the economic capital model are regularly reviewed to ensure that they accurately reflect the AXA Group's risk profile and new methods are developed and integrated regularly (in accordance with the Internal Model change policy).\n\nThe SCR, calculated on the basis of the Internal Model, represents the value at risk of Group EOF at the 99.5 th /uni00A0percentile over a oneyear horizon. In other words, the Solvency Capital Requirement is the capital needed to sustain an extreme shock likely to occur with a 0.5% probability ( i.e., a 1/uni00A0in 200/uni00A0years event). It aims at including all material quantifiable risks (market, credit, insurance and operational) and reflecting the Group's diversified profile.\n\nIn addition to the risks that impact the SCR through the Internal Model calculation, the Group also monitors its liquidity risk, reputation risk, strategic risk, and regulatory risks as well as emerging threats.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

The Solvency/uni00A0II Committee is supported by risk technical working groups reviewing changes proposed to the Internal Model and presenting conclusions of these diligences to the Solvency/uni00A0II\n\nCommittee. The Solvency/uni00A0II Committee also reviews the Internal Model validation and model change processes and liaises with local governance. It also reviews the conclusions of the regular validation activities.\n\n## INTERNAL MODEL VALIDATION\n\nThe Group has implemented and documented a validation process of its Internal Model to monitor its performance and continued adequacy. This process and associated governance are documented in the Group validation policy, endorsed by the ARCC.\n\nThe  Group  validation  policy  is  supplemented  by  local validation policies specifying the local validation activities and responsibilities.\n\nValidation does not only apply to the quantitative aspects of the model (input data, theory &/uni00A0methodology, parameters &/uni00A0 assumptions,  data,  results)  but  also  encompasses the qualitative aspects of the model: expert judgment, documentation, model governance, use test, systems/IT.\n\nRisk Management performs regular integrated validation activities, described in the Internal Model validation policy, mostly organized around:\n\n- /uni25A0 validation of the model structure, modelling choices, parameters, and assumptions; and\n- /uni25A0 validation of the Solvency Capital Requirement calculation and results.\n\nThese tasks are performed mostly within the Risk Management Departments in charge of the model, through controls and validation activities using validation tools such as sensitivity tests, back testing, scenario testing, and stability analysis and any other relevant activity.\n\nThese validation procedures are complemented by independent challenge and validation of assumptions, key parameters, and results through Committees (including assumptions Committees, calibration Committees and clearance Committees) intended to provide an adequate level of expertise and seniority.\n\nIn  particular,  Group  Risk  Management  teams  provide independent testing of the local model choices, local parameters, assumptions, or calibration as well as local results.\n\nApart from this fully integrated validation, sanctioned by the Group Chief Risk O/ff icer's review and sign-o/ff , a comprehensive independent review process has been defined and implemented to provide adequate comfort to AXA Group management and Board of Directors that the model and its outputs meet a 'fit for purpose' standard.\n\nI\n\nI",

Such independent opinion is provided based on FY2022 process and results, at Group and local levels.\n\nAt the end of the annual validation process, the Board of Directors is provided with a report summarizing the conclusions of the internal review by Risk Management and the conclusion of the independent review by IMR and IFC as well as a review by independent third parties as aforementioned.\n\n## Governance of investment strategy and Asset Liability Management (ALM)\n\nThe AXA Group, as an insurance group, follows an investment strategy mainly driven by Asset Liability Management (ALM). The overall objectives of all investment decisions made within the Group are to meet its obligations and commitments to policyholders, to protect the solvency of the Group's entities, and to generate superior return over time.\n\n## GENERAL INVESTMENT GOVERNANCE\n\nThe Group Chief Investment O/ff icer (Group CIO) heads the Groupwide community of local insurance companies CIOs, the central Investment &/uni00A0ALM Department, and reports to the Group Chief Financial O/ff icer. In particular, he is responsible for aligning AXA's investment strategy with the Group's broader strategy, including its commitments to responsible investment, promoting better cooperation between entities, improving the strategy and investment methodology and steering investment decisions.\n\nLocal investment &/uni00A0ALM activities are steered by local CIOs. Local CIOs manage local portfolios, aiming at an optimized riskreturn ratio, maintain reporting lines to the Group, and manage close relationships with asset managers and local stakeholders. Moreover, they are responsible for the investment performance and for implementing and executing a sound Asset Liability Management.\n\n## GROUP AND LOCAL GOVERNANCE BODIES\n\nIn order to e/ff iciently coordinate local and global investment processes, decisions within the Group's investment community are taken by two main governance bodies:\n\n- /uni25A0 the Group Investment Committee, which is chaired by the Group Chief Financial Officer. This Committee defines the Group's investment strategy, steers tactical asset allocation, evaluates new investment opportunities and monitors the Group's investment performance; and\n- /uni25A0 the Group Financial Risk Committee is co-chaired by the Group Chief Financial O/ff icer and the Group Chief Risk O/ff icer. The Group Chief Investment O/ff icer is also member of this Committee (please refer to the paragraph 'Audit Risk and Compliance Committee' above).\n\nAt the entity level, each insurance company has a local Investment and ALM Committee whose terms of reference are approved by the local Executive Committees.\n\nThese Committees are responsible for, inter alia, defining the entity's Strategic Asset Allocation, approving, and monitoring investments, meeting local compliance obligations, and reviewing the participation in investment proposals syndicated by the Group, as well as local investment proposals.\n\n## ALM STUDIES AND STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION\n\nALM aims to match assets with the liabilities generated by the sale of insurance policies. The objective is to define the optimal asset allocation so that all liabilities can be met with the highest degree of confidence while maximizing the expected investment return.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.2/uni00A0INTERNAL CONTROL AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5",

They use methodologies and modelling tools that develop deterministic and stochastic scenarios, embedding policyholders' behavior considerations for the liabilities, financial market evolution for the assets and taking into account existing interaction between the two. This process aims at maximizing expected returns given a defined level of risk. Furthermore, a series of additional constraints are taken into account, such as Solvency/uni00A0II economic capital model considerations, earnings stability, protection of the solvency margin, preservation of liquidity, as well as local and consolidated capital adequacy and requirement.\n\nALM constraints are also taken into account when new insurance products are being designed as part of the product approval process (see Section/uni00A05.6 'Insurance risks -/uni00A0Product approval' of this Annual Report).\n\nAt the entity level, the strategic asset allocation issued from the ALM study must be reviewed by local Risk Management, and verified against predefined risk appetite limits, before being approved by the local Investment and ALM Committee.\n\n## INVESTMENT APPROVAL PROCESS\n\nInvestment opportunities, like non-standard investments, new strategies, or new structures, are subject to an Investment Approval Process (IAP) in line with the third pillar of the Group Risk Management principles which provides for a systematic second opinion on key processes. The IAP ensures key characteristics of the investment are analyzed, such as risk and return expectations, experience and expertise of the investment management teams, as well as accounting, tax, legal and reputational issues.\n\nThe IAP is completed at Group level for any significant investment, depending on the investment size and the number of entities participating in it. The successful completion of an IAP is done a/f\\_t er the production of a second independent opinion by Group Risk Management. The IAP is used and completed at local level to cover local regulatory characteristics (including tax and statutory accounting).\n\nLocal IAP is also run for investments in new asset classes for local entities under the same principles.\n\n## GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK FOR/uni00A0DERIVATIVES\n\nProducts involving hedging programs based on derivative instruments are designed and executed with the support of dedicated teams at AXA Investment Managers and AXA/uni00A0SA. In a similar way, this set-up ensures that all entities benefit from technical expertise, legal protection, and good execution of such transactions within the following governance framework for derivatives.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nDerivative strategies are reviewed by local Investment and ALM Committees. In addition, there is a segregation of duties between those responsible for making investment decisions, executing transactions, processing trades, and instructing the custodian. This segregation of duties aims in particular at avoiding conflicts of interest.\n\nThe market risks arising from derivatives are regularly monitored taking into account the Group's various constraints (such as risk appetite and Internal Model).\n\nSuch monitoring is designed to ensure market risks, arising from cash or derivative instruments, are properly controlled and remain within approved limits.\n\nLegal risk is addressed by defining a standardized master agreement. The Group's business units may trade derivatives only if they are covered by legal documentation which complies with the requirements set out in the Group standards. Any change to certain mandatory provisions defined in the Group standards must be approved by GRM.\n\nAdditionally, there is a centralized counterparty risk policy. GRM has established rules on authorized counterparties, minimum requirements regarding collateral and counterparty exposure limits.\n\nThe operational risk related to derivatives is measured and managed in the context of the Group's global operational risk framework. Furthermore, execution and management of derivatives are centralized within dedicated teams, reducing the AXA Group's operational risk.\n\nValuation Risk is also addressed through the use of dedicated teams, within the Group's asset managers and banks. They independently counter-valuate the derivatives positions so as to achieve appropriate accounting, payment, and collateral management. They also challenge the prices proposed by counterparties in the event that the applicable AXA entity wishes to initiate, terminate, or restructure derivatives. Such capacity in pricing requires strong expertise, which relies on rigorous market analysis and the ability to follow the most up-to-date market developments for new derivatives instruments.\n\n## INVESTMENT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT\n\nFor a large proportion of its assets, the Group utilizes the services of asset managers to invest in the market:\n\n- /uni25A0 local AXA companies assign the day-to-day management of their asset portfolios primarily to AXA's Asset Management subsidiary, namely AXA Investment Managers. Local CIOs continuously monitor, analyze, and challenge asset managers' performances; and\n- /uni25A0 in order to benefit from a more asset-specific and/or geographical expertise, the Group may also decide to invest through external asset managers. In such event, thorough due diligence analyses are performed by the Investment and the Risk Management communities, and a continuous monitoring is implemented at both Group and Local levels.",

This risk can be significant for long-tail businesses but is managed through regular pricing adjustments or specific protections against peaks of inflation.\n\nThe Group policies implemented to manage these risks are tailored to each product type and their related risks .\n\nThe main market risks to which the AXA Group is exposed are the following:\n\n- /uni25A0 interest-rate risk, spread risk and equity risk related to the operating activities of Group subsidiaries;\n- /uni25A0 exchange-rate risk related to the operating activities of Group subsidiaries; and\n- /uni25A0 risks relating to the management of holding companies' exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and debt.\n\nAXA Group's exposure to market risks is covered by AXA Group's Solvency Capital Requirement metric, as detailed in the paragraph 'Internal Model' in Section/uni00A05.2 'Internal Control and Risk Management' of this Annual Report and is taken into account in AXA's Liquidity Risk Management framework (please refer to Section/uni00A05.5 'Liquidity Risk' of this Annual Report).\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

This approach aims to allow a swift reaction in an accurate and targeted manner to changes in financial markets, political and economic environments in which the Group operates.\n\nA wide variety of Risk Management techniques are used to control and mitigate the market risks to which the Group is exposed. These techniques, used primarily in all operating subsidiaries, include:\n\n- /uni25A0 local risk appetite governance and processes, including functional limits on market risks defined locally and approved by the local Board or Executive Committee;\n- /uni25A0 Asset Liability Management (ALM), i.e., defining an optimal strategic asset allocation with respect to the liabilities' structure in order to reduce the risk to a desired level;\n- /uni25A0 a  disciplined  investment  process,  requiring  for  any sophisticated investment a formal thorough analysis by the Investment Department, and a second opinion by Risk Management;\n- /uni25A0 hedging of financial risks when they exceed the tolerance levels set by the Group. Operational management of derivatives is based on stringent rules and is mainly performed by AXA/uni00A0SA for the holding company activities and AXA Investment Managers for operating units;\n- /uni25A0 a regular monitoring of the financial risks on the Group Solvency/uni00A0II ratio; and\n- /uni25A0 reinsurance which also o/ff ers solutions to mitigate certain financial risks.\n\nI\n\nAs regards the market risks relating to the management of holding companies' foreign exchange and interest rates exposure, the following Risk Management measures have been defined and implemented.\n\nFor the purpose of optimizing the financial management and control of financial risks linked to AXA/uni00A0SA and its sub-holding companies, the Group Corporate Finance and Treasury Department has defined a methodology to monitor and assess financial risks.\n\nThe policy on the management of holding companies' interest rate risk aims at monitoring and limiting the potential mediumterm variation in interest expenses and consequently at partially protecting future levels of interest expenses against movements in interest rates. Regarding foreign exchange risk, the implemented policy's objective is to limit variations in net foreign currency-denominated assets resulting from movements in exchange rates. The purpose of the policy is therefore to protect partially the value of AXA's net foreign-currency investments in its subsidiaries to the extent of the following year's foreseeable dividends and more generally the exposure of AXA SA's liquidity to FX movements.\n\nAXA regularly monitors its exchange rate hedging strategy and will continue to review its e/ff ectiveness and the potential need to adapt it taking into account impacts on earnings, value, solvency, gearing ratio and liquidity.\n\nThe Group Corporate Finance and Treasury Department is in charge of producing reporting data that consolidate interest rate, foreign exchange, and liquidity risk exposures, as well as the interest expenses of AXA/uni00A0SA and its sub-holdings. This reporting also includes medium-term forecasts.\n\nSynthetic reports, including information about hedging strategies, are sent to, and reviewed by the Finance &/uni00A0Risk Committee of AXA's Board of Directors five times a year.",

This aggregate however reflects the IFRS accounting value of liabilities and not their economic value which is better reflected within Solvency/uni00A0II EOF.\n\nThe main elements of the reconciliation between the IFRS TNAV and the group EOF Unrestricted Tier/uni00A01 are as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 deduction of \u20ac5.0/uni00A0billion of foreseeable dividends to be paid to shareholders in 2023 of \u20ac3.9/uni00A0billion and provisions for the share buy-back of \u20ac1.1/uni00A0billion;\n- /uni25A0 addition of \u20ac34.8/uni00A0billion reflecting the Solvency/uni00A0II technical provision adjustments corresponding to the adjustment from IFRS reserves to best estimate liabilities (\u20ac+43.3/uni00A0billion) and the risk margin net of tax (\u20ac-8.4/uni00A0billion); and\n- /uni25A0 other adjustments between IFRS TNAV and group EOF Unrestricted Tier/uni00A01 (\u20ac-0.8/uni00A0billion);\n- /uni25A0 Group EOF are then the sum of Unrestricted Tier/uni00A01, Restricted Tier/uni00A01, Tier/uni00A02, and Tier/uni00A03.\n\nInformation on the group EOF is disclosed in the 'Embedded Value &/uni00A0Solvency/uni00A0II Own Funds Report 2022' which is available on AXA Group website (www.axa.com).\n\nThe sensitivities of the EOF to changes in major economic assumptions were calculated as follows for the 2022 values:\n\n- /uni25A0 upward shift of 50/uni00A0basis points in reference rates simulates a sudden shock to the initial conditions. This means changes to: 1) the current market values of fixed-interest assets, with related possible changes to projected capital gains/losses and/or fee revenues, 2) future reinvestment rates for all asset classes, and 3) discount rates. The change is applied to the reference interest rates, including the volatility adjuster were applied in the base case. Inflation rates, the volatility on interest rates and the Ultimate Forward Rates are not changed;\n- /uni25A0 downward shift of 50/uni00A0basis points in reference rates is the same as above but with a shi/f\\_t  downward;\n- /uni25A0 25% higher value of equity markets simulates a shock to the initial conditions for equities only. Listed equities and private equity values including the impact of equity hedges are shocked. This means changes to current market values of all these equities excluding hedge funds, with related possible changes to projected capital gains/losses and/or fee revenues;\n- /uni25A0 25% lower value of equity markets : same methodology as mentioned above assuming a decrease.\n\n| L&S EOF sensitivities   | 2022 EOF (in Euro million)   | 2022 EOF (in percentage)   |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Closing amount          | 43,729                       | 100%                       |\n| Interest rates +50bps   | 1,041                        | 2%                         |\n| Interest rates -50bps   | (1,426)                      | (3%)                       |\n| Equity markets +25%     | 2,591                        | 6%                         |\n| Equity markets -25%     | (2,553)                      | (6%)                       |\n\n| P&C EOF sensitivities   | 2022 EOF (in Euro million)   | 2022 EOF (in percentage)   |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Closing amount          | 30,044                       | 100%                       |\n| Interest rates +50bps   | 138                          | 0%                         |\n| Interest rates -50bps   | (160)                        | (1%)                       |\n| Equity markets +25%     | 1,236                        | 4%                         |\n| Equity markets -25%     | (1,148)                      | (4%)                       |\n\nI\n\nI",

However, this classical pattern is not followed everywhere, as for certain type of business with significantly low interest rate guarantees, the EOF behaves more like a portfolio of fixedincome assets.

Given the nature of its core business activities, AXA Group monitors three major types of counterparties, using methods suitable to each type:\n\n- /uni25A0 investment portfolios held by the Group's insurance operations (excluding assets backing separate-account products where\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe financial risk is borne by policyholders) as well as by banks and holding companies;\n\n- /uni25A0 receivables from reinsurers resulting from reinsurance ceded by the AXA Group; and\n- /uni25A0 credit and credit-sensitive exposures on third party obligors stemming  from  some  Group  insurance  and  assumed reinsurance businesses.\n\nAXA Group's exposure to credit risk is covered by AXA Group's Solvency Capital Requirement metric, as detailed in the paragraph 'Internal Model' in the Section/uni00A05.2 'Internal Control and Risk Management' of this Annual Report and is taken into account in AXA's liquidity Risk Management framework (please refer to Section/uni00A05.5 'Liquidity risks' of this Annual Report).\n\n## I Risk control and risk mitigation\n\nFor more information on the AXA Group's risk controls and Risk Management processes, please refer to Section/uni00A05.2 'Internal Control and Risk Management' of this Annual Report.\n\nIn addition, AXA Group's investment strategy, which is mainly driven by Asset Liability Management, aims to meet the Group's obligations and commitments to policyholders, and to protect the solvency of the Group and of its entities (please refer to paragraph 'Governance of investment strategy and Asset Liability Management (ALM)' in Section/uni00A05.2 'Internal Control and Risk Management' of this Annual Report).\n\nA specific set of limits take into account all AXA Group exposures on a given ultimate shareholder through debt securities, cash, equity, derivatives, reinsurance receivables, insurance and assumed reinsurance commitments. They aim at managing globally the default risk of a given counterparty.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## INVESTED ASSETS: A CENTRAL MONITORING OF COUNTERPARTY EXPOSURE\n\nAXA Group concentration risk is monitored by di/ff erent analyses performed at Group level by issuer and ultimate shareholder, in addition to local procedures and by a set of Group and local issuer limits.\n\nThese limits aim at managing the default risk of a given issuer, depending on its rating and on the maturity and seniority of all bonds issued by the issuer and held by the AXA Group (corporate, Government agency and sub sovereign).\n\nOn sovereign exposures, specific limits have also been defined on government bonds and government-guaranteed bonds.\n\nCompliance with the limits is ensured by the Group through defined governance. The Group Credit Risk Committee handles, on a monthly basis, the issuer exposure breaches to the Group's limits and determines coordinated actions for excessive credit concentrations. A Group Credit Team reporting to the Group Chief Investment O/ff icer (Group CIO) provides credit analyses independently from Group asset managers, in addition to local CIO teams.

Only information referred to in Note/uni00A04/uni00A0is covered by the report Statutory Auditors on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nInformation in this Section/uni00A0should be read in conjunction with the paragraph 'Pricing and underwriting-related risks' in Section/uni00A05.1/uni00A0'Risk factors' of this Annual Report.\n\nThe Group's insurance subsidiaries are primarily responsible for managing their insurance risks linked to underwriting, pricing and reserving. They are also responsible for taking appropriate actions in response to changes in insurance cycles and to the political and economic environments in which they operate.\n\nIn the context of its Property &/uni00A0Casualty (P&C) and Protection &/uni00A0 Health businesses operations as described in Section/uni00A01.3 'Business overview' of this Annual Report, the AXA Group is exposed to the following main insurance risks, which include:\n\n- /uni25A0 premium risk resulting from fluctuations in the timing, frequency and severity of insured events, and relating to:\n- \u00b7 valuation of reserves for unexpired risks on existing contracts (insu/ff icient premium reserves),\n- \u00b7 mispricing of policies to be written (including renewals) during the period, and\n- \u00b7 expense payments;\n- /uni25A0 reserve risk resulting from fluctuations in the timing and amount of claim settlements and relating to the insu/ff iciency of claims reserves, which includes:\n- \u00b7 misestimating claims reserves (average payments), and\n- \u00b7 fluctuation of payments around their statistical average;\n- /uni25A0 catastrophe risks embedding both natural events such as climatic or meteorologic phenomena (including windstorms, hurricanes, floods or hailstorms), tectonic ones (earthquakes, volcanoes) and man-made ones, such as nuclear, liability, cyber, conflagration, terrorist attacks.\n\nLife risks also include risks related to mortality, longevity, lapses, disability and pandemics among others. The main risks to which the Life business is exposed are longevity risk and lapse risk, which are both sensitive to changes in interest rates, and could be defined as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 longevity risk is the risk related to the overestimation of mortality rates for business contingent on longevity;\n- /uni25A0 lapse risk is the risk of experiencing lapses lower (or higher) than expected on a permanent basis for businesses adversely sensitive to a decrease (or an increase) in lapses.\n\nAXA Group's exposure to insurance risks is covered by the AXA Group's Solvency Capital Requirement , as detailed in the paragraph 'Internal Model' in Section/uni00A05.2 'Internal Control and Risk Management' of this Annual Report and is taken into account in AXA's liquidity Risk Management framework (please refer to Section/uni00A05.5 'Liquidity risk' of this Annual Report).\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

These  procedures  are  adapted  and implemented locally, and aim at fostering product innovation across the Group while maintaining risks under control. The validation framework relies among others on the results of the Solvency Capital Requirement's assessments, based on the AXA Group's Internal Model, to ensure that new products undergo a thorough approval process before they are brought to market.\n\nIn Life &/uni00A0Savings, as well as Health, the Product Approval Process is managed at local level for all traditional products meeting Group's minimum requirements, which allows maintaining time-to-market product launches. For sophisticated products, local entities require Group's approval before launch to ensure all long-term commitments are monitored at Group level and benefit from the Group expertise on enhanced or specific guarantees.\n\nIn Property &/uni00A0Casualty, methods are adapted to the underwriting of risks, while maintaining the principle of local decision-making\n\nI\n\nbased on a documented approval procedure and using the output of the internal model. The aim is twofold:\n\n- /uni25A0 for pre-launch business, the aim is to ensure that new risks underwritten by the Group have been scrutinized before proposing them to customers;\n- /uni25A0 for post-launch business, appropriate profitability and risk control are performed to verify that the business remains in line with the Group's risk framework.\n\nThis framework is part of the Group underwriting policy and ensures that no risks are taken outside the Group tolerances and that value is created by adequate risk pricing.\n\n## EXPOSURE ANALYSIS AND RISK ASSESSMENT\n\nAXA Group reviews regularly its exposure to ensure that the risks underwritten are diversified geographically and by lines of business in order to manage risk concentration, and to verify adequacy of reinsurance.\n\nFor Life &/uni00A0Savings, Health and Property &/uni00A0Casualty activities, AXA Group has developed and deployed common models and metrics to consistently measure risks throughout the Group (in particular via its economic capital framework as detailed in Section/uni00A05.2 'Internal Control and Risk Management' of the Annual Report. This enables the Group to verify that its exposure complies with consolidated risk appetite limits along the dimensions of earnings, Eligible Own Funds (EOF), solvency and liquidity. These tools also contribute substantially to monitoring the major risks (claims frequency deviation, claims severity, reinsurance, pricing consistency, natural and man-made catastrophes, biometric and behavior risks deviations).\n\nThis framework is included in the governance set out previously for product development control.\n\nIn the Life &/uni00A0Savings, Health businesses, these tools allow for mortality/longevity risks to be analyzed on a multi-country basis. The AXA Group regularly monitors its exposure to these risks (including mortality, longevity and morbidity) and uses the results of this work to optimize its product design and its reinsurance coverage. These exposure analyses are supported by expert risk models in Life &/uni00A0Savings.\n\nRegarding  the  Property  &/uni00A0 Casualty  exposures, ad  hoc concentration risk models (internal and external for natural catastrophe and for man-made catastrophe) are developed to ensure yearly natural catastrophe volatility, coming from events such as windstorm, earthquake, hurricane or typhoon, or catastrophe man-made events, such as cyber or liability ones, are not likely to a/ff ect the Group above the set tolerance levels.",

        "page_content": "Since 2015, the Group has strategically developed a strong in-house expertise of development and validation of natural catastrophe models to cope with their dynamic nature in the context of global climate change. This has been complemented by a reinforced and continuously enhanced expertise in the modelling of systemic events (without border in time and space) like Cyber.\n\n## CEDED REINSURANCE\n\nThe reinsurance structure in charge of Life &/uni00A0Savings, Health and Property &/uni00A0Casualty reinsurance (AXA Global Re up to mid2022 and then Group Ceded Re) reports to the Group Deputy Chief Executive O/ff icer, in charge of Finance, Risk Management, Strategy, ceded Reinsurance and Operations. Its main mandate is to contribute to the protection of the Group through the centralization of the Group's purchase of reinsurance.\n\nFor the Life &/uni00A0Savings, Health and Property &/uni00A0Casualty operations, reinsurance programs are set up as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 Group's operating entities reinsurance capacity are set in alignment with Group Standards and with their local risk appetite limits considering the risk assessment previously described;\n- /uni25A0 their risks are modeled through in-depth actuarial analyses conducted on each portfolio; specifically, for Property &/uni00A0 Casualty modelling, via the Group economic capital model, AXA uses several models both internal and external for assessing the risk associated with the main natural perils (storms, floods, earthquakes,/uni00A0etc.).\n\n## Reinsurance strategy\n\nCentralization and harmonization of treaty reinsurance purchase is based on the same procedures for both the Life &/uni00A0Savings, Health businesses as for the Property &/uni00A0Casualty activities.\n\nIn order to build adjusted and optimized protection, the Group's operating entities are reinsured by AXA/uni00A0SA except for very specific cases notably for products developed in partnership with reinsurers in Life and Health and except for some AXA XL treaties.\n\nGroup Ceded Re can place a variable part of the local treaties on the reinsurance market, for regulatory reasons for example. A portion of the risk exposure is retained and mitigated within AXA/uni00A0 SA through the Group covers (including through a pool mechanism for Property) and the remaining part is ceded to external reinsurers.\n\nGroup Ceded Re is responsible for all Group external cessions. Since the acquisition of the XL group, AXA XL contributes to placing directly part of its covers (mainly quota share for specialties and for US portfolios) under Group Ceded Re's\n\n## RISK FACTORS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n5.6/uni00A0INSURANCE RISKS\n\ndelegation and control. 2023 Group reinsurance protections ensure respecting the risk appetite as in 2022.\n\nThese protections consist of major Group-covers (CAT, Property Per Risk, International Liability, Marine Whole Account (incl. Marine, Energy,/uni00A0etc.), Cyber, Motor Third Party Liability and Life) and various entities' specific local covers mainly driven by AXA XL-dedicated protections ( e.g. Aviation, Marine, Energy, US Liability, Political risks, retro,/uni00A0etc.).\n\nThe structures of Group covers are designed to adequately protect the Group in compliance with the Group risk appetite framework. Specific proportional and non-proportional covers are arranged through either the traditional reinsurance market or alternative capital markets (cat bonds and Insurance Linked Securities -/uni00A0ILS) both on an indemnity and industry loss index basis.\n\nAs opposed to the other Group covers where the Group retention is kept by AXA/uni00A0SA, in 2022, 94% of the Property Pool year-end financial result net of external reinsurance protections is retroceded back to local entities, through a pool mechanism managed by Group Ceded Re on behalf of those local entities.\n\nAXA also uses alternative capital market solutions also known as Insurance-Linked Securities (ILS), such as catastrophe bonds, as part of the overall reinsurance strategy. The use of ILS may not provide the same level of protection as traditional reinsurance, and the protections provided may vary depending on the region in which the loss occurred, or the number of events that make up the loss. Like traditional reinsurance, the accessibility of the ILS market may be impacted by disruptions, volatility or uncertainty, such as those that may arise following a major catastrophic event. Also, to the extent that AXA uses ILS products providing reinsurance protections based on an industry loss index rather than on its actual incurred losses, such transactions could result in a larger or lower residual loss than anticipated.\n\nFinally, in addition to the analyses described above, the Group Security Committee regularly monitors the AXA Group credit exposures to reinsurers, to ensure that consolidated exposures remain within the Group risk tolerance (see Section/uni00A05.4/uni00A0'Credit Risk/uni00A0-/uni00A0Receivables from reinsurers' of this Annual Report).\n\n## TECHNICAL RESERVES\n\nOperational entities specifically monitor their reserve risks. Claims reserves are estimated and booked on a file by file basis by the claims handlers. Additional reserves are also booked by the local entities.\n\nThe additional reserves' calculations are carried out locally by a two-independent-opinion process.\n\nActuaries in charge of assessing reserves use various statistical and actuarial methods. Their assumptions are made following\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5",

Its implementation is not limited to insurance activities. It encompasses all AXA entities, including insurance companies, banking activities, AXA Investment Managers and internal service providers consistent with AXA policy on operational Risk Management.\n\nBoth quantitative and qualitative requirements are defined:\n\n- /uni25A0 across the Group, the most critical operational risks of each entity and a set of stress scenarios are identified and assessed following a forward-looking and expert-opinion approach. These risk scenarios are then used to estimate the capital requirement needed to cover operational risks based on advanced models based on Solvency/uni00A0II principles. The operational Risk Management process is embedded into local governance through senior management validation to ensure that the risk assessment is adequate, appropriate and comprehensive but also to ensure that adequate corrective and pre-emptive actions are defined and implemented in respect of the main risks;\n- /uni25A0 in addition, a loss data collection process is in place within most companies of the Group in order to track and appropriately mitigate actual operational risk losses. This process is also used as a valuable source of information to back-test the assumptions taken in risk assessments.\n\nA key objective of the AXA Group's operational risk economic capital model is to understand and reduce losses resulting from operational failures and to define an appropriate risk response strategy for major operational risk scenarios. Entities and Group Operational Risk profiles are presented to local/Group Risk Committees for decisions and actions to be taken.\n\nIn 2022, the Group Operational Risk Profile is reasonably well spread out with all seven operational risk categories covered and the main risks being the following:\n\n- /uni25A0 transaction capture, execution and maintenance risk is a major risk and relates to process error, failure, and/or misperformance;\n- /uni25A0 compliance risk due to increases in legislation and regulation remains a major concern and is under the close monitoring of Group Compliance;\n- /uni25A0 external fraud &/uni00A0system security risk continues also to be a top priority. AXA Group's exposure to cyber risk is still high with more and more new technology into AXA Group's products and services. Information on cyber risks should be read in conjunction with the paragraph 'Operational and businessrelated risks' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk factors' of this Annual Report.\n\nAXA Group's exposure to operational risks is captured in the AXA Group's Solvency Capital Requirement as detailed in the paragraph 'Internal Model' in Section/uni00A05.2 'Internal Control and Risk Management' of this Annual Report.\n\nSpecific actions are identified at Group and local levels to mitigate these risks. Also, the implementation of the Internal Control framework will continue to contribute to better embed controls in activities and mitigate the risks.\n\nAs regards information risks, AXA has built an Information Risk Management (IRM) framework to enable information risk decisions to be made consistently across the organization and establish sustainable Risk Management capabilities that are integrated with the business.\n\nAXA relies on third-party providers for outsourcing of services at different stages of the value chain. Although relying on partners is a strategic advantage, onboarding a vendor into AXA's organization requires AXA to assess the risks it might bring, such as regulatory, compliance, IT security,/uni00A0etc.\n\nTo protect both business and customers, AXA has set up a dedicated Vendor Risk Framework program co-sponsored by Group Risk Management and Group Procurement. This program is supported by Group functions (Compliance, Data Privacy, Information Security, Operational Resilience, Legal, Reputation and Internal Control) and local stakeholders (Chief Risk O/ff icers, Chief Procurement Officers and Insurance Procurement Directors).\n\nThe Vendor Risk Framework defines a set of requirements for each relationship, with a risk-based approach, i.e. existing and potential new contracts. After identification of the criticality through pre-determined criteria, an appropriate level of due diligence, minimum requirements and oversight is implemented.\n\nFor more information on the AXA Group's risk controls and Risk Management processes, please refer to Section/uni00A05.2 'Internal Control and Risk Management' of this Annual Report.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5.7/uni00A0OPERATIONAL RISKS\n\n5",

The objectives of the Reputation Risk Management approach are in line with AXA's overall Enterprise Risk Management approach aiming to develop a reputation risk culture and risk intelligence.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nGiven the nature of strategic risks, there is no capital charge assessment but a strong strategic Risk Management framework to anticipate and mitigate these risks. Group Risk Management is involved at early stage in major strategic projects ( e.g. large M&A projects). The Group governance standards require among other things a Risk Management second opinion on key processes, including significant transactions and strategic plans. Furthermore, the ORSA report provides an assessment on the overall solvency needs which include the Solvency/uni00A0II ratio projection made until the strategic plan horizon and in stress scenarios as detailed in Section/uni00A05.2 'Internal Control and Risk Management -/uni00A0Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (ORSA)' of this Annual Report.\n\nThree main objectives drive the Reputation Risk Management approach:\n\n- /uni25A0 proactively manage reputation risk, avoid or minimize negative issues impacting the reputation of AXA and build trust among all of AXA stakeholders;\n- /uni25A0 define  accountability  for  reputation  risk  across  the organization, at Group and local levels;\n- /uni25A0 implement a common reputation Risk Management framework throughout the organization.\n\nAXA Group monitors in near real-time potential and existing issues and receives periodic top reputation risk reports from local entities. Every two months, an informational report is submitted to the Group Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee, and once a year, an internal report analyzes the main cases of reputation risk managed by AXA. Regular dialogue with the Global Reputation Network allows for building awareness, identification and dissemination of key topics that could negatively impact the Group's reputation.\n\nThe implementation of the Reputation Risk Framework encompasses AXA Group's main activities including insurance, Asset Management as well as internal service providers.",

        "page_content": "IAS/uni00A029 requires the financial statements of the entities operating in hyperinflationary economies to be adjusted to reflect the changes in the general purchasing power of their functional currency. Thus, non-monetary assets and liabilities of AXA's Turkish subsidiaries which are not already expressed in terms of the measuring unit current at the period end date are restated to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index ('CPI').\n\nIn the Group's consolidated statement of financial position as at the reporting date, the restatement e/ff ects on equity items are included in other components of comprehensive income, altogether with the translation di/ff erences, since the change in the Turkish CPI is correlated with movements in the Turkish lira/ Euro exchange rate.\n\nThe e/ff ect of inflation on monetary assets and liabilities over the reporting period is included in the reporting period's consolidated income as a loss on net monetary position. The cumulated gains and losses on net monetary position for previous periods are included within the retained earnings.\n\nAs stated in IAS/uni00A021 - The E/ff ects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, financial statements of Turkish subsidiaries, including their income statements, are translated in Euros at the closing exchange rate.\n\nThe presentation of the consolidated income statement of the reporting period is not restated as the e/ff ect of the restatement is not material. The comparative information is not restated.\n\n## 1.2.2 Standards and amendments published but not yet e/ff ective\n\n## 1.2.2.1 IFRS/uni00A017 - INSURANCE CONTRACTS AND IFRS/uni00A09 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nAXA will apply IFRS/uni00A017 - Insurance C ontracts and IFRS/uni00A09 - Financial I nstruments for the first time on January/uni00A01, 2023.\n\nIFRS/uni00A017 - Insurance C ontracts, published on May/uni00A018, 2017 and amended on June/uni00A025, 2020 and on December/uni00A09, 2021, was adopted by the European Union with an exemption regarding the annual cohort requirement (see below).\n\nIFRS/uni00A09 - Financial I nstruments was issued on July/uni00A024, 2014 and adopted by the European Union on November/uni00A022, 2016, with the published effective date on January/uni00A01, 2018. However, amendments to IFRS/uni00A04 - Insurance C ontracts/uni00A0'Applying IFRS/uni00A09 - Financial I nstruments with IFRS/uni00A04 - Insurance C ontracts', published on September/uni00A012, 2016, and 'Extension of the temporary exemption from applying IFRS/uni00A09', published on June/uni00A025, 2020, both endorsed by the European Union, allowed entities issuing insurance contracts within the scope of IFRS/uni00A04 to mitigate certain effects of applying IFRS/uni00A09 before the new insurance contract standard, IFRS/uni00A017, becomes e/ff ective. The amendments provided two options:\n\n- (ii) /uni00A0annual reporting periods beginning on or a/f\\_t er January/uni00A01, 2023, following the deferral of the e/ff ective application of IFRS/uni00A017 until the same date. Additional disclosures related (i) apply a temporary exemption from implementing IFRS/uni00A09 until the earlier of (i) /uni00A0 the effective date of IFRS/uni00A017, or\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n- to financial assets were required during the deferral period. This option was only available to entities whose activities are predominantly connected with insurance and that had not applied IFRS/uni00A09 previously; or\n- (ii) adopt IFRS/uni00A09 but, for designated financial assets, remove from profit or loss the e/ff ects of some of the accounting mismatches that may occur before IFRS/uni00A017 is implemented. During the interim period, additional disclosures were required.\n\nThe Group, eligible for the temporary exemption option (i) , decided to defer the implementation of IFRS/uni00A09 until the e/ff ective date of IFRS/uni00A017, as mentioned above. Disclosures related to financial assets required during the deferral period are included in the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nFinally, an amendment to IFRS/uni00A017 -Initial Application of IFRS/uni00A017 and IFRS/uni00A09 - Comparative Information, issued on December/uni00A09, 2021 and endorsed by the European Union on September/uni00A08, 2022, improved requirements for the comparative information to be disclosed on initial application of IFRS/uni00A017 and IFRS/uni00A09. It permits entities that first apply both standards at the same time to present comparative information about a financial asset as if the classification and measurement requirements of IFRS/uni00A09 had been applied to that financial asset before. AXA intends to restate the comparative period at the first application of IFRS/uni00A09 and apply this 'classification overlay', including the impairment requirements of IFRS/uni00A09, to all eligible financial assets.\n\n## Status of the IFRS/uni00A017 and IFRS/uni00A09 implementation program\n\nIn order to adopt these two new standards in its Consolidated Financial Statements, AXA conducted a global implementation program launched in 2016. This program involved both the central functions and all the entities included in the Group's consolidation  scope,  covered  various  aspects  such  as methodology, modelling, information systems, accounting and reporting, risk management, internal control, etc., and required the update of existing tools or the creation of new dedicated ones.\n\nThe adoption of IFRS/uni00A017 and IFRS/uni00A09 will result in significant accounting changes, with an impact on AXA's consolidated statement of financial position and consolidated statement of income. At the date of the publication of these Consolidated Financial Statements, the Group has estimated the expected impacts at the transition date, i.e. as of January/uni00A01, 2022, as disclosed below.\n\nThe implementation process is currently focused on building the comparative 2022 information applying transitional requirements in both standards. Although the work is well advanced, it is not finalized as of the date of the publication of these Consolidated Financial Statements, and it is not yet practicable to reliably disclose any quantitative information on the impacts of IFRS/uni00A017 and IFRS/uni00A09 for the comparative 2022 period.\n\nThe Group might determine that current options or valuations relating to IFRS/uni00A017 and IFRS/uni00A09 could be adjusted in the course of the formal implementation of the standards in the Group's 2023 financial reporting.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

In addition, a negative accounting mismatch in OCI will structurally occur as some underlying items, notably investments in real estate properties, are expected to continue to be accounted for at amortized cost, with therefore no recognition of unrealized gains and losses in shareholders' equity while these unrealized gains and losses will be included in the value of the contracts (with a corresponding negative e/ff ect in OCI).\n\nFurther details explaining these expected impacts are provided below for both IFRS/uni00A017 and IFRS/uni00A09.\n\n## IFRS/uni00A017 - Insurance C ontracts\n\nIFRS/uni00A0 17  establishes  the  principles  for  the  recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts and supersedes IFRS/uni00A04 - Insurance C ontracts. It aims at being more economic and better reflecting the underlying profitability of the business, while increasing comparability across the industry.\n\n## Scope\n\nIFRS/uni00A0 17 applies to insurance contracts issued, reinsurance contracts issued (inward business), reinsurance contracts held (outward business) and investment contracts with discretionary participation features provided the entity also issues insurance contracts. It requires separating the following components from insurance contracts: (i) /uni00A0 embedded derivatives, if they meet certain specified criteria, (ii) /uni00A0 distinct investment components, and (iii) /uni00A0 distinct performance obligations to provide noninsurance goods and services. These components should\n\nbe accounted for separately in accordance with the related standards.\n\n## Contract boundaries\n\nCash flows are within the boundary of an insurance contract if they arise from substantive rights and obligations that exist during the reporting period in which the entity can compel the policyholder to pay the premiums or in which the entity has a substantive obligation to provide the policyholder with services./uni00A0A substantive obligation to provide services ends notably when the entity has the practical ability to reassess the risks of the policyholder and, as a result, can set a price or level of benefits that fully reflects those risks.\n\n## Level of aggregation\n\nThe standard defines the level of aggregation to be used for measuring the insurance contract liabilities and the related profitability. Indeed, IFRS/uni00A017 requires to identify portfolios of insurance contracts, which comprise contracts that are subject to similar risks and are managed together. Afterwards, each portfolio of insurance contracts issued shall be divided into three groups:\n\n- /uni25A0 contracts that are onerous at initial recognition;\n- /uni25A0 contracts that at initial recognition have no significant possibility of becoming onerous subsequently; and\n- /uni25A0 the remaining contracts in the portfolio.\n\nMoreover, IFRS/uni00A017 as issued by the IASB introduces the 'annual cohort requirement' that prevents contracts issued more than one year apart from being included in the same group. However, the Standard as adopted by the European Union provides an optional exemption from applying this annual cohort requirement for the following contracts:\n\n- /uni25A0 groups of insurance contracts with direct participation features and groups of investment contracts with discretionary participation features, and with cash flows that a/ff ect or are a/ff  ected by cash flows to policyholders of other contracts;\n- /uni25A0 groups of insurance contracts that are managed across generations of contracts and that meet certain conditions and have been approved by supervisory authorities for the application of the matching adjustment.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

AXA intends to apply this exemption to eligible groups of insurance contracts.\n\nCompared with the level at which the liability adequacy test is performed under IFRS/uni00A04, the level of aggregation under IFRS/uni00A017 is more granular and can therefore potentially result in more contracts being identified as onerous and losses on onerous contracts being recognized sooner.\n\n## The general measurement model\n\nIFRS/uni00A017 requires applying by default the general measurement model ('Building Block Approach', or 'BBA') which is based on the following 'building blocks':\n\n- /uni25A0 the fulfilment cash flows ('FCF'), which comprise:\n- \u00b7 probability-weighted estimates of future cash flows;\n- \u00b7 an adjustment to reflect the time value of money ( i.e. discounting) and the financial risks associated with those future cash flows; and\n- \u00b7 a risk adjustment for non-financial risk;\n- /uni25A0 the Contractual Service Margin ('CSM').\n\n## Risk adjustment for non-financial risk\n\nRegarding the risk adjustment, its measurement should reflect the compensation required by AXA for bearing the uncertainty around the amount and timing of the future cash flows that arises from non-financial risk as AXA fulfils insurance contracts.\n\nThe Group considers the 62.5 th -67.5 th /uni00A0 percentile range as the adequate level of prudence on underlying reserves.\n\nThe determination of the risk adjustment follows a valueat-risk type approach, reflecting a retained confidence level with reference to the risk drivers of reserves. The value-at-risk is the maximum loss within a certain confidence level. The implementation is slightly di/ff erent between Life and Savings and Property and Casualty businesses. For Life and Savings business, groups of contracts are first shocked, risk factor by risk factor, up to the retained confidence level to assess the change in the present value of future cash flows. Then, diversification benefits between risks implicit to the entity's portfolio are considered by applying correlation factors between risks. For Property and Casualty liabilities for incurred claims, a direct value-at-risk calculation, reflecting the retained confidence level, is applied to the full probability distribution of the reserves. Finally, a diversification e/ff ect between entities is considered to reflect the fact that a same risk is unlikely to impact all the entities at the same time.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## Discount rates\n\nRegarding the discount rate, AXA intends to adopt a bottom-up approach. IFRS/uni00A017 requires the use of a market consistent yield curve factoring the illiquidity embedded in insurance liabilities. The methodology consists in using a Basic Risk-Free Rate ('RFR'), based on swaps for most currencies and government bonds for others, and adding on a liquidity premium ('LP') allowance to reflect the remuneration of illiquidity observed on traded assets until the Last Liquid Point ('LLP'), meaning the longest maturity for which there are enough traded bonds. An Ultimate Forward Rate ('UFR') macro-economically defined as the sum of the average of past real interest rates and central bank's target inflation is also considered. Discount rates ranging between the/uni00A0LLP and the UFR maturities are obtained by extrapolation.\n\n## Contractual Service Margin (CSM)\n\nCompared to IFRS/uni00A04, the introduction of the CSM is a major change. The CSM represents the unearned profit for a group of insurance contracts, in other words the present value of future profits attributable to the shareholders. It will be recognized in the consolidated statement of income over the coverage period of the contracts, as the entity provides services to the policyholders. The CSM of a group of contracts cannot be negative at inception; any net negative amount of the fulfilment cash flows at inception will be recorded in profit or loss immediately.\n\nAt the end of each subsequent reporting period the carrying amount of a group of insurance contracts is remeasured to be the sum of:\n\n- /uni25A0 the liability for remaining coverage ('LRC'), which comprises the FCF related to future services and the CSM of the g roup at that date; and\n- /uni25A0 the liability for incurred claims ('LIC'), which is measured as the FCF related to past services allocated to the g roup at that date.\n\nUnder the general measurement model, the CSM is adjusted at each subsequent reporting period for changes in expected future cash flows driven by changes in technical assumptions (death, morbidity, longevity, surrenders, expenses, future premiums\u2026). However, if negative changes in future discounted cash flows are greater than the remaining CSM, the di/ff erence is immediately recognized in profit or loss as the CSM cannot be negative. Interest is also accreted on the CSM at rates locked in at initial recognition of a contract ( i.e. discount rate used at inception to determine the present value of the estimated cash flows). Moreover, the CSM will be released into profit or loss based on coverage units, reflecting the quantity of the benefits provided and the expected coverage duration of the remaining contracts in the g roup. Given the variety of insurance contracts, the definition of coverage units involves the use of judgment by considering both the level of coverage defined within the contract ( e.g. a",

With the PAA, the liability for remaining coverage corresponds to premiums received at initial recognition less acquisition costs and amounts already recognized as insurance revenue at the closing date. However, the general measurement model remains applicable for the measurement of incurred claims. For the PAA, changes relative to IFRS/uni00A04 are expected to be limited and mainly linked to the discount of all reserves, a more granular onerous contract testing based on facts and circumstances and the inclusion of a risk adjustment for nonfinancial risk.\n\nThe PAA is expected to be used for most of the AXA Property and Casualty business and, to a lesser extent, for some short-term Protection businesses.\n\n## The Variable Fee Approach\n\nThe Variable Fee Approach ('VFA') is the mandatory model for measuring contracts with direct participation features (also referred to as 'direct participating contracts'). A contract has a direct participation feature if it meets all three requirements below:\n\n- /uni25A0 the contractual terms specify that the policyholder participates in a share of a clearly identified pool of underlying items;\n- /uni25A0 the entity expects to pay to the policyholder an amount equal to a substantial share of the fair value returns on the underlying items;\n- /uni25A0 the entity expects a substantial proportion of any change in the amounts to be paid to the policyholder to vary with the change in fair value of the underlying items.\n\nThis assessment of whether the contract meets the criteria above is made at inception of the contract and not revised subsequently, except in case of substantial modification of the contract.\n\nThe VFA is expected to apply for a large part of the AXA Life and Savings businesses (both General Account and Unit-l inked contracts), as well as for long term Protection and Health businesses which include participating features.\n\nFor these contracts, the general model described above is adapted as follows: the CSM needs to be adjusted (i) /uni00A0for changes in the variable fee (company's share in the change in fair value\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nof underlying items that corresponds to the revenue of the insurer), (ii) /uni00A0for the time value of money, and (iii) /uni00A0for the e/ff ect of changes in financial risks not arising from underlying items (such as options and guarantees). In order to allow an appropriate release pattern of the CSM, consistent with the definition of the investment-related service, real-world expected development of the CSM and coverage units (the policyholders' account value) need to be considered when determining the CSM release factor.\n\nAs a result of applying IFRS/uni00A017, the shareholders' share in the unrealized capital gains and losses on underlying items related to VFA contracts will be recognized in CSM instead of equity under the current accounting framework.\n\nTherefore, shadow accounting ( i.e. recognition of policyholders participation in unrealized capital gains and losses as allowed by IFRS/uni00A04 for insurance and investment contracts with discretionary participating features) will no longer apply under IFRS/uni00A017.\n\nFor some groups of VFA contracts, the Group also intends to apply the 'risk mitigation' accounting option that allows to reduce or remove any accounting mismatch arising from the mitigation of financial risks impacting the CSM by using (i) /uni00A0 derivatives, (ii) /uni00A0financial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss and held within shareholders' fund or (iii) /uni00A0reinsurance contracts. Under this option, it is allowed (on a prospective basis from the transition date to IFRS/uni00A017) not to adjust the CSM but instead a/ff ect the profit or loss for the changes in the fulfilment cash flows and the entity's share in the fair value return on the underlying items that the hedging instruments are intended to mitigate.\n\n## Presentation\n\nUnder IFRS/uni00A017, in terms of presentation, the amounts recognized in  the  statements  of  financial  performance  have  to  be disaggregated into:\n\n- /uni25A0 an insurance service result, comprising insurance revenue (corresponding to the insurance service provided over the period, which will be more comparable with the revenue of other industries) and insurance service expenses ( i.e. incurred claims and other incurred insurance service expenses); and\n- /uni25A0 a net finance income or expenses from insurance and reinsurance contracts, which mostly relates to non-direct participating business and shareholders' funds, with the expectation that AXA will generally apply the option to disaggregate insurance financial income or expense between the statement of profit or loss and the other comprehensive income in order to limit the volatility in net income (considering that many of the supporting financial assets will be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income under IFRS/uni00A09). Under this option, for non-participating contracts, the di/ff  erence between the valuation of the liabilities at locked-in rates (used for the unwind in the insurance finance income or expenses) and their valuation at current rates is recognised in OCI. In the same way, when changes in liabilities arise from a contractual link (indexation) between inflation and the payments to policyholders, the changes due to inflation that relate to future services should also be considered as resulting\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

This approach consists in repricing the contracts in the light of actuarial and financial parameters observed at the transition date.\n\nThe Group intends to apply the FRA mainly to the liabilities for remaining coverage of contracts measured with the PAA and the liabilities for incurred claims occurred since 2016.\n\nFor other groups of contracts, different factors (such as the impossibility of running models since the inception of the contracts, the lack of historical data\u2026) are expected to make the application of the FRA unpracticable. For these groups of contracts, AXA therefore expects to apply the MRA or the FVA. In particular:\n\n- /uni25A0 for long-term Life and Savings contracts, the MRA is expected to be the approach the most broadly used, the FVA being applied only on a more limited basis; and\n- /uni25A0 for LIC occurred before 2016 related to non-participating contracts, in the absence of reasonable and supportable information (under IFRS/uni00A04, claims reserves are generally not discounted and determining the correct locked-in discount yield curves is not possible without hindsight for periods before the adoption of Solvency 2), the FVA will be applied with the option taken to set the OCI to zero on transition ( i.e. discounting the liabilities with the transition yield curve instead of an historical accident year yield curve).\n\n## IFRS/uni00A09 - Financial instruments\n\nIFRS/uni00A0 9 - Financial instruments replaces IAS/uni00A039 and provides accounting requirements related to the classification and measurement of financial instruments.\n\nChanges in accounting policies resulting from the adoption of IFRS/uni00A09 will be applied retrospectively, excluding the changes in hedge accounting that, with some exceptions (see below), may only be applied prospectively from January/uni00A01, 2023.\n\n## Classification and measurement of financial assets\n\nIFRS/uni00A09 uses a single approach to determine the measurement category for financial assets based on the business model in which those financial assets are held and on the characteristics of their contractual cash flows:\n\n- /uni25A0 a financial asset is measured at amortized cost if both (i) /uni00A0 the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, and (ii) /uni00A0 the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding ('SPPI');",

Most of AXA's investments in debt instruments are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets;\n- /uni25A0 assets not fitting either of these categories are measured at fair value through profit or loss ('FVTPL').\n\nIn addition, IFRS/uni00A09 provides the following classification options designed to eliminate or significantly reduce accounting mismatches  that  would  otherwise  arise  if  the  general classification approach were applied:\n\n- /uni25A0 an entity can designate at FVTPL a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch in profit or loss;\n- /uni25A0 for equity instruments that are not held for trading, an entity can make an irrevocable election to present in OCI (instead of profit or loss) subsequent changes in the fair value of those instruments (including realized gains and losses), dividends being recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe impairment model under IFRS/uni00A09 reflects expected credit losses ('ECL'), as opposed to incurred credit losses under IAS/uni00A039. Under the IFRS/uni00A09 impairment approach, it is no longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognized. Instead, an entity always accounts for expected credit losses and changes in those expected credit losses.\n\nECL is defined at each financial reporting date based on the key inputs which are the probability of the default, the magnitude of the potential credit loss (a/f\\_t er any potential recovery) and the exposure to the risk of default.\n\nThe amount of expected credit losses is updated at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition. IFRS/uni00A09 distinguishes between lifetime ECL calculated for financial instruments for which there have been significant increases in credit risk since initial recognition, and 12-month ECL recognized for financial instruments for which the credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition. It is assumed that the credit risk has not increased significantly\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nsince initial recognition if the financial instrument has low credit risk at the reporting date, and 12-month ECL is recognized for those financial instruments. In addition, a particular impairment approach, quite similar to that existing under IAS/uni00A039, is applied to instruments for which the credit event has already occurred. Previously recognized ECL allowances are reversed when the corresponding credit risk improves.\n\nAs a part of its IFRS/uni00A09 implementation process, AXA created a new impairment model including a credit risk assessment that combines quantitative and qualitative approaches, ECL calculation tools, dedicated accounting and specific governance.\n\nThe new impairment model will apply to debt instruments and receivables held by the Group and measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI.\n\n## Estimated impacts of IFRS/uni00A09 on financial assets as of January/uni00A01, 2022\n\nMost of the Group's financial assets are measured at fair value both before and a/f\\_t er transition to IFRS/uni00A09, and most of the debt instruments accounted for at FVOCI under IAS/uni00A039 are expected to continue to be accounted for at FVOCI under IFRS/uni00A09. The new classification and measurement (including impairment) requirements are however expected to result in the following changes in the financial assets held by AXA as of January/uni00A01, 2022:\n\n- /uni25A0 for equity securities, as IAS/uni00A039 FVOCI with recycling of realized gains and losses in profit or loss is no longer permitted under IFRS/uni00A09, AXA expects to apply the optional designation at FVOCI without recycling for most of equity securities held, which represents an estimated investment amount of \u20ac22/uni00A0billion (of which \u20ac7/uni00A0billion of unrealized gains cumulated in OCI), in order to avoid a significant new volatility in net income resulting from this asset class, compared to the current IAS/uni00A039 accounting. As a consequence of this reclassification from FVOCI with recycling to FVOCI without recycling, the cumulated amount of IAS/uni00A039 impairment allowances (\u20ac-2/uni00A0billion) is also expected to be transferred from retained earnings to OCI without recycling, with no impact on the Group's total consolidated shareholders' equity. As a result, the OCI balance without recycling is estimated to be \u20ac5/uni00A0billion;\n- /uni25A0 some debt instruments and non consolidated funds, for a total of \u20ac13/uni00A0billion, are expected to be reclassified from FVOCI to FVTPL with unrealized gains of \u20ac2/uni00A0billion transferred from OCI to retained earnings, either because those instruments do not meet the SPPI criteria or because the optional designation at FVTPL is applied;\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

AXA intends to apply IFRS/uni00A09 requirements for all hedges with the exception of portfolio fair value hedges of interest rate risk (commonly referred to as 'fair value macro hedges'). For the latter, AXA will continue applying the hedge accounting requirements currently in IAS/uni00A039 as allowed by the IASB that is addressing macro hedge accounting as a separate project.\n\nMost Group's hedge accounting relationships documented under IAS/uni00A0 39 will be considered as continuing hedge relationships under IFRS/uni00A09 with the exception of those implying derivative instruments which are part of underlying items of insurance or investment contracts with direct participating features within the scope of IFRS/uni00A017, as no accounting mismatch exists in this case. The IAS/uni00A039 hedge relationships implying those derivatives will therefore be discontinued.\n\n## Change in the presentation of derivative instruments\n\nUnder the current presentation, AXA discloses derivative instruments, in its consolidated statement of financial position, alongside their underlying assets or liabilities. Thus, for each line of assets or liabilities concerned, a net economic position is currently presented.\n\nTogether with the first application of IFRS/uni00A09, AXA has decided to present its derivative instruments in separate lines of its consolidated statement of financial position, as either an asset or a liability depending upon the fair value position at the reporting date, with no o/ff setting. In the Group's consolidated statement of financial position as of January/uni00A01, 2022, the derivative assets and liabilities lines are expected to represent respectively \u20ac9/uni00A0billion and \u20ac11/uni00A0billion, the net balance of \u20ac-2/uni00A0billion mostly resulting from derivatives previously classified within the investments.",

It requires a degree of judgment in the application of the Group accounting principles described below. The main balance sheet captions concerned are goodwill (in particular impairment tests described in paragraph/uni00A01.7.1), intangible assets acquired in a business combination, the value of acquired business in force, deferred acquisition costs and equivalent, certain assets accounted at fair value, deferred tax assets, liabilities relating to the insurance business, pension benefit obligations and balances related to share-based compensation. The principles set out below specify the measurement methods used for these items. These methods, along with key assumptions where required, are discussed in\n\ngreater depth in the notes relating to the asset and liability items concerned where meaningful and useful.\n\nAs recommended by IAS/uni00A01, assets and liabilities are generally classified globally on the balance sheet in increasing order of liquidity, which is more relevant for financial institutions than a classification between current and non-current items. As a standard practice for insurance companies, expenses are classified by destination in the income statement.\n\nAll amounts in the consolidated statement of financial position, consolidated statement of income, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of cash flows, consolidated statement of changes in equity and in the Notes are expressed in Euro/uni00A0million.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

They are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to AXA. Under IFRS/uni00A010, AXA controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to a/ff ect those returns through its power over the investee. Only substantive rights ( i.e. the holder must have the practicability to exercise them) and rights that are not protective shall be considered. AXA can have power with less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, in particular through:\n\n- /uni25A0 the proportion of ownership with regards to the other investors;\n- /uni25A0 potential voting rights;\n- /uni25A0 a contractual arrangement between the investor and other vote holders;\n- /uni25A0 rights arising from other contractual arrangements; or\n- /uni25A0 a combination of these indicators.\n\nUnder IFRS/uni00A011, companies over which AXA exercises a joint controlling influence alongside one or more third parties are joint ventures and are accounted for under the equity method.\n\nCompanies in which AXA exercises significant influence are accounted for under the equity method. Under IAS/uni00A028, significant influence is presumed when AXA directly or indirectly holds 20% or more of the voting rights. Significant influence can also be exercised through an agreement with other shareholders.\n\nUnder the equity method, AXA's share of equity investments' postacquisition profit or loss is recognized in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is stated under 'Other reserves'.\n\nInvestment funds and real estate companies are either fully consolidated or accounted for under the equity method, depending on which conditions of IFRS/uni00A010/IFRS/uni00A011/IAS/uni00A028 listed above they satisfy. Fees received by asset managers are also taken into account in the assessment of the exposure to variability of returns. For fully consolidated investment funds, minority interests are recognized at fair value and shown as liabilities in the balance sheet if the companies' instruments can be redeemed at any time by the holder at fair value. Investment funds accounted by equity method are shown under the balance sheet caption 'Financial investments'.\n\nSome companies in which AXA exercises control, a joint controlling influence or a significant influence are excluded from the scope of consolidation as they are not material with respect to the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements. These are mainly investment funds.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## 1.3.2 Business combinations and subsequent changes in the Group ownership interest\n\nIn accordance with the option made available by IFRS/uni00A01/uni00A0First-time adoption of IFRS, business combinations prior to 2004 were not restated with respect to French accounting principles in force at the time.\n\n## VALUATION OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED OF NEWLY ACQUIRED SUBSIDIARIES AND/uni00A0CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\n\nUpon first consolidation, all assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities (unless they are not present obligations) of the acquired company are estimated at their fair value. However, in compliance with an exemption permitted by IFRS/uni00A04, liabilities related to life insurance contracts or investment contracts with discretionary participating features are maintained at the carrying value prior to the acquisition date to the extent that this measurement basis is consistent with AXA's accounting principles. The fair value of acquired business in force relating to life insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participating features is recognized as an asset corresponding to the present value of estimated future profits emerging on acquired business in force at the date of acquisition (also referred to as value of acquired business in force or VBI and reflecting the di/ff erence between the fair value and the carrying value of the liabilities). The present value of future profits takes into consideration the cost of capital and is estimated using actuarial assumptions based on projections made at purchase date but also using a discount rate that includes a risk premium.\n\nInvestment contracts with no discretionary participating features do not benefit from the exemption permitted by IFRS/uni00A04 such as described above, under which the fair value of acquired liabilities is booked through the recognition of an asset corresponding to the value of acquired business in force. Liabilities relating to investment contracts with no discretionary participating features are measured directly at fair value. In accordance with IAS/uni00A039, the fair value of these contracts cannot be less than surrender value when they contain a demand feature.\n\nOther identifiable intangible assets such as the value of customer relationships should be recognized. The value of customer relationships intangible represents the value of future cash flows expected from renewals and the cross-selling of new products to customers known and identified at the time of the acquisition. These projections include assumptions regarding claims, expenses and financial revenues, or they can be estimated on the basis of the New Business Value. In line with accounting practices in force before the adoption of IFRS, which may continue to be applied under IFRS/uni00A04, future premiums relating to acquired business may be recognized in the 'Value of acquired business in force' item.\n\nTo the extent that these other intangible assets can be estimated separately, they can also be measured by looking at the purchased marketing resources that will allow to generate these future cash flows. The nature of the intangible assets recognized is consistent with the valuation methods used when purchasing the acquired entity.",

        "page_content": "In the context of a business combination, only restructuring costs that can be measured reliably and which correspond to an existing liability of the acquired company prior to the acquisition date are included in restructuring provisions recognized in the acquired company's balance sheet at acquisition date.\n\nThe consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred by the Group, the liabilities incurred by the Group to former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group.\n\nPurchase consideration includes any contingent element (adjustment in the acquisition price conditional upon on one or more events). In the estimate of the contingent element, attention is paid to use assumptions that are consistent with the assumptions used for the valuation of intangible assets such as VBI. For business combinations that occurred before January/uni00A01, 2009, any contingent element was included in the cost of the combination to the extent the adjustment was probable and could be measured reliably. If the future events do not occur or the estimate needs to be revised, the cost of the business combination continues to be adjusted accordingly, taking account of the impact in terms of additional goodwill and/or adjustments of the valuation of acquired assets and liabilities. For business combinations on or after January/uni00A01, 2009, any change to the estimate of the contingent element between the acquisition date and the amount actually subsequently paid is recognized in the income statement.\n\nDirect transaction costs related to a business combination are charged in the income statement when incurred.\n\nIn step acquisitions, any previous minority interest held by the Group is measured at fair value and the resulting adjustment is recognized through net income. Similarly, when an additional purchase changes the control from significant influence or joint control to control, any investment pre-existing in a former associate/joint venture is re-measured to its fair value with the gain or loss through net income (consequently also resulting in a new goodwill).\n\nAccording to a decision taken for each acquisition, any minority interest may be measured at fair value or at its proportionate interest in the acquiree's identifiable net assets.\n\n## GOODWILL\n\nGoodwill is measured as the excess of (i) /uni00A0 the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of any minority interest in the acquiree and in a business combination achieved in stages, the acquisition-date fair value of the Group's previously held equity interest in the acquiree over (ii) /uni00A0 the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.\n\nGoodwill arising from the acquisition of a foreign entity is recorded in the local currency of the acquired entity and is translated into Euro at the closing date.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nIf the cost of acquisition is less than the net of the acquisitiondate amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, the difference is directly recorded in the consolidated statement of income.\n\nAdjustments can be made to goodwill within twelve/uni00A0months of the acquisition date, if new information becomes available to complete the initial accounting. In this case, comparative information is presented as if the initial accounting had been completed from the acquisition date.\n\nIf, a/f\\_t  er the period of twelve/uni00A0months, a deferred tax asset, initially considered as not recoverable, finally meets the recognition criteria, the corresponding tax benefit is recorded in the consolidated statement of income without a corresponding adjustment in goodwill.\n\nGoodwill is allocated to cash generating units corresponding/uni00A0to (i) the companies acquired or portfolios of business acquired according to their expected profitability, and (ii) /uni00A0 the entities already within the AXA Group that will benefit from the synergies of the combination with the activities acquired. This allocation of goodwill is used both for segment reporting and for impairment testing.\n\n## PURCHASE AND SALE OF MINORITY INTERESTS IN/uni00A0A/uni00A0CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARY\n\nPurchase and sale transactions of minority interests in a controlled subsidiary that do not change the conclusion of control are recorded through shareholders' equity (including direct acquisition costs).\n\nIf control in a subsidiary is lost, any gain or loss is recognized in net income. Furthermore, if an investment in the entity is retained by the Group, it is re-measured to its fair value and any gain or loss is also recognized in net income.\n\n## PUT OVER MINORITY INTERESTS\n\nWhen control over a subsidiary is acquired, a put option may be granted to minority shareholders. However, the recognition of the puttable instruments as a liability depends on the contractual obligations.\n\nWhen the contract involves an unconditional commitment exercisable by the option holder, it is recognized as a liability. Since the balancing entry to this liability is not specified by current IFRS, the Group's method is/uni00A0to (i) /uni00A0 reclassify minority interests from equity to liability, (ii) /uni00A0 re-measure this liability at the present value of the option price, and (iii) /uni00A0 recognize the difference either as an increase in goodwill for puts existing before January/uni00A01, 2009, or as a decrease in equity (Group share) for a put granted a/f\\_t er January/uni00A01, 2009, to the extent there is no immediate transfer of risks and rewards. Similarly, subsequent changes in the liability are recorded against goodwill for puts existing before January/uni00A01, 2009, and against equity (Group share) for puts granted a/f\\_t er that date.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

However, in case of a loss, an impairment test is performed, in order to assess whether an impairment of the underlying item has to be booked.\n\nIn the event of an internal sale of an asset that is not intended to be held on the long term by the Group, deferred tax is recognized as the current tax calculated on the realized gain or loss is eliminated. The income statement impact of the potential policyholders' participation resulting from this transaction is also eliminated, and a deferred policyholders' participation asset or liability is posted to the statement of financial position.\n\nIn addition, the transfer of consolidated shares, between two consolidated subsidiaries but held with different ownership percentages, should not impact the Group net income. The only exception would be any related tax and policyholders' participation recorded in connection to the transaction, which are maintained in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These transfers also have an impact on Group shareholders' equity (with a balancing entry recorded in minority interests). This impact is identified in the 'other' changes of the consolidated statement of shareholders' equity.\n\n## 1.4 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND/uni00A0TRANSACTIONS\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in Euro/uni00A0million, the Euro being the Group's presentational currency.\n\nThe results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency ( i.e. the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates) di/ff erent from the Group presentational currency are translated as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 assets and liabilities of entities in a functional currency di/ff  erent from Euro are translated at the closing exchange rate;\n- /uni25A0 revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate over the period, except for revenues and expenses of the entities operating in hyperinflationary economies which are translated in Euros at the closing exchange rate as explained in paragraph/uni00A01.2.1.2;\n- /uni25A0 all resulting foreign exchange di/ff erences are recognized as a separate component of equity (translation di/ff erences).\n\nI\n\nI\n\nAt the local entity level, foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at closing rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognized in the income statement, except where hedge accounting is applied as explained in paragraph/uni00A01.10.\n\nAs mentioned in paragraph/uni00A01.3.2, goodwill arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity is recorded in the local currency of the acquired entity and is translated into Euro at the closing date.\n\nForeign exchange di/ff erences arising from the translation of a net investment in a foreign subsidiary, borrowings and other currency instruments qualifying for hedge accounting of such investment are recorded in shareholders' equity under translation di/ff erences and are recycled in the income statement as part of the realized gain or loss on disposal of the hedged net investment.\n\nForeign exchange di/ff erences arising from monetary financial investments available for sale are recognized as income or expense for the period in respect of the portion corresponding to amortized cost. The residual translation di/ff erences relating to fair value changes are recorded in shareholders' equity, like for non-monetary items such as equity securities.\n\nRegarding the cumulative amount of the exchange di/ff erences related to disposed business, the Group applies the step-by-step consolidation method (IFRIC/uni00A016).\n\n## 1.5 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT\n\nThe Group applies the IFRS/uni00A013 fair value hierarchy as described below for all assets and liabilities where another IFRS requires or permits fair value measurement or disclosures about fair value measurement in the Notes. Principles below address mostly assets given the nature of the activities of the Group.\n\n## 1.5.1 Active market: quoted price\n\nFair values of assets and liabilities traded on active markets are determined using quoted market prices when available. An instrument is regarded as quoted in an active market if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service or regulatory agency and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis between a willing seller and a willing buyer. For financial instruments traded in active markets, quotes received from external pricing services represent consensus prices, i.e. using similar models and inputs resulting in a very limited dispersion.\n\nThe fair value amounts of assets and liabilities for which fair value is determined in whole directly by reference to an active market are disclosed as level/uni00A01 in the Notes/uni00A0to the financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## 1.5.2 Active versus inactive markets financial instruments\n\nFinancial instruments are considered as being quoted in an active market when:\n\n- /uni25A0 quotes that represent consensus are regularly provided by external pricing services with limited dispersion; and\n- /uni25A0 prices are readily available.\n\nLiquidity may be defined as the possibility to sell or dispose of the asset in the ordinary course of business within a certain limited time period at approximately the price at which the investment is valued. Liquidity for debt instruments is assessed using a multi-criteria approach including the number of quotes available, the place of issuance and the evolution of the widening of bid ask spreads.\n\nA financial instrument is regarded as not quoted in an active market:\n\n- /uni25A0 if there is little observation of transaction prices as an inherent characteristic of the instrument;\n- /uni25A0 when there is a significant decline in the volume and level of trading activity;\n- /uni25A0 in case of significant illiquidity;\n- /uni25A0 if observable prices cannot be considered as representing fair value because of dislocated market conditions.\n\nCharacteristics of inactive markets can therefore be very di/ff erent in nature, inherent to the instrument or indicative of a change in the conditions prevailing in certain markets.\n\n## 1.5.3 Assets and liabilities not quoted in/uni00A0an/uni00A0active market\n\nFair values of assets and liabilities that are not traded in an active market are estimated using:\n\n- /uni25A0 external and independent pricing services; or\n- /uni25A0 valuation techniques.\n\nFair values of assets and liabilities that are not traded in active market mainly based on observable market data are disclosed as level/uni00A02 in the Notes/uni00A0to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nFair values mainly not based on observable market data are disclosed as level/uni00A03 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n- /uni25A0 No active market: use of external pricing services\n\nExternal pricing services may be fund asset managers in the case of non-consolidated investments in funds or brokers. To the extent possible, the Group collects quotes from external pricing providers as inputs to measure fair value. Prices received may form tight clusters or dispersed quotes which may then lead to the use of valuation techniques. The dispersion of quotes\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nreceived may be an indication of the large range of assumptions used by external pricing providers given the limited number of transactions to be observed or reflect the existence of distress transactions. In addition, given current market conditions since the financial crisis and the persistency of complete inactivity of some markets since then, many financial institutions closed their desks dedicated to structured assets deals and are no longer in a position to deliver meaningful quotes.\n\n- /uni25A0 No active market: use of valuation techniques\n\nThe objective of valuation techniques is to arrive at the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants (a willing buyer and a willing seller) at the measurement date. Valuation techniques include:\n\n- \u00b7 market approach: the consideration of recent prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving substantially similar assets or liabilities,\n- \u00b7 income approach: use of discounted cash flow analysis, option pricing models, and other present value techniques to convert future amounts to a single current ( i.e. discounted) amount,\n- \u00b7 cost approach: the consideration of amounts that would currently be required to construct or replace the service capacity of an asset.\n\nValuation techniques are subjective in nature and significant judgment is involved in establishing fair values. They include recent arm's length transactions between knowledgeable willing parties on similar assets if available and representative of fair value and involve various assumptions regarding the underlying price, yield curve, correlations, volatility, default rates and other factors. Unlisted equity instruments valuation is based on cross checks using di/ff erent methodologies such as discounted cash flows techniques, price earning ratios multiples, adjusted net asset values, taking into account recent transactions on instruments which are substantially the same if concluded at arm's length between knowledgeable willing parties, if any. The use of valuation techniques and assumptions could produce di/ff erent estimates of fair value. However, valuations are determined using generally accepted models (discounted cash flows, Black/uni00A0& Scholes models,/uni00A0etc.) based on quoted market prices for similar instruments or underlyings (index, credit spread,/uni00A0etc.) whenever such directly observable data are available and valuations are adjusted for liquidity and credit risk.\n\nValuation techniques may be used when there is little observation of transaction prices as an inherent characteristic of the market, when quotes made available by external pricing providers are too dispersed or when market conditions are so dislocated that observed data cannot be used or need significant adjustments. Internal mark to model valuations are therefore normal market practices for certain assets and liabilities inherently scarcely traded or exceptional processes implemented due to specific market conditions.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

For example, a very large widening of bid ask spreads may be a helpful indicator in understanding whether market participants are willing to transact. The dislocation of markets may also be suspected in cases of wide dispersion in the prices (over time or among market participants), small number of transactions, closing down of primary and/or secondary markets, forced transactions motivated by needs of liquidity or other di/ff icult financial conditions with insu/ff icient time to market the assets to be sold, and large bulk sales to exit such markets at all costs that may involve side arrangements (such as sellers providing finance for a sale to a buyer). In such cases, the Group uses valuation techniques including observable data whenever possible and relevant, adjusted if needed to develop the best estimate of fair value, including adequate risk premiums or develops a valuation model based on unobservable data representing estimates of assumptions that willing market participants would use when prices are not current, relevant or available without undue costs and e/ff orts: in inactive markets, transactions may be inputs when measuring fair value, but would likely not be determinative and unobservable data may be more appropriate than observable inputs.\n\n## 1.6 SEGMENT REPORTING\n\nThe segmental analysis provided in AXA's Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements reflects six operating business segments. These segments are determined on the basis of geographies or transversally for entities operating in various jurisdictions, and include France, Europe, Asia, AXA/uni00A0XL, International and Transversal & Central Holdings.\n\n## 1.7 INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n\n## 1.7.1 Goodwill and impairment of goodwill\n\nGoodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful life and is therefore not amortized but subject to a regular test for impairment. Impairment tests are performed at least annually. Impairment of goodwill is not reversible.\n\nAXA performs an/uni00A0impairment test of goodwill by cash generating unit, using valuation approaches that rely on parameters such as market indicators, market value of assets, market value of liabilities and future operating profits, derived on the basis of operational and economic assumptions in order to determine\n\nI\n\nI\n\nany significant adverse changes that might lead to the nonrecoverability of the goodwill. Compliant with IAS/uni00A036, within each cash generating unit, a comparison is made between net book value and the recoverable value (equal to the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use). Value in use consists of the net assets and the value placed on expected future earnings from existing and new business. For Life & Savings segment, the value of future expected earnings is estimated on the basis of embedded value models or similar calculations for other activities. Fair value less costs to sell is determined in compliance with IFRS/uni00A013 fair value as described in paragraph/uni00A01.5.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognized for a cash generating unit if, and only if, the recoverable amount of the unit or group of units is less than the carrying amount of the unit or group of units.\n\nFair value approach is based on risk neutral valuation techniques taking into account:\n\n- /uni25A0 the current shareholders' net asset value plus the future profitability of the business in force:\n- \u00b7 the current shareholders' net asset value is adjusted to take into account any di/ff erence between the basis of cash flows projections used in the value of business in force calculations and IFRS,\n- \u00b7 the profitability of business in force is determined using the embedded value methodology, which is an industrywide and specific valuation approach, consistent with the principle of discounted earnings, as the value of business in force is represented by the discounted value of future earnings from the in-force portfolios. The Group uses however both market consistent risk neutral approaches, aligned with fair-value calculations, and traditional discounted cash flows projections;\n- /uni25A0 the profitability of future new business:\n- \u00b7 the value of future new business is computed either on the basis of multiples of a standardized year of new business contribution (present value of projected future distributable profits generated from business written in a year) or on a projection of each of the expected annual future earnings when multiples are not appropriate. The determination of the future earnings arising from the new business relies upon the use of operational and economic assumptions, both of which are compliant with the requirements of the di/ff erent regulatory frameworks.\n\nThe recoverable value of the Life & Savings segment is first assessed on a risk free basis (basic test) and then on the basis of illustrative investment assumptions suitable for a traditional embedded value approach if the recoverable value determined for the basic test is lower than the carrying amount.",

Cash flows beyond that period are extrapolated using a steady growth rate and a terminal value.\n\n## 1.7.2 Value of purchased Life insurance business in force (VBI)\n\nThe value of purchased insurance contracts and investment contracts  with  discretionary  participating  features recognized in a business combination (see paragraph/uni00A01.3.2) is amortized as profits emerge over the life of the contracts' portfolio. In conjunction with the liability adequacy test (see paragraph/uni00A01.14.2),VBI is subject to annual recoverability testing based on actual experience and expected changes in the main assumptions.\n\n## 1.7.3 Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC) relating to insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participating features rights to future management fees, also known as Deferred Origination Costs (DOC) relating to investment contracts with no discretionary participating features\n\nThe incremental direct costs of acquiring a portfolio of insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participating  features,  primarily  related  to  the  selling, underwriting and initiating the insurance contracts in a portfolio, are deferred by recognizing an asset, Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC). In Property & Casualty segment, DAC are amortized over the terms of the policies, as premium is earned. For Life & Savings segment, the asset is amortized based on the estimated gross profits emerging over the life of the contracts. This asset is tested for recoverability and any amount above future estimated gross profits is expensed. DAC are also tested through the liability adequacy test (see paragraph/uni00A01.15.2).\n\nFor investment contracts with no discretionary participating features, a similar asset is recognized, i.e. rights to future management fees, also known as Deferred Origination Costs (DOC) (see Note/uni00A07) but limited to incremental costs directly attributable to the provision of investment management services. This asset is amortized by taking into account projections of fees collected over the life of the contracts. The amortization of DOC is reviewed at each closing date to reflect changes in assumptions and experience. This asset is also tested for recoverability.\n\nDAC and DOC are reported gross of unearned revenues and fees reserves. These unearned revenues and fees reserves are separately recognized as liabilities and are amortized over the contract term using the same amortization approach as the one used for DAC and DOC.\n\n## 1.7.4 Unearned Revenues Reserves\n\nRevenues received at contract inception to cover future services are deferred and recognized in the income statement using the same amortization pattern as the one used for deferred acquisition costs.\n\n## 1.7.5 Other Intangible Assets\n\nOther intangible assets include so/f\\_t ware developed for internal use for which direct costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the assets' estimated useful lives.\n\nThey also include customer relationships intangibles as well as distribution agreements recognized as a result of business combinations. If these assets have a finite useful life, they are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated life. In all cases, they are subject to impairment tests, at each closing for assets with a finite useful life and at least annually for other assets. In the event of a significant decline in value, an impairment is booked corresponding to the di/ff erence between the value on the balance sheet and the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell.\n\n## 1.8 INVESTMENTS FROM INSURANCE, BANKING AND OTHER ACTIVITIES\n\nInvestments include investment in real estate properties and financial instruments including equity instruments, debt instruments and loans.\n\n## 1.8.1 Investment in real estate properties\n\nInvestment in real estate properties (excluding investment in real estate properties totally or partially backing liabilities arising from contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders) is recognized at cost. The properties components are depreciated over their estimated useful lives, also considering their residual value if it may be reliably estimated.\n\nIn case of unrealized loss over 15%, an impairment is recognized for the di/ff erence between the net book value of the investment property and the fair value of the asset based on an independent valuation. Furthermore, at the level of each reporting entity, if the cumulated amount of unrealized losses under 15% (without o/ff  setting with unrealized gains) represents more than 10% of the cumulated net cost of real estate assets, additional impairment is booked on a line-by-line approach until the 10% threshold is reached.\n\nIf, in subsequent periods, the appraisal value rises to at least 15% more than the net carrying value, previously recorded impairment is reversed to the extent of the di/ff erence between (i) the net carrying value and (ii) /uni00A0the lower of the appraisal value and the depreciated cost (before impairment).\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

As specified above, the financial instruments held in the 'Satellite Investment Portfolios' are accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through income statement.\n\nAssets  designated  as  available  for  sale,  trading  assets, investments designated as at fair value through profit or loss and all derivatives are measured at fair value, i.e. the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, between knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm's length transaction. The Group applies the IFRS/uni00A013 fair value hierarchy.\n\nLoans which are not designated under the fair value option are accounted at amortized cost using the e/ff ective interest rate method.\n\n## IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\n\nAXA assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset or a group of financial investments at (amortized) cost or designated as available for sale should be impaired. A financial asset or group of financial investments should be impaired when there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events and this event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the assets that can be reliably estimated.\n\nFor debt instruments classified as 'held to maturity' or 'available for sale', an impairment based respectively on future cash flows discounted using the initial e/ff ective interest rate or on fair value is recorded through the income statement if future cash flows may not be fully recoverable due to a credit event relating to the instrument issuer. A downgrade of an entity's credit rating is not, of itself, evidence of impairment. If the credit risk is eliminated or improves, the impairment may be reversed. The amount of the reversal is also recognized in the income statement.\n\nFor equity instruments classified as available for sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value below its carrying value is considered as indication for potential impairment, such as equity instruments showing unrealized losses over a 6/uni00A0months period or more (prior to the closing date), or unrealized losses in excess of 20% of the net carrying value at the closing date. If such evidence exists for an available for sale financial asset, the cumulative loss - measured as the di/ff erence between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment on that financial asset already booked in the income statement - is removed from shareholders' equity and an impairment is recognized through the income statement. Equity instruments impairment recognized in the income statement cannot be reversed through the income statement until the asset is sold or derecognized.\n\nImpairment testing for loans available for sale is based on the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan's effective interest rate (down to the loan's observable market price), or on the fair value of the collateral.",

A more global test is then performed on groups of assets with similar risk profile.\n\nMethods for calculating the net book value of assets sold (average cost, first-in first-out,/uni00A0etc.) depend on local Assets and Liabilities Management (ALM) strategies as these strategies have been set up to take into account specific commitments to policyholders. These methods may di/ff er within the Group provided that they are used consistently at each entity level.\n\n## 1.8.3 Repurchase agreements and securities lending\n\nThe Group is party to repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions under which financial assets are sold to a counterparty, subject to a simultaneous agreement to repurchase these financial assets at a certain later date, at an agreed price. Since substantially all of the risks and rewards of the financial assets remain with the Group over the entire lifetime of the transaction, the Group does not derecognize the financial assets. The proceeds of the sale are reported separately. Interest expense from repurchase and security lending transactions is accrued over the duration of the agreements.\n\nAdditionally, the Group is party to total return swaps under which financial assets are sold to a counterparty with a corresponding agreement. Cash flows equal to those of the underlying assets will be remitted to the Group in exchange for specified payments taking into account any increase or decline in the fair value of the assets. This results in substantially all of the risks and rewards of the financial assets remaining with the Group. As such, the Group does not derecognize the financial assets.\n\nThe Group is also party to reverse repurchase agreements under which financial assets are purchased from a counterparty, subject to a simultaneous agreement to return these financial assets at a certain later date, at an agreed price. If substantially all of the risks and rewards of the securities remain with the counterparty over the entire lifetime of the agreement of the transaction, the securities concerned are not recognized as financial assets of the Group. The amounts of cash disbursed are recorded under financial investments, except for transactions arising from banking activities, which are recorded as separate assets. Interest income on reverse repurchase agreements is accrued over the duration of the agreements.\n\n## 1.9 ASSETS BACKING LIABILITIES ARISING FROM CONTRACTS WHERE THE FINANCIAL RISK IS BORNE BY POLICYHOLDERS\n\nAssets backing liabilities arising from insurance or investment contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders are presented in a separate aggregate of the balance sheet so that\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nthey are shown in a symmetrical manner to the corresponding liabilities. This presentation is considered more relevant for the users and consistent with the liquidity order recommended by IAS/uni00A01 for financial institutions, since the risks are borne by policyholders, whatever the type of assets backing liabilities (investment in real estate properties, debt instruments or equity instruments,/uni00A0etc.). Details of these assets are provided in the Notes.\n\n## 1.10  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\n\nDerivatives are initially recognized at fair value at purchase date and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized in the statement of income unless they relate to a qualifying hedge relationship as described below. The Group designates certain derivatives as either: (i) /uni00A0 hedging of the fair value of recognized assets or liabilities or of a firm commitment (fair value hedge), or (ii) /uni00A0hedging of highly probable expected future transactions (cash flow hedge), or (iii) /uni00A0 hedging of net investments in foreign operations.\n\nThe Group documents, at inception, the hedge relationship, as well as its Risk Management hedging objectives and strategy. The Group also documents the hedge e/ff ectiveness, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, indicating the actual or expected e/ff iciency level of the derivatives used in hedging transactions in o/ff setting changes in the fair values or cash flows of hedged underlying items.\n\n## FAIR VALUE HEDGE\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as fair value hedge are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability. Therefore, the gain or loss relating to any ine/ff ective portion is directly recognized in the income statement.\n\n## CASH FLOW HEDGE\n\nThe e/ff ective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash flow hedge is recognized in shareholders' equity. The gain or loss relating to any ine/ff ective portion is recognized in the income statement. Cumulative gain or loss in shareholders' equity is recycled in the income statement when the hedged underlying item impacts the profit or loss for the period (for example when the hedged future transaction is recognized). When a hedging instrument reaches its maturity date or is sold, or when a hedge no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, the cumulative gains or losses in shareholders' equity are released in profit or loss when the initially hedged future transaction ultimately impacts the income statement.\n\n## NET INVESTMENT HEDGE\n\nThe accounting of net investments in foreign operations hedge is similar to the accounting of cash flow hedge. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the e/ff ective portion of the hedge is recognized in shareholders' equity; the gain or loss relating to the ine/ff ective portion is recognized in the income\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

Cumulative gains and losses in shareholders' equity impact the income statement only on disposal of the foreign operations.\n\n## DERIVATIVES NOT QUALIFYING FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING\n\nChanges in the fair value of all other derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognized in the income statement. Given IAS/uni00A039 constraints, only a few hedges are eligible to hedge accounting provisions described above. However, most of the derivatives used by the Group are purchased with a view to hedge or for example to use such instruments as an alternative to gain exposure to certain asset classes through 'synthetic positions'. See Note/uni00A020.\n\nThe Group holds financial investments that also include embedded  derivatives.  Such  embedded  derivatives  are separately recorded and measured at fair value through profit or loss if the impact is deemed material.\n\nFor the statement of financial position, derivatives are presented alongside the underlying assets or liabilities for which they are used, regardless of whether these derivatives meet the criteria for hedge accounting.\n\nThe purpose and condition of the use of derivatives within the Group are detailed in Note/uni00A020.\n\n## IBOR REFORM\n\nStarting from January/uni00A01, 2019, AXA applies the amendments to IAS/uni00A039 and IFRS/uni00A07 - Temporary exceptions from applying specific hedge accounting requirements, related to Phase/uni00A01 of the IBOR reform , issued in September/uni00A02019 and endorsed by the European Union on January/uni00A015, 2020. These amendments provide temporary reliefs from applying specific hedge accounting requirements to hedging relationships directly affected by the IBOR reform and introduce corresponding disclosure requirements. The reliefs enable the concerned hedge relationships to continue despite the uncertainties with respect to the cash flows of both the hedged item and the hedging instrument arising from the transition from old interest rate benchmarks to new ones.\n\nThe amendments apply to the Group's hedging relationships directly impacted by the IBOR reform qualified as fair value hedges and cash flow hedges. Derivative instruments involved in aforementioned hedges are interest rate derivatives and foreign exchange derivatives like interest rate swaps, forward interest rate swaps, bond and foreign exchange forwards and cross currency swaps. Nominal amounts of derivative instruments a/ff ected by the IBOR reform and involved in an IAS/uni00A039 hedge accounting relationship are presented in Note/uni00A020.2.\n\nThe reliefs provided by the Phase/uni00A01 amendments cease when there is no longer uncertainty with respect to the cash flows of both the hedged item and the hedging instrument. Thus, the Group still apply the Phase/uni00A01 amendments as of December/uni00A031, 2022 to hedge relationships for which that uncertainty is not removed yet with the e/ff ective cessation of the old interest rate benchmarks.\n\nStarting from January/uni00A01, 2021, AXA applies the amendments to IAS/uni00A039, IFRS/uni00A09, IFRS/uni00A07, IFRS/uni00A04 and IFRS/uni00A016 related to Phase/uni00A02 of\n\nI\n\nI\n\nthe IBOR reform , issued in August/uni00A02020 and endorsed by the European Union in January/uni00A02021. These amendments provide a practical expedient for the situations where changes are made to contractual cash flows of financial assets and liabilities or leases, as a result of the transition from an IBOR benchmark rate to alternative benchmark rates, in the context of the ongoing riskfree rate reform. This practical expedient enables entities not to derecognise or adjust the carrying amounts of those assets and liabilities that are subject to a change with recognition of a corresponding modification gain or loss in profit or loss. In addition, the amendments provide several exceptions to the hedge accounting requirements so that entities will be able to update the designation of the hedging relationship in response to the replacement of the original benchmark rate and to continue with the hedging relationships a/f\\_t er transition to the alternative benchmark rate.\n\nThe application of the amendments has no material impact on the Group's C onsolidated F inancial S tatements and is not expected to have any material impact in the future.\n\nIn 2019, AXA initiated a group-wide project to actively manage the transition to new benchmark rates. The scoping phase took place in 2020 during which remediation guidelines were established. The implementation phase was launched in the first half of 2021. As of December/uni00A031, 2022, nearly all of inscope contracts referencing discontinued indices have been repapered by the largest entities in the Group in line with those remediation guidelines. AXA continues to remediate in-scope contracts referencing USD LIBOR settings that have not yet been discontinued.\n\n## 1.11  ASSETS/LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE AND ASSETS/LIABILITIES INCLUDING DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\nThese comprise assets, particularly buildings or operations, intended to be sold or discontinued within twelve/uni00A0months. Subsidiaries  held  for  sale  remain  within  the  scope  of consolidation until the date on which the Group loses e/ff ective control. The assets and activities (assets and liabilities) concerned are measured at the lower of net carrying value and fair value net of selling costs. They are presented in separate asset and liability items on the balance sheet.

Such contracts may also transfer financial risk from the policyholders to the insurer. Investment contracts are contracts that carry financial risk with no significant insurance risk.\n\nA number of insurance and investment contracts contain discretionary participating features. These features entitle the contract holder to receive additional benefits or bonuses on top of these standard benefits:\n\n- /uni25A0 they are likely to represent a significant portion of the overall contractual benefits;\n- /uni25A0 their amount or timing is contractually at the discretion of the Group; and\n- /uni25A0 they are contractually based on the performance of a group of contracts, the investment returns of a financial asset portfolio or the Company profits, a fund or another entity that issues the contract.\n\nIn some insurance or investment contracts, the financial risk is borne by policyholders. Such contracts are usually Unit-Linked contracts.\n\nThe Group classifies its insurance and investment contracts into six categories:\n\n- /uni25A0 liabilities arising from insurance contracts;\n- /uni25A0 liabilities arising from insurance contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders;\n- /uni25A0 liabilities arising from investment contracts with discretionary participating features;\n- /uni25A0 liabilities  arising  from  investment  contracts  with  no discretionary participating features;\n- /uni25A0 liabilities arising from investment contracts with discretionary participating features where the financial risk is borne by policyholders; these relate to Unit-Linked contracts or multifunds contracts containing a non-Unit-Linked fund with discretionary participating features; and\n- /uni25A0 liabilities  arising  from  investment  contracts  with  no discretionary participating features where the financial risk is borne by policyholders.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

Post claims reserves are generally not discounted, except in limited cases (a detail of discounted reserves is shown in Note/uni00A014.10).\n\n## PRE-CLAIMS RESERVES\n\nUnearned premiums reserves of non-life insurance contracts represent the prorata portion of written premiums that relates to unexpired risks at the closing date.\n\nFor traditional life insurance contracts (that is, contracts with significant mortality or morbidity risk), the future policy benefits reserves are calculated on a prospective basis according to each country's regulation provided methods used are consistent with the Group's policies and using assumptions on investment yields, morbidity/mortality and expenses.\n\nChanges in reserves are booked if there are impacts caused by a change in the mortality table.\n\nFuture policy benefits reserves relating to investment contracts with discretionary participation features (previously called 'savings contracts' in AXA's accounting principles) that carry low mortality and morbidity risk are generally calculated using a prospective approach based on discount rates usually set at inception with reserves similar to the retrospective approach ( i.e. 'account balance' methodology).\n\nThe discount rates used by AXA are less than or equal to the expected future investment yields (assessed on prudent basis).\n\nPart of the policyholders participation reserve is included in future policy benefits reserves, according to contractual clauses. Except when these guarantees are covered by a Risk Management program using derivative instruments (see next\n\nI\n\nI\n\nparagraph), guaranteed minimum benefits reserves relating to contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders (insurance contracts because they include such guarantees or investment contracts with discretionary participating features), are built over the life of the contract based on a prospective approach: the present value of future benefit obligations to be paid to policyholders in relation to these guarantees is estimated on the basis of reasonable scenarios. These scenarios are based on assumptions including investment returns, volatility, surrender and mortality rates. This present value of future benefit obligations is reserved as fees are collected over the life of the contracts.\n\nSome guaranteed benefits such as Guaranteed Minimum Death or Income Benefits (GMDB or GMIB), or certain guarantees on return proposed by reinsurance treaties, are covered by a Risk Management program using derivative instruments. In order to minimize the accounting mismatch between liabilities and hedging derivatives, AXA has chosen to use the option allowed under IFRS/uni00A04.24 to re-measure its provisions: this revaluation is carried out at each account closing based on guarantee level projections and considers interest rates and other market assumptions. The liabilities revaluation impact in the current period is recognized through income, symmetrically with the impact of the change in value of hedging derivatives. This change in accounting principles was adopted on the first time application of IFRS on January/uni00A01, 2004, for contract portfolios covered by the Risk Management program at that date. Any additional contract portfolios covered by the Risk Management program a/f\\_t er this date are valued on the same terms as those that applied on the date the program was first applied.\n\n## POST CLAIMS RESERVES\n\n## Claims reserves (life and non-life contracts)\n\nThe purpose of claims reserves is to cover the ultimate cost of settling an insurance claim. Claims reserves are generally not discounted, except in cases such as disability annuities.\n\nClaims reserves include the claims incurred and reported, claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) as well as claims handling costs. Claims reserves are based on historical claims data, current trends, actual payment patterns for all insurance business lines as well as expected changes in inflation, regulatory environment or anything else that could impact amounts to be paid.\n\n## Shadow accounting and Deferred policyholders Participation Asset (DPA) or Liability (DPL)\n\nIn compliance with the option in IFRS/uni00A04, shadow accounting is applied to insurance and investment contracts with discretionary participating features. Shadow accounting includes adjustments to technical liabilities, policyholders participation, other obligations, deferred acquisition costs and value of business in force to take into account unrealized gains or losses on insurance",

        "page_content": "liabilities or assets in the same way as it is done for a realized gain or loss of invested assets.\n\nFor example, for contracts with discretionary participating features,  shadow  accounting  consists  in  recognizing policyholders participation in unrealized capital gains and losses. Thus, when an unrealized gain is recognized, a deferred participating liability (DPL) is recorded. In case of an unrealized loss, a deferred participating asset (DPA) should be recognized only in the extent that its recoverability as defined below is highly probable. Deferred participating liabilities and assets are calculated using an appropriate long-term participation rate based on a contractual, regulatory and constructive obligation to allocate a percentage of gains/losses to policyholders. Jurisdictions where participating business is significant are Switzerland (for group insurance policies), Germany and France where the minimum is set to 90%, 90% and 85% respectively, of a basis which may include not only financial income but also other components. Participating business is less prevalent in Japan.\n\nDPL is fully recognized in the liabilities. As a consequence, there is no component recognized as an equity component and AXA does not need to ensure the liability recognized for the whole contract is not less than the amount that would result from applying IAS/uni00A039 to the guaranteed element.\n\nWhen a net unrealized loss (unrealized change in fair value, impairment, expense related\u2026) is accounted, a deferred participating asset (DPA) may be recognized only to the extent that it is highly probable that it can be charged to policyholders, by entity, in the future. This could be the case if the DPA can be offset against future participation either directly through deduction of the DPL from future capital gains or the DPL netted against value of businesses in force or indirectly through deduction of future fees on premiums or margins.\n\nUnrealized gains and losses on assets classified as trading or designated at fair value through profit and loss, along with any other entry impacting the income statement and generating a timing difference, are accounted for through the income statement with a corresponding shadow entry adjustment also in the statement of income. The shadow accounting adjustments relating to unrealized gains and losses on assets available for sale (for which change in fair value is taken to shareholders' equity) are booked through shareholders' equity.\n\n## Recoverability tests and liability adequacy test (LAT)\n\n## Deferred participation\n\nWhen a net deferred participation asset is recognized, the Group uses liquidity analyses performed by the entities to assess the capacity to hold assets showing unrealized loss position, if any, generating such debits. The Group then performs projections to compare the value of assets backing policyholders' contracts with expected payments to be made to policyholders.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Liability adequacy test\n\nIn addition, at each balance sheet date, liability adequacy tests are performed in each consolidated entity in order to ensure the adequacy of the contract liabilities net of related DAC and VBI assets and deferred policyholders' participation asset. To perform these tests, entities group contracts together according to how they have been acquired, are serviced and have their profitability measured. Entities use current best estimates of all future contractual cash flows as well as claims handling and administrative expenses, and take into account guarantees and investment yields relating to assets backing these contracts:\n\n- /uni25A0 such tests are based on the intention and capacity of entities to hold financial assets according to various sets of scenarios, excluding the value of new business;\n- /uni25A0 they include projections of future investments sales according to estimated surrender patterns; and\n- /uni25A0 they determine the extent to which resulting gains/losses may be allocated/charged to policyholders, i.e. profit sharing between policyholders and shareholders.\n\nThese tests therefore measure the capacity to charge estimated future losses to policyholders on the basis of the assessment of the holding horizon and potential realization of losses among unrealized losses existing at closing date.\n\nContract specific risks directly related to the contracts (insurance risk, asset return risk, inflation risk, persistency, adverse selection,/uni00A0etc.) are also considered.\n\nDepending on the type of business, the future investment cash flows and discounting may be based on a deterministic best estimate rate, with corresponding participation, or in the case of Guaranteed Minimum Benefits, stochastic scenarios. Testing is performed either by a comparison of the reserve booked net of related assets (DAC, VBI,/uni00A0etc.) directly with discounted cash flows, or by ensuring that the discounted profit net of participation from release of the technical provisions exceeds net related assets.\n\nAny identified deficiency is charged to the income statement, initially by respectively writing off DPA, DAC or VBI, and subsequently by establishing a LAT provision for losses arising from the liability adequacy test for any amount in excess of DPA, DAC and VBI. For non-life insurance contracts, an unexpired risk provision is recognized for contracts on which the premiums are expected to be insu/ff icient to cover expected future claims and claims expenses.\n\n## Embedded derivatives in insurance and investment contracts with discretionary participating features\n\nEmbedded derivatives that meet the definition of an insurance contract or correspond to options to surrender insurance contracts for a set amount (or based on a fixed amount and an interest rate) are not separately measured. All other embedded derivatives are bifurcated and booked at fair value when material (with change in fair value recognized through income statement)\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

These cash flows shall rather be recognized as deposits and withdrawals.\n\nThis category includes mainly Unit-Linked contracts that do not meet the definition of insurance or investment contracts with discretionary participating features. For these Unit-Linked contracts, the liabilities are valued at current unit value, i.e. on the basis of the fair value of the financial investments backing those contracts at the balance sheet date together with rights to future management fees, also known as Deferred Origination Costs (DOC, described in paragraph/uni00A01.7.3).\n\n## UNEARNED FEES RESERVES\n\nFees received at inception of an investment contract with no discretionary participating features to cover future services are recognized as liabilities and accounted in the income statement based on the same amortization pattern as the one used for deferred origination costs.\n\n## 1.15  REINSURANCE\n\nThe Group assumes and cedes reinsurance in the normal course of business. Assumed reinsurance refers to the Group's acceptance of certain insurance risks that other companies have underwritten. Ceded reinsurance refers to the transfer of insurance risk, along with the related premiums, to other reinsurers who will assume the risks. Indeed, in the normal course of business, the Group seeks to reduce the potential amount of loss arising from claims events by reinsuring certain levels of risk assumed in various areas of exposure with other insurers or reinsurers.\n\nWhen these contracts meet the insurance contracts classification requirements, transactions relating to reinsurance are accounted for in the balance sheet and income statement in a similar way to direct business transactions in agreement with contractual clauses. Reinsurance premiums ceded are expensed (and any commissions recorded thereon are earned) on a monthly prorata basis over the period the reinsurance coverage is provided. Ceded unearned reinsurance premiums represent the portion of premiums ceded applicable to the unexpired term of policies in\n\nI\n\nI\n\nforce. Reinstatement premiums ceded are recognized at the time a loss event occurs where coverage limits for the remaining life of the contract are reinstated under pre-defined contract terms and are fully expensed when recognized. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured policy. Provisions are made for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance.\n\nIf a reinsurance asset is impaired, the Group reduces the carrying amount accordingly and recognizes that impairment loss in the income statement. A reinsurance asset is impaired if there is objective evidence, as a result of an event that occurred a/f\\_t er initial recognition of the reinsurance assets, that the Group may not receive all amounts due to it under the terms of the contract, and the event has a reliably measurable impact on the amounts that the Group will receive from the reinsurer.\n\nIf the Group determines that reinsurance contracts do not meet the insurance contracts definition and/or principally transfers financial risk, the agreement is recorded using the deposit method of accounting. Deposits received are included in payables and deposits made are included within receivables. As amounts are paid or received, consistent with the underlying contracts, the deposit assets or liabilities are adjusted as appropriate.\n\n## 1.16  FINANCING DEBT\n\nFinancing debt issued to finance the solvency requirements of operational entities or to acquire a portfolio of contracts is isolated in a specific aggregate of the statement of financial position and is accounted for at amortized cost.\n\n## 1.17  OTHER LIABILITIES\n\n## 1.17.1 Income taxes\n\nThe current income tax expense (benefit) is recorded in the income statement on the basis of local tax regulations.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities emerge from temporary di/ff erences between the accounting and fiscal values of assets and liabilities, and when applicable from tax loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available to o/ff set the temporary di/ff erences taking into account the existence of tax groups and any legal or regulatory requirements on the limits (in terms of amounts or timing) relating to the carry forwards of unused tax credits. The recoverability of deferred tax assets recognized in previous periods is re-assessed at each closing.\n\nIn particular, a deferred tax liability is recognized for any taxable temporary di/ff erence relating to the value of shares in a consolidated company held, unless the Group controls at what date the temporary di/ff erence will reverse and it is probable",

If a Group company decides to sell its stake in another consolidated entity, the di/ff erence between the carrying value and the tax value of these shares for the company that holds them leads to the recognition of deferred tax (including as part of a business combination when the Group as the buyer intends to sell or carry out internal restructuring of the shares following the acquisition). The same approach applies to dividend payments that have been voted or deemed likely, to the extent that a tax on dividends will be due.\n\nDeferred taxes for taxable temporary di/ff erences relating to tax deductible goodwill are recognized to the extent they do not arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. These deferred taxes are only released if the goodwill is impaired or if the corresponding consolidated shares are sold.\n\nThe measurement of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets reflects the expected tax impact, at the balance sheet date. That would follow the way the Group expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. When income taxes are calculated at a di/ff erent rate if dividends are paid, deferred taxes are measured at the tax rate applicable to undistributed profits. The income tax consequences of dividends are only accounted when a liability to pay the dividend is recognized.\n\n## 1.17.2 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits\n\nPensions and other post-retirement benefits include the benefits payable to AXA Group employees after they retire (retirement compensation, additional pension benefit, health insurance). In order to meet those obligations, some regulatory frameworks have allowed or enforced the set up of dedicated funds (plan assets).\n\nDefined contribution plans: payments are made by the employer to a third party ( e.g. pension trusts). These payments free the employer of any further commitment, and the obligation to pay acquired benefits to the employees is transferred. The contributions paid by the employer are recorded as an expense in the income statement and no liability needs to be recorded once contributions are made.\n\nDefined benefit plans: an actuarial assessment of the commitments based on each plan's internal rules is performed. The present value of the future benefits paid by the employer, known as the DBO (Defined Benefit Obligation), is calculated annually on the basis of long-term projections of rate of salary increase, inflation rate, mortality, staff turnover, pension indexation and remaining service lifetime. The amount recorded in the balance sheet for defined benefit plans is the di/ff erence between the present value of the Defined Benefit Obligation and the market value at the balance sheet date of the corresponding invested plan assets a/f\\_t er adjustment for any minimum funding requirement or any asset ceiling e/ff ect. If the net result is positive,\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\na provision is recorded under the provision for risks and charges heading. If the net result is negative, a prepaid pension asset is recorded in the balance sheet but not more than its recoverable amount (asset ceiling). Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized in shareholders' equity (in Other Comprehensive Income) in full in the period in which they occur. Similarly, the actual return on assets and any change in asset ceiling, excluding the net interest income on assets, is recognized in shareholders' equity. The regular impact in the income statement mainly relates to the current service cost (annually accruing employee benefit) and the net interest on the amount recorded in the opening balance sheet (unwinding of discount applied to the net liability/asset at start of the annual period, taking into account contributions and benefits payments during the period). Past service cost represents the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation resulting from a plan amendment or curtailment to a defined benefit plan. It is recognized totally and immediately in the income statement when incurred. Gains and losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan also have an impact in the income statement when the settlement occurs.\n\nIt should be noted that, all cumulative past actuarial gains and losses on all employee benefit plans were recognized in retained earnings as of January/uni00A01, 2004, AXA Group's transition date.\n\n## 1.17.3 Share-based compensation plans\n\nThe Group's share-based compensation plans are predominantly settled in equities.\n\nAll equity-settled share-based compensation plans are accounted for at fair value at the date they were granted and\n\nthe fair value is expensed over the vesting period.\n\nCash-settled share-based compensation plans are recognized at fair value, which is remeasured at each balance sheet date with any change in fair value recognized in the statement of income.\n\nThe AXA Shareplan issued under a specific French regulatory framework includes a traditional and a leveraged formula (with an application subject to specific local regulations within the Group).\n\n## 1.18  PROVISIONS FOR RISKS, CHARGES AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\n\n## 1.18.1 Restructuring costs\n\nRestructuring provisions other than those that may be recognized on the balance sheet of an acquired company on the acquisition date are recorded when the Group has a present obligation evidenced by a binding sale agreement or a detailed formal plan whose main features are announced to those a/ff ected or to their representatives.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

Provisions are not recognized for future operating losses. The same applies to contingent liabilities, except if identified at the time of a business combination (see paragraph/uni00A01.3.2).\n\nProvisions are measured at management's best estimate, at the balance sheet date, of the expenditure required to settle the obligation, discounted at the market risk-free rate of return for long term provisions.\n\n## 1.19  REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\n## 1.19.1 Gross written premiums\n\nGross written premiums correspond to the amount of premiums written by insurance and reinsurance companies on business incepted in the year with respect to both insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participating features, net of cancellations and gross of reinsurance ceded. For reinsurance, premiums are recorded on the basis of declarations made by the ceding company, and may include estimates of gross written premiums. Any subsequent di/ff erences arising on such estimates are recorded in the period they are determined. For multi-year reinsurance treaties which are payable in annual installments, generally, only the initial annual installment is included as premiums written at policy inception due to the ability of the reinsured to commute or cancel coverage during the term of the policy. The remaining annual installments are included as premiums written at each successive anniversary date within the multi-year term.\n\nReinstatement premiums are recognized at the time a loss event occurs where coverage limits for the remaining life of the contract are reinstated under pre-defined contract terms and are fully earned when recognized.\n\nRetroactive loss portfolio transfer contracts are evaluated to determine whether they meet the established criteria for reinsurance accounting, and, if so, at inception, written premiums are fully earned and corresponding losses and loss expense recognized. The contracts can cause significant variances in gross premiums written, net premiums written, net premiums earned, and net incurred losses in the years in which they are written.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## 1.19.2 Fees and revenues from investment contracts with no discretionary participating features\n\nAmounts collected as premiums from investment contracts with no discretionary participating features are reported as deposits net of any loadings and policy fees. Revenues from these contracts consist of loadings and policy fees relating to underwriting, investment management, administration and surrender of the contracts during the period. Front-end fees collected corresponding to fees for future services are recognized over the estimated life of the contract (see 'Unearned fees reserves' paragraph/uni00A01.14.3).\n\n## 1.19.3 Deposit accounting\n\nInvestment contracts with no discretionary participating features fall within the scope of IAS/uni00A039. Deposit accounting applies to these contracts, which involves the following:\n\n- /uni25A0 the Group directly recognizes the consideration received (apart from potential fees) as a deposit financial liability rather than as revenues;\n- /uni25A0 claims paid are recognized as withdrawals with no posting in the income statement apart from potential fees.\n\n## 1.19.4 Unbundling\n\nThe Group unbundles the deposit component of contracts when required by IFRS/uni00A04, i.e. when both the following conditions are met:\n\n- /uni25A0 the Group can measure separately the 'deposit' component (including any embedded surrender option, i.e. without taking into account the 'insurance' component);\n- /uni25A0 the Group accounting methods do not otherwise require the recognition of all obligations and rights arising from the 'deposit' component.\n\nNo such situation currently exists within the Group. In accordance with IFRS/uni00A04, the Group continues to use the accounting principles previously applied by AXA to insurance contracts and investment contracts with discretionary participating features. According to these principles, all rights and obligations related to contracts are recognized.\n\n## 1.19.5 Change in unearned premiums reserves net of unearned revenues and/uni00A0fees\n\nChanges in unearned premium reserves net of unearned revenues and fees include both the change in the unearned premiums reserve reported as a liability (see 'Unearned premiums reserves' in paragraph/uni00A01.14.2) and the change in unearned revenues and fees. Unearned revenues and fees correspond to upfront charges for future services recognized over the estimated life of insurance and investment contracts with discretionary participating features (see 'Unearned revenues",

In particular, as asset management entities of the Group deliver investment management services to their clients, revenue for providing this service may theoretically occur over-time, with a time-based measure of progress, which is relevant as the service is provided continuously over the contract period. However, according to IFRS/uni00A015, revenue is recognized only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. As a result, as management fees and performance fees received by the Group are generally calculated based on a percentage of assets under management (AUM), they are considered as variable considerations, which are subject to market volatility and are recognized only when uncertainty is resolved.\n\n## 1.19.8 Net investment result excluding financing expenses\n\nNet investment result includes:\n\n- /uni25A0 investment income from investments other than from banking activities, net of depreciation expense on real estate investments (depreciation expense relating to owner occupied properties is included in 'administrative expenses'); this item includes interest received calculated using the e/ff ective interest method for debt instruments and dividends received on equity instruments;\n- /uni25A0 investment management expenses (excluding financing debt expenses);\n- /uni25A0 realized investment gains and losses net of releases of impairment following sales;\n- /uni25A0 the change in unrealized gains and losses on invested assets measured at fair value through profit or loss; and\n- /uni25A0 the change in impairment of investments (excluding releases of impairment following sales).\n\nIn respect of banking activities, interest income and expenses are included in the 'Net revenue from banking activities' (see paragraph/uni00A01.19.6).\n\n## 1.20  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\n\nSubsequent events relate to events that occur between the balance sheet date and the date when the financial statements are authorized for issue:\n\n- /uni25A0 such events lead to an adjustment of the Consolidated Financial Statements if they provide evidence of conditions that existed at the balance sheet date;\n- /uni25A0 such events result in additional disclosures if indicative of conditions that arose after the balance sheet date, and if relevant and material.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

Structured entities often have a narrow and well-defined objective or restricted activities.\n\nThe Group does not hold significant interests in unconsolidated insurance/reinsurance structured entities.\n\nFurthermore, given its insurance business, the Group holds direct investments in corporates of various sectors, such as debt instruments, equity securities and loans. These investments are not designed to be done in structured entities and the whole Group's exposure is reflected on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nIn addition, the Group holds interests in investment funds including real estate companies. Some of these funds are fully consolidated or accounted for using the equity method (see\n\nI\n\nI\n\nNote/uni00A02.1.). Other funds are not consolidated because they are not controlled or under significant influence. By nature, and notably because of the power of decision usually given to the asset managers (internal or external to AXA), most of these funds are structured entities.\n\nAs investor, AXA's interests in unconsolidated funds are limited to the investments held. These ones are fully recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. Depending on the nature of its investment, AXA receives interests or dividends and can realize capital gains or losses in case of sale. These investments are subject to impairment testing as any financial asset.\n\nThe Group's asset manager companies also receive fees for the services they provide when they manage investment funds. Some unconsolidated funds managed by the Group are partially or fully held by external investors.\n\nInformation on these unconsolidated investment funds are provided in di/ff erent sections of this Annual Report:\n\n- /uni25A0 Section/uni00A01.1 'Key figures': AXA's total assets under management including assets managed on behalf of third parties;\n- /uni25A0 Section/uni00A02.3 'Activity Report';\n- /uni25A0 Section/uni00A06.6 'Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements':\n- \u00b7 Note/uni00A09 'Investments' with the breakdown of investments and detail on non-consolidated investment funds in Note/uni00A09.8,\n- \u00b7 Note/uni00A0 22 'Net investment result excluding financing expenses'.",

For AXA Belgium the recoverability of the goodwill is assessed using the value in use approach. Both approaches are described in the Note/uni00A01 'Accounting principles'.\n\nFor the CGUs within the Property & Casualty business segment, recoverability of goodwill is also assessed using the value in use approach, as described in the note/uni00A01. For AXA Investment Managers the recoverability of the goodwill follows a market approach  with  recoverable  value  derived  from  market information, such as the price to earnings ratio of peers, and the earnings expected for the year. This methodology represents the fair value of the Company to be compared with the market capitalization.\n\n## MAIN ASSUMPTIONS\n\nFor the CGUs within the Property & Casualty business segment, the value in use approach relies on the earnings of the strategic plan approved by management discounted using a risk adjusted rate. Cash flows beyond that period are extrapolated using sustainable perpetual growth rates assumed to be achievable over the long term to derive a terminal value. The earnings included in the business plan of each CGU are agreed with the management and defined locally considering best estimate operating assumptions, including expenses and loss ratios, investment income, economic capital, premium rates and taxes, all compliant with the various standards and the requirements\n\nof supervisory authorities, when applicable. The discount rates used for the valuation have been derived using the Capital Asset Pricing Model which includes assumptions for risk-free interest rates, equity risk premiums, insurance activity beta and leverage ratio that are consistent with the view of AXA's Management for the specific markets in which the CGU operates. The main CGUs discount rates range from 3.6% to 10.1% in 2022, compared to a range of 3.6% to 8.3% in 2021, and growth rates applied beyond the strategic plan horizon, where applicable, vary from 0.6% to 7.1% in 2022, compared to a range of 0.6% to 5.3% in 2021.\n\nFor Life & Savings CGUs, recoverable amounts are calculated using a risk neutral approach, relying on European Embedded Value (EEV) techniques, that are industry specific and widely used. The EEV represents the excess of the market value of assets over the market value of liabilities. The market value of liabilities is based on best estimate liabilities which are the probability weighted average of future cash flows adjusted to allow for the time value of money, using the relevant term structure of the riskfree interest rates, as well as for deviations related to the cost of non-hedgeable, i.e. non-financial, risks. The calculation of best estimate liabilities involves the use of operational and economic assumptions. Operational assumptions include factors, such as mortality, morbidity and lapse/surrender rates, expenses allowance and taxes, all compliant with the requirements of supervisory authorities. Future cash flows are discounted using reference rates that are compliant with EIOPA specifications of using swap rates adjusted for credit and volatility risk. The table below shows the adjustments in basis points by currency:\n\n| Reference Yield Curve (in bps)    |   EUR | GBP   |   USD |   JPY | CHF   |   HKD |\n|-----------------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Volatility adjustment (added)     |    19 | 24    |    52 |     2 | (3)   |     3 |\n| Credit risk adjustment (deducted) |    10 | -     |    10 |    10 | 10    |    10 |\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

The discount rate used to determine the recoverable value of AXA Belgium was 6.0% in 2022 as opposed to 4.4% used in 2021.\n\n## ALL CASH-GENERATING UNITS (CGU)\n\nThe results of cash flow projections exceed the carrying amount of each related CGU or group of units.\n\nThe test of the recoverability of goodwill for AXA XL CGU as of December/uni00A031, 2022 evidenced a significant margin. The value in use basis reflects management projections of the cash flows, which are based on the business plan of AXA XL, reflecting strong earnings delivery in recent years driven by significant tari/ff  increases and disciplined growth, combined with further reductions in Nat Cat exposure to reduce earnings volatility. Sensitivities were performed with regards to the main assumptions and under the plausible scenarios, the value in use still exceeded the carrying amount.\n\nThe test of the recoverability of the Goodwill for AXA Germany P&C and AXA UK & Ireland P&C CGUs as of December/uni00A031, 2022 evidenced material margins. Cash flows projections based on the 2023 business plan approved by the AXA Group management, demonstrate that AXA Germany and AXA UK & Ireland will\n\ncontinue to deliver resilient earnings leading to conclude that their goodwill is recoverable.\n\nThe recoverability of the goodwill of Japan Life & Savings CGU relies on European Embedded Value (EEV) and New Business Value (NBV) projections using a reasonable new business multiple, derived from market consistent assumptions. The level of profitability of products sold by AXA Japan in 2022 reached a high margin over the premiums received. The EEV and NBV projections exceeds the carrying amount of Japan Life & Savings CGU.\n\nFor all CGUs, to the extent that the valuation of securities and interest rate levels remain low for prolonged periods of time, or volatility and other market conditions stagnate or worsen, new business volumes and profitability together with the value of the inforce portfolio are likely be negatively a/ff ected. In addition, the future cash flow expectations from both the inforce and new business and other assumptions underlying management's current business plans could be negatively impacted by other risks to which the Group is exposed. For each CGU, sensitivity analyses were performed with regards to the discount rate: an increase of 0.5% in the discount rate would not lead to an impairment loss for any of the CGUs as the recoverable amount for each CGU would still exceed its carrying value.\n\nHowever, subsequent impairment tests may be based upon di/ff erent assumptions and future cash flow projections, which may result in an impairment of these assets in the foreseeable future.\n\n## 5.3 OTHER INFORMATION RELATING TO GOODWILL, ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS OF/uni00A0SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## 5.3.1 Singapore operations disposal\n\nOn February/uni00A011, 2022, AXA completed the sale of its insurance operations in Singapore to HSBC, for a total cash consideration of \u20ac463/uni00A0million.\n\nThe transaction resulted in an overall loss of \u20ac-235/uni00A0million of which \u20ac-230/uni00A0million were already recognized as of December/uni00A031, 2021.

E/ff ective maturities may di/ff er from those presented, mainly because some assets include clauses allowing early redemption, with or without penalty or duration extension features. In some cases, the effect of derivatives (detailed in Note/uni00A020.3) modifies the maturity profile of assets presented below.\n\nDebt instruments (at cost) that are not quoted in an active market and loans and debt instruments backing contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders are excluded from the table below.

As substantially all of the risks and rewards of the financial assets remain with the Group over the entire lifetime of the transaction, the Group does not derecognize the financial assets. The proceeds of the sale are reported separately in the line item payable - Collateral debts relating to investments\n\nunder lending agreements and equivalent. Interest expense from repurchase and security lending transactions is accrued over the duration of the agreements.\n\nAdditionally, the Group is party to total return swaps where financial assets are sold to a counterparty with an agreement in which the Group retains substantially all the risk and rewards of the financial instruments. Therefore, the Group doesn't derecognize the assets.\n\nThe breakdown of transferred financial assets/liabilities not qualifying for derecognition was as follows:\n\n|                                                       | December/uni00A031, 2022                                              | December/uni00A031, 2022               | December/uni00A031, 2022                  | December/uni00A031, 2021                                              | December/uni00A031, 2021               | December/uni00A031, 2021                  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| (in Euro million)                                     | Debt  instruments  designated  at fair value  through profit  or loss | Debt  instruments  available for  sale | Debt  instruments  -

Such assets are categorized in the level/uni00A01 of the IFRS/uni00A013 fair value hierarchy.\n\nLevel/uni00A02 and 3 assets are investments which are not quoted in an active market or for which there is no active market. Fair values for level/uni00A02 and 3 assets include:\n\n- /uni25A0 values provided by external parties which:\n- \u00b7 are readily available including last transaction prices but relate to assets for which the market is not always active, or\n- \u00b7 are provided at the request of the Group by pricing services and which are not readily publicly available;\n- /uni25A0 assets measured on the basis of valuation techniques including a varying degree of assumptions supported by market transactions and observable data.\n\nThe common characteristic of level/uni00A02 and 3 assets is that their markets are considered as less active. Their value is generally based on mark to market basis, except when there is no market or when the market is distressed, in which case a mark to model approach is used. Assets not quoted in an active market which are marked to market mainly using observable inputs are classified in level/uni00A02. Assets not quoted in an active market for which fair value determination is not mainly based on observable inputs are classified as level/uni00A03. For all assets not quoted in an active market/no active market and for which a mark to model approach is used, the classification between level/uni00A02 and level/uni00A03 depends on the proportion of assumptions used supported by market transactions and market observable data:\n\n- /uni25A0 assumed to be used by pricing services or;\n- /uni25A0 used by the Group in the limited cases of application of mark to model valuations.\n\n## Fair values determined in whole directly by reference to an active market (level/uni00A01)\n\nDuring 2022, the global economic turmoil has led to a significant rise in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, the widening of the bid/ask spread across the board, leading to transfers from Level/uni00A01 to Level/uni00A02.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2022, the net transfer from level/uni00A02 to level/uni00A01 amounted to \u20ac-6,602/uni00A0million. This amount comprised \u20ac3,675/uni00A0 million  transferred  from  level/uni00A0 2  to  level/uni00A0 1,  and \u20ac10,277/uni00A0million from level/uni00A01 to level/uni00A02, of which \u20ac7,180/uni00A0million for corporate bonds and \u20ac2,368/uni00A0million for government bonds.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## Fair values of assets not quoted in an active market - no active markets (level/uni00A02 and level/uni00A03)\n\n## Overview of the nature of such investments\n\nAmounts presented in level/uni00A02 and 3 represent a variety of circumstances. A financial instrument is regarded as not quoted in an active market if there is little observation of transaction prices as an inherent characteristic of the instrument, when there is a significant decline in the volume and level of trading activity, in case of significant illiquidity or if observable prices cannot be considered as representing fair value because of dislocated market conditions. Characteristics of inactive markets can therefore be very di/ff erent in nature, inherent to the instrument or be indicative of a change in the conditions prevailing in certain markets.\n\nThe identification of level/uni00A03 assets among assets not quoted in an active market involves a significant level of judgment. The following are considered as observable: inputs provided by external pricing services, information observable obtained from specialized data providers, rating agencies, external surveys. The extent to which such data are external to the Group and not assessed by internal valuation teams is one of the main criteria applied in assessing whether data are observable or not. Should those data be significantly adjusted or would they be outdated because of the lack of newly available factors, such inputs would be deemed unobservable. Another area of judgment is the assessment of the significance of an input against the fair value measurement in its entirety. As a result, a di/ff erent cut between observable and unobservable data and variances in the weighting of the significance of each input against the fair value measurement in its entirety could produce a different categorization.\n\nAssets such as certain unquoted debt instruments, some instruments issued on private markets such as private equity instruments or private loans were always considered as not quoted in active markets as an inherent characteristic of these investments and were included as assets not quoted in active markets/no active markets in all periods presented. Valuations are based either on external pricing providers or internal models using techniques commonly used by market participants. Valuation teams make the maximum use of current transaction prices (if any) and observable data but some of the underlying sectors to which the investments relate may be so particular that significant adjustments are performed or unobservable data are used. Private equity funds of funds are measured on the basis of the latest net asset values of funds provided to the Group.",

Specifics to the valuation of investments are further described in Note/uni00A09.10.1 and the same principles apply to the fair value of investments at amortized cost.\n\nGenerally fair values of investments in real estate properties cannot be determined via reference to quotes of an active market from an exchange market or service provider and no property is therefore categorized in level/uni00A01. However, AXA's investments in real estate properties are mostly physically located within liquid markets with identical or comparable asset sales. Given the regulatory environment, some real estate properties located in markets such us France are valued by experts using very similar approaches leading to very limited dispersion in prices, with a majority of market inputs themselves homogeneous in terms of sources and values. Hence, the Group, consistently with the policy described in Note/uni00A01.5 which notably considers, for assets\n\nnot quoted in an active market, the weight of observable inputs in the valuation, concludes that the fair value calculations, which are based on valuations performed by qualified property appraisers mainly based on market observable inputs, are considered as level/uni00A02 fair values. However, as described in Note/uni00A01.5 and Note/uni00A09.10.1, the assessment of the significance of an input against the fair value measurement in its entirety involves judgment and a di/ff erent weighting could produce a di/ff erent categorization.\n\nThe fair values of debt instruments and loans at cost are determined with consideration of market inputs to the extent possible. For level/uni00A02 instruments, the fair value is mainly derived using valuation techniques based upon observable market interest rate curves. For level/uni00A03 instruments, the fair values of debt instruments and loans at cost are determined by valuation techniques using limited observable market data.\n\n## 9.11  INVESTMENTS BACKING CONTRACTS WHERE THE FINANCIAL RISK IS BORNE BY/uni00A0POLICYHOLDERS\n\n| (in Euro million)                                      | December/uni00A031, 2022 Fair value/uni00A0 (a)   | December/uni00A031, 2021 Fair value/uni00A0 (a)   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Investment in real estate properties                   | 4,740                                             | 4,673                                             |\n| Equity instruments & non-consolidated investment funds | 63,632                                            | 72,629                                            |\n| Debt instruments                                       | 7,268                                             | 8,671                                             |\n| Others                                                 | 826                                               | 343                                               |\n| TOTAL INSURANCE ACTIVITIES                             | 76,467                                            | 86,315                                            |\n\n(a) Fair value equals carrying value.\n\nFinancial assets included in these investments are valued at fair value through profit or loss under the fair value option.\n\nI\n\nI",

During this deferral period, additional disclosures related to SPPI criterion and to credit risk exposure are required.\n\nTo determine the appropriate classification of financial assets under IFRS/uni00A09, an entity would need to assess the contractual cash flows characteristics of any financial asset. Indeed, the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise, on specified dates, to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding i.e. cash flows that are consistent with a basic lending arrangement. In a basic lending arrangement, consideration for the time value of money and credit risk are typically the most significant elements of interest.\n\nIFRS/uni00A09 defines the terms 'principal' as being the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition, and the 'interest' as being compensation for (i) /uni00A0the time value of money, and (ii) /uni00A0the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time.\n\nThe tables below set out the result of the SPPI test for the assets not currently designated as at fair value through profit and loss, with a split between Insurance and Other activities.\n\nEach investment item is presented gross of tax and excluding the e/ff  ect of related hedging derivatives (IAS/uni00A039 qualifying hedges or economic hedges) and the potential impact resulting from the application of the future IFRS/uni00A017/uni00A0standard on insurance contracts that will avoid accounting mismatches in particular for contracts eligible to the variable fee approach measurement model.\n\n## INSURANCE\n\n|                                                                   | December/uni00A031, 2022   | December/uni00A031, 2022                     | December/uni00A031, 2022   | December/uni00A031, 2022                     | December/uni00A031, 2021   | December/uni00A031, 2021                     | December/uni00A031, 2021   | December/uni00A031, 2021                     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                   | Fail the SPPI test         | Fail the SPPI test                           | Pass the SPPI test         | Pass the SPPI test                           | Fail the SPPI test         | Fail the SPPI test                           | Pass the SPPI test         | Pass the SPPI test                           |\n| (in Euro million)                                                 | Fair  value                | Change in  unrealized  gain or loss  in 2022 | Fair  value                | Change in  unrealized  gain or loss  in 2022 | Fair  value                | Change in  unrealized  gain or loss  in 2021 | Fair  value                | Change in  unrealized  gain or loss  in 2021 |\n| Debt instruments held to maturity                                 | -

All contracts concerned are insurance contracts as defined by IFRS.\n\nThe first line labelled 'Gross reserves for unpaid claims and claims expenses developed initially at the booking date' represents the loss reserves developed in the Group's balance sheet on the reporting date for the year indicated in the column heading. For example, the amount of \u20ac46,440/uni00A0million appearing in the first line of the table in the 2012 column represents all loss reserves developed in all years of occurrence prior to and including 2012, recognized on the Group's balance sheet as of December/uni00A031, 2012.\n\nThe second line titled 'Gross reserves for unpaid claims and claims expenses developed in 2022 adjusted for changes in exchange rates and scope of consolidation' indicates the amount that would have been developed initially at the booking date, had the exchange rates for the current year been used (for reserves recognized by AXA Group entities that do not use the Euro as their functional currency) and assuming an identical\n\nscope of consolidation to that used for the last diagonal of the table.\n\nThe first section of the table entitled 'Cumulative payments' shows, for a given column N, the cumulative amount of payments related to years of occurrence prior to and including N, made since December/uni00A031 of year N-1.\n\nThe second part of the table entitled 'Reserve re-estimated' shows, for a given column N, an estimate of the final cost of liabilities carried as of December/uni00A031 of year N in respect of all years of occurrence prior to and including N, at each future period end. The final cost estimate varies year on year as information relating to losses still outstanding becomes more reliable.\n\nThe surplus (shortfall) of the initial reserve with respect to the re-estimated (gross) final cost for each year represents, for a given year N, the di/ff erence between the amount shown in the second line ('Gross reserves for unpaid claims and claims expenses developed in 2022 adjusted for changes in exchange rates and scope of consolidation') and the amount shown in the final diagonal under 'Reserve re-estimated'.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

Note/uni00A013.2.1 also contains a focus on jurisdictions with significant portions of participating business\n\nand where required minimum local policyholders' share in the entities' results are significant. This Note discloses for such jurisdictions unrealized gains and losses related to available for sale investments and related shadow accounting adjustments. In 2022, as a consequence of the increase in the interest rates, assets arising from policyholder participaction were recognized for \u20ac6,573/uni00A0million mainly in France (\u20ac3,476/uni00A0million), Hong Kong (\u20ac1,495/uni00A0million) and Italy (\u20ac1,293/uni00A0million).\n\n## 14.9 PAYMENT, SURRENDER PROJECTIONS, INSURANCE AND INVESTMENT CONTRACT LIABILITIES DISCOUNT RATES\n\nIn the tables presented in Note/uni00A014.9.1 and 14.9.2, liabilities arising from Life/uni00A0& Savings and Property/uni00A0& Casualty insurance contracts and investment contracts exclude contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders. These liabilities are not exposed to interest rate or duration risk, except Unit-Linked contracts with performance guarantees. In addition, as far as liquidity risk is concerned, entities hold Unit-Linked assets backing the corresponding liabilities arising from these contracts. Occasional mismatches result mainly from administrative timing di/ff erences in the processing of day-to-day operations.\n\n## 14.9.1 Payment and surrender projections\n\nThe table below shows the breakdown of projected payments and surrenders related to insurance and investment contracts (excluding contracts where the financial risk is borne by policyholders). Actual maturities may di/ff er significantly from the estimates set out below, mainly because some of the contracts contain a surrender option controlled by the policyholder that may reduce their duration.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThe projections shown below cannot be compared with the reserves carried on the balance sheet and are higher than the published balance sheet figures because they represent expected cash flows without the impact of discounting. They are also shown net of inflows of periodical premiums payable by policyholders.\n\nThe figures shown in the first line of the table below represent estimated undiscounted cash outflows in connection to death, incapacity and disability claims, surrenders, annuities, minimum guaranteed benefits for Unit-Linked contracts, Property/uni00A0& Casualty and Health claims, net of premiums due from policyholders under contracts in-force. These cash flows are based on assumptions regarding mortality, incapacity and disability, surrender and settlement frequency for Property/uni00A0& Casualty businesses, which are consistent with past experience. They are gross of reinsurance. Given the strong use of estimates, it is likely that actual payments will di/ff er.",

Liabilities are based on estimates, and one of the key assumptions used in these estimates is the discount rate.\n\nAs shown in the table below, as at December/uni00A031, 2022, 79% of Life/uni00A0& Savings reserves (excluding Unit-Linked contracts) were discounted, of which 13% were subject to a revision of the discount rate and 66% retained the rate set at inception, subject to the liability adequacy test described in Note/uni00A01.\n\nBy convention, contracts with zero guaranteed rates are deemed undiscounted, except for products o/ff ering guaranteed rates updated annually and for one year: these contracts are presented in discounted reserves. Reserves for savings contracts with\n\nnon-zero guaranteed rates are discounted at the technical restatements at closing and mainly consist of reserves for guarantees (Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits, etc.).\n\nIn Property/uni00A0& Casualty, most reserves (94% as of December/uni00A031, 2022) are not discounted, with the exception of disability annuities and workers' compensation liabilities that are deemed structured settlements and where the discount rate is revised regularly.

These features are described in Note/uni00A04. They are not embedded derivatives which AXA reports separately at fair value because:\n\n- /uni25A0 many of the features would be considered clearly and closely related to the host contract; and\n\nI\n\nI\n\n- /uni25A0 many of the features would themselves qualify as insurance contracts under IFRS/uni00A04.\n\nThe primary features can be divided into two main categories: Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefits (GMDB) or Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefits (GMIB) offered on Unit-Linked contracts and guaranteed annuity purchase rates. As of December/uni00A02022, the AXA Group exposure to these liabilities was not material.",

As of December/uni00A031, 2022, the carrying value and fair value amount and the related contractual amount due at maturity for such liabilities were \u20ac353/uni00A0million and \u20ac381/uni00A0million respectively (\u20ac641/uni00A0million and \u20ac581/uni00A0 million as of December/uni00A031, 2021), including the Euro Medium Term Notes.\n\nThe Group applies the IFRS/uni00A013 fair value hierarchy as described in Note/uni00A01.5. The valuation method of liabilities arising from banking activities excluding derivatives (detailed in Note/uni00A020.5) are as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 banking liabilities issued at fair value - Retail customers (\u20ac353/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2022): values are based upon market prices that are available in active markets and are/uni00A0considered as level/uni00A01 fair values;\n- /uni25A0 retail customers deposits (\u20ac3,105/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2022) and Corporate customers deposits (\u20ac3,589/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2022) are not traded in active markets and quoted prices are not available. Given the short maturities of main liabilities arising from banking activities (see Note/uni00A015.2), the carrying amounts may be considered as reasonable proxies for fair values. Thus, the fair value of amounts displayed above for these instruments are considered to be level/uni00A03 fair values;\n- /uni25A0 interbanking refinancing (\u20ac3,038/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2022):\n- \u00b7 \u20ac2,751/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2022 (\u20ac2,251/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021): values are based upon market prices that are available in active markets and are/uni00A0considered as level/uni00A01 fair values,\n- \u00b7 \u20ac287/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2022 (\u20ac74/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021): mainly based on non-observable market data inputs and are considered to be level/uni00A03 fair values;\n- /uni25A0 refinancing  with  central  banks:  \u20ac2,076/uni00A0 million  as  of December/uni00A031, 2022 (\u20ac2,076/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021): values are based on observable market data inputs. As such, the fair values of these liabilities were considered as level/uni00A02 instruments.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

The fair value decreased by \u20ac675/uni00A0million compared to December/uni00A031, 2021 in line with the interest rates increase throughout the year for \u20ac-2,167/uni00A0million and the repayment of subordinated debt for \u20ac-1,378/uni00A0million,\n\npartly o/ff set by subordinated and financing debt issuances for \u20ac+2,870/uni00A0million.\n\nThe Group applies the IFRS/uni00A013 fair value hierarchy as described in Note/uni00A01.5./uni00A0The fair value amounts are mainly based on observable market data inputs and are therefore considered as level/uni00A02 fair value.\n\n## 17.3 EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK AND CONTRACTUAL MATURITIES\n\nThe table below sets out the maturities based on contractual cash flows of financing debt (including the impact of derivatives detailed in Note/uni00A020.1).

The change relates to:\n\n- /uni25A0 impact of rate differences on notional tax charges (\u20ac182/uni00A0million) corresponding to the di/ff erence between the blended tax (expected tax calculated at each entity level with the applicable standard rate) and the tax calculated using the 25.83% French tax rate applicable to the Company. This tax rate is composed of a basic tax rate (25%) and a social contribution (0.83%). The blended standard rate was 23.43% in 2022 and 24.05% in 2021. The decrease of the blended tax rate is mainly due to positive geographical mix combined with a decrease of tax rate in France;\n\n## 19.2 DEFERRED TAX\n\nIn the table below, the net deferred tax position corresponds to the di/ff erence between Deferred Tax Assets (DTA) and Deferred Tax Liabilities (DTL) carried on the Group's consolidated statement of financial position.

Their net fair value amounted to \u20ac-2,787/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2022 (\u20ac-1,575/uni00A0million at the end of 2021), comprised of the fair value of derivatives on invested assets (\u20ac689/uni00A0million and \u20ac-2,698/uni00A0million at the end of 2021 - see Note/uni00A020.3) and the fair value of derivatives on liabilities (\u20ac2,099/uni00A0million and \u20ac-1,123/uni00A0million at the end of 2021 - see Note/uni00A020.4).\n\nAXA uses derivatives primarily to hedge various risks stemming from both sides of the balance sheet in the context of its Asset Liability Management (ALM) strategy in insurance companies, as well as holdings and banks. Notional amount of such hedging strategies amounted to \u20ac437.3/uni00A0billion as of December/uni00A031, 2022 (\u20ac369.2/uni00A0billion at the end of 2021) and were mainly used to:\n\n- /uni25A0 manage interest rate exposures on fixed maturity investments, long-term debt and guaranteed interest rates on insurance contracts;\n- /uni25A0 reduce foreign-currency exposures on foreign-currency denominated investments and liabilities;\n- /uni25A0 manage liquidity positions (including the ability to pay benefits and claims when due) in connection with Asset Liability Management and local regulatory requirements for insurance and banking operations;\n- /uni25A0 limit equity risk;\n- /uni25A0 limit credit risk about certain investments in corporate debt instruments.\n\nAXA also uses derivatives as an alternative to gain exposure to certain asset classes through 'synthetic positions', for example, holding cash and equity futures instead of physical equities. Another example is the combination of government bonds\n\nand credit default swaps (CDS) as a synthetic position and an alternative to the direct purchase of a corporate bond. These schemes do not add any specific risks compared with other investment assets.\n\nThe notional amount of derivatives which is used to express the volume of instruments outstanding and to provide a basis for comparison with other financial instruments most certainly overstates the level of activity and does not directly measure risk as it greatly exceeds the possible credit and market loss that could arise from such transactions. It does not represent the amounts that are e/ff ectively exchanged by the parties, and thus is not a measure of the Group's exposure to derivative instruments. For example, the Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of its counterparties to the derivative instruments but is not exposed to credit risk on the entire notional amounts. AXA actively manages counterparty risk generated by derivatives through a specific group-wide policy. This policy includes a limit framework and an exposure monitoring process. Limits are specifically set for each authorized counterparty, based on an internal scoring system. This policy also includes daily to weekly collateralization for the majority of the Group's exposure. The total net collateral given communicated for all derivative instruments including those related to derivatives held within investment funds of the 'Satellite Investment Portfolio' (see Note/uni00A01.8.2) was \u20ac0.8/uni00A0billion as of December/uni00A031, 2022 (\u20ac2.0/uni00A0billion at the end of 2021). This net total includes amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and unrecognized commitments received or given disclosed in Note/uni00A029.\n\nAXA is increasing or decreasing its derivative positions in accordance with AXA's governance framework for derivatives. In particular, hedging activities are one of the most important instruments to decrease the risk of the options and guarantees that are embedded in some Life/uni00A0& Savings and Property/uni00A0& Casualty products; they also\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

The various policies that AXA applies with reference to the use of derivatives and hedging instruments, include a close monitoring of its hedging strategy and associated risks as part of a Systemic Risk Management Plan (SRMP), approved by the Management Committee and the Board of Directors, in the context of the policy measures that apply to Global Systemically Important Insurers (GSII).\n\nFor further detail on Asset Liability Management governance, please refer to page/uni00A0255 of Section/uni00A05.2 'Internal control and Risk Management'.\n\nIn 2022, the use of derivatives within the Group increased overall by \u20ac66.7/uni00A0billion in terms of notional amount (see also details in Note/uni00A020.2.1.):\n\n- /uni25A0 the notional amount of currency derivatives increased by \u20ac33.4/uni00A0billion mainly in France, Hong Kong, AXA/uni00A0SA, Switzerland and United Kingdom;\n- /uni25A0 the notional amount of interest rates derivatives increased by \u20ac27.1/uni00A0billion mainly in France, AXA Assistance, Germany and Belgium;\n- /uni25A0 the notional amount of other derivatives increased by \u20ac5.4/uni00A0billion notably in France, Germany and Hong Kong;\n- /uni25A0 the notional amount of equity derivatives increased by \u20ac2.6/uni00A0billion mainly in France, AXA XL, partly o/ff set by Hong Kong, Japan and Spain;\n\nIt was partly o/ff set:\n\n- /uni25A0 the notional amount of credit derivatives decreased by \u20ac1.9/uni00A0billion mainly in Japan and Germany;\n\nIn the tables above, the column 'Macro-hedges and other derivative instruments' includes derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS/uni00A039, but whose objective is nevertheless to provide economic hedging of a risk, with the exception notably of certain credit derivatives. They also include 'macro-hedging' derivatives as defined by the IASB in IAS/uni00A039.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2022, the notional amount of hedging derivative instruments as defined by IAS/uni00A039 (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge and net investment hedge) of the Group was \u20ac123.5/uni00A0billion versus \u20ac115.7/uni00A0billion at the end of 2021. The net fair value recorded was \u20ac-4,592/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2022, versus \u20ac-2,239/uni00A0million at the end of 2021.\n\n## 20.2.1 Interest rate derivative instruments\n\nThe AXA Group's primary interest rate exposure is related to contracts with guaranteed benefits and the risk that the value of the financial assets purchased with the consideration received from the contract holders is insu/ff icient to fund the guaranteed benefits and expected discretionary participation payable to them. To hedge against potential adverse market conditions,\n\nI\n\nI\n\nderivative strategies are used to reduce the risk arising from the guarantee liability over time.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2022, the notional amount of interest rate derivative instruments totalled \u20ac230.8/uni00A0billion (\u20ac203.6/uni00A0billion at the end of 2021). Their net fair value as of December/uni00A031, 2022 amounted to \u20ac-1,996/uni00A0million (\u20ac974/uni00A0million at the end of 2021). AXA mainly uses (i) /uni00A0 interest rate swaps (80% of total notional amount of interest rate derivative instruments), (ii) /uni00A0interest rate options (10%), and (iii) /uni00A0futures and forwards (9%).\n\nThese instruments are mainly used to:\n\n- /uni25A0 manage duration gap and/or hedge convexity risk between assets and liabilities on the General Account as a part of Asset Liability Management strategies mainly in France for \u20ac97.7/uni00A0billion ( versus \u20ac79.5/uni00A0billion at the end of 2021), Japan for \u20ac16/uni00A0billion at the end of 2022 ( versus \u20ac17.5/uni00A0billion at the end of 2021) and Hong Kong for \u20ac15.1/uni00A0billion at the end of 2022 ( versus \u20ac10.8/uni00A0billion at the end of 2021);\n- /uni25A0 hedge interest rate risk and interest volatility risk as part of the Asset Liability Management strategy associated with the guaranteed minimum benefits on Variable Annuity products, with a notional amount of \u20ac55.5/uni00A0billion at the end of 2022 (\u20ac37.8/uni00A0billion at the end of 2021) mainly at AXA Life Europe;\n- /uni25A0 minimize the cost of Group debt and limit volatility of financial charges, mainly in the Company, with a notional amount of \u20ac12.5/uni00A0billion at the end of 2022 ( versus \u20ac13.8/uni00A0billion at the end of 2021).\n\n## 20.2.2 Equity derivative instruments\n\nAs of December/uni00A0 31, 2022, the notional amount of equity derivative instruments amounted to \u20ac15.5/uni00A0billion (\u20ac12.9/uni00A0billion at the end of 2021). Their net fair value amounted to \u20ac214/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2022 (\u20ac209/uni00A0million at the end of 2021). AXA mainly uses (i) /uni00A0 equity option contracts (74% of total notional amount of equity derivative instruments), (ii) /uni00A0equity futures and forwards (13%), and (iii) /uni00A0equity swaps (13%).\n\nThese instruments are mainly used to:\n\n- /uni25A0 hedge the exposure to equity risk within the General Account assets, protecting policyholders' investments and their guaranteed liability over time, mainly in France (notional amount of \u20ac8.3/uni00A0billion in 2022 compared with \u20ac4.1/uni00A0billion in 2021), Switzerland (notional amount of \u20ac2.6/uni00A0billion in 2022 compared with \u20ac2.2/uni00A0billion in 2021) and Hong Kong (notional amount of \u20ac0.8/uni00A0billion in 2022 compared with \u20ac1.9/uni00A0billion in 2021);\n- /uni25A0 hedge equity risk as part of the Asset Liability Management strategy associated with the guaranteed minimum benefits on Variable Annuity products, which amounted to \u20ac0.1/uni00A0billion at the end of 2022 (\u20ac0.2/uni00A0billion at the end of 2021).",

        "page_content": "## 20.2.3 Currency derivative instruments\n\nThe Group has entered into di/ff erent currency instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk. Currency derivative instruments represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed price and settlement date.\n\nAs of December/uni00A031, 2022, the notional amount of currency derivative amounted to \u20ac170.6/uni00A0billion versus \u20ac137.2/uni00A0billion at the end of 2021. Their market value was \u20ac495/uni00A0million versus \u20ac-1,133/uni00A0million at the end of 2021. AXA mainly uses (i) /uni00A0 currency future and forward contracts (57% of total notional amount of currency derivative instruments), (ii) /uni00A0 currency option contracts (25%), and (iii) /uni00A0currency swaps (17%).\n\nOne of the main objectives of currency derivatives instruments used by the Company is to limit variations in net foreign currencydenominated assets resulting from movements in exchange rates in order to protect partially the value of AXA's net foreigncurrency investments in its subsidiaries to the extent of the following year's foreseeable dividends and more generally the exposure of AXA SA's liquidity to forex movements. The notional amount of derivatives used by the Company to hedge the foreign currency exposure increased from \u20ac22.9/uni00A0billion at the end of 2021 to \u20ac28.7/uni00A0billion at the end of 2022.\n\nCurrency derivative instruments are also used to hedge foreign exchange mismatch between assets and liabilities in insurance subsidiaries of the Group. While most of the operating units' commitments are matched by assets denominated in the same currency, some entities may invest in foreign currency denominated assets to diversify their investments. This is the case mainly in (i) /uni00A0 Switzerland using such contracts to hedge exchange rate risk arising from their investments in equities and debt instruments denominated in non-CHF currencies (mainly Euro and US Dollar) with a total notional amount of \u20ac22.2/uni00A0billion at the end of 2022 versus \u20ac17.9/uni00A0 billion at the end of 2021, (ii) /uni00A0 Japan using future and forward foreign currency contracts to hedge exchange-rate risk arising from its investments mainly in fixed-maturity debt instruments denominated in non JPY currencies with a total notional amount of \u20ac16.8/uni00A0billion at the end of 2022 versus \u20ac16.5/uni00A0billion at the end of 2021 and (iii) /uni00A0Hong Kong using forward contracts and cross currency swaps to hedge\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nexchange rate risk with a total notional amount of \u20ac25.3/uni00A0billion at the end of 2022 versus \u20ac19.1/uni00A0billion at the end of 2021.\n\nA description of exchange-rate risk related to the operating activities of Group subsidiaries and the Company is included in Section/uni00A05.3 'Market Risks' of this Annual Report with amounts of exposures to exchange-rate risk and corresponding hedges.\n\nIn accordance with IAS/uni00A021 and IAS/uni00A039, the translation di/ff erence relating to these debt instruments used in operational entities is recognized in profit or loss and o/ff sets most of the change in market value of associated derivative instruments, which is also recognized in profit or loss.\n\n## 20.2.4 Credit derivative instruments\n\nThe Group, as part of its investment and credit Risk Management activities, uses strategies that involve credit derivatives, which consist mainly of Credit Default Swaps (CDS). These instruments are used as an alternative to corporate bonds portfolios, when coupled with government debt instruments, but also as a protection on single names or specific portfolios.\n\nAs of December/uni00A0 31, 2022, the notional amount of credit derivatives held by the Group was \u20ac10.5/uni00A0billion compared to \u20ac12.4/uni00A0billion at the end of 2021 (including the instruments held within investment funds of the 'Satellite Investment Portfolio' for \u20ac0.8/uni00A0billion; see Note/uni00A01.8.2).\n\nCredit derivative instruments are mainly used to:\n\n- /uni25A0 hedge credit risk involving the purchase of CDS as a protection mainly on single corporate names or specific portfolios starting from a certain level of losses through tranches instruments (notional amount of \u20ac1.0/uni00A0billion at the end of 2022 versus \u20ac1.5/uni00A0billion at the end of 2021);\n- /uni25A0 enhance the return mainly on government bonds portfolios by holding government bonds and at same time selling protection on very good quality names as an alternative to the direct purchase of a corporate bond. This type of ALM strategy is implemented to compensate for the lack of depth or liquidity in some markets by taking a synthetic credit risk (notional amount of \u20ac9.5/uni00A0billion at the end of 2022 versus \u20ac10.9/uni00A0billion at the end of 2021).\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

The level of benefits is generally based on members' length of service and their salary in the final years leading up to retirement.\n\nIn Switzerland, the benefit plan is a Swiss contribution-based plan classified as a defined benefit plan under IAS/uni00A019 because of guarantees, risks related to the mortality and disability coverage.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and Germany, pensions in payment are generally updated in line with the retail price index or inflation, as opposed to other countries where pensions do not necessarily receive inflationary increases once in payment.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nMost of the defined benefit pension plans are funded through long-term employee benefit funds or covered by insurance policies or Mutual funds.\n\nBenefit payments in the United Kingdom and Switzerland are from trustee-administered funds and plan assets held in trusts are governed by local regulations and practices. The Board of trustees, generally composed of representatives of the Company and plan participants in accordance with the respective plan's regulations is responsible for the governance of the plans including investment decisions and contribution schedules in order to meet the existing minimum funding requirement or funding regime objective.\n\nIn France and Belgium, benefit payments are managed by insurance companies or Mutual funds.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the main defined benefit plan was closed to new members on August/uni00A031, 2013, and members who were part of defined benefit sections had the option to participate in defined contributions sections.\n\nAXA XL sponsors di/ff erent defined benefits: pension plans mainly in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Germany, as well as deferred cash awards for executive o/ff icers.\n\n- /uni25A0 International (\u20ac-585/uni00A0million) mainly driven by the disposals of Singapore (\u20ac-413/uni00A0million), AXA Bank Belgium (\u20ac-227/uni00A0million), and the Gulf Region (\u20ac-121/uni00A0million), partly o/ff set by Turkey (\u20ac+152/uni00A0million) notably in the context of hyperinflation in 2022;\n- /uni25A0 Europe (\u20ac-93/uni00A0million) mainly driven by the impact of the disposal of a General Account portfolio in Belgium.",

Central to the scheme funding regime are: the Statutory Funding Objective (SFO), which is a requirement that the Scheme has su/ff icient and appropriate assets to meet its technical provisions ( i.e . the amount required, on an actuarial calculation, to make provision for the scheme's liabilities); and the Statement of Funding Principles (SFP), which is a document prepared by the trustees which sets out its policy for ensuring that the SFO is met.\n\nAs part of the triennial funding valuation process, acting in accordance with the scheme funding legislation and the trust deed and rules of the AXA UK Group Pension Scheme, the Trustee determines an appropriate level of employer contributions to be paid to the AXA UK Group Pension Scheme, having consulted with the Scheme Actuary and discussed this with AXA UK plc. The resulting schedule of contributions is prepared by the Trustee and the Scheme Actuary sets out what contributions are payable and by when./uni00A0This is then agreed by AXA UK plc. Where there is a deficit on a technical provision funding basis, the Trustee will also need to agree and put in place a Recovery Plan, which sets out the period over which the SFO will be met. There is no prescribed period for a recovery plan, but the Pension Regulator would generally be concerned about long recovery plans. The Trustee is required to prepare the schedule of contributions following valuations but may revisit (and potentially amend) the schedule of contributions in between actuarial valuations,\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nfor example if significant events occur during the period. Note that the 2022 normal employer contribution to the Scheme was reduced to nil as the actual deficit was lower than expected. Indeed, the Scheme finalized the March/uni00A031, 2021 triennial funding valuation in February/uni00A02022. As part of this actuarial valuation, the appropriate level of future contributions to be paid were determined per annum until December/uni00A031, 2030. However, contributions from 2022 are subject to adjustments depending on the deficit calculated at each March/uni00A031 from 2022.\n\nIn Switzerland and Belgium, entities used to fund the cost of the entitlements expected to be earned on at least a yearly basis where contributions are determined as a percentage of pensionable salaries depending on the age-class of the beneficiaries.\n\nIn Switzerland, AXA Life Switzerland and AXA pension fund have commonly decided in 2021 to terminate a collective insurance contract covering a large part of the retirees' obligation. The allocated assets were transferred to the pension fund with an e/ff ective transfer date as of January/uni00A01, 2022. They have been aggregated in the Plan Assets backing the global pensions' DBO in Switzerland. As a result, the pension plan in Switzerland became fully funded under IAS/uni00A019 a/f\\_t  er the transaction, then over-funded at the end of 2022 due to financial and economical conditions at year end. As the Plan Assets in Switzerland are restricted to employee benefits payments and cannot be returned to AXA, the net asset surplus was recognized up to the asset ceiling measured according to IAS/uni00A019 and IFRIC/uni00A014 as at December/uni00A031, 2022. The cumulative e/ff ect of asset ceiling is presented in the pension financial position in Note/uni00A026.2.4.\n\nIn France, voluntary regular employer annual contributions are made to Separate Assets, with an objective of the coverage ratio remaining within a targeted range of the total defined benefit obligation after consideration of the yearly predetermined service cost.\n\nIn Germany, there is no requirement to fund employee defined benefit obligation.\n\nIn summary, considering Other Assets in Spain and Separate Assets i.e . all Assets other than Plan Assets backing the current liabilities, the net economic situation of the funding for defined benefit plans is the following:\n\n|                                                        | Pension benefits          | Pension benefits          | Other benefits            | Other benefits            | Total                     | Total                     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (in Euro million)                                      | December/uni00A031,  2022 | December/uni00A031,  2021 | December/uni00A031,  2022 | December/uni00A031,  2021 | December/uni00A031,  2022 | December/uni00A031,  2021 |\n| Statement of financial position  liability/uni00A0 (a) | (3,548)                   | (6,707)                   | (144)                     | (180)                     | (3,691)                   | (6,887)                   |\n| Assets other than plan assets/uni00A0 (b)              | 1,056                     | 2,565                     | -                         | -                         | 1,056                     | 2,565                     |\n| Net economic position                                  | (2,492)                   | (4,142)                   | (144)                     | (180)                     | (2,636)                   | (4,322)                   |\n\n- (a) Amounts representing the defined benefit obligation less plan assets adjusted for assets not recoverable by asset ceiling impact.\n- (b) Amounts including separate assets or right to reimbursements and other assets managed within the Group but not taken into consideration in the pension disclosures as described in Note/uni00A026.2.6.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

The investment strategy is reviewed\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nregularly, following actuarial valuations of the funded benefit plans.\n\nThe investment positions are managed within an Asset Liability Management (ALM) framework defining an optimal strategic allocation with respect to the liabilities structure. The management of the assets notably includes liquidity management, diversification of each asset type so that the failure of any specific investment does not present a material risk to the plans, and implementation of hedging programs.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the pension scheme entered into several longevity swap transactions for economically hedging longevity risk inherent within the pensioner population:\n\n- /uni25A0 in 2015, for covering pensioner members that retired prior to April/uni00A01, 2015;\n- /uni25A0 in 2019, for covering pensioner members that retired prior to April/uni00A01, 2019;\n- /uni25A0 in 2020 and most recently in 2021, for covering longevity risk (subject to a level of retention) of the remaining unhedged members.\n\nFurthermore, a hedging strategy has been put in place to protect the scheme funding level from movements in inflation and interest rate. The strategy is reviewed on a regular basis by AXA UK, Trustees and investment advisors.\n\nAdditionally, caps on inflationary increases were in place in the United Kingdom & Ireland to protect the scheme against extreme inflation.\n\n## 26.2.11  Statement of financial position/balance sheet reconciliation\n\n| (in Euro million)                                    | December/uni00A031, 2022   | December/uni00A031, 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Net position (excluding separate assets)/uni00A0 (a) | (3,691)                    | (6,887)                    |\n| - (assets)/liabilities held for sale/uni00A0 (b)     | 50                         | -                          |\n| Other liabilities                                    | (273)                      | (363)                      |\n| (c) TOTAL/uni00A0                                    | (3,914)                    | (7,250)                    |\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

These options were either subscription options involving newly issued AXA ordinary shares or purchase options involving AXA treasury shares.

The e/ff ect of expected early exercise was taken into account through the use of an expected life assumption based on historical data. AXA/uni00A0SA share price volatility was estimated on the basis of implied volatility,\n\nwhich was checked against an analysis of historical volatility to ensure consistency. The expected AXA/uni00A0SA dividend yield was based on the market consensus. The risk-free interest rate was based on the Euro Swap Rate curve for the appropriate term.\n\nThe option pricing assumptions and fair value at grant date for plans issued for the last time in 2018 are shown below:\n\n|                                                                 | 2018   | 2017   | 2016   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Assumptions                                                     |        |        |        |\n| Dividend yield                                                  | 5.79%  | 6.50%  | 6.60%  |\n| Volatility                                                      | 20.72% | 25.05% | 26.60% |\n| Risk-free interest rate                                         | 0.72%  | 0.55%  | 0.36%  |\n| Expected life  (in years)                                       | 8.6    | 8.5    | 8.5    |\n| Weighted average fair value per option at grant date  (in Euro) | 1.21   | 1.81   | 1.80   |\n\nThe total cost has been amortized over the vesting period and a nil estimated pre-vesting lapse rate was applied over the remaining vesting period. On that basis, the expense recognized in profit or loss for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2022 was \u20ac0.5/uni00A0million (\u20ac1.2/uni00A0million for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2021).\n\n## AXA GROUP SHAREPLAN\n\nAXA o/ff  ers its employees the opportunity to become shareholders through a special employee share o/ff ering. In countries that meet the legal and fiscal requirements, two investment options are available: the Classic plan and the leveraged Guarantee Plus plan.\n\nThe Classic plan allows employees to purchase, through a personal investment, AXA shares either through Mutual funds (FCPE) or through direct share ownership, depending on the country, with a discount of 20%. The shares are held within the Group Company Savings Plans and are restricted from sale during a period of approximately five/uni00A0years (except specific early exit cases allowed by applicable laws). Employees receive dividends distributed by AXA during the holding period and at the end, benefits are subject to the share price evolution, up or down, as compared to the subscription price.\n\nThe Guarantee Plus plan allows employees to purchase AXA shares with a discount through a personal investment and a bank contribution equal to 9/uni00A0times the personal investment. The shares are purchased either through Mutual funds (FCPE) or through direct share ownership, depending on the country. The shares are held within the Group Company Savings Plans and are restricted from sale during a period of approximately five/uni00A0years (except specific early exit cases allowed by applicable laws). Employees' personal investment is guaranteed by a bank, and employees also benefit from either (i) /uni00A0 a guaranteed minimum return of 3% per year on their personal investment, (ii) /uni00A0or, if more favourable than the guaranteed minimum return: a multiple of 4/uni00A0 times the protected average increase of the AXA share price over the holding period. The calculation of the protected average increase is based on the reference price which is the average over the twenty trading days ending on the date preceding the\n\nI\n\nI\n\nChief Executive O/ff icer's decision setting the definitive terms of the operation.\n\nAt the end of the five years holding period, the employees can, depending on their residence country, receive the cash value of their investment, or transfer their investment in dedicated Mutual funds.\n\nIn 2022, both Classic and Guarantee Plus plans were o/ff ered to AXA employees. The subscription price for the Classic plan amounted to \u20ac19.15 per share (discount of 20% to the reference price of \u20ac23.93). The subscription price for the Guarantee Plus plan amounted to \u20ac22.16 per share (discount of 7.40% to the reference price of \u20ac23.93).\n\nA total of 13.9/uni00A0million new shares were issued, increasing the share capital by \u20ac296.5/uni00A0million. The 2022 o/ff ering represented a total cost of \u20ac7.3/uni00A0million (\u20ac6.9/uni00A0million for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2021).\n\n## OTHER SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\n\n## AXA Performance & Restricted Shares\n\nPerformance & Restricted Shares can be granted to executive officers and other key employees in France. These plans are equity-settled award plans, subjected to a three-year vesting period and performance conditions. The performance conditions of Restricted Shares plans are solely linked to the Group Sustainability performance. Whereas, the performance conditions of Performance Shares plans are based on the Group's financial targets and strategic orientations. In addition, for some identified beneficiaries, a compulsory two-year holding period can be applicable a/f\\_t er the vesting period.\n\nIn 2022, the valuation was based on a market price of \u20ac25.11 per share at grant date and an estimate 5% pre-vesting lapse rate per year. The grant date fair value of Performance & Restricted Shares granted in 2022 was \u20ac17.31 (\u20ac15.57 for 2021 grants).\n\nThe total cost of the Performance & Restricted Shares recorded as of December/uni00A031, 2022, was \u20ac71.7/uni00A0million in profit or loss (\u20ac67.8/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021).",

The performance period is currently three years. The vesting period is between three and five years. For some identified beneficiaries, a compulsory twoyear holding period can be applicable a/f\\_t er the vesting period.\n\nThe settlement is made in shares rather than in cash (except where the settlement in shares is impossible for legal or other reasons).\n\nThe total cost of the International Performance & Restricted Shares recorded as of December/uni00A031, 2022, was \u20ac85.7/uni00A0million in profit or loss (\u20ac84.3/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021).\n\n## AXA Retirement Performance Shares\n\nAs voted by the Shareholders' Meeting of April/uni00A024, 2019, AXA's Board of Directors is authorized to grant retirement performance shares to designated senior executives in France. Under this plan, beneficiaries of Performance Shares have the right to receive at the settlement date, a certain number of AXA shares based on the achievement of a performance condition related to the average AXA Group Solvency/uni00A0II ratio calculated during the performance period of three years.\n\nThe total cost of the Performance Shares Retirement recorded as of December/uni00A031, 2022, was \u20ac18.1/uni00A0million in profit or loss (\u20ac18.9/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021).\n\n## 26.3.2 Share-based compensation instruments issued by AXA subsidiaries\n\n## AXA INVESTMENT MANAGERS SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS\n\nAXA Investment Managers granted Performance Shares to certain key employees as part of its deferred remuneration policy that also includes DIP (Deferred Incentive Plan). The Investment Managers Performance Shares incentive plan is a long-term award plan in which participants are allocated rights to acquire AXA Investment Managers shares upon completion of a specified vesting period depending on applicable local regulations, and subject to fulfilment of certain performance conditions. The performance condition is based on the achievement of Actual AXA Investment Managers Underlying Earnings Group share versus budgeted and/or investment performance conditions.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 6.6/uni00A0NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nIn 2021, following the change in the deferred remuneration fully in DIP, AXA Investment Managers decided to cease issuing the Investment Managers Performance Shares incentive plan. As a result, the last plan was the one granted in March/uni00A02020.\n\nThe total cost of AXA Investment Managers Performance Shares recorded as of December/uni00A031, 2022, was \u20ac5.7/uni00A0million in profit or loss (\u20ac10.9/uni00A0million as of December/uni00A031, 2021).\n\n## 26.4 COMPENSATION OF MANAGEMENT AND OFFICERS\n\nCompensation costs/expenses:\n\n- /uni25A0 short-term  benefits:  the  compensation  paid  to  the Management Committee members in 2022 amounted to \u20ac25.8/uni00A0million (\u20ac19.2/uni00A0million in 2021), including fixed salary, bonuses, directors' fees, benefits in kind and other short-term benefits;\n- /uni25A0 share-based compensations: the expense recognized in 2022 in respect of share-based compensations granted to the Management Committee members was \u20ac15.5/uni00A0million (\u20ac11.7/uni00A0million in 2021);\n- /uni25A0 post-retirement benefits: the estimated cost of providing defined benefit pensions and other post-retirement benefits to the Management Committee members for the current year of service, measured in accordance with IAS/uni00A019, amounted to \u20ac4.0/uni00A0million in 2022 (\u20ac3.9/uni00A0million in 2021).\n\n## 26.5 SALARIED WORKFORCE\n\nAt December/uni00A031, 2022, the Group employed 90,443 salaried people on a full-time equivalent basis (compared to 92,556 at December/uni00A031, 2021).\n\nThe decrease in salaried employees by 2,113 in 2022 was mainly driven by (i) /uni00A0 the reporting change at AXA Group Operations considering employees from consolidated scope only (-1,968), (ii) /uni00A0 the sale of our operations in Malaysia and in Singapore (-1,530), and (iii) /uni00A0the e/ff  iciency programs notably in Germany and Spain, partly o/ff set by recruitments to support business growth across several entities and the full consolidation of Nigeria.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

On December/uni00A031, 2022, the Mutuelles AXA collectively owned 15.37% of the Company's outstanding ordinary shares representing 25.67% of the voting rights.\n\nEach Mutuelle AXA is supervised by a board of directors elected by delegates representing policyholders. Certain members of the Company's Management Committee and Board of Directors serve as directors of the Mutuelles AXA.\n\nThe Mutuelles AXA and two of the Company's French insurance subsidiaries engaged in the Property/uni00A0& Casualty insurance business and Life/uni00A0& Savings insurance business, AXA France IARD and AXA France Vie respectively (the 'Subsidiaries'), are parties to an agreement pursuant to which they provide a full range of management services to manage the insurance operations and portfolios of the Mutuelles AXA. The agreement includes provisions designed to ensure the legal independence and protection of the respective client portfolios of the Mutuelles AXA and these Subsidiaries. Certain costs and charges (excluding commissions) are allocated between the Subsidiaries and the Mutuelles AXA through an economic interest grouping (groupement d'int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9conomique) or 'GIE'.\n\nThe Property/uni00A0& Casualty insurance business generated in France by insurance brokers was mainly underwritten through co-insurance and reinsurance arrangements between AXA Assurances IARD Mutuelle and AXA France IARD. Aggregate written premiums under these agreements amounted to \u20ac2,365/uni00A0million in 2022 (of which \u20ac2,266/uni00A0million was attributed to AXA France IARD).\n\n## 28.2 GROUPEMENT D ' INT\u00c9R\u00caT \u00c9CONOMIQUE (GIE)\n\nFrom time to time the Company enters into GIEs with certain of its subsidiaries. GIEs are intercompany partnerships, governed by French law, created to perform various common services for their members and to allocate associated costs and expenses among their members. The allocation of costs and expenses invoiced to GIE members is based on various agreed criteria including particular activity drivers. The GIEs of which the Company was a member during 2022 covered a\n\nvariety of common services including services performed by the Group's central functions (GIE AXA) for the benefit of AXA Group companies ( e.g. finance, accounting and reporting, tax, legal, internal audit, human resources, information systems, r isk m anagement, cash management). Expenses invoiced by these GIEs to the Company and its subsidiaries are generally invoiced at cost and are included in the consolidated expenses reflected in Note/uni00A025 'Expenses by type' to the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements. Expenses invoiced by the GIE AXA to its members in 2022 and 2021 amounted to respectively \u20ac261/uni00A0million and \u20ac251/uni00A0million.\n\n## 28.3 LOANS/GUARANTEES/CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS, ETC.\n\nThe Company has given numerous commitments, including financing  commitments,  guarantees  given  to  financial institutions and customers, pledged assets, collateralized commitments and letters of credit. For a description of these commitments and guarantees, see Note/uni00A029 'Contingent assets and liabilities and unrecognized contractual commitments' to the Group's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nCertain of these guarantees are given by the Company for the benefit of its subsidiaries and affiliates for various business purposes including to promote development of their business ( e.g. to facilitate acquisitions, integration of acquired businesses, distribution arrangements, o/ff -shoring arrangements, internal restructuring, sales or other disposals of assets or businesses, sales or renewals of products or services or similar transactions), to support their credit ratings, and/or to promote e/ff icient use of the Group's capital resources. In this context, the Company may guarantee repayment of loans or other obligations of its subsidiaries to third parties, or provide other types of guarantees to support its subsidiaries' obligations. The beneficiaries of these guarantees are generally required to compensate the Company at a negotiated rate based on prevailing market rates for guarantees with similar conditions. In addition, from time to time, the Company may provide comfort letters or similar letters to rating agencies and/or regulators in support of its subsidiaries and a/ff  iliates for various business purposes, including facilitating specific transactions, achieving target rating levels and, more generally, helping to develop the business of these subsidiaries.\n\nCommitments granted by the Company to its subsidiaries are disclosed in Appendix/uni00A0III of this Annual Report 'AXA parent Company financial statements: Subsidiaries and participating interests'.\n\nThe Company may enter into various types of transactions with its subsidiaries and a/ff iliates from time to time for various business purposes including (i) /uni00A0in connection with liquidity, solvency and capital management initiatives designed to promote e/ff icient use and fungibility of the Group's capital resources or (ii) /uni00A0to finance their business operations and/or to promote the development of their business ( e.g. to facilitate acquisitions, integration of acquired businesses, distribution arrangements, internal\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

This includes the potential liability of AXA UK under customary warranties and indemnities given by AXA UK to Resolution/uni00A0Ltd. in connection with this transaction.\n\n## 29.4.2 Employee and director Indemnification Obligations\n\nIn addition to other employment-related obligations, various AXA subsidiaries are required to indemnify their employees and directors against certain liabilities and costs that they may incur from time to time in performing activities within the scope of their duties. These activities may include, for example, service as a director, officer, agent, general partner, or in a similar capacity for/uni00A0 (i) /uni00A0an AXA Group company other than the employee's principal employer or (ii) /uni00A0 a company outside the AXA Group where service is at the request of (or for the benefit of) the Group ( e.g. joint ventures, partnerships, or special-purpose investment Companies or funds). The potential amount of compensation relating to commitments covered by these obligations cannot be evaluated with any certainty.\n\n## 29.4.3 Supports provided without having a/uni00A0contractual or constructive obligation to do so\n\nThe Group did not provide any material support without having a contractual or constructive obligation to do so to structured entities during the period.\n\n## 29.5 OTHER ITEMS: RESTRICTION ON DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO/uni00A0SHAREHOLDERS\n\nCertain AXA subsidiaries and joint ventures, principally insurance companies, are subject to restrictions on the amount of funds they may transfer in the form of cash dividends or otherwise.\n\nIn most cases, the amounts available for distribution from AXA's insurance subsidiaries and joint ventures are limited to net income for the year and retained earnings calculated in accordance with the statutory accounting policies used by the subsidiaries to prepare their local financial statements. Further restrictions may be imposed by the local insurance regulators in countries where AXA operates. In some cases, amounts available for distribution are also subject to regulatory capital adequacy tests or the approval of an independent actuary or subject to individual provisions contained in a company's by laws.\n\nIn accordance with European Union directives, insurance companies with their registered office in a European Union member country are required to maintain minimum solvency ratios which must be supported by eligible elements. AXA's insurance operations in countries outside the European Union are also subject to local capital adequacy and solvency margin regulations.\n\nAXA/uni00A0 SA is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations notably stemming from its Non-Euro participations. The aim of the hedging programs of the Company is to protect partially the value of AXA's net foreign-currency investments in its subsidiaries to the extent of the following year's foreseeable dividends and more generally the exposure of AXA SA's liquidity to foreign exchange movements .\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

If we determine the likelihood of a negative outcome is probable, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we establish a reserve and record an estimated loss for the expected outcome of the litigation. However, it is o/f\\_t en di/ff icult to predict the outcome or estimate a possible loss or range of loss because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, particularly when plaintiffs allege substantial or indeterminate damages, the litigation is in its early stages, or when the litigation is highly complex or broad in scope.\n\n## 31.1 MATTERS CONCERNING AXA/uni00A0SA AND/uni00A0ITS SUBSIDIARIES\n\nAXA and its subsidiaries are involved in various legal actions and proceedings of a character normally incidental to their business including claims litigation arising in connection with the Group's insurance business and litigation arising from the Group's Asset Management business.\n\nIn addition, several AXA subsidiaries are involved in lawsuits (both class action and individual), investigations, and other actions arising in the various jurisdictions where they do business, including the United States.\n\nA number of lawsuits have been filed against insurers in the United States and elsewhere involving the scope and interpretation of policies, insurers' sales practices, alleged misconduct or misrepresentation, alleged failure to properly supervise agents, compensation of intermediaries, product features, fees or performance , alleged bad-faith denials of coverage as well as numerous other matters. Some of these actions have resulted in the award of substantial judgments against insurers (including material amounts of punitive damages) or in substantial settlements. In certain jurisdictions, juries have broad discretion in awarding punitive damages. AXA's subsidiaries are involved in these types of litigations as well as regulatory inquiries, investigations or actions with respect to these and a wide variety of other matters related to the ownership or management of real estate, asset or investment activities, corporate transactions, employee benefit disputes, alleged discrimination in employment practices, as well as other matters.\n\nA number of AXA subsidiaries are involved in ongoing litigations relating to COVID-19 exposure under business interruption policies and non-damage business interruption extensions to business interruption policies.\n\nSome of the litigations described in this section have been brought on behalf of various alleged classes of claimants, and certain of the claimants in these actions seek significant or unspecified amounts of damages, including punitive damages.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

The AXA XL Division is party to coverage actions brought by manufacturers (including Purdue Pharma), distributors and retailers against insurers. Most of these are in the early stages and it is expected that the coverage litigation (including appeals) and possible arbitrations will take several years to reach final resolution.\n\n## AVIATION LITIGATION FOLLOWING THE RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE\n\nSince the Russian invasion of Ukraine, lawsuits have been filed against the AXA XL Division in the UK, Ireland and the United States relating to alleged aircra/f\\_t  losses in Russia. The AXA XL Division provides coverage to aircra/f\\_t  lessors for their aircra/f\\_t , engines and spares under various types of aviation policies (including lessor war and lessor all risk) as well as other insured under separate policies (for example, aircra/f\\_t  operators under operator war and operator all risk). The lawsuits are at an early stage, and we do not expect substantive rulings until 2024.\n\n## 31.2 OTHER LITIGATION\n\nIn addition to the various matters noted above, AXA and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous legal actions and proceedings arising out of transactions involving the acquisition or sale of businesses or assets, mergers or other business combination transactions, the establishment or dissolution of joint ventures or other partnerships, public exchange or tender offers, buy-outs of minority interests or similar types of transactions ('M&A Transactions'). In connection with M&A Transactions, AXA and its subsidiaries from time to time:\n\n- /uni25A0 are involved in legal actions or other claims brought by purchasers, joint venture partners, shareholders or other transaction parties asserting claims for damages on various theories (including misrepresentation, failure to disclose material  information,  failure  to  perform  contractual duties, breach of fiduciary duties), seeking contractual indemnification, or otherwise seeking to impose liability on AXA and/or its subsidiaries; and/or\n- /uni25A0 benefit from contractual rights to indemnification from third party sellers or other transaction counterparties that are designed to protect the Group against existing or potential future litigation exposures or other types of contingent liabilities of the acquired businesses or assets. These indemnities generally constitute unsecured obligations of the indemnifying party and, consequently, their value may be substantially impaired or rendered worthless in the event of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the indemnifying party.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nAXA and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in tax assessment negotiations and/or active litigation with tax authorities over contested assessments or other matters in a number of jurisdictions including in France. These actions or assessments arise in a variety of circumstances including matters in connection with M&A, restructuring or financing transactions as well as in the ordinary course of business.\n\nOver the past several years a number of jurisdictions, including France and Belgium, have enacted legislation that permits corporate entities to be charged with criminal offences. The standard for attributing criminal conduct by corporate o/ff icers and employees to corporate entities is not clearly defined in many of these jurisdictions and government prosecutors and judges have broad discretion in this area. In recent years, complaints against or indictments of corporate entities for alleged criminal o/ff ences have become increasingly common and certain AXA Group companies have been the subject of penal complaints and/or indictments from time to time including in Belgium, France, and Switzerland. While a criminal complaint against or indictment of a corporate entity may not pose material financial risk, it has broad potential implications for a regulated financial institution like AXA both from a reputation point of view and from a regulatory perspective because a criminal conviction can have potentially far reaching negative implications for AXA Group companies engaged in regulated businesses around the world (including for their ability to obtain or maintain licenses to engage in certain types of regulated business activities such as asset management, insurance and banking).\n\nBeyond litigation risks of the type described above, AXA and its subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive regulation in the various jurisdictions where they do business. In this context, AXA and its subsidiaries are subject, from time to time, to examinations, investigations, enforcement proceedings and other actions by regulatory and law enforcement authorities (involving civil and/or penal matters) as well as to proposed changes in law and/or regulation that may significantly impact their business and results of operations. For additional information on these matters as well as other risks and contingent liabilities affecting the Group and its business, please see Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors' and Section/uni00A07.3 'General Information' and Note/uni00A029 'Contingent assets and liabilities and unrecognized contractual commitments' in Part/uni00A06 'Consolidated Financial Statements' of this Annual Report.\n\nAlthough the outcome of any lawsuit cannot be predicted with certainty, particularly in the early stages of an action, Management believes that the ultimate resolutions of the matters described above are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Group, taken as a whole. In addition, as of December/uni00A031, 2022, to the Company's knowledge, there were no other governmental, judicial or arbitration proceedings, either pending or threatened, that may have, or have had a significant impact on the financial situation or profitability of the Company or the Group over the past 12/uni00A0months. However, due to the nature of such lawsuits and investigations and the frequency of large damage awards",

Thus, when an unrealized gain is recognized, a deferred participating liability (DPL) is recorded. In case of an unrealized loss, a deferred participating asset (DPA) should be recognized only in the extent that its recoverability is highly probable.\n\nAssumptions used are generally locked-in at inception, and for some Life & Savings reserves, are based on revised discount rates as stated in N ote 14.9.2 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAt each closing,  Liability Adequacy Tests are performed to determine that technical reserves are su/ff icient, and that deferred acquisition costs are recoverable. The Liability Adequacy Test is based on current best estimates of all future  cash flows that are valued using complex actuarial models and involve a significant level of judgment. In addition, in case a net deferred participation asset is recognized, the Group evaluates its recoverability using liquidity analyses in order to assess the capacity of the Group to hold financial assets showing unrealized loss position.\n\nCertain changes in these assumptions could result in material impact to the valuation of these liabilities and assets.\n\nAccordingly, we deemed the Measurement of Life & Savings technical reserves (including deferred acquisition costs and deferred policyholders' participation assets) to be a key audit matter.\n\nIn order to cover the risk relating to the valuation of these liabilities and assets in the Life & Savings and investment contracts with discretionary participation, our audit approach is as follow :\n\n- /uni25A0 We  updated  our  knowledge  of  the  methodologies  for measuring technical reserves covering these contracts as well as the models used to calculate the reserves and evaluated their appropriateness;\n- /uni25A0 We assessed the compliance of the methodology with current accounting standards and its implementation;\n- /uni25A0 We assessed the IT systems used to process the technical data and integration into the accounting system;\n- /uni25A0 We assessed the design  and tested the operating e/ff ectiveness of the  controls  we deemed key to our audit;\n- /uni25A0 We tested, on a sample basis and according to our risk assessment, the calculation models applied to estimate the future cash flows used to determine the future policy benefit reserves or  the liability adequacy tests and to assess the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs and deferred policyholders' participation assets;\n- /uni25A0 We applied procedures to test the reliability of the underlying data used in estimates ;\n- /uni25A0 We examined the information underlying the main assumptions used by M anagement and the sensitivity of the models to the assumptions;\n- /uni25A0 We applied analytical procedures with a view to identifying and analyzing any material unusual and/or unexpected changes.\n\nFinally, we assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

They include claims  reported, claims incurred but not reported (IBNR) as well as claims handling costs.\n\nThese reserves are calculated using statistical and actuarial methods, on the basis of historical  data , and use assumptions to estimate ultimate claims cost.\n\nFor some insurance contracts, these estimates require a high degree of judgment, and the assumptions selected may have a significant impact on the ultimate claims cost  at the end of the reporting period as the inherent uncertainty is higher. This is especially the case for the long-tail Property & Casualty line of business such as general and professional liability, worker's compensation, and other specialty lines.\n\nIn addition, estimates of gross and net loss from natural catastrophe events and large man-made losses, including business written or reinsured through AXA XL, are more di/ff icult to project as they are less frequent but can be of higher severity.\n\nDue to these inherent uncertainties to calculate the estimates, we deemed the measurement of claim reserves in the Property & Casualty line of business notably for long-tail claims  to be a key audit matter.\n\nI\n\nOur audit approach to the risk relating to the measurement of claims reserves in the P roperty & C asualty notably for long-tail claims  is as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 We assessed the compliance of the methodology applied by the Group with current accounting standards and its application;\n- /uni25A0 We evaluated the design and tested the  operating e/ff ectiveness of the  controls we deemed key to our audit and relating to:\n- -the management of claims and, in particular, the measurement of reserves on a case-by-case basis;\n- -the calculation of the ultimate cost (assumptions, judgments, data, methodologies, compliance with the applicable accounting standards ), including second opinions supplied by the Risk Management teams with respect to technical reserves;\n- -the IT systems used to process the technical data and integration into the accounting system.\n- /uni25A0 We tested the reliability of the underlying data;\n- /uni25A0 We applied analytical procedures (including monitoring the change in loss ratios) to analyze the significant changes that took place over the reporting period;\n- /uni25A0 We have evaluated , notably on branches where the estimation of claims reserves has a higher risk of uncertainty and judgment,  the outcome of the accounting estimates made the previous years in order to assess the reliability of the process used by M anagement to calculate these estimates;\n- /uni25A0 Our work also consisted in assessing the relevance of the statistical methods and actuarial inputs applied, as well as of the assumptions used, with respect to the applicable regulations, market practices, ongoing litigations and the economic and financial context of the AXA/uni00A0S.A. Group;\n- /uni25A0 We have, with the help of our actuarial specialists, undertook an independent evaluation of the reserves for some insurance risk categories.\n\nFinally, we assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nI",

Goodwill is allocated to the CGUs of the activities into which that business was incorporated.\n\nAn impairment test of goodwill, as stated in Note 1.7.1 to the consolidated financial statements, is performed at least once a year to ensure that the net carrying amount does not exceed the recoverable amount and that there is no impairment risk. The recoverable amount corresponds to the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.\n\nAs stated in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, value in use  is mainly based on the following key assumptions:\n\n- /uni25A0 cash flow projections based on business plan,\n- /uni25A0 discount rates, and\n- /uni25A0 growth rates\n\nrequiring significant judgment from M anagement. This is especially the case for the AXA XL CGU.\n\nAccordingly, we deemed the measurement of the recoverable amount of goodwill to be a key audit matter.\n\nOur audit approach to the risk relating to recoverability of goodwill, notably for AXA XL CGU, was as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 We assessed the compliance of the methodology applied by the Group with current accounting standards and its implementation;\n- /uni25A0 We evaluated the design and tested the  operating e/ff ectiveness of the  controls related to goodwill impairment test process we deemed key to our audit;\n- /uni25A0 We also performed  procedures regarding the main assumptions used by M anagement to test :\n- -the consistency of the projected future cash flows  with M anagement's most recent estimates, as established during the business plan ;\n- -the reasonableness of the assumptions made with respect to projected future cash flows  in terms of the economic and financial context of the CGU and, the reliability of the process by which the estimates were calculated , by assessing the reasons for differences between projected and actual performances;\n- -the reasonableness of the discount rate and long term growth rate and their consistency with the projected cash flows to which they apply;\n- /uni25A0 We also performed a sensitivity analysis of the main assumptions to ascertain that selected adverse changes to main assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of goodwill to exceed the recoverable amount.\n\nWe assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## SPECIFIC  VERIFICATIONS\n\nWe have also performed, in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the specific verifications required by laws and regulations of the information relating to the Group given in the Board of Directors' management report .\n\nWe have no matters to report as to its fair presentation and its consistency with the consolidated financial statements, it being specified that it is not our responsibility to conclude on the fair presentation and consistency with the financial statements of the solvency related information extracted from the report required by A rticle L. 356-23 of the French Insurance Code ( Code des assurances ).\n\nWe attest that the consolidated non-financial statement required by Article L. 225-102-1 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ) is included in the information relating to the Group given in the management report, it being specified that, in accordance with Article L. 823-10 of said Code, we have verified neither the fair presentation nor the consistency with the consolidated financial statements of the information contained therein.This information should be reported on by an independent third party.\n\n## REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\n\n## Format of preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in the annual financial report\n\nWe have also verified, in accordance with the professional standard applicable in France relating to the procedures performed by statutory auditors regarding the annual and consolidated financial statements prepared in the European single electronic format, that the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in the annual financial report mentioned in Article L. 451-1-2, I of the French Monetary and Financial Code ( Code mon\u00e9taire et financier ), prepared under responsibility of the Chief Executive O/ff icer, complies with the single electronic format defined in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No. 2019/815 of 17 December 2018. Regarding consolidated financial statements, our work includes verifying that the tagging thereof complies with the format defined in the above-mentioned regulation.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users made on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L. 823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code ( Code de commerce ), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the a/ff airs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- /uni25A0 Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be su/ff icient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- /uni25A0 Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ff ectiveness of the internal control.\n\nI",

This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

The shareholders waived their preferential subscription rights so that this o/ff  ering could be made exclusively to Group employees (' Shareplan  2022')    .\n\nIn countries that met the legal, regulatory and tax requirements to participate in Shareplan, two investment options were o/ff ered to the Group employees in 2022:\n\n- /uni25A0 the classic o/ff er, proposed in 36/uni00A0countries,\n- /uni25A0 the guarantee plus o/ff er, proposed in 32/uni00A0countries.\n\nThe classic offer allowed employees to subscribe through a personal investment to AXA shares (either through Mutual funds (FCPE) or through direct share ownership, depending on their country) with a 20% discount. The shares are held within the Group Company Savings Plans and are restricted from sale during a period of approximately 5/uni00A0years (except specific early exit cases allowed by applicable law).

The Company's registered o/ff ice is located at 25, avenue Matignon, 75008 Paris, France and its  telephone  number  is  +33 (0) 1 40 75 57 00.  AXA/uni00A0 SA  was incorporated in 1957 but the origin of its activities dates to 1852. The Company's corporate existence will continue, subject to dissolution or prolongation, until December/uni00A031, 2059. The Company is registered with the Paris Trade and Companies Register ( Registre du commerce et des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s ) under number/uni00A0572 093 920. AXA's legal entity identifier (LEI) is F5WCUMTUM4RKZ1MAIE39.\n\nThe following documents may be consulted at the AXA Group Legal Department (Tour Majunga - 6, place de la Pyramide -\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Regulation and Supervision\n\nAXA is engaged in regulated business activities on a global scale through numerous operating subsidiaries. The Group's principal business activities of insurance, reinsurance and asset management are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision in each of the various jurisdictions where the Group operates. AXA/uni00A0SA, the ultimate parent holding company of the AXA Group, is also subject to extensive regulation as a reinsurer and as a result of its listing on Euronext Paris and its direct and indirect shareholding in numerous regulated insurance and asset management subsidiaries. Given that the AXA Group is headquartered in Paris, France, this supervision is based to a significant extent on European Union directives and regulations and on the French regulatory system. AXA's principal regulators and supervisory authorities in France are the AMF, which is the financial markets regulator, and the Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (the 'ACPR'), which is the insurance, reinsurance and financial services supervisor.\n\nAs a global company operating in numerous jurisdictions, the AXA Group is subject to various laws and regulations. This section does not purport to describe all of the regulations to which AXA Group is subject nor to provide all of the information in connection with the AXA Group's supervision in every jurisdiction in which the AXA Group is present.\n\nThis section presents what the AXA Group considers to be the most significant regulations and supervision mechanisms to which the AXA Group is subject as of the filing date of this Annual Report with the AMF.\n\nA/f\\_t er having received its reinsurance license from the ACPR in May/uni00A02022 and merging with AXA Global Re on June/uni00A030, 2022, AXA/uni00A0SA has completed its previously announced transformation into the Group's internal reinsurer.

In certain jurisdictions, regulations limit sales commissions, fees and certain other marketing expenses that may be incurred by the insurer and impose product suitability and disclosure requirements. In general, insurers and reinsurers are required to file detailed annual financial statements with their supervisory agencies in each of the jurisdictions in which they do business. Such agencies may conduct regular or unexpected examinations of the insurers' and reinsurers' operations and accounts and request additional information from the insurer and reinsurer. Certain jurisdictions also require registration and periodic reporting by holding companies that control a licensed insurer or reinsurer. This holding company legislation\n\nI\n\nI\n\n7",

In addition, such legislation generally provides that any direct or indirect acquisition of 'control' of our insurance or reinsurance entities domiciled in a given jurisdiction will be subject to the prior approval of the insurance and reinsurance regulatory authorities in such jurisdiction; the definition of 'control' for such purposes generally includes any direct or indirect acquisition of shares or other instruments representing more than a 9.9% voting interest, and would include the acquisition of shares of AXA/uni00A0SA as an insurance holding company. In general, these regulatory schemes are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than shareholders. For additional information, see the paragraph 'The Group and our businesses are subject to extensive regulation, regulatory supervision, adverse judicial decisions, and emerging legal, regulatory, and reputational risks in the various jurisdictions in which we operate ' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\n## REGULATORY CAPITAL AND SOLVENCY REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe Group and its insurance and reinsurance entities are subject to regulatory capital requirements in the jurisdictions where they do business, which are designed to monitor capital adequacy and to protect policyholders. While the specific regulatory capital requirements (including the definition of admitted assets and methods of calculation) vary between jurisdictions, an insurer's or reinsurer's required regulatory capital can be impacted by a wide variety of factors, including, but not limited to, business mix, product design, sales volume, invested assets, liabilities, reserves and movements in the capital markets, including interest rates and financial markets. Regulatory capital requirements may increase, possibly significantly, during periods of declining financial markets and/or lower interest rates.\n\n## Solvency/uni00A0II\n\nThe European Union has implemented a regulatory regime for European insurers which became effective on January/uni00A01, 2016, following the adoption of Directive 2009/138/EC dated November/uni00A025, 2009 on the taking-up and pursuit of the business\n\nI\n\nI\n\nof insurance and reinsurance, as amended (the 'Solvency/uni00A0II Directive') and the regulations promulgated thereunder (together with the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive, 'Solvency/uni00A0II'). Solvency/uni00A0II was implemented into French law beginning in 2015. In June/uni00A02019, amendments to the delegated regulations enacted under the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive were issued in connection with the 2018 interim review of Solvency/uni00A0II.\n\nSolvency/uni00A0II is designed to implement solvency requirements that reflect the risks that insurance and reinsurance companies face and build a supervisory system that is consistent across all EU Member States. Solvency/uni00A0II is based on three pillars, applicable both at the individual insurer or reinsurer and group levels: (1) Pillar 1 consists of the quantitative requirements around own funds, valuation rules for assets and liabilities and solvency capital requirements; (2) Pillar 2 sets out qualitative requirements for the governance and Risk Management of insurers, as well as for the effective supervision of insurers, including the requirement for insurers to submit an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment ('ORSA'); and (3) Pillar 3 introduces an enhanced reporting and disclosure regime, pursuant to which subject insurance undertakings headquartered in the European Union are required to prepare a Regular Supervisory Report ('RSR'), to be submitted by the undertaking to the competent national supervisory authority on a regular basis as determined by the regulation, and a Solvency and Financial Condition Report ('SFCR'), to be made publicly available on an annual basis. Solvency/uni00A0II covers, among other matters, the valuation of assets and liabilities, the treatment of insurance and reinsurance groups, the definition of capital and the overall level of required capital. A key aspect of Solvency/uni00A0II is that assessment of the Group's risks and capital requirements is aligned closely with economic capital methodologies and allows the use of either a standard model or an insurer's or reinsurer's own internal economic capital model (to permit a better understanding of the actual risks and Risk Management of the insurer or reinsurer) to calculate the Solvency Capital Requirement ('SCR'), subject in the latter case to the approval of the insurer's lead supervisor.\n\nSolvency/uni00A0II provides for two separate levels of solvency capital requirements: (i) /uni00A0 the Minimum Capital Requirement ('MCR'), which is the amount of own funds below which policyholders and beneficiaries are exposed to an unacceptable level of risk should the insurance or reinsurance companies be allowed to continue their operations, and (ii) /uni00A0 the SCR, which corresponds to a level of eligible own funds that enables insurance or reinsurance companies to absorb significant losses and gives reasonable assurance to policyholders and beneficiaries that payments will be made.",

The Solvency/uni00A0II ratio of the Group as of December/uni00A031, 2022, published on February/uni00A023, 2023, was estimated at 215%/uni00A0 (1 ) , compared to 217% as of December/uni00A031, 2021. The Group maintained eligible own funds in excess of its SCR at all times during 2022.\n\nAXA continues to regularly review the scope, underlying methodologies and assumptions of the Internal Model, and will adjust its SCR accordingly. In addition, AXA's Internal Model has been and may be revised from time to time in accordance with applicable regulations. However, any significant change to the Internal Model would be subject to the prior approval of the ACPR, which may require adjustments to the level of SCR.\n\nFor more information on the Internal Model, please refer to Section/uni00A0 5.2 'Internal control and Risk Management - Internal Model'  of this Annual Report. For further information on AXA's SCR, Internal Model and other Solvency/uni00A0II disclosures, please refer to the AXA Group's SFCR for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2021, available on AXA's website AXA Group's SFCR for the year ended December/uni00A031, 2022 is expected to be published  by the end of May/uni00A02023 on the same website. (www.axa.com).\n\n## Solvency/uni00A0II review\n\nThe Solvency/uni00A0II framework is currently under review by the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union. Following the opinion submitted by EIOPA to the European Commission on December/uni00A017, 2020 as part of the review of the Solvency/uni00A0II framework (the 'Solvency/uni00A0II Opinion'), the European Commission published on September/uni00A022, 2021 its proposed directive amending the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive and explained its overall intentions on the most important aspects of the forthcoming level/uni00A02 amendments (in particular with respect to risk margin). On June/uni00A017, 2022, the Council of the European Union agreed on its position and published a compromise text, with proposed amendments to the Solvency/uni00A0II framework including, among others, (i) /uni00A0the extrapolation method and changes to the volatility adjustment, including the introduction of principles for the modelling of the dynamic volatility adjustment; (ii) /uni00A0new reporting requirements such as (a) the assessment of the impact of long-term climate change scenarios on our business in the ORSA, (b) structural changes to the Solvency and Financial Condition Report (SFCR) that would require undertakings to split their content into a part addressed to policyholders and a part addressed to other market participants, and (c) the requirement for internal model users to calculate and report their solvency and financial condition using the standard formula; (iii) /uni00A0 the introduction of macro-prudential tools, including the integration of macroeconomic considerations in the ORSA and granting supervisory authorities extended powers with respect to macro prudential concerns, allowing them to impose additional\n\nmeasures to reinforce insurance groups and companies' financial condition, such as restricting or suspending dividend or other payments to shareholders (including share buy-backs) and other implementing measures aimed at mitigating liquidity risk-related concerns; and (iv) /uni00A0amending the Group supervision regime (including the required amount of eligible own funds ('EOF') requirements and the MCR for groups). The Council of the European Union must now agree on a final version with the European Parliament. The European Parliament has not finalized its position yet.\n\n## Recovery and resolution regimes for insurers and reinsurers\n\nIf the solvency, liquidity or the interests of clients of an insurer or reinsurer are threatened, insurance supervisors generally have broad authority to exercise various administrative powers at an early stage, including limiting or prohibiting certain activities or operations (such as the acceptance of premiums), prohibiting or on the contrary ordering asset or portfolio disposals, restricting payment of dividends or other shareholder distributions, suspending managers, and/or putting a company under special oversight.\n\nIn addition, under the French recovery and resolution framework for the insurance sector, set forth in Order No./uni00A02017-1608 of November/uni00A027, 2017, and its various implementing measures (the 'French Resolution Framework'), the ACPR is empowered to use resolution tools in order to maintain continuity of critical functions of insurance holding companies, and insurance or reinsurance companies that are failing or likely to fail. These tools include portfolio transfers, the establishment of a bridge institution or the establishment of a liability management structure, as well as associated resolution actions such as temporary stays on certain payments. Under the French Resolution Framework, major French insurance groups, such as the AXA Group, are required to prepare and file with the ACPR a pre-emptive recovery plan ( plan pr\u00e9ventif de r\u00e9tablissement ) covering insurance holding companies, insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries thereof, and any other entity of such groups, providing key services ( services indispensables ) thereto, and to ensure that such recovery plan remains up-to-date therea/f\\_t er.\n\nOn September/uni00A022, 2021, the European Commission published its proposed directive establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of insurance and reinsurance companies with a view towards harmonizing national laws on recovery and resolution of insurers and reinsurers, ensuring that EU Member States have the same tools and procedures to address failures of insurers and reinsurers, safeguarding the interests of policyholders, preserving the real economy and facilitating cooperation between national supervisory authorities when dealing with the failure of crossborder insurance and reinsurance groups.

EU Member States may also introduce additional measures and powers at the national level, as long as these are compatible with the objectives and principles set out at the EU level. On December/uni00A020, 2022, the Council of the European Union published its agreed-upon position regarding the proposed directive and must now agree on a final version with the European Parliament.\n\n## EU-US Covered Agreement\n\nIn connection with Solvency/uni00A0II, on September/uni00A022, 2017, the European Union and the United States signed the 'Bilateral Agreement between the European Union and the United States of America on Prudential Measures Regarding Insurance and Reinsurance' (the 'Covered Agreement') which sets out principles governing the imposition of Group capital and supervisory standards for insurance groups headquartered in a EU Member State or the United States with operations in both. Following approval by the European Parliament on March/uni00A01, 2018, and the Council of the European Union on March/uni00A020, 2018, the Covered Agreement entered into force on April/uni00A04, 2018, and will be fully implemented within five years from its signing date. Pursuant to the Covered Agreement, the AXA Group will remain subject to group supervisory and capital requirements, as currently provided under Solvency/uni00A0II, with AXA's US insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries remaining subject to local requirements. The Covered Agreement also addresses various regulatory information-sharing and reporting matters, as well as EU/US reinsurance market issues.\n\n## LLOYD'S\n\nFollowing the acquisition of XL group in 2018, we have been managing, through AXA/uni00A0XL Underwriting Agencies Limited, Syndicate 2003, a large underwriting syndicate at Lloyd's and, as a result of which, are exposed to a variety of Lloyd's-related regulatory risks. For instance, the Council of Lloyd's has wide discretionary powers to regulate members of Lloyd's, and may vary the method by which the capital solvency ratio is calculated, or impose additional or special levies on members.\n\nFor further information on the risks related to regulatory capital requirements, see the paragraph 'The Group's or its insurance\n\nI\n\nI\n\nor reinsurance entities' failure to meet their solvency and capital adequacy requirements could have a material adverse e/ff ect on our business, liquidity, ratings, results of operations and financial condition' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\n## IAIS AND INTERNATIONALLY ACTIVE INSURANCE GROUP ('IAIG') STATUS\n\nThe IAIS has developed several sets of supervisory requirements and actions applicable to the insurance industry: (i) /uni00A0 ICPs, which are intended to apply to the supervision of all insurers and insurance groups, regardless of size or importance; (ii) /uni00A0 the Common Framework ('ComFrame'), which builds and expands on the standards and guidance set forth in the ICPs to establish supervisory standards and guidance focusing on the e/ff ective group-wide supervision of IAIGs, as well as a globally comparable risk-based measure of capital adequacy of IAIGs, the Insurance Capital Standard (the 'ICS'); and (iii) /uni00A0policy measures for global systemically important insurers ('GSIIs') and an assessment methodology for designating GSIIs. From 2013 to 2016, the FSB, in consultation with the IAIS and national authorities, annually published a list of GSIIs, which included AXA in each of such years. The ACPR, as AXA's group-wide supervisor, has designated AXA as an IAIG.\n\nOn November/uni00A014, 2019, the IAIS adopted the ComFrame, which includes the version 2.0 of the ICS. As part of the IAIS implementation schedule, ICS/uni00A02.0 is first subject to a five-year monitoring period, starting in January/uni00A02020, during which IAIGs can be asked by their supervisors to compute an ICS, on a voluntary basis, for confidential reporting and discussion in supervisory colleges. The end objective for the IAIS is to have the ICS implemented in all jurisdictions as a group-wide prescribed capital requirement for IAIGs a/f\\_t er the monitoring period.\n\nOn November/uni00A0 14, 2019, the IAIS also adopted a holistic framework for the assessment and mitigation of systemic risk in the insurance sector (the 'Holistic Framework'), in lieu of the previous individual GSII designation mechanism.\n\nThe Holistic Framework comprises a set of enhanced supervisory measures and powers of intervention ( e.g ., ongoing supervisory requirements applied to insurers, enhanced macro-prudential surveillance, crisis management and recovery planning), which are embedded within certain ICPs and ComFrame materials, an annual global monitoring exercise by the IAIS (at individual insurer and sector-wide levels), as well as implementation assessment activities aimed at assessing and mitigating the potential build-up of systemic risk in the global insurance sector. The Holistic Framework moves away from the previous binary approach, in which a set of pre-determined policy measures applied to only a small group of identified GSIIs, to an approach promoting a proportionate application of an enhanced set of",

In addition, many of the enhanced supervisory measures reflected in the Holistic Framework are similar to and derived from the enhanced policy measures the IAIS had formerly adopted for application to GSIIs only. In light of the development and adoption of the Holistic Framework by the IAIS, the FSB has decided to continue suspending the annual identification of GSIIs as from the beginning of 2020. On December/uni00A09, 2022, the FSB announced that it will discontinue the annual identification of GSIIs and that, going forward, it will utilize assessments available through the Holistic Framework to inform its considerations of systemic risk in the insurance sector.\n\nAXA will continue to monitor the development of the Holistic Framework, ICPs and ComFrame and expects the regulatory landscape with respect to insurance, reinsurance and financial markets to continue to evolve in 2023 and beyond with further legislative and regulatory initiatives.\n\n## ASSET MANAGEMENT & BANKING ACTIVITIES\n\nAXA Investment Managers and other AXA asset management entities are subject to extensive regulations in the various jurisdictions in which they operate. These include, in Europe, Directive 2011/61/EU dated June/uni00A0 8, 2011 on Alternative Investment Fund Managers (as amended, 'AIFMD'), and Directive 2009/65/EC dated July/uni00A013, 2009 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities ('UCITS'), and their various implementing regulations and transposition measures. On November/uni00A025, 2021, the European Commission published legislative proposals regarding the AIFMD and the rules applicable to UCITS. On June/uni00A017, 2022, the Council of the European Union published its agreed-upon position and must now agree on a final version with the European Parliament. The European Parliament has not finalized its position yet.  In addition, AXA's investment management operations in the United States are subject to regulation by the SEC.\n\nThese regulations are generally designed to safeguard client assets and ensure the adequacy of disclosures concerning investment returns, the risk characteristics of invested assets in various funds, the suitability of investments for client investment objectives and risk tolerance, as well as the identity, regulatory approvals and qualifications of the investment manager. These regulations generally grant supervisory agencies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the carrying on of business for failure to comply with such laws\n\nand regulations. In such event, the possible sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in business for specific periods, the revocation of the registration as an investment company, censures and/or fines.\n\nIn addition, certain AXA entities must comply with revised obligations on capital resources for banks and certain investment firms, including Directive 2013/36/EU dated June/uni00A026, 2013, on access to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit institutions and investment firms (as amended 'CRD'), and Regulation (EU) No./uni00A0575/2013 dated June/uni00A026, 2013, on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms, as amended, which set forth specific capital, governance and remuneration requirements (as amended 'CRR'). On June/uni00A027, 2019, Directive (EU) 2019/878 dated May/uni00A020, 2019 ('CRD/uni00A0II') and Regulation (EU) 2019/876 dated May/uni00A020, 2019 ('CRR/uni00A0II'), which respectively amend CRD and CRR, entered into force. CRD/uni00A0II and CRR/uni00A0II further implement the Basel/uni00A0III framework by amending various CRD and CRR provisions regarding, e.g. , holding company rules, leverage ratios, large exposures, liquidity, market risk and counterparty credit risk, as well as reporting and disclosure requirements (including on remuneration). Most provisions of CRD/uni00A0II had to be transposed into national law by EU Member states by December/uni00A028, 2020, and were transposed in France by Order No./uni00A02020-1635 dated December/uni00A021, 2020, while most CRR/uni00A0II requirements became applicable as of June/uni00A028, 2021.\n\nMoreover, certain AXA entities are subject to Directive 2014/65/ EU dated May/uni00A015, 2014, on markets in financial instruments (as amended, 'MiFID/uni00A0II') and Regulation (EU) No./uni00A0600/2014 on markets in financial instruments, as amended ('MiFIR' and, together with MiFID/uni00A0II, and the various regulations promulgated thereunder, the 'MiFID/uni00A0II Package') which entered into force in 2018. The MiFID/uni00A0II Package, which was designed to better integrate the European Union's financial markets and increase cross-border investments, market transparency and investor protection, imposes a wide variety of new requirements including with respect to trading/ clearing of certain derivatives on organized platforms, regular reporting with respect to derivatives positions and certain other types of financial instruments, enhanced governance and investor protection standards, restrictions and/or prohibitions on certain types of compensation arrangements or other monetary inducements to firms providing independent investment advice and greater regulation of structured products and other complex financial instruments.\n\nThe reforms introduced by the MiFID/uni00A0II Package significantly impacted EU securities and derivatives markets. The European Commission conducted a public consultation on the review of the MiFID/uni00A0II Package, which expired in May/uni00A02020, and consequently revised the MiFID/uni00A0II Package in successive Commission delegated regulations published on March/uni00A026, 2021, July/uni00A014, 2021 and August/uni00A02, 2021. These regulations require investment firms that manufacture and distribute financial instruments to, among other things, (i) /uni00A0 clarify that their processes and internal control\n\nI\n\nI\n\n7",

On March/uni00A09, 2022, ESMA published its assessment of, and recommendations on, the European Commission's proposal. The Council of the European Union and the European Parliament are currently examining the proposal.\n\nSome AXA entities are directly or indirectly subject to Regulation (EU) No./uni00A01286/2014 dated November/uni00A026, 2014, on key information documents for packaged retail and insurance-based investment products (as amended, the 'PRIIPs Regulation') which entered into force in 2018, the objective of which is to enhance retail investor protection by standardizing the information through predefined key information documents. While the PRIIPs Regulation has already impacted insurance undertakings, banks and asset managers, its technical regulatory standards are under review by the European Commission, and review of the PRIIPS Regulations under consideration by the European Union in order to reach better convergence with other EU regulations.\n\nThe European Union (Regulation (EU) 648/2012 dated July/uni00A04, 2012, also referred to as the European Market Infrastructure Regulation - 'EMIR') and similar US regulations (principally under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act), as amended from time to time, establish various requirements and prescriptive guidelines which impact operations, liquidity and credit Risk Management for derivatives. AXA's asset managers and banks, which manage derivatives on behalf of various AXA Group a/ff iliates (including on behalf of AXA), operate in conformity with these rules, in line with the Group's overall financial risk framework.\n\nFor additional information, see the paragraph 'The Group and our businesses are subject to extensive regulation, regulatory supervision, adverse judicial decisions, and emerging legal, regulatory, and reputational risks in the various jurisdictions in which we operate ' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## OTHER SIGNIFICANT LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORKS\n\n## EU Data Protection Reform\n\nThe EU Data Protection Reform, which was adopted in 2016 and entered into force in 2018, establishes a comprehensive framework governing the protection and processing of personal data in the private and public sectors, which includes the GDPR.\n\nThe main principles of the GDPR include (i) /uni00A0 the strengthening of citizens' fundamental rights, giving them more control over their personal data and making it easier for them to access it, (ii) /uni00A0 an increased harmonization of the applicable law across the European Union and a 'one-stop-shop' that will streamline cooperation between the data protection authorities on issues with implications for all the European Union, and (iii) /uni00A0a stronger enforcement regime, under which competent data protection authorities are able to fine companies that do not comply with EU rules up to 4% of their global annual turnover. The GDPR applies to both EU and non-EU companies, if the latter are offering goods and services or monitoring the behaviour of individuals in the European Union. As insurance and reinsurance companies need a EU license for providing insurance services in the European Union, the GDPR applies primarily, in the insurance and reinsurance sector, to companies operating in the European Union.\n\nIn France, the EU Data Protection Reform has been transposed by Law No./uni00A02018-493 regarding personal data protection, which entered into force on May/uni00A025, 2018, and various implementing measures, including Decree No./uni00A02018-687 dated August/uni00A01, 2018.\n\nFor further information concerning data protection, please see the paragraph 'The evolving and complex regulatory environment surrounding data protection and transfer worldwide could increase our costs and adversely impact our business' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\n## Personal data transfers to non-EU jurisdictions (without an adequacy decision adopted by the European Commission)\n\nFollowing invalidation in 2015 of the European Commission's Safe Harbor Decision by the European Union Court of Justice (the '2015 ECJ Decision'), which had allowed, under certain conditions, for the transfer of personal information for commercial purposes from companies in the European Union to companies in the United States which had signed up to the US Department of Commerce 'Safe Harbor Privacy Principles,' transatlantic data flows between companies continued using other mechanisms, such as standard contractual clauses with US companies and binding corporate rules for transfers within a multinational corporate group. Following the 2015 ECJ Decision,",

As banks, insurance and reinsurance companies were generally not eligible to register and participate in the EU-US Privacy Shield, the AXA Group has continued to rely on standard contractual clauses when transferring data to non-AXA non-EU companies, and binding corporate rules when transferring personal data between companies within the AXA Group. We currently believe that we can continue using such mechanisms to transfer data to the US and to other non-EU jurisdictions and add supplementary measures as required. In December/uni00A02022, the European Commission announced a dra/f\\_t adequacy decision for the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (the 'EU-US DPF'), a data transfer mechanism that would replace the invalidated EU-US Privacy Shield. As with the EU-US Privacy Shield, the EU-US DPF is limited to entities subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission or Department of Transportation, though other US statutory bodies recognized by the EU may be included in future annexes of the EU-US DPF. Because of this, the AXA Group believes that it may continue to rely on standard contractual clauses and binding corporate rules as data transfer mechanisms to transfer data from the EU to the United States and other non-EU jurisdictions, but the EU-US DPF is in development and there is no guarantee that it will be approved in its current form. For further information concerning transatlantic data transfers, please see the paragraph 'The evolving and complex regulatory environment surrounding data protection and transfer worldwide could increase our costs and adversely impact our business' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\n## Information and Communication Technology (ICT)\n\nIn February/uni00A02020, EIOPA finalized its 'Guidelines on outsourcing to cloud service providers', which national supervisors have been enforcing since January/uni00A02021. In addition, on October/uni00A08, 2020, EIOPA issued an additional set of guidelines, the 'Guidelines on information and communication technology security and governance', aimed at promoting the operational resilience of the digital operations of insurance and reinsurance undertakings. Both sets of guidelines provide guidance to national competent authorities and insurance and reinsurance undertakings on the information and communication technology ('ICT') security and governance requirements envisaged under Solvency/uni00A0II,\n\nand have applied since July/uni00A01, 2021. AXA Group has tracked the progress of both sets of guidelines, provided feedback to EIOPA and confirmed the alignment of its practices or strategy with the guidelines.\n\nThese guidelines set out the principles developed for the financial sector under the European Commission's Digital Operational Resilience Act ('DORA'). DORA was adopted by the European Parliament on November/uni00A010, 2022 and by the Council of the European Union on November/uni00A028, 2022, and will come into e/ff ect in 2025. DORA is designed to establish a comprehensive framework on digital operational resilience for EU financial institutions, including insurance and reinsurance undertakings and intermediaries, credit institutions, investment firms, alternative investment fund managers and UCITS management companies. This framework is aimed at enhancing the ICT Risk Management conducted by financial institutions, establishing a thorough testing of ICT systems, increasing supervisors' awareness of cyber risks and ICT-related incidents faced by financial institutions, as well as introducing powers for competent supervisory authorities to oversee risks stemming from financial institutions' dependency on ICT third-party service providers. DORA also creates a consistent incident reporting mechanism in order to strengthen supervisory e/ff ectiveness.\n\n## Executive compensation\n\nSolvency/uni00A0II sets out the remuneration policy principles and governance requirements to be implemented by European insurers and specifies that the companies subject to Solvency/uni00A0II must adopt a written remuneration policy compliant with a number of principles set out in Delegated Regulation (EU) 2015/35 dated October/uni00A010, 2014 (as amended, the 'Solvency/uni00A0II Regulation')  which  promotes  sound  and  effective  Risk Management and does not encourage risk-taking that exceeds the risk tolerance limits of the Company. In this context, AXA has reviewed and formalized its existing Group remuneration policy, identified the individuals responsible for managing and having an impact on the Group's overall risk profile, and defined a consistent approach to manage remuneration of individuals in charge of control functions. AXA's Compensation, Governance & Sustainability Committee is in charge of overseeing the design of the remuneration policy and remuneration practices, their implementation and operation.\n\nSince 2008, there have been a variety of proposals with respect to executive compensation practices at financial institutions including from the FSB and other regulatory bodies. Certain of these proposals have been embodied in regulation or legislation, while others remain best practice recommendations.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n7",

Among the matters covered in these standards and principles are a variety of mechanisms (including minimum recommended deferrals of cash bonuses, greater use of longterm equity grants rather than cash as a form of compensation, minimum vesting/deferral periods, and performance criteria for vesting of long-term awards) that are designed to ensure an appropriate alignment of interests between (i) /uni00A0 Executive Management and certain employees (such as traders) who can have a potentially significant impact on the nature and duration of risks incurred, (ii) /uni00A0 the Company and (iii) /uni00A0 shareholders. The FSB's principles were supplemented by additional guidance published by the FSB in 2018, which has been developed in the form of recommendations regarding improvements in compensation practices and tools that could be used to reduce misconduct risk and address misconduct incidents.\n\nIn addition, on April/uni00A07, 2020, EIOPA published an opinion on the supervision of remuneration principles in the insurance sector. This opinion is based on EIOPA's views that the remuneration principles defined in the Solvency/uni00A0II Regulation are high-level and leave considerable discretion to undertakings and supervisory authorities, and aims at ensuring that consistent practices be applied in the application of the remuneration principles included in the Solvency/uni00A0II framework. As a result, EIOPA's opinion sets out guidance to national supervisory authorities on how to challenge the application of certain remuneration principles, and focuses on employees identified as potential higher profile risk-takers including, subject to certain variable compensation thresholds, (i) /uni00A0 members of the administrative, management or supervisory body of the undertaking, (ii) /uni00A0 Executive Directors who e/ff ectively run the undertaking, (iii) /uni00A0 key function holders within the meaning of the Solvency/uni00A0II regulations ( i.e. , Risk Management, compliance, internal audit and actuarial), and (iv) /uni00A0 employees whose professional activities have a material impact on the undertakings' risk profile. EIOPA has indicated that it will begin monitoring the application of this opinion by national supervisory authorities two years a/f\\_t er its publication ( i.e. , a/f\\_t  er April/uni00A07, 2022).\n\nThese principles and standards are reflected in a variety of regulations and legislative initiatives that have been enacted over the past few years in various jurisdictions where the Group does business. While these restrictions do not apply uniformly to the Group across the various jurisdictions where it does business, the Group has largely aligned its global executive compensation practices with these standards and principles, and conducts regular reviews of its compensation practices and policies in light of these standards as well as applicable legal and regulatory requirements. The application of these principles and standards may vary among the di/ff erent actors in the financial sector (such as banks, insurers, asset managers, private equity funds and hedge funds) and across the various jurisdictions where the Group does business, which may give rise to certain competitive issues for the Group, including by a/ff ecting the Group's ability to attract and retain top-rate talents.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## Evolution of accounting standards\n\nPolicyholders' liabilities through year-end 2022 (and for purposes of this Annual Report) were accounted for according to IFRS/uni00A04, which generally allows the use of a wide variety of accounting practices for insurance contracts, reflecting di/ff erent national accounting requirements, and the continuation of accounting policies applied prior to conversion to IFRS. On May/uni00A018, 2017, the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB') issued the IFRS/uni00A0 17/uni00A0 - Insurance Contracts, which replaced IFRS/uni00A04, finalizing a long-standing project of the IASB to develop a single and consistent approach to the accounting for insurance contracts. In particular, IFRS/uni00A017 requires insurance obligations to be accounted for using current values, instead of historical costs. Following amendments by the IASB on June/uni00A025, 2020, the updated IFRS/uni00A017 became e/ff ective for annual periods beginning on or a/f\\_t er January/uni00A01, 2023. The amended version of IFRS/uni00A017 was adopted by the European Union on November/uni00A019, 2021. The Group has begun applying IFRS/uni00A017 as from January/uni00A01, 2023.\n\nIn parallel with IFRS/uni00A017, the Group is applying (from January/uni00A01, 2023 onward) IFRS/uni00A09/uni00A0- Financial Instruments. The published e/ff  ective date of IFRS/uni00A09 was January/uni00A01, 2018. However, given the interaction between financial assets and insurance liabilities, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS/uni00A04 allowing, under certain conditions, entities issuing insurance contracts within the scope of IFRS/uni00A04 to defer the implementation of IFRS/uni00A09 until the e/ff ective date of IFRS/uni00A017, but no later than January/uni00A01, 2023, so that qualifying insurers could apply both standards for the first time simultaneously. The Group was eligible for this temporary exemption and decided to apply it.\n\nIn May/uni00A02023, the Group expects to report key 2022 financial information and activity indicators for the first quarter of 2023 under IFRS/uni00A017 and IFRS/uni00A09. All future financial performance will also be reported under IFRS/uni00A017 and IFRS/uni00A09.\n\n## Climate and sustainable finance-related regulatory initiatives SNFP\n\nThere are various initiatives at the French, EU and international levels with respect to climate change and sustainable finance, which generally aim at proposing reforms to and potential changes a/ff ecting investment activities, disclosure requirements and requirements relating to the inclusion of (i) /uni00A0environmental, social and governance ('ESG') considerations in insurance and Asset Management products and advice and (ii) /uni00A0climate change in stress testing.\n\n## Disclosure requirements with respect to climate change and/uni00A0sustainable finance\n\nIn France, the national framework for non-financial reporting requirements for companies (including financial institutions) has been successively strengthened by (i) /uni00A0 article/uni00A0173-VI of Law No./uni00A02015-992 dated August/uni00A017, 2015, on the energy transition for green growth ('article/uni00A0173') and (ii) /uni00A0 article/uni00A0 29 of Law No./uni00A02019-1147 dated November/uni00A08, 2019, on energy and climate",

The decree implementing article/uni00A029 published on May/uni00A027, 2021, provides a framework for extrafinancial reporting by market participants, which will include certain entities of the AXA Group, and defines how ESG qualitative information and the means implemented to support the energy and ecological transition are to be presented.\n\nAt the European Union level, Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 on sustainability-related disclosures in the financial services sector ('SFDR') was adopted on November/uni00A027, 2019. The SFDR sets out harmonized rules for financial market participants, which includes certain AXA Group entities, on transparency with respect to the integration of sustainability risks, the consideration of adverse sustainability impacts of market participants' processes and the provision of sustainability-related information of certain financial products. On April/uni00A06, 2022, the European Commission adopted a delegated regulation supplementing the SFDR with respect to regulatory technical standards ('RTS') for the content and presentation of disclosure requirements under the SFDR, which has been published in the O/ff icial Journal of the European Union as the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288 on July/uni00A0 25, 2022. The Joint Committee of the European Supervisory Authorities has published a set of questions and answers regarding the RTS on November/uni00A017, 2022. The RTS became applicable as of January/uni00A01, 2023. On October/uni00A031, 2022, following a final report by the Joint Committee of the European Supervisory Authorities, the European Commission adopted amendments to the RTS to require financial market participants to disclose the extent to which their portfolios are exposed to gas and nuclear-related activities. These amendments are currently subject to scrutiny by the Council of the European Union and by the European Parliament.\n\nRegulation (EU) 2020/852 on the establishment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment (the 'Taxonomy Regulation') was adopted on June/uni00A018, 2020. The Taxonomy Regulation applies, in particular, to undertakings (such as the Company) that are required to publish a non-financial statement. The Taxonomy Regulation establishes the criteria for determining whether an economic activity qualifies as environmentally sustainable for the purposes of establishing the degree to which an investment is environmentally sustainable. Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 dated June/uni00A04, 2021 and Commission Delegated\n\nRegulation (EU) 2021/2178 dated July/uni00A06, 2021 (both Commission Delegated Regulations as further amended by Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 dated March/uni00A09, 2022, amending Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 regarding economic activities in certain energy sectors and Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2178 regarding specific public disclosures for those economic activities) supplement the Taxonomy Regulation by, among other things, specifying the content and presentation of the information to be disclosed in a non-financial statement.\n\nRegulation (EU) 2019/2089 amending the EU Benchmark Regulation in connection with the EU Climate Transition Benchmarks, EU Paris-aligned Benchmarks and sustainabilityrelated disclosures for the benchmarks was adopted on November/uni00A027, 2019, and seeks to, among other things, ensure the integrity of low-carbon benchmarks. Directive 2014/95/EU (also known as the Non-Financial reporting Directive, or 'NFRD') is an amendment to Directive 2013/34/EU (the 'Accounting Directive') that requires certain large companies, such as AXA/uni00A0SA, to publish annually a non-financial statement.\n\nOn April/uni00A021, 2021, the European Commission published the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (the/uni00A0'CSRD') which, with respect to corporate sustainability reporting, amends the Accounting Directive, Directive 2004/109/EC (the Transparency Directive, as amended), Directive 2006/43/EC and Regulation (EU) No./uni00A0537/2014. The CSRD was published in the O/ff icial Journal of the European Union on December/uni00A016, 2022 and entered into force on January/uni00A05, 2023. The CSRD introduced, among other things, new sustainability-related reporting requirements for companies, including (i) /uni00A0the principal risks the issuer faces with respect to sustainability matters and how the issuer manages those risks, (ii) /uni00A0the resilience of the issuer's business model and strategy in light of risks related to sustainability matters, (iii) /uni00A0the opportunities which sustainability matters may present for the issuer, (iv) /uni00A0the issuer's plan(s) to ensure that its business model and strategy are compatible with the transition to a sustainable economy and with the global warming limit of 1.5\u00b0C set by the Paris Agreement, an international climate change agreement that entered into force on November/uni00A04, 2016, (v) /uni00A0 a description of the targets set by the issuer related to sustainability matters and the progress the issuer has made towards achieving those targets, (vi) /uni00A0 the role of the administrative, management and supervisory bodies with regards to sustainability matters, and (vii) /uni00A0 the due diligence process(es) implemented by the issuer with respect to sustainability matters.\n\nOn February/uni00A023, 2022, the European Commission published its proposal for a directive on corporate sustainability due diligence (the/uni00A0'CSDD Directive'). The CSDD Directive aims at, among other things, improving corporate governance practices to better integrate Risk Management and mitigation processes of human rights and environmental risks and impacts into corporate strategies, and improve access to remedies for those\n\nI\n\nI\n\n7",

In this connection, the CSDD Directive will introduce, among other things, obligations for certain companies regarding actual and potential human rights adverse impacts and environmental adverse impacts, with respect to their own operations, the operations of their subsidiaries, and the valuechain operations carried out by entities with whom the Company has an established business relationship. The proposal will be presented to the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union for approval. Once adopted, EU Member States will have two years to transpose the CSDD Directive into national law and communicate the relevant texts to the European Commission.\n\nFinally,  the  Group  supports  and  implements  the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), and publishes voluntary information in line with these recommendations, which include, among others, recommendations with respect to disclosure of actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning, disclosure of the organization's governance around climaterelated risks and opportunities and disclosure of metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks and opportunities.\n\n## Requirements relating to the inclusion of environmental, social and governance considerations in insurance and Asset Management products and advice\n\nOn April/uni00A0 30, 2019, EIOPA issued a technical opinion to the European Commission with respect to the integration of sustainability risks and factors in the delegated acts under the Solvency/uni00A0II Directive and Directive (EU) 2016/97 dated January/uni00A020, 2016, on insurance distribution (as amended, 'IDD'). On September/uni00A030, 2019, EIOPA issued its opinion on sustainability under Solvency/uni00A0II framework.\n\nBased on the public consultation conducted by the European Commission between June/uni00A02020 and July/uni00A02020, the European Commission adopted on April/uni00A021, 2021, Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/1257 amending the regime for the integration of sustainability factors, risks and preferences into the product oversight  and  governance  requirements  for  insurance undertakings and insurance distributors and into the rules on conduct of business and investment advice for insurance-based investment products. Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/1257 became applicable on August/uni00A02, 2022.\n\nAt the international level, the IAIS completed in January/uni00A02021 a public consultation on a draft Application Paper on the supervision of climate-related risks in the insurance sector, developed to support insurance supervisory authorities in their e/ff orts to integrate climate-related risks into their respective supervisory frameworks.\n\n## Requirements in connection with climate change in stress testing\n\nThe ACPR conducted an initial climate pilot exercise that incorporated certain climate change scenarios and assumptions into stress testing, the first results of which were published in May/uni00A02021. Pursuant to these first results, the exposure of French\n\nI\n\nI\n\nfinancial institutions to the sectors that are most impacted by the risks related to the ecological transition (as identified in the climate pilot exercise) is relatively limited. In February/uni00A02022, the ACPR published a report analyzing the evolution of measures taken by the industry in addressing climate risks. Further, the ACPR and the AMF published joint reports monitoring French financial institutions' climate commitments in November/uni00A02021 and November/uni00A02022, noting that the implementation of those commitments remains insu/ff icient.\n\nFor further information on climate change, please refer to Section/uni00A04.3 'Climate change and biodiversity ' of this Annual Report.\n\n## Reform and potential changes to reference rates and indices (benchmarks)\n\nReforms to interest rate, equity, foreign exchange rate and other types of indices (also known as 'benchmarks') have been recently enacted, and regulatory authorities have also proposed further reforms to and potential changes a/ff ecting benchmarks. In particular, Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 dated June/uni00A08, 2016 (as amended, the 'EU Benchmark Regulation'), which entered into force on January/uni00A01, 2018, as well as the EU Benchmark Regulation as incorporated into UK law as from January/uni00A01, 2021 (the 'UK Benchmark Regulation' and, together with the EU Benchmark Regulation, the 'Benchmark Regulation') imposed additional requirements on the provision of financial market-related benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of benchmarks within the EU and the UK.\n\nSeveral interbank market benchmarks have since been designated as critical benchmarks under the Benchmark Regulation, including LIBOR, EURIBOR and EONIA, and their related benchmark methodologies made subject to review. Certain critical benchmarks have been discontinued, including EONIA, which ceased to be published on January/uni00A03, 2022, and LIBOR (publication of most LIBOR settings ceased on December/uni00A031, 2021, and publication of certain USD LIBOR settings is expected to cease on June/uni00A030, 2023). In this context, Regulation (EU) 2021/168 amending the EU Benchmark Regulation was published on February/uni00A010, 2021, and allows the European Commission to impose a statutory replacement for certain critical benchmarks, whose cessation might result in significant disruption to the operation of financial markets in the EU. This new statutory benchmark would replace other benchmarks used in contracts and financial instruments, which (i) have not been renegotiated before the date of cessation of the benchmark, and (ii) /uni00A0contain either no contractual replacement (or so-called 'fallback provision'), or a fallback provision which is deemed unsuitable be supervisors. The European Commission has designated statutory replacements for EONIA and CHF LIBOR. The FCA has also exercised certain powers under the UK Benchmark Regulation to compel the publication of the 1-, 3- and 6-month GBP and JPY LIBOR settings on the basis of a changed or 'synthetic' methodology until December/uni00A031, 2022.\n\nBecause these reforms are a/ff ecting the whole financial services sector, the transition to new benchmarks creates industry-wide",

AXA is conducting a Group-wide project to manage this transition and manage the impacts of future benchmark changes, which could have implications for our capital models, Risk Management e/ff orts, investment strategies and product design, among others.\n\n## Evolution of the regulatory and litigation environment\n\nThe Group's insurance, reinsurance, asset management and banking operations are subject to an increasing number of legislative and regulatory initiatives designed to increase consumer protection in the sector of financial services. In the European Union, initiatives related to the financial sector include in particular the IDD, MiFID/uni00A0II and the PRIIPs Regulation. Similar initiatives are under review (or in the course of implementation) in other jurisdictions where the Group operates, and these initiatives are likely to continue to expand, resulting in increased operational compliance costs to meet regulatory expectations.\n\nThe IDD superseded the Insurance Mediation Directive and is designed to improve consumer protection by ensuring that all distributors of insurance products operate on a level playing field. The main provisions of the IDD relate to enhanced professional requirements ( e.g. , continuing training and development for distributors), conduct of business rules, conflicts of interest (relating to fees, commissions and bonuses), increased disclosure and transparency and extensive product governance requirements. It also includes additional requirements for the sale of insurance products with investment elements in order to ensure that policyholders receive a similar level of protection as buyers of retail investment products regulated under MiFID/uni00A0II ( e.g. , when providing advice, distributors have to assess whether the insurance-based investment product is suitable for the customer).\n\nThe IDD entered into force on October/uni00A01, 2018, while MiFID/uni00A0II and the PRIIPs Regulation entered into force at the beginning of January/uni00A02018.\n\nFinancial crime compliance programs of financial institutions (anti-money laundering, anti-corruption and international sanctions compliance) continue to be a major focus for regulatory and law enforcement authorities, with increasingly significant penalties imposed for compliance failures. In particular, French Law No./uni00A02016-1691 dated December/uni00A09, 2016 on transparency, the fight against corruption and modernization of the economy, known as 'Sapin/uni00A0II', which was introduced in June/uni00A0 2017, included new requirements for all large French companies to establish internal procedures to prevent and detect acts of corruption and influence peddling committed in France and abroad. Sapin/uni00A0II also established a new French anti-corruption agency ( Agence fran\u00e7aise anticorruption ), which was given strengthened supervisory and enforcement powers.\n\nFurthermore, Orders No./uni00A02020-1342 of November/uni00A04, 2020 and No./uni00A02020-115 of February/uni00A012, 2020, enhanced the requirements for French financial institutions, including the reinforcement of internal procedures to implement asset-freezing measures and prevent and detect acts of corruption committed in France and abroad, while strengthening the supervisory and enforcement powers of supervisory authorities. In addition, French Law No./uni00A02022-401 dated March/uni00A021, 2022 amended certain provisions of Sapin/uni00A0II to improve the protection of whistleblowers and became e/ff ective on September/uni00A01, 2022.\n\nIn light of this and other initiatives in respect of compliance requirements, Management believes that the complexity and risks for international financial institutions like AXA in this area will likely continue to increase, and that compliance costs will also increase accordingly.\n\nThe litigation environment in which the Group operates also continues to evolve. In continental Europe, the introduction of class actions, including in France in 2014, has, and is likely to continue to, increase litigation risks and costs for insurers, asset managers and other financial institutions. Most recently, the adoption of Directive (EU) 2020/1828 dated November/uni00A025, 2020, on representative actions for the protection of the collective interests of consumers at the EU level aims at enabling qualified entities to seek remedy through representative actions against infringements of provisions of EU law in a variety of areas (including data protection and financial services), in order to provide an e/ff ective and e/ff icient way of protecting the collective interests of consumers. This Directive was required to be transposed by EU Member States by December/uni00A025, 2022, for a scheduled application date of June/uni00A025, 2023. A bill to transpose this Directive has not yet been submitted to the French National Assembly.\n\nIn addition, the litigation environment has been evolving in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, with holders of property and casualty insurance policies increasingly seeking coverage for losses caused by the governmental actions and measures implemented to contain the spread of COVID-19, such as lockdown measures. A number of lawsuits have been and may be introduced against insurers, such as AXA, in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nFor additional information, please see 'The Group and our businesses are subject to extensive regulation, regulatory supervision, adverse judicial decisions, and emerging legal, regulatory, and reputational risks in the various jurisdictions in which we operate ' and 'We have been and may become in the future subject to lawsuits, regulatory investigations and/ or other proceedings which may affect our business, brand, reputation, relations with regulators and/or results of operations ' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors' and Section/uni00A05.8 'Other material risks - Regulatory risks' of this Annual Report.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n7",

AXA regards it as a critical element of its commitment to grow in a sustainable, responsible and socially inclusive way.\n\nAXA also squares its responsibilities as a co-operative, compliant taxpayer in each and every country in which it operates, with the need to support competitive business growth - serving all its stakeholders including investors, suppliers and employees.\n\n## TAX ASPECTS IN RELATION TO AXA AS/uni00A0A/uni00A0MULTINATIONAL COMPANY\n\n## The AXA Group's approach to tax issues\n\nIn the countries where it operates, AXA is both a taxpayer and a tax collector, given that many specific taxes are levied on insurance and reinsurance policies and collected from our customers as part of the insurance, reinsurance and Asset Management revenues while others are remitted to the various state and federal administrations around the world.\n\nThe tax function is organized within the Group to ensure full compliance with all tax legislation in the countries where AXA operates. In addition to the Group Tax Department based in France, all key operational entities/countries/geographic zones have a tax team in charge of ensuring that tax regulations are well understood and fully satisfied by the entities.\n\nAs a part of the global internal risk assessment, a specific tax internal control program is implemented. These controls must be reported and documented by each team in scope to ensure full compliance.\n\nA Tax Code of Ethics, agreed between Group Tax Department and local tax teams, highlights the key principles guiding the actions of the various tax teams:\n\n- /uni25A0 to comply with tax laws and regulations;\n- /uni25A0 to maintain a good relationship with the local tax authorities; and\n- /uni25A0 not to engage in aggressive tax driven transactions that could compromise the good reputation of the Group.\n\nThe satisfaction of this Code of Ethics is a prerequisite of the activities performed by all AXA tax teams and gives rise to an annual certification by each head of tax, which is provided to the Group tax team. In addition, a bi-annual tax review process of each key entity or business line is performed by the Group Tax Department in connection with each local team. During these reviews, specific attention is given to tax audits and associated tax risks as well as market positions on tax matters that may impact AXA. These reviews o/ff er a global framework for the tax teams to identify, analyze, control, and report tax risks.\n\nLastly, an International Tax Committee composed of various senior tax executives within AXA tax teams meets every quarter to ensure consistency in approach on some technical topics, as well as agreements on guidelines, when necessary, connected to specific items.\n\nAs an international group operating in several countries, the AXA Group is subject to various tax regimes and regulations and takes into account any changes in tax law. AXA is specifically vigilant about the changes that could result in higher tax expenses and payments, higher compliance costs or that may a/ff ect the AXA Group's tax liability, return on investments and business operations. In particular, please see the paragraph 'Changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations or uncertainties in the interpretation of certain tax laws may result in adverse consequences to our business and our results of operations ' in Section/uni00A05.1 'Risk Factors' of this Annual Report.\n\nWhen considering how AXA entities structure commercial arrangements, tax implications are analyzed in parallel with other consequences such as capital e/ff iciency and legal and regulatory aspects when deciding between potential alternative arrangements.\n\n- /uni25A0 to remain up to date with respect to applicable laws and regulations;\n\nI\n\nI",

The presence in this jurisdiction is purely driven by operational purposes.\n\nAXA still holds two non-consolidated operating companies in Panama (one providing assistance services to local customers, and the other delivering health claim services) employing circa 40/uni00A0people at the end of 2022.\n\nMore globally, AXA does not use non-cooperative jurisdictions to avoid taxes on operational activities performed elsewhere.\n\nAny presence in countries in which AXA operates with tax rates lower than France are driven by business operations. With the acquisition of the XL Group in September/uni00A02018, AXA now has a material presence and substance in Bermuda with nearly 200/uni00A0employees working for AXA XL there. Despite the fact that Bermuda is a low-tax jurisdiction, it is a center of expertise and one of the key locations of the worldwide reinsurance market. It is not considered as a non-cooperative jurisdiction according to the French and European Union laws. This presence is mainly driven by local capital management regulation enabling flexibility on the required capital for reinsurance activities and AXA supports the Economic Substance legislation enacted in this country. This situation will in no way change how the AXA Group is managed on the tax side. AXA will continue to tax its operations in the various countries where operational profits are made.\n\n## Disclosure on tax matters and information on/uni00A0taxes connected with the Group's activities in each country\n\nThe  consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  in compliance with IFRS standards (as disclosed in Section/uni00A06.6 Note/uni00A01 'Accounting principles' of this Annual Report). Accounting for income taxes recognizes both the current tax consequences of transactions and events and the future tax consequences of the future recovery or settlement of the carrying amount of the entity's assets and liabilities, as required by IAS/uni00A012 (see Section/uni00A06.6 - Note/uni00A01.17.1 'Income taxes' of this Annual Report).\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements present the reconciliation between the theoretical tax charge and the e/ff ective tax charge\n\nunder IFRS. All di/ff erences are fully explained (see Section/uni00A06.6 - Note/uni00A019 'Tax' of this Annual Report). It should be noted that in many jurisdictions where AXA operates, the income and capital gains on savings products benefit from a favorable tax treatment, also when such products are included in life insurance products. This leads to a lower e/ff ective tax rate for life insurance companies.\n\nIn addition to the details reported around the Group e/ff ective tax rate, AXA reports substantial information on the impacts of any change in local tax regulations on its business, as well as details of the tax burden per line of business and per country. AXA's income tax expenses/benefits are extensively disclosed in the Annual Report and are broken down by business segment and country. For each, a dedicated paragraph provides a comment about the line related to Tax Income (see Section/uni00A02.3 'Activity Report'  of this Annual Report).\n\nSince 2019, AXA has been annually reporting a Tax Transparency report where it discloses a lot of information around its tax footprint in its key geographies, as well as key principles of its tax policy. This report is available on the AXA website (www.axa. com) at the end of the AXA Group Tax Policy page. AXA updates this report annually and the most recent version was issued in June/uni00A02022.\n\n## TAX ASPECTS OF ACTIVITIES AND/uni00A0PRODUCTS OFFERED BY THE GROUP\n\n## Activities of the Group\n\nThe Group's activities are subject to strict regulations and rigorous control in each territory in which AXA operates. In addition to these regulations, AXA has developed a set of detailed internal standards that applies to all Group entities that are managed or controlled by AXA, regardless of the activities undertaken by the entity or its ownership structure.\n\nAccording to these internal standards, Chief Executive O/ff icers must ensure that sta/ff  are fully conversant, and comply with applicable laws, mandatory Codes of Conduct, rules and regulations (including applicable tax laws and regulations) relevant to their area of operations.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n7",

However, no such Extraordinary Shareholders' Meetings may decide (i) /uni00A0to increase the liability of the shareholders in respect of the Company or a third party; or (ii) /uni00A0 to reduce the individual rights vested in each shareholder (such as voting rights, right to distributable profits of the Company, right to sell one's shares and right to sue the Company).\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## SHAREHOLDERS' MEETINGS\n\nShareholders are convened, meet and deliberate in accordance with applicable French laws and AXA SA's Bylaws.\n\nA notice of meeting must be published in the Bulletin des annonces l\u00e9gales obligatoires ('BALO'), at least 35/uni00A0days before any Shareholders' Meeting (or 15/uni00A0days in certain specific cases), and must indicate, in particular, the agenda and the proposed resolutions.\n\nAt least 15/uni00A0days (or six days in certain cases) prior to the date set for the meeting on first call, and at least 10/uni00A0days (or four days in certain cases) before any second call, the Company shall send a final notice containing all the information requested by law by mail to all registered shareholders who have held shares for more than one month prior to the date of this final notice and publish a final notice in a bulletin of legal notices, as well as the BALO.\n\nAll shareholders are entitled to attend these meetings, either in person or by proxy, provided that they show valid proof of ID and share ownership as specified under French law. This ownership is justified by a book entry showing the number of shares in the name of the shareholder (or the intermediary for the account), on the second business day preceding the meeting at 0:00 am, Paris time (France), either in the registered share accounts kept by the Company or in the bearer share accounts kept by a qualified intermediary.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of article/uni00A0L.22.10-10 5\u00b0 of the French Commercial Code, the conditions for the participation to Shareholders' Meetings are detailed in article/uni00A023 of AXA SA's Bylaws, which is expressly incorporated by reference herein.\n\nIn addition, the information referred to in article/uni00A0L.22-10-11 of the French Commercial Code is made public in the corporate governance report approved by AXA SA's Board of Directors' and attached to the Board of Directors' report of AXA/uni00A0SA included in this Annual Report. For further information, please refer to Appendix/uni00A0VII 'Corporate governance report - Cross Reference Table' to this Annual Report.\n\n## ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS\n\nThere are no French anti-takeover statutes similar to the antitakeover statutes enacted by certain states in the United States and other jurisdictions. However, a number of French law provisions, in particular those resulting from Law No./uni00A02014-384 dated March/uni00A029, 2014 ( visant \u00e0 reconqu\u00e9rir l'\u00e9conomie r\u00e9elle ), from Law No./uni00A02019-486 dated May/uni00A022, 2019 ( relative \u00e0 la croissance et la transformation des entreprises ), known as 'PACTE', or from certain provisions of Directive 2004/25/EC dated April/uni00A021, 2004 on takeover bids (which was implemented in France in 2006), may have certain anti-takeover e/ff ects. In the case of AXA, the",

This notification shall detail the total number of shares and voting rights held as\n\nwell as the total number of securities giving a di/ff ered claim to the share capital and the potential voting rights attached thereto.\n\nThe notification shall be repeated in the conditions stated above each time an additional fraction of 0.5% of the share capital or voting rights is crossed upward or downward.\n\nIn  the  event  of  failure  to  comply  with  the  notification requirements described above, shares exceeding the fraction that should have been notified will be deprived of voting rights at the Shareholders' Meetings if, at such meetings, the notification failure has been recorded and if one or more shareholders jointly holding at least 5% of the share capital so request. Loss of voting rights shall be applicable in all Shareholders' Meetings that would be held up until two years following proper notification.\n\n## CHANGES IN CAPITAL\n\nThe Company's share capital may be modified only under the conditions stipulated by the legal and regulatory provisions in force.

AXA's Statutory Auditors provide a reasonable assurance report on AXA Group's ICOFR each year.\n\nThe IFC program is based on the Group Internal Control Standard and the Group Internal Control Policy, which include additional specific requirements for the IFC framework.\n\n## (a) IFC framework\n\nThe IFC framework is based on the 'Internal Control - Integrated Framework' issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). It is designed to define the IFC scope, governance, and principles in order to ensure consistency and quality in AXA Group's financial reporting.\n\n## (A.1) IFC SCOPE\n\nThe IFC program includes primarily the entities which are individually significant to consolidated financial position or results of operations, as well as the entities which provide significant services to AXA and/or its consolidated subsidiaries (the 'Group').\n\n## (A.2) IFC GOVERNANCE\n\nManagement, including the Group Chief Executive O/ff icer (CEO), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate ICOFR.\n\nThe IFC program is steered by the Group IFC Committee chaired by the Group CFO and involves the Planning Budgets Results Central (PBRC) Department, other relevant AXA departments, and representatives from each in-scope entity. The IFC program and the conclusion of management as to the e/ff ectiveness of AXA Group's ICOFR are also reviewed by AXA's Audit Committee.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## (A.3) IFC PRINCIPLES\n\nAXA Group's ICOFR includes policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance that:\n\n- /uni25A0 the maintenance of records accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of Group assets;\n- /uni25A0 the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with the applicable generally accepted accounting principles;\n- /uni25A0 the receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of management and directors of the Group; and\n- /uni25A0 unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Group assets that could have a material e/ff ect on the Group's financial statements would be prevented or detected in a timely manner.\n\nIn order to assess the e/ff ectiveness of ICOFR, financial reporting risks are initially identified at Group level with a focus on identifying those risks that may result in a material misstatement of Consolidated Financial Statements not being prevented or detected in a timely manner. This top-down and risk-based approach enables to identify in-scope entities and processes.\n\nIn line with the COSO framework, AXA Group's ICOFR is organized around the following key process categories: Entity-Level Controls (ELC), IT ELC, Financial Statement Closing Process, Business Processes, and IT General Controls.\n\nFor every key process category, the in-scope entities (i) /uni00A0document the significant processes and/or controls, as well as the rationale of how the associated risk of material misstatement due to error or fraud can be reduced to an acceptable level, (ii) /uni00A0test the design and operational e/ff ectiveness of key controls based on the test plans elaborated with insight into risks, and (iii) /uni00A0 remediate identified control deficiencies.\n\nOutstanding control deficiencies are consolidated at Group level to evaluate their impact on Consolidated Financial Statements, compensating controls and other qualitative factors. This evaluation process is designed to identify any control deficiencies that may rise to the level of a material weakness. A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company's financial statements will not be prevented or detected on time.",

        "page_content": "## (A.4) IFC CERTIFICATION\n\nAt each year-end, the in-scope entities are required to perform an evaluation of their ICOFR as part of an internal certification process. This process involves formal sign-o/ff  by the entity's process owners and culminates with a formal management report from the entity's CFO or another senior executive o/ff icer stating their conclusion as to the e/ff ectiveness of the entity's ICOFR.\n\nThis internal certification process across all in-scope entities is designed to assist AXA's management in its evaluation of AXA Group's ICOFR and to support its conclusion as to the e/ff ectiveness of AXA Group's ICOFR.\n\n## (b) Management's annual evaluation on ICOFR based on the IFC framework\n\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the e/ff ectiveness of AXA Group's ICOFR in accordance with the IFC framework as described above. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that AXA Group's ICOFR was e/ff ective as of December/uni00A031, 2022.\n\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be e/ff ective may not prevent or detect misstatements and can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of e/ff ectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or if the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures deteriorates.\n\n## (c) Report of the Statutory Auditors on ICOFR\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit and Ernst & Young Audit have performed audit procedures in order to be able to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether management's conclusion as to the e/ff ectiveness of AXA Group's ICOFR based on the IFC framework is fairly stated.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA",

The assessment of the e/ff ectiveness of internal control over financial reporting is based on criteria set out in the IFC Framework.\n\nOur role, in response to AXA's request, is to express a reasonable assurance opinion as to whether the statement of AXA's Management on the e/ff ectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, was prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the criteria set out in the IFC Framework.\n\nWe conducted our work in accordance with professional standards and ISAE 3000 (revised). These standards require that we design and perform procedures which enable us to obtain reasonable assurance that the statement of AXA's Management on the e/ff ectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, is fairly presented in all material respects. Our work consisted in obtaining an understanding of the internal control procedures over financial reporting, assessing the risk regarding the existence of any material weakness, testing and assessing the design and operational e/ff ectiveness of internal control on a risk by risk basis, and where relevant performing any other procedures that we considered necessary. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is su/ff icient and appropriate to express a reasonable assurance opinion.\n\nDue to the limitations inherent to internal control over financial reporting, the procedures related thereto may not always prevent or detect misstatements. Furthermore, the assessment of their e/ff ectiveness in respect of any future periods, is subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate as a result of changes in conditions or in the event that the degree of compliance with the principles or procedures were to deteriorate.\n\nIn our opinion, Management's statement on the e/ff ectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as at December 31, 2022 was prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the criteria set out in the IFC framework.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Paris-La D\u00e9fense, March/uni00A020, 2023\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nB\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Vignon\n\nGr\u00e9gory Saugner\n\nERNST & YOUNG Audit\n\nOlivier Durand\n\nPatrick Menard\n\nI\n\nErnst & Young Audit\n\nTour First, TSA 14444 92037 Paris-La D\u00e9fense\n\nI",

This transformation follows AXA SA's approval as a reinsurance company by the Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (ACPR). This merger is retroactive from January/uni00A01, 2022.\n\nThis transformation involves a change in the accounting framework, which is now the ANC Regulation No./uni00A02015-11 of November/uni00A026, 2015, on the annual financial statements of insurance companies.\n\nImpacts on the balance sheet on January/uni00A01, 2022, following the adoption of this regulation are as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 shareholders' equity was increased by \u20ac116/uni00A0 million corresponding to (i) /uni00A0 the recognition of unrealized gains by \u20ac284/uni00A0million on debts which do not respect the definition of structural element (ii) /uni00A0 unrealized losses by \u20ac123/uni00A0million on forward financial instruments not eligible for a yield strategy or an investment or divestment strategy, and (iii) /uni00A0the reclassification to other non-technical provisions of \u20ac45/uni00A0million of tax driven provisions;\n- /uni25A0 accrued interest is now recognized in accrued income by \u20ac1/uni00A0million and in liabilities by \u20ac359 /uni00A0million, and is therefore no longer attached to the loans or debts concerned;\n- /uni25A0 debt on financial assets (\u20ac75/uni00A0million) is now recognized as a deduction from the asset concerned.\n\nThe income statement now presents a technical income statement relating to non-life reinsurance operations on the one hand and life on the other hand, and a non-technical income statement which mainly includes operations relating to holding company activity.\n\nGeneral expenses relating to the reinsurance business are broken down into acquisition, administration, claims settlement and investment management costs.\n\nExpenses related to the holding activity are individualized and allocated in full and unequivocally to non-technical expenses without the application of an allocation key.\n\nNet investment income relating to the portfolio of assets covering reinsurance and holding operations is broken down between non-life and life technical income statements, according to the weighting of the net technical reserves and the shareholders' equity.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## Net Income\n\nAXA SA's corporate income a/f\\_t er tax for the financial year ended December/uni00A031, 2022, was a profit of \u20ac2,809/uni00A0million, of which \u20ac2,528 /uni00A0million for the holding activity and \u20ac281 /uni00A0million/uni00A0 (1) for the reinsurance business a/f\\_t er the reallocation of \u20ac185 /uni00A0million net investment income according to the weighting of the net technical reserves and the shareholders'equity. This reallocated amount exceeds by \u20ac101 /uni00A0million the financial result specific to the reinsurance business. To provide a more economical view, the financial result is kept specific to each activity in the following analysis. Income at December/uni00A031, 2021, amounted to \u20ac2,819/uni00A0million. This included only the holding activity.\n\n## Net income from the holding activity\n\nNet investment income amounted to \u20ac2,941/uni00A0million, increasing by \u20ac363/uni00A0million, of which:\n\n- /uni25A0 \u20ac850/uni00A0million in dividends received from subsidiaries, amounting to \u20ac4,345/uni00A0million compared to \u20ac3,495/uni00A0million in 2021;\n- /uni25A0 partly o/ff set by additional allowances for impairment on investments in subsidiaries by \u20ac507/uni00A0million.\n\nNon-technical income and expenses show a deficit of \u20ac606/uni00A0million compared to \u20ac419/uni00A0million in 2021, of which:\n\n- /uni25A0 \u20ac123/uni00A0million of provision on unrealized losses on foreign exchange options as part of the protection of the Company cash flows;\n- /uni25A0 \u20ac40/uni00A0million increase due to continued investments in the IT transformation.\n\nCorporate income tax amounted to \u20ac336/uni00A0million, of which \u20ac448/uni00A0million of tax receivables on members of the tax consolidation group partially o/ff set by a provision of \u20ac54/uni00A0million for the possible repayment of tax savings on subsidiaries belonging to the tax consolidation group. The tax expense relating to the reinsurance business is now reported under the holding activity.",

Income at December/uni00A031, 2021, amounted to \u20ac2,819/uni00A0million. This included only the holding activity.\n\n## 1. SIGNIFICANT EVENTS\n\nOn July/uni00A01, 2022, AXA SA, 'the Company' and the holding company of the AXA Group, became the Group's internal reinsurer, following its merger on June/uni00A030, 2022 with AXA Global Re. This transformation follows AXA SA's approval as a reinsurance company by the Autorit\u00e9 de contr\u00f4le prudentiel et de r\u00e9solution (ACPR) on May/uni00A06, 2022.\n\nThe merger of AXA Global Re into AXA SA is carried out in accordance with the provisions of articles/uni00A0L.236-1 et seq . of the French Commercial Code, and in particular article/uni00A0L.236-11 relating to simplified mergers.\n\nThis merger is retroactive for accounting purposes to January/uni00A01, 2022.\n\nAll the assets and liabilities of the absorbed company are transferred to the absorbing company at their net book values.\n\nA merger bonus of 117/uni00A0million was recognized in the books of AXA SA as financial income.\n\nThis transformation implies a change in accounting standards and the ANC regulation n\u00b0 2015-11 of November/uni00A026, 2015 and the CRC/uni00A02009-02 regulation on Forward Financial Instruments relating to the annual accounts of insurance companies must now be applied.\n\nThe 2021 accounts as displayed in the '2021 restated' column are the accounts of the holding activity exclusively but presented in the format of the insurance chart of accounts. The accounting changes brought about by this standard are explained in the paragraphs below.\n\n## 2. CHANGE IN METHOD AND/uni00A0PRESENTATION\n\nImpacts on the balance sheet at January/uni00A01, 2022 are as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 shareholders' equity was increased by \u20ac116/uni00A0million in recognition of (i) /uni00A0unrealized gains of \u20ac284/uni00A0million on debts that do not meet the definition of structural items, (ii) /uni00A0 unrealized losses of \u20ac123/uni00A0million on forward financial instruments that may not be eligible for a yield strategy, an investment strategy or divestment strategy and (iii) /uni00A0the reclassification of exceptional amortization to other non-technical provisions in the amount of \u20ac45/uni00A0million;\n- /uni25A0 accrued interests are now recognized in accrued income in the amount of \u20ac1/uni00A0million and in liabilities in the amount of \u20ac359 /uni00A0million and is therefore no longer attached to the loan or borrowing items concerned;\n- /uni25A0 debts on financial assets, \u20ac75/uni00A0million, are now recognized as a deduction from the asset concerned.\n\nThe total balance sheet at December/uni00A031, 2022 amounted to \u20ac89,257/uni00A0million compared to \u20ac77,621/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2021, according to the presentation under the French Insurance Chart of Accounts.\n\nThe di/ff erence compared to the total balance sheet according to the French General Chart of Accounts for the 2021 fiscal year of \u20ac77,695/uni00A0million is explained by the restatement of debts on financial assets as mentioned above.\n\n## 3. ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, RULES AND METHODS\n\n## 3.1 General principles\n\nAXA SA's 2022 annual financial statements were prepared following the merger of AXA Global Re with AXA SA, in accordance with the accounting provisions set out in Title/uni00A0IV of Book/uni00A0III of the French Insurance Code and the regulation of the French Accounting Standards Authority ( Autorit\u00e9 des normes comptables - ANC) No./uni00A02015-11 of November/uni00A026, 2015 modified.\n\n## 3.2 Reinsurance activity within AXA SA\n\nThe Company is the AXA Group's reinsurance captive and reinsures exclusively the Group's insurance entities ('cedants'), both property and casualty and life.\n\nAccepted operations concern transactions whereby AXA SA, the reinsurer, agrees to assume a portion of the risks underwritten by AXA's entities.\n\nThe retrocessions correspond to the transfer of risks by AXA SA to other market players, whether internal or external to the AXA Group.\n\nAssumed reinsurance is recognized by the Company upon receipt of the accounts transmitted by the ceding company. In accordance with the provisions of article/uni00A0152-1 of ANC Regulation No./uni00A0201511 of November/uni00A026, 2015, accounts not received from the ceding company at the end of the financial fiscal are estimated. When the Company becomes aware of a foreseeable loss, it is provisioned.\n\nRetroceded reinsurance premiums are recognized in proportion to the period in which the reinsurance coverage is provided.\n\nReserves for unearned premiums recognise the portion, calculated on a pro-rata basis, of gross written premiums and commissions still to be written relating to the period between the inventory date and the treaty's next due date or, by default, its term.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA",

These amounts are recorded under 'R eceivables for cash deposited with ceding companies'.\n\nCash deposits received from 'retrocessionaires' are recognized on the liabilities side of the balance sheet under 'Payables for cash deposits received from 'retrocessionaires'\n\nThe reinsurance premium paid by the ce ding company to the reinsurer only constitutes a basic premium intended to cover the reinsurance capacity. As claims occur, the ceding company must pay an additional premium called 'reinstatement premium' which corresponds to the renewal of the portion of the capacity absorbed by the claim and up to the limit of the annual guarantee.\n\nIf a reinsurance asset is impaired, the Company reduces the carrying value accordingly and recognises this impairment loss in the income statement. A reinsurance asset is impaired if there is tangible evidence, following an event occurring a/f\\_t er the initial recognition of the reinsurance assets, that the Company may not receive all amounts due to it under the terms of the treaty, and the impact of this event on the amounts to be received from 'retrocessionaires' by the Company can be reliably estimated.\n\n## LOSS RESERVES\n\nClaims reserves are established on the basis of data provided by ceding companies and supplemented by actuarial estimates.\n\nAmounts recoverable from 'retrocessionaires' are estimated in accordance with the claim liabilities associated with the treaty.\n\nThe main items related to reinsurance business are presented as follows:\n\n| Balance Sheet  (in Euro million )                                | 12/31/2022   | 01/01/2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Cessionaires and retrocessionaires share in technical provisions | 5,576        | 5,377        |\n| Claims provisions (life)                                         | 157          | 134          |\n| Claims provisions (non life)                                     | 5,103        | 5,120        |\n| Provisions for unearned premiums (non life)                      | 142          | 132          |\n| Other technical provisions (life)                                | 187          | 2            |\n| Other technical provisions (non life)                            | (13 )        | (11 )        |\n| Receivable arising from cash deposits given to cedents           | 1,852        | 1,205        |\n| Receivables on reinsurance transactions                          | 1,885        | 992          |\n| TOTAL ASSETS                                                     | 9,313        | 7,574        |\n| Gross technical provisions                                       | 8,230        | 6,838        |\n| Claims provisions (life)                                         | 251          | 213          |\n| Claims provisions (non life)                                     | 7,524        | 6,446        |\n| Provisions for unearned premiums (non life)                      | 170          | 171          |\n| Other technical provisions (life)                                | 285          | 8            |\n| Liabilities on cash deposits from retrocessionaires              | 1,682        | 878          |\n| TOTAL LIABILITIES                                                | 9,912        | 7,716        |\n\n01/01/2022 figures are those published by AXA Global Re, the year before the merger with AXA SA.\n\nI\n\nI",

These transactions are converted into euros at the prices known on the inventory date.\n\nThe Company applies the rules relating to the accounting treatment of foreign currency transactions of companies governed by the French Insurance Code in accordance with ANC Regulation 2015-11.\n\n## Exchange rate balance sheet position applicable to receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies\n\nAt the end of each fiscal year, foreign currency items shown in the balance sheet must be translated into euros by breaking down transactions as follows:\n\n- /uni25A0 transactions involving assets or liabilities generating a so-called structural foreign exchange position, mainly investments in subsidiaries and the financing of these in foreign currencies;\n- /uni25A0 transactions generating an operational foreign exchange position concerning other transactions in foreign currencies.\n\nTranslation di/ff erences are valued as the di/ff erence between the exchange rate of the currency concerned on the day of the transaction (historical rate) and the closing rate. Translation di/ff  erences in structural foreign exchange positions are recognized in the balance sheet while translation di/ff erences in operational foreign exchange positions are recognized in foreign exchange income.\n\n## Foreign exchange o/ff -balance sheet positions applicable to forward financial instruments (FFIs)\n\nDi/ff erences between the o/ff -balance sheet foreign exchange positions of Forward Financial Instruments (FFIs) and the corresponding exchange value accounts represent unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses. They are recorded on the balance sheet in a 'translation adjustments' account as opposed to the 'Accruals related to financial instruments account', according to the underlying strategy.\n\nThe treatment of the 'translation adjustment' account aims to respect the symmetry of treatment with that of exchange di/ff erences on the underlying items:\n\n- /uni25A0 when the FFIs is linked to a structural element, the 'translation adjustments' account is maintained in the balance sheet until the date on which the structural element is realized;\n- /uni25A0 when the FFIs is part of an investment strategy, the 'translation adjustments' account is maintained on the balance sheet until the date of the investment;\n- /uni25A0 when the FFIs is linked to an operating item, as part of a divestment or yield strategy, or when the FFIs is linked to a non-structural financial debt, the 'translation adjustments' account is recorded in income.\n\nDi/ff  erences in interest on forward foreign exchange transactions, or carry-forwards, are recognized on a staggered basis over the e/ff  ective term of the hedged transaction.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA",

This mainly includes the AXA brand, valued at \u20ac308/uni00A0million.\n\n## 4.2 Investments\n\nInvestments include land and buildings, investments in a/ff iliated companies and in companies in which there is a shareholding link, and other investments as well as receivables for cash deposited with ceding companies that are related to the reinsurance business.\n\n## LAND AND BUILDINGS\n\nThese include shares in Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Civiles Immobili\u00e8res (SCI), amounted to \u20ac105 million.\n\n## INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATED COMPANIES AND IN/uni00A0COMPANIES WITH WHICH THERE IS A/uni00A0SHAREHOLDING/uni00A0LINK\n\n- /uni25A0 A company is considered affiliated with another when it is likely to be fully consolidated in the same consolidated entity.\n- /uni25A0 Companies with which the Company has a shareholding link are companies other than a/ff iliated companies in which the Company directly or indirectly holds a stake. Are presumed to be investments in subsidiaries representing at least 10% of the capital.\n\nFinancial assets are measured at acquisition cost or transfer cost. At the balance sheet date, the acquisition cost is compared to the fair value, and the lower of these two values is then recognized in the balance sheet.\n\nThe fair value of these investments corresponds to their value in use and is determined by management either on the basis of stock market prices, shareholders' equity (including unrealized gains) or the subsidiary's outlook.  Estimating value in use of these securities requires the management judgement in choosing valuation approaches, depending on the investments involved, and in determining the data and assumptions used to estimate expected earnings when these are considered into the valuation. F or the 'Life, Savings and Retirement' activities, the value of future profits is estimated on the basis of the calculations of the European Embedded Value published by the Group. For 'Property and Casualty' activities, the value in use approach relies on the earnings of the strategic plan approved by management discounted using a risk adjusted rate. Cash flows  are extrapolated using sustainable perpetual growth rates assumed to be achievable over the long term to derive a terminal value.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nPursuant to article/uni00A0242-2 of Regulation ANC/uni00A0No./uni00A02015-11, transactions involving structural investments in subsidiaries in foreign currencies are considered as transactions in euros and are frozen in euros at the historical exchange rate, and no translation di/ff erences are recognized subsequently.\n\n## OTHER INVESTMENTS\n\n## Bonds and other fixed-income securities\n\nBonds and other fixed-income securities are recorded at the acquisition value, excluding accrued interest. The di/ff erence between the purchase price and the redemption value, premium or discount, is amortized in income over the remaining period until the redemption date, according to the e/ff ective interest rate method, pursuant to the provisions of article/uni00A0122-1 of ANC Regulation/uni00A0No./uni00A02015-11 of November/uni00A026, 2015.\n\nUnrealized losses arising from the di/ff erence between the carrying value (taking into account the premium/discount) and the realizable value of the corresponding securities are not subject to a reserve. Nevertheless, when there is a reason to consider that the debtor will not be able to meet its commitments, either for the payment of interest or for the repayment of the principal, an impairment must be recognized in the inventory.\n\n## Shares and other variable-income securities\n\nShares and other variable-income securities are recorded at their acquisition cost, excluding fees. The realized value at the end of the fiscal year is determined in accordance with ANC Regulation No./uni00A02015-11 of November/uni00A026, 2015 and corresponds, for listed securities, to the stock market price on the day of the inventory and, for unlisted securities, at the market value determined on the basis of the net position.\n\nWhen the realizable value is more than 20% lower than the acquisition cost for more than six consecutive months, it is proceeded by an analysis of the permanent nature of the impairment. A reserve for impairment is recognized line by line for securities subject to long-term impairment. The reserve is measured as the di/ff erence between the net book value and the realizable value corresponding to the market value at the closing date.\n\n## RECEIVABLES FOR CASH DEPOSITED WITH CEDING COMPANIES\n\nThis item  amounting to \u20ac1,852/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2022 and covers the deposits that the Company must make with the ceding companies when the treaties so provide, so that they can benefit from a guarantee on their ceded technical reserves.",

Gross policy benefits reserves are provided by the entities. In the same way as for the other reserves, the conditions of reinsurance treaties are applied to obtain the retroceded and net policy benefits reserves.\n\nClaims reserves also include the reserve for claims handling costs of \u20ac12/uni00A0million, which is intended to cover the future handling costs incurred by the Company to manage and settle outstanding claims.\n\n- /uni25A0 Unearned premium reserves of \u20ac170/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2022 recognized for all current contracts, the portion - calculated on the gross written premiums and estimated on the remaining premiums to be written - which relates to the period between the inventory date and the next premium due date or, by default, the term of the contract.\n- /uni25A0 Other technical reserves amounted to \u20ac285/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2022 and mainly include a reserve for increasing risks in the life business.\n\n## 4.10 Other non-technical provisions\n\nThese amounted to \u20ac1,054/uni00A0million compared to \u20ac936/uni00A0million in 2021 and mainly include \u20ac266/uni00A0million in reserves for the Company's subsidiaries for the risk of tax savings under the French tax consolidation scheme, \u20ac179/uni00A0million in reserves for unrealized losses on options and \u20ac161/uni00A0million for unrealized losses on interest rate derivatives not eligible for hedge accounting.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThe Company is the head of a tax consolidation group; in this respect, the tax consolidation agreement provides that tax savings are recognized directly in the Company's financial statements. However, a provision for the risk of reimbursement of tax savings is recognized when there is a high probability that these subsidiaries will become profitable again, expected future taxable incomes resulting from the Group's strategic plan process.\n\n## 4.11 Liabilities relating to cash deposits from retroceding companies\n\nCash deposits amounted to \u20ac1,683/uni00A0million, including \u20ac1,319/uni00A0million in deposits received through retroceding companies up 805/uni00A0million.\n\n## 4.12 Other liabilities\n\nOther liabilities amounted to \u20ac18,795/uni00A0million compared to \u20ac16,493/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2021 and mainly include:\n\n- /uni25A0 financial liabilities to Group subsidiaries for \u20ac12,045/uni00A0million;\n- /uni25A0 bonds related to Group entities for \u20ac3,440/uni00A0million as well as \u20ac500/uni00A0million of commercial papers ;\n- /uni25A0 senior debts for \u20ac1,350/uni00A0million;\n- /uni25A0 debts arising from reinsurance operations for \u20ac937/uni00A0million.\n\n## 4.13 Accruals liabilities\n\nAccruals liabilities amounted to \u20ac1,477/uni00A0million compared to \u20ac849/uni00A0million at December/uni00A031, 2021 and mainly include translation adjustments on liabilities for \u20ac304 /uni00A0million, \u20ac407/uni00A0million in accrued interests not yet due and \u20ac301/uni00A0million relating to options premium received.\n\n## PENSION COMMITMENTS\n\nAs part of the update to social commitments, an assessment was made of the additional reserves to be established to cover commitments under defined-benefit pension plans, in accordance with ANC Recommendation No./uni00A02013-02. Method 1 defined by this recommendation has been applied: the cost of past services is spread out in the income statement over the vesting period of the rights, and the expected return on the assets is retained as part of the expense for the period. This assessment led to no reserve being recorded at December/uni00A031, 2022. The option retained by the Company is to not record any provisions in the balance sheet.",

Similarly, in the absence of dividends being paid, unpaid coupons accumulated over the years will be recognized as payable upon liquidation, if any.\n\n## 5.8 Contingent liabilities\n\n## Table/uni00A017: Variation of other non-technical provisions\n\nTable/uni00A018: Breakdown of liabilities by residual value\n\n| (in Euro million)             |   12/31/2021 | Allocation  for/uni00A0the year   | Reversal  for the year  (reserve  used)   | Reversal  for the year  (reserve not  used)   | 12/31/2022   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Regulated reserves            |           45 | -                                 | -                                         | -                                             | 45           |\n| Reserves for exchange losses  |           57 | 128                               | 5                                         | -                                             | 180          |\n| Provisions for taxes          |           12 | 1                                 | 12                                        | -                                             | 1            |\n| Provisions for deferred taxes |          243 | 203                               | 4                                         | -                                             | 442          |\n| Other non technical reserves  |          579 | 54                                | 247                                       | -                                             | 386          |\n| TOTAL                         |          936 | 386                               | 268                                       | -                                             | 1,054        |\n\n## 5.9 Other liabilities\n\n|                                                              | 2022                 | 2022                                   | 2022                      | 2021   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------|--------|\n| (in Euro million)                                            | Up to  1/uni00A0year | From  1/uni00A0year to  5/uni00A0years | More than  5/uni00A0years | Total  | Total  |\n| LIABILITIES                                                  | -                    | -                                      | -                         | -      | -      |\n| Liabilities for cash deposits received from ceding companies | 1,683                | -                                      | -                         | 1,683  | -      |\n| Liabilities arising from direct insurance operations         | -                    | -                                      | -                         | -      | -      |\n| Liabilities arising from reinsurance operations              | 937                  | -                                      | -                         | 937    | -      |\n| Bonds                                                        | 920                  | 1,585                                  | 935                       | 3,440  | 3,686  |\n| Liabilities towards credit institutions                      | -                    | -                                      | -                         | -      | -      |\n| Other liabilities                                            | 2,317                | 2,619                                  | 9,480                     | 14,417 | 12,807 |\n| TOTAL                                                        | 5,857                | 4,204                                  | 10,416                    | 20,477 | 16,493 |\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA",

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/ff icient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOur responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Statutory Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe conducted our audit engagement in compliance with independence requirements of rules required by the French Commercial Code (code de commerce) and the French Code of ethics ( code de d\u00e9ontologie de la profession de commissaire aux comptes ) for statutory auditors for the period from January 1, 2022 to the date of our report, and specifically we did not provide any prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) N\u00b0 537/2014.\n\n## EMPHASIS OF MATTER\n\nWe draw attention to the following matter described in Notes 2 and 3 to the financial statements which specify the impact on these accounts of the application of ANC Regulation n\u00b0 2015-11 of November 26, 2015 modified relating to the annual financial statements of insurance companies, following the approval in 2022 as a reinsurance company.\n\nI\n\nI\n\nERNST & YOUNG Audit Tour First, TSA 14444 92037 Paris-La D\u00e9fense",

At the end of the fiscal year, an impairment allowance is recognized if the value at closing date is less than the acquisition cost.\n\nAs described in note 4.2 to the financial statements, the value at closing date corresponds to the value in use and is determined by management on the basis of the share price, the equity value (including unrealized gains), or the future prospects of the subsidiary. Estimating the value in use of these types of investments requires a significant degree of judgment from management in terms of selecting the measurement methods, depending on the investment in question, and in determining which data and assumptions should be used to estimate the expected profits when these are taken into account in the valuation.\n\n## In  particular:\n\n- /uni25A0 for the 'Life, Savings and Retirement' activities, the value of future profits is estimated on the basis of the calculations of the European Embedded Value published by the Group.\n- /uni25A0 for 'Property and Casualty' activities, the value in use approach results from cash-flow projections based on the strategic plan approved by management, discounted using a risks adjusted rate. Beyond the strategic plan horizon, future cash-flows are extrapolated using long term growth rates deemed achievable, to derive a terminal value\n\nGiven the inherent uncertainty involved in the use of forecasts (in terms of whether or not they will be achieved) and in the judgment required to assess value in use, we deemed the correct measurement of investments in a/ff iliated undertakings and in undertakings with which a participating interest exists, particularly those based on forward-looking data, to be a key audit matter.\n\nTo assess the reasonableness of the estimated value in use of investments in a/ff iliated undertakings and in undertakings with which a participating interest exists, based on the information provided to us, our audit work consisted primarily of verifying that the estimated values determined by management were based on an appropriate measurement method and assumptions, depending on the investment concerned.\n\nFor valuations based on forecast data:\n\n- /uni25A0 Assess the appropriateness of the methodology and assumptions used with regard to the Solvency II texts and the European Embedded Value principles published by the CFO Forum when the values in use of life and non-life insurance companies are based on these frameworks;\n\n/uni25A0\n\nFor the other entities notably non-life business, obtain the\n\nprojections for cash flow and operating cash flow for the businesses\n\nproduced by their respective operational management teams, and:\n\n- -Check the consistency of the historical data used with the financial statements of the audited entities;\n- -Check that the assumptions made are consistent with the economic environment at the closing date and at the date the financial statements were prepared;\n- -Compare projections made in previous periods with actual results in order to assess the reliability of the estimates;\n- -Verify the accuracy of the value in use calculated;\n- -Confirm that the value in use, which is based on projected cash flows, has been adjusted to account for debts;\n\nWe also verified the recording of other non technical reserves where the company is exposed to the losses of a subsidiary with negative equity.\n\nFinally, we assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in the financial statements.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA",

Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs specified in Article L.823-10-1 of the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ), our statutory audit does not include assurance on the viability of the Company or the quality of management of the a/ff airs of the Company.\n\nAs part of an audit conducted in accordance with professional standards applicable in France, the statutory auditor exercises professional judgment throughout the audit and furthermore:\n\n- /uni25A0 Identifies and assesses the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designs and performs audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtains audit evidence considered to be su/ff icient and appropriate to provide a basis for his opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- /uni25A0 Obtains an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the e/ff ectiveness of the internal control.\n- /uni25A0 Evaluates the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management in the financial statements.\n- /uni25A0 Assesses the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. This assessment is based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of his audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. If the statutory auditor concludes that a material uncertainty exists, there is a requirement to draw attention in the audit report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are not provided or inadequate, to modify the opinion expressed therein.\n- /uni25A0 Evaluates the overall presentation of the financial statements and assesses whether these statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n\n## Report to the Audit Committee\n\nWe submit a report to the Audit Committee which includes in particular a description of the scope of the audit and the audit program implemented, as well as the results of our audit. We also report, if any, significant deficiencies in internal control regarding the accounting and financial reporting procedures that we have identified.\n\nOur report to the Audit Committee includes the risks of material misstatement that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and which are therefore the key audit matters that we are required to describe in this report.\n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with the declaration provided for in Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, confirming our independence within the meaning of the rules applicable in France such as they are set in particular by Articles L.822-10 to L.822-14 of the French Commercial Code ( code de commerce ) and in the French Code of Ethics for statutory auditors ( code de d\u00e9ontologie de la profession de commissaire aux comptes ). Where appropriate, we discuss with the Audit Committee the risks that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and the related safeguards.\n\nNeuilly-sur-Seine and Courbevoie, March 20, 2023\n\nThe Statutory Auditors\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Audit\n\nB\u00e9n\u00e9dicte Vignon\n\nGr\u00e9gory Saugner\n\nI\n\nERNST & YOUNG Audit\n\nOlivier Durand\n\nPatrick Menard\n\nI",

Shares held by AXA and its subsidiaries ( i.e. treasury shares) are deducted for the calculation of outstanding shares.\n\nDiluted earnings per share (' diluted EPS ') represent AXA's consolidated earnings (net of financial charges related to undated and deeply subordinated debts recorded through shareholders' equity) divided by the weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares over the period, on a diluted basis ( i.e. including the potential impact of all outstanding dilutive stock options being exercised, performance shares, and conversion of existing convertible debt into shares, provided that their impact is not anti-dilutive). Shares held by AXA and its subsidiaries ( i.e. treasury shares) are deducted for the calculation of outstanding shares.\n\nUnderlying Earnings per share* correspond to underlying Earnings (net of financial charges related to undated subordinated debts recorded through shareholders' equity) divided by the weighted average number of outstanding ordinary shares over the period.

It is defined as the excess of market value of assets over best estimate liabilities and Risk Margin as per Solvency/uni00A0II regulation.\n\n## Solvency/uni00A0II ratio\n\nThis ratio is calculated as per Solvency/uni00A0II and is equal to the total amount of the Group's Eligible Own Funds (' EOF ') divided by the Group's Solvency Capital Requirement (' SCR '). The Solvency Capital Requirement, i.e. the denominator of the Solvency/uni00A0II ratio, is set at a level ensuring that insurers and reinsurers are able to meet their obligations towards policyholders and beneficiaries over the next 12/uni00A0months, with a 99.5% probability. The Solvency Capital Requirement can be calculated either based on the standard formula or an internal model. The Group is using an internal model.\n\nThe Solvency/uni00A0II ratio is estimated primarily using AXA's internal model calibrated based on an adverse 1/200/uni00A0years shock. For further information on AXA's internal model and Solvency/uni00A0II disclosures, please refer to AXA Group's Solvency and Financial Condition Report (SFCR) as of December/uni00A031, 2022, available on AXA's website (www.axa.com).\n\n## Debt Gearing/uni00A0*\n\nDebt Gearing refers to the level of a company's debt related to its long term capital, usually expressed as a percentage. Debt Gearing is used by Management to measure the financial leverage of the Group and the extent to which its operations are funded by creditors as opposed to shareholders. AXA's Debt Gearing is calculated by dividing gross debt (financing debt and undated and deeply subordinated debts) by total capital employed (shareholders' equity excluding undated and deeply subordinated debts and reserves relating to the change in the fair value of financial instruments and of hedge accounting derivatives) plus gross debt.\n\n## ACTIVITIES\n\n## Insurance\n\n## LIFE/uni00A0& SAVINGS HYBRID AND GENERAL ACCOUNT CAPITALLIGHT PRODUCTS\n\nHybrid products: Savings products allowing clients to invest in both Unit-Linked and General Account funds.\n\nGeneral Account capital-light products: General Account Savings products which, at inception, create more EOF than the economic capital they consume.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n## LIFE/uni00A0& SAVINGS NET INFLOWS\n\nLife/uni00A0& Savings Net Inflows are defined as the collected premiums (including risk premiums, fees and revenues), net of surrenders, maturities, claims paid, and other benefits paid. This definition is applicable to all Life/uni00A0& Savings products as well as Life-like Health products, except for Mutual funds products.\n\n## NEW BUSINESS APE (NEW BUSINESS ANNUAL PREMIUM EQUIVALENT)\n\nNew business APE represents 100% of new regular premiums plus 10% of single premiums, in line with EEV methodology. APE is Group share.\n\n## PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED PREMIUM (PVEP)\n\nPVEP represents the new business volume, equal to the present value at time of issue of the total premiums expected to be received over the policy term. The present value is discounted at the reference interest rate and PVEP is Group share.\n\n## NBV/PVEP\n\nNBV/PVEP is the ratio of (i)/uni00A0 New Business Value representing the value of newly issued contracts during the current year to (ii)/uni00A0 PVEP. While the measure is not as closely linked to the cash received in the current period as APE, the ratio of NBV/PVEP is a more economic indicator of profit margin than the NBV margin.\n\n## NBV (NEW BUSINESS VALUE)\n\nThe value of newly issued contracts during the current year. It consists of the present value of future profits a/f\\_t er the costs of acquiring business, less (i)/uni00A0 an allowance for the time value of financial option and guarantees, and (ii)/uni00A0 cost of capital and nonfinancial risks. AXA calculates this value net of tax.\n\n## NBV MARGIN (NEW BUSINESS VALUE MARGIN)\n\nNew Business Value Margin is the ratio of:\n\n- /uni25A0 New Business Value representing the value of newly issued contracts during the current year; to\n- /uni25A0 Annual Premium Equivalent.\n\nThis ratio represents the profitability of the new business.\n\n## MARGIN ANALYSIS\n\nThe Margin Analysis is presented on an underlying earnings basis.\n\nEven though the presentation of the Margin Analysis is not the same as the Statement of Income (underlying basis), it is based on the same GAAP measures as used to prepare the Statement of Income in accordance with IFRS.\n\nUnderlying investment margin includes the following items:\n\n- /uni25A0 net investment income; and\n- /uni25A0 interests and bonuses credited to policyholders and unallocated policyholder bonuses (and the change in specific reserves purely linked to invested assets returns) related to the net investment income as well as the unwind of the discount rate used in calculating technical reserves.",
