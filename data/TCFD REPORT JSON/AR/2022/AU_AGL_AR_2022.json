The required elements of the Directors' Report, including the Operating and Financial Review (OFR) as required by ASIC Regulatory Guide 247, are covered on pages 8 to 84. Commentary on AGL's financial performance specifically is contained on pages 8 to 50 and references information reported in the Financial Report (pages 84 to 183). The Financial Report includes AGL Energy Limited (the Company or Parent Entity) and the entities it controlled at the end of, or during, the year ended 30 June 2022. Throughout the report, the consolidated entity is referred to as AGL or the Group.\n\nThe Directors' Declaration forms part of the Financial Report under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (Corporations Act).\n\n## Voluntary reporting frameworks\n\nThis report has been prepared with reference to the International Integrated Reporting Council's (IIRC) International Integrated Reporting Framework. This framework provides a useful basis for disclosing how sustainable value is created for our shareholders and other stakeholders over time. We have used the framework to demonstrate how consideration of risks and opportunities (both those arising from our business and those that exist in a broader operational context), our purpose and our values drive our strategy. We have also considered how the execution of our strategy creates value, applying a lens that is broader than financial performance alone.\n\nAGL follows the guidance provided by the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures voluntary disclosure framework (TCFD Framework). This year, we have not produced a separate TCFD report. A TCFD Index is included in the ESG Data Centre on our website which describes where elements of the TCFD framework are addressed in this report and other disclosures, noting that we expect to release updated scenario analysis of different decarbonisation pathways for the National Electricity Market (NEM) later in 2022 following the review of strategic direction which AGL is currently completing.\n\nThe disclosures in this report and the accompanying ESG Data Centre are aligned to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards for 'Electrical Utilities and Power Generators' and 'Gas Utilities'. A SASB index is included in the ESG Data Centre which identifies the extent to which each SASB disclosure requirement has been applied. In addition, we have referenced the GRI Standards in the preparation of this report. The ESG Data Centre includes a GRI index that outlines which topic-specific GRI standards have been referenced in our disclosures.\n\n## Assurance\n\nThe Remuneration Report (page 59 to 82) and the Financial Report (page 84 to 183) have been audited by Deloitte. Deloitte was also engaged to undertake limited assurance of selected key performance indicators included in the Business Value Driver scorecards (page 19 to 29) in accordance with the Australian Standard on Assurance Engagements ASAE 3000 Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information issued by the Australian Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (ASAE 3000). The key performance indicators are to be read in conjunction with the definitions in the Glossary (page 178). Full details of the assurance scope, process and outcome are included in the assurance statement on page 172.",

        "page_content": "## Business Value Drivers\n\nThe International Integrated Reporting Framework describes six forms of capital (financial, manufactured, intellectual, human, social and relationship and natural) but encourages organisations to adopt a categorisation and terminology appropriate to their business. In this report, AGL has grouped and defined these capitals into the seven distinct Business Value Drivers outlined below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## CUSTOMERS\n\n## Social and relationship capital\n\nEffective and trusted relationships with residential, business and wholesale customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## INFRASTRUCTURE\n\nManufactured capital\n\nEffective and efficient use of assets throughout the value chain that AGL uses, owns or has control of, to enable delivery of energy to the market and to customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## COMMUNITIES & RELATIONSHIPS\n\nSocial and relationship capital\n\nThe strength of working relationships and trust with key stakeholders; brand and reputation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SYSTEMS & PROCESSES\n\nIntellectual capital\n\nAvailability and development of processes, knowledge, insights, systems and data, including energy portfolio management and customer analytics, to support and enhance business activities.\n\n## Forward looking statements\n\nThis report includes information about AGL's performance for the period 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022. Any forward-looking statements are based on AGL's current expectations, best estimates and assumptions as at the date of preparation, many of which are beyond AGL's control. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees or predictions of future performance, and involve known and unknown risks, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the report.\n\n## Sustainable Development Goals\n\nThe United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 interconnected goals that form a global benchmark for achieving a sustainable future for all. While many of the SDGs intersect with our operations, the three SDGs that were most material to the strategy and operations of AGL over FY22 comprised SDG 13 - Climate Action; SDG 7 - Affordable and Clean Energy; and SDG 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure.\n\n## PEOPLE\n\nHuman capital\n\nThe competencies, experience, behaviours, engagement and wellbeing of AGL's people.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial capital\n\nAccess to and management of financial capital to support execution of strategy and investment in growth opportunities through retaining financial market support.\n\n## SDG\n\n## Business Value Driver\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPage 24\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPage 26\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPage 24\n\nPage 20\n\nPage 21\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPage 26\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPage 28\n\nPage 30\n\n|\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAccess to and stewardship and use of scarce natural resources, and AGL's impact on the natural environment, both directly and as a result of the products and services provided.\n\nInformation about performance in relation to each Business Value Driver is included in Section 3.2 of this report.",

This has included both the geopolitical instability and international supply constraints driving higher global coal and gas prices, as well as the interventions required to manage system security issues.\n\nI am proud that throughout significant change and challenges, the AGL team has stayed focused on keeping our power stations running safely as they progress towards accelerated closure dates, developing our pipeline of renewable and storage projects, and keeping customers, communities and our people at the centre of what we do. I would like to thank our people for everything they have done over the past year to look after our business and customers.\n\n## Withdrawal of Demerger Proposal\n\nOn 30 May 2022, AGL announced that it had withdrawn the Demerger Proposal to separate AGL into two industry-leading companies: AGL Australia and Accel Energy. Although the Board believed that the Demerger Proposal would have been supported by a majority of shareholders, we made this difficult decision as the anticipated voter turnout and stated opposition from a small number of investors made it clear that the Demerger Proposal would not receive the necessary 75% support.\n\nAt the same time as announcing the decision to withdraw the Demerger Proposal, we committed to undertaking a review of AGL's strategic direction, renewing the composition of the Board, including the CEO, and determining the best way to deliver long-term shareholder value in the context of Australia's energy transition.\n\n## Review of Strategic Direction\n\nThe review of strategic direction is being overseen by a Board subcommittee co-chaired by Vanessa Sullivan and Graham Cockroft with fellow Non-Executive Director, Mark Bloom also forming part of the sub-committee.\n\nThe review will consider how the company moves forward in a way that will create long-term shareholder value in an environment where pressure on decarbonisation, renewable development and energy affordability is accelerating.\n\nIn particular, the process will include a reassessment of decarbonisation pathways, analysis of the scale and mix of technologies required to meet these accelerated pathways and AGL's role in providing the energy and capacity required today and into the future. It will also consider how the strategies developed in preparation for the proposed demerger can be leveraged in an integrated model as well as AGL's capital structure and providers.\n\nAGL will report initial outcomes in late September 2022 in conjunction with FY23 guidance.",

        "page_content": "## Committed to decarbonisation\n\nAustralia is at a pivotal moment in the transition of our energy system and the Board remains committed to ensuring we play a leading role. This means responsibly transitioning our coal generators, while ensuring energy system stability, energy affordability for customers, support for our people and communities through the transition, and appropriate shareholder outcomes.\n\nIn the past two decades AGL has invested more than $4.8 billion in renewable and firming generation, the most of any ASXlisted company, and has delivered more than 2,350 MW of new generation capacity to the grid since 2003.\n\nNext year, we will complete the closure of the Liddell Power Station which alone will deliver an emissions reduction equivalent to almost 5% of FY21 emissions from Australia's electricity sector - a significant step forward in Australia's decarbonisation journey. As we close that power station, we will be progressing our plans for the site to be converted into an integrated, low-carbon industrial Energy Hub, which will deliver both energy and jobs for the future.\n\nWe are also working towards our previously announced closure dates for the Bayswater and the Loy Yang A power stations. We believe the closure of coal-fired power stations will continue to be accelerated and that public policy settings, market conditions and the growing expectations of stakeholders will all play a role in determining what this pathway to closure looks like.\n\nAGL's decarbonisation pathway will continue to be reviewed as part of the review of strategic direction that is currently underway. AGL will release a Climate Transition Action Plan following this review, and shareholders will have the opportunity to vote on the Climate Transition Action Plan as part of the 'Say on Climate\" resolution at the 2022 Annual General Meeting (AGM).\n\n## Board and CEO renewal\n\nAs part of the Board and CEO renewal process some of our Directors - myself included - and our Managing Director and CEO, Graeme Hunt, will step down when replacements have been appointed. Jacqueline Hey resigned as a Non-Executive Director effective 30 May 2022. Diane Smith-Gander has also advised that she will resign from the Board following the conclusion of the 2022 AGM on 15 November 2022.\n\nIt was originally intended that Diane Smith-Gander would resign from the Board following the release of AGL's FY22 full year results on 19 August 2022. However, given Diane's role as Chair of the People & Performance Committee, the Board considered it was important that Diane continue in this capacity until the 2022 AGM to oversee the delivery of the Remuneration Report.\n\n## On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Graeme, Diane and Jaqueline for their contribution and service to AGL.\n\nThe selection process for a new Chair is well advanced and we expect to announce a new Chair before the 2022 AGM in November. We have also commenced a global search for the Managing Director and CEO and a search process to identify potential new Non-Executive Directors of AGL is also well advanced. We are committed to ensuring that these processes are thorough and timely to ensure new leadership is in place to take AGL forward as soon as possible.\n\nFor more information about our Board visit agl.com.au/about-agl/ who-we-are/our-people.\n\n## Dividend\n\nAGL has declared a final unfranked dividend for FY22 of 10 cents per share. The final dividend is consistent with AGL's dividend policy to target a payout ratio of 75 percent of Underlying Profit after tax. The final FY22 dividend will be paid on 27 September 2022.\n\nGiven the status of the review of AGL's strategic direction, in order for AGL to manage its ongoing continuous disclosure obligations the Board has determined that the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) will not operate for the final FY22 dividend. It is our intention to reinstate the DRP when circumstances allow.\n\nThe Board recognises that the past year has been a challenging time for our business and you, our shareholders. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank you for your ongoing support.\n\n## AGM\n\nOur 2022 AGM will be held on Wednesday, 15 November 2022. Further details about the event will be released in the Notice of Meeting in October.\n\n## Outlook\n\nDespite the challenges of the energy industry and broader market, AGL's underlying business remains resilient, underscored by the strength of our low-cost baseload generation position, large and loyal customer base and robust risk management processes.\n\nAGL is largely hedged for FY23, however, from FY24 AGL is well positioned to benefit from sustained higher wholesale electricity pricing as hedge positions progressively roll off.\n\nIt has been my privilege to be the Chair of the AGL Board over the past year and to have been an AGL Director for the past five years. I firmly believe AGL is a strong company that is well positioned to lead during Australia's energy transition, and I am optimistic about what the future holds for the company.\n\n|",

At the same time, the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic continues, there have been floods in New South Wales and Queensland and the expectations for faster action on climate change are continuing to rise.\n\nAgainst this unprecedented backdrop, AGL's FY22 result reflects the underlying strength and resilience of our business, and the commitment of our people to keep the lights on for the millions of households and businesses that depend on us.\n\nIn May the AGL Board made the difficult decision to withdraw the Demerger Proposal that would have seen AGL separate into two industry-leading companies. At the same time, we also announced a review of the company's strategic direction and a Board and CEO renewal process.\n\nWhile the decision to withdraw the Demerger Proposal represented a significant change in the company's direction, it does not change the vital role AGL is committed to playing in Australia's transition to a low-carbon future. As Australia's largest electricity generator\n\nand a leading multiservice energy retailer with more than 4.2 million customer services, there is an enormous opportunity for AGL and our shareholders to share in the value that will be created as Australia decarbonises over the next few decades.\n\nThroughout the year the AGL team has remained committed to our purpose, Progress for Life , taking action to shape a better future for our people, customers, shareholders and communities. The team has stayed focused on operating our assets safely and reliably, serving our customers and communities, and supporting each other through a period of significant market disruption and change.\n\nLet's now turn to our FY22 performance and reflect on some of the achievements of the year, which demonstrate the strength and resilience of our business.\n\n## Safety\n\nI am pleased to share that our safety performance has improved this year. This is illustrated by a reduction in our Total Injury Frequency Rate (TIFR) to 2.1 per million hours worked for employees and contractors from 2.3 in FY21.\n\nThis year-on-year improvement in safety performance continues the material improvement we saw in the FY21 safety performance compared to the previous two years. It is also important to note that a high volume of critical work was undertaken throughout the year without any serious injury.\n\n## Customers\n\nDespite unprecedented market volatility our customer services have remained stable this year at 4.2 million and we have seen continued growth in telecommunications customers. A sustained focus on improving our customer experience has led to strong strategic Net Promoter Scores relative to historical results and a further reduction in customer complaints. We also have more than one million customers interacting regularly with us online through the AGL Mobile App and MyAccount services.\n\nWe have also seen strong growth in our energy solutions business as the demand for services to help customers decarbonise continues to rise. Our commercial solar credentials have strengthened over the past year, and we continue to hold the number one position in the market. In April 2022, we acquired Energy360, a provider of biogas plants for commercial and industrial customers, extending the ways we can help our customers reduce their carbon emissions and manage their energy costs.\n\n## Generation and trading performance\n\nDespite a good start to the year, our generation volume remained broadly flat in FY22, and our thermal fleet's commercial availability was down two percentage points year-on-year largely due to a confluence of planned and unplanned outages in the fourth quarter.\n\nThere were three key causes of the unplanned outages - an earth fault in Loy Yang Unit 2 generator rotor which we expect to return to service in late September, COVID-19 related delays to planned outages at Bayswater; and a rise in boiler tube leaks across Liddell, Bayswater, and Loy Yang A power stations. Action is underway to address these issues and improve availability in the year ahead.\n\nAmidst the challenging second half of the year, it is important to recognise the performance of the AGL trading team to manage the organisation's risk position and mitigate further downside.",

        "page_content": "## FY22 results\n\nAGL's FY22 Underlying Profit after tax was $225 million, down 58% from FY21.\n\nThe result was largely driven by lower realised contracted and wholesale customer prices, increased costs of capacity to cover periods of peak electricity demand, generation performance, and the non-recurrence of the Loy Yang Unit 2 insurance proceeds received in FY21. This was partly offset by decreased operating costs.\n\nThe strength of AGL's underlying business our low-cost baseload generation; our large and loyal customer base; and our effective portfolio management - has enabled us to manage one of the most challenging and complex periods in the 20-plus-year history of the National Electricity Market (NEM).\n\nIt is this underlying strength, combined with strong fuel supply arrangements, robust risk management and prudent margin management that will ensure the resilience of our FY23 earnings amidst the continuing challenging conditions.\n\nWhile AGL is largely hedged for FY23, we are well positioned from FY24 to benefit from sustained higher wholesale electricity prices as hedge positions progressively roll-off. We expect to provide guidance for FY23 in late September in conjunction with the initial outcomes of the review of AGL's strategic direction.\n\n## People\n\nIt has been a challenging 12 months and the associated disruption has had an understandable impact on our people, with employee engagement falling by five percentage points to 57%. I want to recognise our people for their resilience and persistence through what has been a difficult period. We are continuing to work with our people leaders to support them as we address the destabilisation related to the uncertainty of the past 12 months.\n\n## Committed to decarbonisation\n\nAs Australia's largest electricity generator, and operator of the largest portfolio of renewable generation and storage assets of any ASXlisted company, AGL is committed to decarbonisation and supporting Australia's energy transition.\n\nAn important part of this is progressing our 2.9 GW renewable and storage development pipeline and building the low-carbon industrial Energy Hubs of the future. Current projects underway include the 250 MW Torrens Island grid-scale battery, which is expected to be operating by mid-2023, the 50 MW Broken Hill battery, the 500 MW Liddell battery and the 200 MW Loy Yang battery. Through our memorandum of understanding with Fortescue Future Industries, announced in November 2021, we're also exploring the development of a green hydrogen facility in the Hunter Valley, with potential for domestic and export opportunities.\n\nWe're also empowering our customers to join the transition to a decarbonised world. More than 100,000 customers have enrolled in our multi-asset Virtual Power Plant services across a range of\n\nasset types and our Peak Energy Rewards program continues to be the largest behavioural demand response program in Australia. In addition, the popularity of our carbon-neutral offerings continues to grow.\n\nWe are committed to reporting in line with the Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework. This year, we have not produced a stand-alone TCFD report. A TCFD Index is included in the ESG Data Centre on our website which describes where elements of the TCFD framework are addressed in this report and other disclosures. AGL will release updated scenario analysis of different decarbonisation pathways for the NEM following the review of AGL's strategic direction which we are currently completing.\n\n## Supporting the Community\n\nWe understand that energy affordability continues to be a major issue for our customers and that FY22 has been another year of COVID-19 related disruption. Many of our customers were also impacted by the floods in the first half of 2022.\n\nWe're continuing to support customers with a range of assistance including payment extensions, instalment plans and our hardship program, Staying Connected. Recognising the impact of floods on households and businesses we proactively contacted 300,000 of our customers in flood-affected parts of New South Wales and Queensland to advise them of emergency support options.\n\nWe also donated $100,000 to the Salvation Army 2022 Flood Appeal and matched employee donations to this fund. This was part of the $3.76 million we contributed to communities in FY22.\n\nIn October 2021 we launched our Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) to help deliver our vision for reconciliation. Since launching our RAP, we have made good progress against our planned actions, including enhancing the cultural capability of our organisation and reviewing our people policies to ensure they are culturally appropriate and inclusive for our Indigenous employees.\n\n## Board and CEO renewal\n\nAs mentioned earlier, a Board and CEO renewal process is underway and as a result, I will be stepping down once a new Managing Director and CEO is appointed.\n\nIt has been a privilege to be involved with AGL for the past nine years, firstly as a member of the Board, then as Chairman, and more recently to lead the company as Managing Director and CEO. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time with the business, from working with our people across our corporate and operational sites, to talking to our customers and sharing the AGL story with all our stakeholders, including you, our valued shareholders.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nThe 2022 financial year was challenging for us and many others in the energy industry. However, the resilience and underlying strength of the business remains and AGL is well positioned to succeed in the future.\n\nThank you for reading this report.\n\n|",

About AGL\n\nProudly Australian for 185 years, AGL supplies energy and other essential services to residential, small and large businesses and wholesale customers. AGL is committed to making the supply of energy, alongside other essential services, simple, fair and transparent.\n\nAGL's purpose - Progress for life - recognises our proud history of delivering innovative outcomes for customers, as well as our contribution to transforming how Australians produce, share and consume energy. To us, progress means helping customers achieve better ways of living day-to-day by enabling them to take greater control over their energy and other essential services. It also means investing in new ideas, partnerships and infrastructure - renewing and expanding our portfolio of energy sources and other products to make them more sustainable, reliable, affordable and useful. At an enterprise level, AGL's purpose provides our company, our Directors and our employees and contractors with the foundations for actions and, together with our values, guides our thinking and decision-making.\n\n## OUR VALUES\n\n- \u00b7 Care in every action: physical and psychological safety first; responsible and sustainable in all our actions; always considering our environment; putting yourself in other people's shoes.\n- \u00b7 Integrity always: doing the right thing; being open and accountable; having courageous conversations; keeping our promise.\n- \u00b7 Better together: breaking down silos; being respectful and inclusive of all; seeking out diverse perspectives; building collaborative partnerships.\n- \u00b7 Deliver your best: going the extra mile for our customers; constantly looking to improve; staying resilient when setbacks happen; making excellence part of every day.\n- \u00b7 Shape tomorrow: having courage to explore new possibilities; embracing opportunities to grow; approaching challenges with a can-do attitude; keeping the future in focus.\n\nThe principal activities of AGL as of the reporting date comprised the operation of energy businesses and investments, including electricity generation, gas storage, the sale of electricity and gas to residential, business and wholesale customers and the retailing of broadband and mobile services. In June 2021, AGL announced its intention to undertake a demerger to create two leading energy businesses with separate listings on the Australian Securities Exchange (Demerger Proposal). On 30 May 2022, AGL announced that it had withdrawn the Demerger Proposal, and committed to undertaking a review of strategic direction, renewing the composition of the Board and management, and determining the best way to deliver long-term shareholder value in the context of Australia's energy transition. Further details are available in Section 2.1.\n\nOn 3 August 2021, AGL made a $358 million capital contribution into Powering Australian Renewables (PowAR) to fund its 20% interest in PowAR's acquisition of Tilt Renewables Limited's Australian business. Subsequent to the acquisition, PowAR changed its name to Tilt Renewables. In April 2022 AGL acquired Energy360, a provider of biogas plants for commercial and industrial customers in Australia. In December 2021, AGL completed the disposal of its investments in Energy Impact Partners US and Ecobee. In June 2022, AGL completed the disposal of its investment in Activate Capital Partners.\n\nAGL manages its business in three key operating segments:\n\n- \u00b7 Customer Markets - Customer Markets is responsible for the retailing of electricity, gas, telecommunications (broadband/ mobile/voice), solar and energy efficiency products and services to residential, small and large business customers.\n- \u00b7 Integrated Energy - Integrated Energy operates AGL's power generation portfolio and other key assets, including coal, gas and renewable generation facilities, natural gas storage and production facilities, and development projects. Integrated Energy manages price risk associated with procuring electricity and gas for AGL's customers, manages AGL's obligations in relation to renewable energy schemes, and controls the dispatch of AGL's owned and contracted generation assets, third party gas agreements and associated portfolio of energy hedging products.\n- \u00b7 Investments - Investments comprises AGL's interests in the ActewAGL Retail Partnership, Tilt Renewables, Energy Impact Partners Europe, Solar Analytics Pty Limited, Sunverge Energy Inc, RayGen Resources Pty Ltd, Honey Insurance Pty Ltd and Ovo Energy Australia Pty Ltd.\n\nRefer to Section 5 for further details and financial performance information for each operating segment, and for centrally managed expenses.",

Strategy\n\n## 2.1 Demerger Proposal and review of strategic direction\n\nIn June 2021, AGL announced its intention to undertake a demerger to create two leading energy businesses with separate listings on the Australian Securities Exchange: AGL Australia and Accel Energy (Demerger Proposal).\n\nOn 30 May 2022, AGL announced that it had withdrawn the Demerger Proposal. While we believe that the Demerger Proposal would have been supported by a majority of shareholders, anticipated voter turnout and stated opposition from a small number of investors made it clear that the Demerger Proposal would not receive the required 75% approval threshold for a scheme of arrangement.\n\nAt the same time as announcing the withdrawal, we committed to undertaking a review of AGL's strategic direction, renewing the composition of the Board, and determining the best way to deliver long-term shareholder value in the context of Australia's energy transition.\n\nAGL's focus for the review of strategic direction will be to answer some of the most substantial strategic questions facing an integrated AGL to create value for shareholders while ensuring AGL takes a responsible and leading role in helping Australia meet its future energy requirements in the energy transition. AGL has the opportunity to play our part in helping Australia achieve net zero and will do so by leveraging our extensive energy and innovation expertise to serve our large-scale customer base.\n\nThe review is focusing on four key areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Review of existing strategies - advance the strategic initiatives developed before and during the proposed demerger process and consider how AGL will continue to meet needs of customers and communities through the energy transition.\n- \u00b7 Decarbonisation objectives - review decarbonisation pathways for AGL and determine how best to participate in and lead the energy transition.\n- \u00b7 Optimal energy mix - determine the asset portfolio that will be required to meet decarbonisation objectives and allow AGL to provide the energy and capacity required today and into the future.\n- \u00b7 Capital structure - preliminary assessment and review of options to fund AGL's existing business and its future energy transition ambitions as an integrated entity.\n\n|",

Through this program, we identify factors that are critical to the successful delivery of our strategy and our ability to create value into the future.\n\nWe undertake a comprehensive process throughout the year to identify, assess and report on the key risks to achieving our strategic priorities over the medium term to long term. We define these as Tier 1 Strategic Risks. Risk mitigation strategies are in place for each of these risks, and the risks have been monitored throughout FY22 by the Audit & Risk Management Committee.\n\n## 2.3.1 FY22 Tier 1 Strategic Risks\n\nVarious aspects of the Australian energy system, and as a consequence AGL's business operations, have become increasingly challenging over the past 12 months, leading to a significantly heightened risk profile for AGL across FY22.\n\nRapidly rising wholesale electricity prices observed across FY22 have led to disruptions to energy markets, and are creating increasing affordability challenges for AGL's customers as these higher input costs flow on to consumer energy bills. The rising wholesale energy prices, and the increasing volatility of these prices, are also placing pressure on energy retailers as liquidity requirements increase, with financial stress being observed by some retailers.\n\nCommunity expectations relating to Australia's energy transition also continue to rise, with broad implications across AGL's risk profile. As Australia's largest energy generator, operator of the largest portfolio of renewable generation and storage assets of any ASX listed company, and a leading retailer of energy solutions, as well as being Australia's largest direct emitter of greenhouse gases, AGL has a critical role to play in a just transition while helping to ensure energy system stability, affordability and appropriate shareholder value outcomes.\n\nSince the FY21 Annual Report, the cyber-security threat landscape has also significantly increased. Increasing rates of ransomware attacks are being observed in Australia and globally, with this trend likely to continue in the current geopolitical environment.",

The key changes identified in AGL's strategic risk profile across FY22 are as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Reflecting the rapidly rising wholesale electricity prices and the likely flow on of these prices to energy customers, the wholesale market pricing and volatility risk and the market disruption risk are increasing.\n- \u00b7 As a result of ongoing increases to the cyber threat landscape, the

As indicated above, our response to climate change is one of AGL's Tier 1 Strategic Risks. At a more granular level, AGL's climate-related risks can be categorised into two main areas: transition risks (arising from the changes to systems and business functions which are necessary to address climate change) and physical risk. A summary of these risks is included below.\n\nTCFD Category of climate-related risk\n\nImplications for AGL\n\n## Mitigation Approach\n\n| Policy & Legal Risks arising from policy or legal interventions that attempt to constrain actions that contribute to the adverse effects of, or seek to promote adaption to, climate change.   | \u00b7 Government policies and/or other interventions designed to limit the impacts of climate change or manage the impacts of Australia's transitioning energy system may be implemented in a disorderly or unplanned manner, increasing uncertainty for AGL's strategic direction and in the allocation of resources. \u00b7 Increased resourcing may be required to anticipate, understand and comply with new regulatory   | AGL engages productively and transparently with all levels of government and regulatory bodies on energy and climate policy and regulations.                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Technology Risks arising from technological changes which are occurring to support the transition to a low carbon economy and the disruption they can cause to markets and businesses.         | \u00b7 As low-carbon, renewable and behind-the-meter technology increase electricity supply to the NEM and change the profile of Australia's electricity supply, some energy assets and investments may no longer provide a viable economic return, and could therefore see their economic life curtailed. \u00b7 AGL may fail to identify and/or appropriately invest in new technologies that support the transition and     | AGL's leading renewable generation position will be further advanced through the continued development of our pipeline of renewable and low-carbon firming projects including batteries, wind, pumped hydro and other storage.

Key Operating Metrics and Business Value Drivers\n\nThe following sections summarise the performance of AGL's business during FY22. Performance is considered through two dimensions:\n\n- \u00b7 Key Operating Metrics - These performance measures have a direct influence on AGL's FY22 financial performance. The six key operating metrics comprise:\n- -Customer numbers and churn;\n- -Customer energy demand;\n- -Wholesale electricity prices;\n- -Generation volumes;\n- -Fuel costs; and\n- -Operating costs and capital expenditure.\n- \u00b7 Business Value Drivers - These performance measures are critical to long-term value creation, however may have a less direct relationship to annual performance, and/or may influence financial performance over the longer term. The performance measures are divided into scorecards for each of AGL's identified Business Value Drivers.\n\n## 3.1 Key Operating Metrics performance\n\n## 3.1.1 Customer numbers and churn\n\nTotal services to customers increased 0.2% to 4.215 million, from 4.208 million as at 30 June 2021. This increase was largely driven by the growth in telecommunication services, offset by anticipated churn related to Click Energy services (acquired on 30 September 2020).\n\nConsumer Electricity decreased by 22,000 services primarily as a result of anticipated churn relating to Click Energy services and heightened competition in the market particularly in Victoria, offset by growth in Queensland. Consumer Gas services decreased by 20,000 services partly related to Click Energy services and competition impacting New South Wales and Victoria, offset slightly by growth in Queensland and Western Australia.\n\nTotal telecommunication services increased 25.5% to 246,000 services due to the continued growth in this service post the launch of AGL Telecommunications in FY21.\n\n|",

The increase has been more pronounced towards the last quarter due to various factors, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the subsequent impact on international coal and gas prices, and overall supply chain delays due to ongoing COVID-19 impacts and flooding affecting coal haulage. Prices have been further affected by a number of coal-fired plant outages across the NEM. In mid June 2022, AEMO intervened in the NEM spot market in response to sustained high prices, initially triggering administered pricing followed by market suspension in response to challenges in market operation.\n\nAGL's approach to managing energy price risks reflects the need to provide price certainty to customers. The exposure to electricity spot prices is hedged via a combination of customer load, generation fleet and financial derivatives. AGL's largely hedged position when wholesale prices were lower, and with customer pricing rolling over a 24-month time frame, resulted in the average wholesale prices realised in FY22 being lower than the prior year. As these lower priced historical hedge positions progressively roll off, AGL will see the recent higher market prices translate into higher realised prices beyond FY23.\n\n## Wholesale electricity prices (AEMO spot prices)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|",

Higher renewable generation was driven by the Coopers Gap Wind Farm located in Queensland and the Macarthur Wind Farm located in Victoria.\n\n| Pool generation volumes                 | FY22 GWh   | FY21 GWh   |\n|-----------------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| AGL Macquarie (Bayswater Power Station) | 13,574     | 13,056     |\n| AGL Loy Yang Power Station              | 13,417     | 14,626     |\n| AGL Macquarie (Liddell Power Station)   | 7,336      | 6,610      |\n| Gas Generation                          | 1,457      | 2,159      |\n| Renewable generation                    | 4,971      | 4,686      |\n| Total pool generation volumes           | 40,755     | 41,137     |\n\n## 3.1.5 Fuel costs\n\nTotal fuel costs for the electricity generation portfolio were $(852) million, down 0.5%.\n\n- \u00b7 Coal costs were $(647) million, up 3.2%. On a per MWh basis, costs increased by $0.5 per MWh or 2.7%. This was driven by higher coal prices which were partly offset by the proportion of coal delivered from legacy contracts, as well as reduced reliance on coal purchases at spot price. Coal prices have been significantly impacted by the global economic environment and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, however AGL was effectively hedged during FY22.\n- \u00b7 Gas fuel costs were $(205) million, down 10.9%, due to lower generation volumes driven by lower contract volumes in South Australia combined with higher gas input costs in the second half of the year impacting the running profile of AGL Torrens. On a per MWh basis, costs increased by $34.2 per MWh or 32.1%. This was driven by the impact of higher cost supply contracts due to the roll off of lower cost legacy gas contracts and increases in gas transportation costs.\n\n| Generation fuel costs       | FY22 $m   | FY21 $m   | FY22 $/MWh   | FY21 $/MWh   |\n|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------|--------------|--------------|\n| Coal                        | (647)     | (627)     | (18.8)       | (18.3)       |\n| Gas                         | (205)     | (230)     | (140.7)      | (106.5)      |\n| Total generation fuel costs | (852)     | (857)     | (20.9)       | (20.8)       |\n\nTotal wholesale gas costs were $(1,446) million, up 10.0% largely due to the roll off of lower cost legacy gas contracts and higher oil prices. On a per GJ basis, costs increased by $1.1 per GJ or 13.3%, driven by increases in fixed haulage and storage costs. The impact of higher gas purchase costs driven by the roll off of legacy supply contracts maturing was offset by lower oil prices, with several of AGL's mid to long-term contracts indexed to oil.\n\n| Total wholesale gas costs   | FY22 $m   | FY21 $m   | FY22 $/GJ   | FY21 $/GJ   |\n|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|\n| Gas purchases               | (1,104)   | (967)     | (7.2)       | (6.1)       |\n| Haulage, storage & other    | (342)     | (347)     | (2.2)       | (2.2)       |\n| Total wholesale gas costs   | (1,446)   | (1,314)   | (9.4)       | (8.3)       |",

Cost out initiatives, in response to market conditions, resulted in a decrease of labour and related on-cost, recruitment, IT and consulting spend across AGL business units combined with non-recurring benefits comprising employee provision movement and labour vacancy benefit. Within the Customer Markets segment, operating costs were lower due to a decrease in net bad debt expense, and campaigns and advertising spend was lower due to cost reductions achieved via digital and marketing campaign efficiencies. Within the Integrated Energy segment, operating costs were lower due to operational efficiencies and organisational restructuring, lower maintenance resulting from the AGL Torrens A station and Liddell Unit 3 closures, the lower turbine repair costs at Kwinana Swift Power Station, and a reduction of insurance premiums.\n\n| Operating costs                                                 | FY22 $m   | FY21 $m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Customer Markets                                                | (491)     | (517)     |\n| Integrated Energy                                               | (725)     | (790)     |\n| Investments 1                                                   | (21)      | (2)       |\n| Centrally Managed Expenses                                      | (259)     | (310)     |\n| Total operating costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation) | (1,496)   | (1,619)   |\n\nTotal capital expenditure was $646 million, a decrease of $61 million:\n\n- \u00b7 Sustaining capital expenditure was $460 million, a decrease of $74 million. This comprised $342 million of expenditure on AGL's coal-fired plants, down $21 million, due to absence of major outages at the Liddell Power Station as the site progresses the planned closure and transitions to the Hunter Energy Hub. This was partly offset by the deferral of outage works from FY21 into FY22 at AGL Loy Yang due to COVID-19 related personnel restrictions on site. Other sustaining capital expenditure was down, due predominately to a deferred Gas Generation outage.\n- \u00b7 Growth and transformation capital expenditure was $186 million, an increase of $13 million, due to the Torrens Island Battery and Broken Hill Battery projects, partly offset by the non-recurrence of the cancelled LNG Crib Point project.\n\n| Capital expenditure        |   FY22 $m |   FY21 $m |\n|----------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Customer Markets           |        77 |        87 |\n| Integrated Energy          |       538 |       556 |\n| Centrally Managed Expenses |        31 |        64 |\n| Total capital expenditure  |       646 |       707 |\n| Sustaining                 |       460 |       534 |\n| Growth and transformation  |       186 |       173 |\n| Total capital expenditure  |       646 |       707 |\n\n## 3.2 Business Value Driver performance\n\nA summary of our performance in relation to each of AGL's Business Value Drivers is provided in the following sections.

        "page_content": "## Operating & Financial Review\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2022\n\n## 3.2.1 Customer scorecard\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Customers\n\nOver FY22, AGL's total services to customers was stable at 4.2 million 1 . Energy consumer churn was 15.6%, below the rest of market at 19.6%. Refer to Section 3.1.1 for more details.\n\n## Strengthening customer relationships\n\nAGL has maintained a positive level of customer advocacy, with our Net Promoter Score increasing for the fourth consecutive year, despite continuing COVID-19 restrictions and increasing cost of living pressures. This demonstrates the positive impact of our strategic focus on improving the moments that matter most to customers.\n\nWe have continued to invest in digital experiences and the self-service capabilities of our digital channels and tools, particularly our sales funnel, MyAccount and the AGL Mobile App. We have over one million active AGL Mobile App and MyAccount users, with the AGL Mobile App rated number one amongst its Australian peers with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating in the App Store. Refer to Section 3.2.6 for examples of some of the initiatives we have implemented over FY22 to demonstrate our focus on enhancing our digital capabilities for our customers.\n\nOmbudsman complaints reduced for the seventh consecutive year, with an 18% reduction achieved in FY22. In FY19 we set a goal to reduce Ombudsman complaints by 50% (based on FY18 volumes) over FY20-FY22. We exceeded this goal, finishing FY22 with a total reduction of 57% compared to FY18. AGL has the least number of consumer electricity customer complaints of any Tier 1 retailer (based on FY21 AER and ESC complaint volumes).\n\n|                          | FY22   | FY21   |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Net Promoter Score (NPS) | +6     | +5     |\n| Ombudsman complaints     | 4,873  | 5,973  |\n\n## Energy affordability and supporting customers experiencing vulnerability\n\nAGL recognises that recent energy price increases will be challenging for some customers, particularly in the context of broader cost of living pressures. AGL has a broad range of support options available to customers, including access to our 'Staying Connected' residential hardship program which provides tailored assistance including advice on energy efficiency, pathways to government support and dedicated financial counselling services. Staying Connected continues to provide support beyond our regulatory obligations, and we have put in place measures to help offset the impact of energy price rises for our hardship customers over the coming year. We also continue to focus on undertaking proactive monitoring utilising our data and analytics capabilities to identify and engage customers at risk of payment difficulties.\n\nThe number of customers on the Staying Connected program reduced in FY22, through a combination of improved customer support measures, improvements in debt performance and government support. This was largely driven by delivery of $26 million of debt relief to assist customers who were participating in the Staying Connected program. This allowed customers to focus on managing the affordability of their ongoing energy costs rather than debt and enabled them to graduate from the program. As a result, the profile of customers remaining on the program shifted to primarily those with long-term payment difficulties who are continuing to pay below the cost of their ongoing consumption, contributing to accumulation of debt. This has resulted in the average debt per Staying Connected customer increasing by 7% in FY22 to $2,973.\n\nSince the end of last year, AGL's Customer Council, with a membership panel that includes some of Australia's most experienced consumer advocates and industry representatives, has been discussing in depth the issue of energy affordability and wrote an open letter (available online ) to articulate its shared views on some key structural and equity issues regarding the energy transition. It notes the industry trend of growing consumer debt levels, compounded by an increase in the number of individuals experiencing entrenched and enduring affordability issues. It canvasses a framework for success to ensure energy fairness for all Australians, calling upon governments, policymakers, regulators, industry, consumer advocates and peak bodies to work together to ensure that the energy transition provides just outcomes for all consumers.\n\n|                                                          | FY22   | FY21   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Number of customers on Staying Connected                 | 15,964 | 26,263 |\n| Average level of debt of customers on Staying Connected  | $2,973 | $2,768 |\n| Total average debt across mass market customer portfolio | $241   | $292   |",

        "page_content": "## Operating & Financial Review\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2022\n\n## Helping our customers decarbonise\n\nAGL continues to provide leadership in helping both our residential and commercial customers transition to a low carbon future, providing innovative offerings in e-mobility, decentralised energy resources and green financing. AGL now provides 390,000 carbon neutral services (up from 260,000 in FY21), including more than 140,000 residential and small business carbon neutral energy services and 60 commercial and industrial customers (up from 65,000 and 35 in FY21, respectively).\n\nCombined sales grew across our solar battery hardware and bring-your-own battery products with a 41% increase compared to FY21. Peak Energy Rewards continues to be the largest behavioural demand response program in Australia. In FY22, we had a record number of enrolments with consistently high levels of customer engagement, satisfaction and advocacy, and rewarded customers for over 200 MWh of energy reduction through the program.\n\nAGL continues to be the leading commercial solar and decarbonisation services partner for business with the acquisition in FY22 of Energy360, a provider of biogas plants for commercial and industrial customers, and the integration of Epho and Solgen (both acquired in FY21). AGL now has more than 140 MW of commercial solar under monitoring and management, an increase of 33% compared to FY21.\n\n## 3.2.2 Communities & Relationships scorecard\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Communities & Relationships\n\n## Brand and reputation\n\nAGL's RepTrak score was 65.8, 0.9 points lower than the result from FY21, reflecting broad trends in the utilities sector. Growing concerns about increased costs of living and rising energy prices, along with the withdrawal of AGL's proposed demerger and subsequent leadership changes, dampened some of the positive momentum made in FY21 and into the first part of FY22. Despite this drop from FY21, AGL's FY22 quarterly scores remained consistently above 65 points, an improvement on historical performance. Results for the key drivers of reputation were comparable to those in FY21.\n\n|               | Target    |   FY22 |   FY21 |\n|---------------|-----------|--------|--------|\n| RepTrak score | FY24: >70 |   65.8 |   66.7 |\n\n## Transparent policy and industry engagement\n\nIt is important to our stakeholders that our involvement in public policy development is undertaken transparently and consistently. Submissions to government processes are published on AGL's online channel, the Hub . Further, the community expects that corporations should not have an undue level of influence on government policy by providing financial contributions to political parties that could result in, or could be perceived to result in, preferential treatment. We adopted a Political Donations Policy in August 2015, which prohibits AGL from making political donations. No political donations (monetary or in-kind) were made during FY22, nor were any political donations made through third parties.\n\nAGL's Industry Association Membership Policy formalises our commitments to monitor the policy positions and public advocacy of industry associations of which we are a member and to disclose all memberships, membership fees, and areas where our policy positions differ materially from the associations of which we are a member. These disclosures are available in the ESG Data Centre .\n\nWe continue to engage with all levels of government as we progress plans for both the closure of Liddell Power Station and the potential redevelopment of the site. In addition, AGL Macquarie has a Community Dialogue Group consisting of stakeholders from local councils, business and industry groups, Traditional Owners and local residents, to ensure there is a formal voice for the community during the Liddell transition.\n\n|",

Overall community contributions for FY22 were $3.8 million 2 . This represented a 28% reduction compared to FY21. This reduction in community investment is due to a number of factors including our focus on the proposed demerger over FY22, the Crib Point Jetty Project not proceeding, and lower management costs compared to FY21.\n\nDuring FY21, we commenced a review of our community investment programs, with the aim of aligning our investments more closely to AGL's purpose, capabilities and stakeholder expectations, and focusing on fewer areas of investment so we can have greater impact. The review was put on hold during FY22 due to the focus within AGL on the proposed demerger. During FY23 we will recommence the review to ensure that our investments in the community are focused and aligned with AGL's future direction and community needs.\n\nWe continue to engage proactively with the communities where we operate and have increased our engagement with the Traditional Owners of lands where our sites are located. In FY22, AGL received endorsement for our inaugural Innovate Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) from Reconciliation Australia. Since the public launch of our RAP in October 2021, we have made good progress against our planned actions, including partnering with BlackCard and Evolve Communities to enhance the cultural capability of our organisation; reviewing our people policies to ensure our policies and procedures are culturally appropriate and inclusive for our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employees; partnering with Clontarf Foundation to help improve school attendance and completion rate for Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander boys; awarding our third annual Jungarra Wannik scholarship; and continuing our support of the Waiwa Mudena Cadetship program by sponsoring two Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander law students.\n\nWe are committed to meeting all our tax compliance obligations, and to providing our stakeholders with information about the taxes we pay. In this regard we have adopted the Board of Taxation's voluntary Tax Transparency Code . The effective tax rate on Underlying Profit is below its long-term average (around 28-29%) and the Australian corporate tax rate of 30% due to adjustments for prior years including research and development benefits, amplified by an overall lower net profit after tax compared to the prior year.\n\n|                               | FY22   | FY21   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Community contribution        | $3.8 m | $5.2 m |\n| Underlying effective tax rate | 23.2%  | 27.0%  |\n\n## 3.2.3 People scorecard\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Safety and wellbeing\n\nAGL's Total Injury Frequency Rate (TIFR) for employees and contractors has decreased by 9% compared to FY21. While this decrease represents an improvement in safety performance, we recognise there is still more to do to keep improving our safety performance. Contractor injuries have made a significant contribution to AGL's TIFR. This has resulted in a review of the Customer Market's end-to-end contractor management processes, including contractor engagement at job start.\n\nThe Serious Injury or Fatality (SIF) potential to recordable incident ratio, which provides a measure of incidents with a potential serious outcome against incidents where an injury has occurred, has improved from 2.7:1 in FY21 to 2.8:1. The initiatives that have driven this improvement include the SIF prevention program, which has resulted in an improved, robust incident review process coupled with learning and sharing from incidents. Additionally, proactive critical control checks continue to identify actions for improvement across high-risk areas.\n\nThe highest frequency SIF events are dropped/ fallen objects and falls from heights. Asset integrity issues continue to account for the majority of the dropped/fallen object incidents, with plant age being a key contributing factor. AGL continues to implement programs to improve site safety including through planned maintenance.\n\nFall from heights SIF potential incidents have been associated with contractors across our assets. As a result, we are working closely to understand and address the contributing factors which include job preparation and on the job supervision.\n\n|                                      |   FY21 |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|\n| TIFR employees                       |    1.7 |\n| TIFR (employees + contractors)       |    2.3 |\n| Fatalities (employees + contractors) |    0   |",

        "page_content": "## Operating & Financial Review\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2022\n\n## Culture and values\n\nAGL's FY22 employee engagement score was 57%, down five percentage points from 62% in FY21. The decline in employee engagement is reflective of the amount of change and disruption experienced by our people over the past 12 months, both in relation to the proposed and subsequently withdrawn demerger plans as well as due to challenges facing the wider energy industry.\n\nThe proportion of females in AGL's senior leadership pipeline (SLP) was 35%, down from 36% last year. Organisational restructuring ahead of the planned demerger and as part of broader resourcing rationalisation has impacted the overall composition of our workforce. We reviewed gender pay equity during FY22, closing the average pay gap in like-for-like roles to zero in September 2021. While a gender pay equity review is normally completed twice yearly, due to demerger activities, this will next be conducted in the second quarter of FY23.\n\nWe have maintained our focus on building a diverse and inclusive workplace, concentrating on six key dimensions: gender; LGBTQ+ inclusion; First Nations, parents and carers; disability; and cultural identity. During FY22, AGL was accredited with Platinum Qualifying Employer Status for LGBTQ+ Inclusion in the Australian Workplace Equality Index. We were also named one of the first companies in Australia to be certified as a Family Inclusive Workplace under new national standards.\n\nWe supported a cultural competency uplift delivering programs to build understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories and culture and improve support for culturally diverse people, and we created new opportunities for people to volunteer as mentors through the Australian Network on Disability's Positive Action towards Career Engagement mentoring programs.\n\n|                                      | Targets                                                                                 | FY22   | FY21   |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Employee engagement                  |                                                                                         | 57%    | 62%    |\n| Gender mix in SLP (% female)         | FY23: Meet gender diversity objectives outlined in AGL's Corporate Governance Statement | 35%    | 36%    |\n| Material breaches of Code of Conduct |                                                                                         | 0      | 0      |\n\n## Talent and leadership\n\nAGL continues to focus on developing leaders at all levels. During FY22 we simplified our leadership capability framework and related tools to provide accessible learning pathways at all levels of leadership. We also continued to deliver foundational programs for critical management skills and shaping hybrid working, as well as delivering executive level coaching and advisory support.\n\nKey talent retention was challenging during FY22. AGL attributes this to a number of factors, including the uncertainty caused by the proposed demerger, the highly competitive external job market and the increasing changes and challenges experienced across the energy industry. During FY22, senior appointment and promotion decisions were made to appropriately staff the proposed demerged companies, both of which would be smaller and with different talent and capability requirements to AGL, and aspects of organisational redesign were implemented over the year. The withdrawal of the proposed demerger had implications on the retention of some key talent. Despite the acknowledged loss of skilled executives, AGL enters FY23 confident in the capabilities of its extended leadership team.\n\nAGL Macquarie is committed to having no forced employee redundancies as a result of the closure of the Liddell Power Station. The Liddell Transition Team and executive-led functional working groups continued to support AGL's goals for the transition of the Liddell site and workforce over FY22.

This year, we have not produced a stand-alone TCFD report. A TCFD Index is included in the ESG Data Centre on our website which describes where elements of the TCFD framework are addressed in this report and other disclosures. AGL will also release updated scenario analysis of different decarbonisation pathways for the NEM following the review of AGL's strategic direction which we are currently completing.\n\nAs announced in February 2022, we committed to responsibly transitioning our operations by closing our thermal coal power stations in the following time frames to reduce our environmental footprint:\n\n- \u00b7 Liddell Power Station: April 2023\n- \u00b7 Bayswater Power Station: 2030-2033\n- \u00b7 Loy Yang A Power Station: 2040-2045\n\nThe above closures will deliver a reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operated electricity generation fleet of between 18-27% during FY25-FY34 and between 55-60% during FY35-FY46 compared to a FY19 baseline, after which AGL will achieve net zero for its electricity generation portfolio 3 .\n\nWe have been in ongoing discussions with key stakeholders regarding our path to decarbonisation, and believe that the dates for closure of coal-fired power stations will continue to accelerate. However we also know that with this scale of change, these closures must not happen outside of a co-ordinated plan across governments, industry, regulators and the community, and we are committed to working with our stakeholders to achieve this.\n\nAGL's decarbonisation pathway will continue to be reviewed as part of the review of strategic direction that is currently underway. AGL will release a Climate Transition Action Plan following this review, and shareholders will have the opportunity to vote on the Climate Transition Action Plan as part of the 'Say on Climate' resolution at the 2022 AGM.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions\n\nAGL's total greenhouse gas emissions decreased relative to FY21 levels, primarily as a result of reduced generation from Loy Yang A Power Station due to the major Unit 2 outage and reduced generation from Torrens Island Power Station due to the mothballing of the A3 and B1 units during FY22. This was partly offset by an increase in generation from Liddell and Bayswater power stations.\n\nThe decrease in controlled emissions intensity was driven by reduced generation from Loy Yang A Power Station as well as increased generation from Bayswater and Liddell power stations and increased renewable output from AGL's generation portfolio, partially offset by decreased gas-fired generation.\n\nThe proportion of AGL's controlled generation capacity that is renewable or electricity storage increased in FY22, largely as a result of Liddell Power Station Unit 3 being retired. As noted in Section 3.2.5 several grid-scale batteries are currently in development.\n\nThe emissions intensity of total revenue has primarily decreased as a result of increasing wholesale electricity prices which has driven revenue up. The increase in revenue from green energy and carbon neutral products was driven by residential solar revenue, carbon neutral products and pool revenue from renewable generation. Further information in relation to carbon neutral products is available in Section 3.2.1.\n\n|                                                           | Targets        |   FY22 |   FY21 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------|--------|\n| Operated scope 1 & 2 emissions (MtCO2e)                   | FY50: Net zero | 40.1   | 40.8   |\n| Controlled generation intensity (tCO2e/MWh)               | FY24: 0.845    |  0.938 |  0.951 |\n| Controlled renewable and battery capacity (%)             | FY24: 34%      | 24.2   | 23     |\n| Emissions intensity of total revenue (ktCO2e/$m)          | -              |  3     |  3.7   |\n| Revenue from green energy and carbon neutral products (%) | FY24: 20%      | 15.3   | 13.4   |\n\n## Rehabilitation and site transition\n\nAGL is committed to providing ongoing, transparent disclosure in relation to our approach to the progressive and final rehabilitation of assets at the end of their operational lives.

        "page_content": "## Operating & Financial Review\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2022\n\n## 3.2.5 Infrastructure scorecard\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Infrastructure\n\nAGL's operated generation capacity as of 30 June 2022 was 10,330 MW. A map of AGL's assets is available in Section 1.1. The output from our electricity generation portfolio is outlined in Section 3.1.4.\n\n## Generation efficiency and availability\n\nThe high performance of AGL's generation fleet during the first three quarters of FY22 was challenged by the confluence of planned and unplanned outages in Q4. In FY22, the overall fleet availability, (termed Equivalent Availability Factor), improved compared to FY21. The performance of Loy Yang A Power Station was ahead of the FY22 target despite the Unit 2 generator failure in Q4. Unit 2 will return to service in September 2022 with an improved design to ameliorate the failure mechanism. Bayswater Power Station's FY22 performance was on par with FY21. The extensive mid-life program for Unit 3 was completed in July 2022. This will provide improved generation capability and efficiency, together with upgraded design features. Liddell Power Station's FY22 performance improved compared to FY21. Unit 3 was removed from service in Q4 and a simplified operational regime has been implemented to ensure the continued safe operation of the remaining units until closure in Q4 FY23.\n\nA Future Ready program is being implemented to ensure the fleet is optimised for future operational requirements. Thermal digital twins, which are digital models of the generating plant with live inputs from the control system, have been deployed at Bayswater and Loy Yang A power stations. This enables control system efficiency gains to be modelled and assessed, allowing implementation of initiatives to occur more quickly.\n\nProgrammed energy efficiency uplifts have been delivered at Bayswater Power Station as part of the FY22 planned outage schedule. This has included plant design modifications to enable online maintenance of feedwater heaters, ensuring generation performance and minimising site emissions intensity. Unit 3 generator turbine sections have been replaced with an improved design, which will provide an additional capacity of 25 MW, enabling additional generation with no additional fuel being required.\n\n|                                        | FY22   | FY21   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Equivalent Availability Factor (EAF) 1 | 74.5%  | 73.7%  |\n\n## Market transformation and development\n\nAGL is committed to continuing to invest in new sources of electricity supply through direct investment and offtake agreements. During FY22 we continued our strong track record of investing in renewable generation as well as energy storage projects:\n\n- \u00b7 On 3 August 2021, AGL made a $358 million capital contribution into Powering Australian Renewables (PowAR) to fund its 20% interest in PowAR's acquisition of Tilt Renewables Limited's Australian business. Subsequent to the acquisition, PowAR changed its name to Tilt Renewables.\n- \u00b7 Development activities continued as part of AGL's national roll-out of 850 MW of grid-scale batteries:\n- -Construction of the Torrens Island 250 MW grid-scale battery commenced in late 2021, with construction of the 50 MW Broken Hill battery scheduled to commence later in 2022.\n- -Development approval has been confirmed for the 200 MW Loy Yang battery and the 500 MW Liddell battery (150 MW in Phase 1), with both projects subject to final investment decision.\n- -The 100 MW Wandoan Battery, over which AGL has a 15-year agreement with Vena Energy for full operational dispatch rights, commenced commercial operation in July 2022.\n- -AGL and specialist independent power producer Neoen have also signed a seven-year agreement to enable AGL to virtually charge and discharge up to 70 MW of Neoen's 100 MW Capital Battery.\n- \u00b7 AGL is leading a consortium of industry partners in a feasibility study to explore the commercial and technical feasibility of establishing a renewable hydrogen hub and the production of hydrogen-derived products at Torrens Island to serve both domestic users in South Australia and interstate, as well as wider export markets. AGL and Fortescue Future Industries have also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to explore the development of a green hydrogen facility at the site of the Liddell and Bayswater power stations.\n\nWe also continue to invest in our orchestration platform for the management of decentralised assets. Our multi-asset virtual power plant (VPP) is made up of residential and business customer assets including batteries, solar, demand response, electric vehicles and back-up generation. The majority of this capacity reflects curtailable load and behind-the-meter generation at our commercial and industrial customer sites and was primarily contracted for the peak summer period to assist managing our position. Over the FY22 period the multi-asset VPP provided over 1 GWh of flexible energy from our residential as well as commercial and industrial customers across all NEM States in which we retail electricity.",

In February, AGL announced that it was bringing forward the closure windows for our thermal coal power stations (refer to Section 3.2.4). On 1 April 2022, AGL closed the first unit of the Liddell Power Station ahead of the full closure of the station in April 2023. In July 2021, AGL informed the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) that we would mothball one of the four operational Torrens B power station units in October FY22, in response to challenging conditions that do not currently support the financial viability of operating all four generation units at the Torrens B power station. In August 2021, AGL also informed AEMO of the closure schedule for Torrens A. The first two Torrens A units were closed in September 2020. A third unit was closed in September 2021 and the final unit will be closed in September 2022.\n\nAGL remains committed to repurposing its thermal generation sites into integrated energy hubs, which includes advancing projects that connect industrial partners into a low-carbon circular economy at the sites. Projects and feasibility studies are already underway at the three identified hubs of Latrobe Valley, Hunter and Torrens. These hubs will bring together energy production and energy-intensive industries around a shared infrastructure backbone to generate synergies and decarbonise the industry in innovative ways. Each of the sites present a rare and unique redevelopment opportunity with a range of valuable assets and resources including surplus land, road and rail access, materials unloading and transport facilities, and water treatment and storage infrastructure and are embedded in unique environments. Importantly, the strong grid locations with valuable existing grid connection infrastructure will help AGL progress and accelerate new renewable and low-carbon firming projects more quickly, as well as attracting complementary industry and partners to the hubs. The commercial reuse of these resources at each of our existing thermal generation sites will support the economic diversification of these regions while also growing local economies and new job and skills development opportunities.\n\nDuring FY22 AGL commenced studies to explore the commercial and technical feasibility of establishing renewable hydrogen hubs at each of the Hunter and Torrens Island sites and the production of hydrogen and hydrogen-derived products at those hubs, as mentioned above. These studies are ongoing and will run until the end of the calendar year. During FY22 AGL also signed a MOU with waste site remediation company, Nu-Rock Building Products, to investigate the feasibility of utilising Nu-Rock's waste recycling technology to convert coal ash into construction bricks at Bayswater Power Station.\n\n|",

The use of advanced analytics and new techniques such as using thermal digital twins at our power stations (refer to Section 3.2.5) continues to increase, providing new and more rapid insights on how we can operate our business more efficiently and how we can best serve our customers.\n\nAs we continue to grow our use of data for machine learning and artificial intelligence, AGL recognises how important it is for data to be as simple as possible to access while maintaining strong levels of security. We are putting data at the core of our decisions and empowering our people to innovate based on common tools and frameworks.\n\nWe are currently using machine learning and artificial intelligence models to achieve outcomes such as:\n\n- \u00b7 providing customers with insights on their energy usage and how it could be improved;\n- \u00b7 delivering a 'Solar Status' feature in the AGL Mobile App which gives all eligible solar customers free monitoring and troubleshooting of their solar system's health; and\n- \u00b7 improving our site operations and power generation by optimising supply chains and coal movement via trains and conveyors at our AGL Macquarie generation site.\n\nOver FY22 AGL completed its Energy Trading & Risk Management (ETRM) Uplift, which commenced in 2019 and which is the largest and most ambitious investment that AGL has made in its energy trading systems and processes. The key driver for the program was the rapidly changing environment in which AGL operates, with the size, number and complexity of Australia's energy markets increasing significantly over recent years, as well as the value of contracts traded by AGL. The objectives of the ETRM Uplift were to replace AGL's ageing energy trading systems, automate manual processes, strengthen internal controls, address market changes such as 5-minute settlements, and provide a foundation to support business growth via the introduction of an integrated data platform, enabling better risk insights into the portfolio. With the systems for energy trading now strengthened, AGL can focus on delivering greater value through improved risk insights and enhanced market and portfolio analysis.\n\n## Technology enabled future\n\nAGL continued our focus on technology transformation over FY22, supporting our overarching objective to deliver contemporary and resilient technology platforms and services that enable our business to: meet the changing needs of our customers; effectively compete in the market; and grow and innovate. Our focus continues to be delivering a lean energy core that lowers cost to serve while delivering effortless customer experiences. This will be enabled by a flexible and modular technology platform that preserves optionality for future investment and innovation.\n\nWe achieved substantial improvements through our drive to be 'Digital First', with the proportion of our customers who have accessed AGL's digital channels materially increasing. In addition, we completed vendor selection for critical 'middle layer' technology including our Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system, Product Catalogue and intelligent Business Process Management (iBPM) system. These technology changes form a critical part of AGL's 'Retail Next' technology transformation program to dramatically simplify its technology architecture and deliver significant capability uplift.\n\nInitiatives that were implemented over FY22 to improve digital adoption include:\n\n- \u00b7 optimising digital origination and experience for telecommunications and energy customers;\n- \u00b7 integrating systems to allow customer data to flow between digital assets and to further protect customer data through two-factor authentication for telecommunication products;\n- \u00b7 growing features and functionality of the market-leading AGL Mobile App;\n- \u00b7 delivering new features to help our customers better manage their services; and\n- \u00b7 investing in our website platform to better respond to our changing business.\n\nThese investments supported AGL's ability to achieve record milestones for digital active, digital sales and our customers' use of service assets such as My Account and the AGL Mobile App over FY22.",

        "page_content": "## Operating & Financial Review\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2022\n\nWe also continued to invest in our systems and platforms over FY22 to further enhance the digital experience for our business customers. AGL now has over 5,500 registered enterprises using our business customer portal. This year we added usage graphing and data visualisation capabilities to the services offered by the business customer portal, enabling customers to easily interpret their consumption patterns and trends to identify opportunities to reduce their energy costs and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with their energy use. In addition, we have expanded our commercial solar monitoring and management platform to support more than 140 MW of our business customers' solar assets, optimising asset performance to ensure customers are benefiting from maximum solar production, lowering costs and improving asset returns.\n\nIn October 2021 AGL won the Australia and New Zealand Best in Future of Intelligence award at the IDC Future Enterprise Awards. This year's Future Enterprise benchmarks were chosen based on an organisation's successful implementation of digital initiatives that address new customer requirements, development of new capabilities, deployment of new critical infrastructure, and pursuit of new industry ecosystems. Delivering on our customer-first ambition, AGL partnered with Tata Consultancy Services to inform intelligent customer insights using artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate collection and categorisation of customer data.\n\nOverall our IT systems remained stable during FY22, despite ongoing challenges from the impacts of COVID-19 on team resourcing. Major incident numbers decreased from FY21. The cause of major incidents differed in that 'Software as a Service' (SaaS) represented the majority of major incidents over FY22, and the number of major incidents caused by production changes decreased. AGL's increased use of SaaS requires a focus on mitigating business impact during major incidents while awaiting technical resolution from the SaaS supplier. The reduction in major incidents caused by production changes can be attributed to an increased focus on service management process improvement, a maturing change management process, as well as driving increased permanent resolutions to reduce the likelihood of incident reoccurrence. Over FY22, AGL also continued with transformation of applications into the cloud to gain improved cybersecurity, flexibility, and end-of-life risk.\n\n|                                        | Targets   | FY22   | FY21   |\n|----------------------------------------|-----------|--------|--------|\n| Major IT incidents                     | -         | 50     | 52     |\n| Digitally active services to customers | FY24: 65% | 53.8%  | 50.4%  |\n\n## Data security and process governance\n\nAGL collects data from and about our customers to provide our products and services and to comply with the law. We recognise that customer data protection and privacy are critical to both our customers and our operations, and our Privacy Policy is designed to explain how we collect, use and protect customer data in the course of our business.\n\nDuring FY22 one notifiable data breach was identified and reported to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, impacting one AGL customer. Since performing an assessment of the root cause of the incident, additional controls have been implemented to prevent similar occurrences.\n\nAGL recognises that customer data protection and privacy are critical to both our customers and our operations. As such, we require all personnel to complete annual privacy training, and continue to invest in uplifting privacy practices to improve the manner in which customer data is collected and controlled.\n\n|                              |   FY22 |   FY21 |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Reportable privacy incidents |      1 |      0 |\n\n## Modern Slavery\n\nAs noted within AGL's Human Rights Policy, we understand that it is our responsibility to respect, uphold and contribute to the realisation of human rights, and to endeavour to avoid complicity in human rights abuse. Our second Modern Slavery Act Statement for the FY21 reporting period detailed how we continued to develop, enhance and embed initiatives across our business operations to better identity, assess and address the risk of modern slavery within our operations and supply chains.

Group Financial Performance and Position\n\n## 4.1 Group results summary\n\nStatutory Profit after tax attributable to AGL shareholders was $860 million, an increase of $2,918 million compared to the Statutory Loss of $(2,058) million in the prior year. The principal drivers of the increase were a lower value of asset impairments taken in FY22 compared to FY21, favourable movements on onerous contracts, offset by increased separation and restructuring costs and lower achieved wholesale energy prices.\n\n## Market Suspension by AEMO\n\nA series of conditions affecting the National Electricity Market (NEM) between 12 and 23 June 2022 triggered administered pricing, spot market suspension and around 500 separate market interventions by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) under the National Electricity Rules. The nature and scale of these events was unprecedented in the NEM.\n\nMarket Participants 4 , primarily electricity generators, adversely impacted by AEMO's market interventions can claim compensation under various mechanisms outlined in the National Electricity Rules. Those compensation payments will be recovered from Market Customers ,4 , including electricity retailers, in proportion to their share of electricity purchased during the period and regions the interventions occurred.\n\nAGL will make claims for compensation as a Market Participant and will share in the aggregate of all claims paid as a Market Customer.  AGL has not recognised any benefit in relation to claims it will make under the National Electricity Rules as a Market Participant for the interventions that occurred in June 2022 as the outcome of those claims is uncertain.\n\nAt 30 June 2022, AGL has recognised its share of the provisional compensation amounts published by AEMO including provisional amounts for directions compensation and payments made under Reliability and Emergency Reserve Trader contracts. It is not possible to reliably estimate the value of further compensation claims that may be made by Market Participants or approved by AEMO and the Australian Energy Market Commission (AEMC) under the National Electricity Rules for the market interventions made by AEMO in June 2022. Those claims may be significant. AGL expects updates to be provided by AEMO and AEMC from time to time however final positions may not be available until AEMO issues revision statements in November 2022, January 2023 or later.\n\nIt is probable that further claims will be approved by AEMO and the AEMC, and these will be recovered from Market Customers, including AGL, in a future period. Had those amounts been known or estimable, at 30 June 2022 AGL would have recognised additional liabilities associated with its proportionate share of the compensation claims net of amounts passed through to customers. The value of the unrecognised liabilities may be material to the financial performance or position of AGL at 30 June 2022.\n\n## 4.1.1 Reconciliation of Statutory Profit/(Loss) to Underlying Profit\n\nAGL uses Underlying Profit as a key measure of financial performance. Underlying Profit is derived from Statutory Profit, as measured in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards, by excluding significant items and movements in the fair value of financial instruments. The use of Underlying Profit enhances comparability of results by excluding non-recurring events and transactions that materially affect the financial results of AGL for the reporting period. The Remuneration Report Section 8.3.2 provides further information regarding the assessment of financial performance against performance incentive targets.\n\nUnderlying Profit after tax was $225 million, down 58.1% from the prior year. A description of the factors driving Underlying Profit is included in Section 4.1.5\n\n|                                                                    | FY22 $m     | FY21 $m       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|---------------|\n| Statutory Profit/(Loss) after tax attributable to AGL shareholders | 860         | (2,058)       |\n| Adjust for:                                                        |             |               |\n| Significant items after tax 1                                      | (486)       | 2,929         |\n| Profit on fair value of financial instruments after tax 2          | (149)       | (334)         |\n| Underlying Profit after tax                                        | 225         | 537           |\n| Earnings per share on Statutory Profit/(Loss)                      | 131.6 cents | (330.3) cents |\n| Earnings per share on Underlying Profit                            | 34.4 cents  | 86.2 cents    |\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) calculations have been based upon a weighted average number of ordinary shares of 653,324,767 (30 June 2021: 623,047,222). The weighted average number of ordinary shares was 30,277,545 higher than the prior year due to the underwriting of the FY21 final dividend and the FY22 interim dividend payments.",

This was partially offset by the reversal of a previously recognised impairment of AGL's investment in Tilt Renewables of $14 million ($10 million post tax).\n- \u00b7 Recognised $125 million pre-tax ($89 million post-tax) in separation costs related to the proposed demerger of AGL Australia.\n- \u00b7 Recognised $61 million pre-tax ($42 million post-tax) in costs related to redundancies and restructuring to deliver future cost reductions, and the integration of acquired businesses including completion of the SEGH Pty Limited and Epho Holdings Pty Limited integrations and Phase 2 of the integration of Southern Phone Company.\n- \u00b7 Recognised $20 million in other revenue related to AGL's sale of the purchase option to re-power 50% of the Macarthur Wind Farm following the completion of the existing lease in 2038.\n- \u00b7 Recognised $65 million pre-tax ($46 million post-tax) due to the reduction in rehabilitation provision for certain assets that had previously been impaired. The reduction in rehabilitation provision was driven by an increase in the discount rate following market changes in base rates. In addition to this the estimated closure date of Camden was revised impacting the timing of cash flows.\n\n## FY21\n\nDuring the year AGL:\n\n- \u00b7 Recognised a $1,931 million pre-tax ($1,348 million post-tax) onerous contract provision related to various out of the money renewable asset PPAs.\n- \u00b7 Recognised a pre-tax impairment of $1,817 million ($1,477 million post-tax) relating to the carrying value of the AGL Generation Fleet cashgenerating unit, including goodwill, inventories and natural gas assets including Newcastle Gas Storage Facility, Silver Springs and Camden.\n- \u00b7 Recognised pre-tax $6 million ($4 million post-tax) in separation costs related to the proposed demerger.\n- \u00b7 Acquired 100% of the outstanding share capital of Click Energy Holdings Pty Ltd, SEGH Pty Limited, Epho Holdings Pty Limited and 51% of the outstanding share capital of Ovo Energy Pty Limited. As a result of these acquisitions, and other growth projects, AGL incurred pre-tax $60 million of acquisition, integration, and other project costs combined with redundancy costs to deliver cost reduction initiatives ($45 million post-tax).\n- \u00b7 Recognised $55 million in contract termination payments related to the cancelled LNG import jetty at Crib Point. This was treated as a non-temporary capital loss.\n\n## 4.1.3 Movement in fair value of financial instruments recognised in Profit or Loss\n\nMovement in the fair value of financial instruments recognised in profit or loss (excluded from Underlying Profit) was $212 million ($149 million post-tax), down $265 million ($185 million post-tax). The net gain in the fair value of energy-related derivatives of $213 million reflected a positive fair value movement in net buy oil & gas derivative contract positions as a result of higher forward prices. Net movements on electricity derivative contracts were minimal during the year due to the offsetting nature of the buy and sell contract portfolio. The treasury related fair value movement of $(1) million recognised in profit or loss reflected hedge ineffectiveness mainly driven by credit adjustment and amortisation of the deals de-designated.\n\n|",

Refer to Note 1- Segment information within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n\n## 4.1.5 Group financial performance\n\nUnderlying Profit after tax attributable to AGL shareholders was $225 million, down 58.1%. The principal drivers of the decrease were lower Trading and Origination electricity gross margin due to lower realised contracted and wholesale customer prices, the recent AGL Loy Yang Unit 2 unplanned outage, lower gross margin across Customer Markets due to margin compression driven by customers swapping to lower priced products and higher cost of energy associated with increased solar volumes, and the absence of AGL Loy Yang Unit 2 insurance proceeds recognised in the prior year. This was partly offset by increased generation at AGL Macquarie combined with decreased labour and maintenance costs as a result of operational efficiencies, organisational restructuring, and non-recurrence of COVID-19 response costs and cost out initiatives across business units. FY22 also benefited from non-recurring labour vacancies and employee provision movements.\n\n|                                                              | FY22 $m   | FY21 $m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Revenue                                                      | 13,221    | 10,942    |\n| Cost of sales                                                | (10,532)  | (7,788)   |\n| Other income                                                 | 25        | 131       |\n| Gross margin                                                 | 2,714     | 3,285     |\n| Operating costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation)    | (1,496)   | (1,619)   |\n| Underlying EBITDA                                            | 1,218     | 1,666     |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                                | (717)     | (707)     |\n| Underlying EBIT                                              | 501       | 959       |\n| Net finance costs                                            | (217)     | (224)     |\n| Underlying Profit before tax                                 | 284       | 735       |\n| Income tax expense                                           | (66)      | (199)     |\n| Underlying Profit after tax                                  | 218       | 536       |\n| Non-controlling interests 1                                  | 7         | 1         |\n| Underlying Profit after tax attributable to AGL shareholders | 225       | 537       |\n\nRefer to Section 5 for further analysis on the movement in gross margin for each operating segment and Section 3.1.6 for commentary on group operating costs.",

        "page_content": "## Operating & Financial Review\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2022\n\nDepreciation and amortisation of $(717) million was up 1.4%, driven by the impact of accelerated closure dates of Bayswater Power Station and AGL Loy Yang, the capitalisation of multi-product retailer assets and the acquisition of Energy 360, AGL's capitalisation of IT transformation costs and the full year impact of the prior year increase in environmental rehabilitation assets and the Solgen and Epho acquisitions. This was partly offset by the impact of the impairments recognised during the prior year across the coal generation fleet and other gas assets.\n\nNet finance costs were $(217) million, down 3.1% largely driven by lower BBSW rates on facilities partly offset by higher onerous contracts and rehabilitation provision interest due to increased reference base rates.\n\nThe underlying effective tax rate was 23.2%, primarily due to prior year adjustments including research and development benefits.\n\n## 4.2 Cash flow\n\n## 4.2.1 Reconciliation of Underlying EBITDA to cash movement\n\nOperating cash flow before significant items, interest and tax was $1,498 million, down $108 million.

Working capital movements were $404 million, compared with $36 million in the prior year. Components of working capital movement were:\n\n- \u00b7 Receivables cash flow of $(330) million reflected the $(197) million increase in the AEMO security and deposit requirement driven by high electricity prices across May & June, higher wholesale revenue and favourable oil and LNG mark to market movements and the recognition of a receivable related to recovery of life to date mine rehabilitation costs.\n- \u00b7 Payables cash flow of $460 million reflected the impact of high electricity prices across May and June on net derivative and AEMO balances, combined with increased market purchases and higher oil and LNG prices on gas supply agreements.\n- \u00b7 Inventory cash flow of $49 million reflected the combination of higher net withdrawals from Silver Springs and Newcastle Gas Storage Facility, lower gas inventory as a result of increased generation, partly offset by increased solar inventory related to Solgen and Epho and higher inventory held in preparation for planned outages at Bayswater Power Station.\n- \u00b7 Financial assets (margin calls) cash flow of $180 million reflected a roll-off of in the money FY22 derivative positions due to an increase in the forward curve on a open position.\n- \u00b7 Green assets and liabilities cash flow of $70 million reflected a reduction of SREC certificates. The prior year reflected higher certificate purchases in response to anticipated increases in scheme compliance percentages.\n\n|",

        "page_content": "## Operating & Financial Review\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2022\n\nThe onerous contracts cash flow of $(158) million reflected the onerous portion of payments made to suppliers under legacy wind farm offtake agreements and Yabulu PPA and Gas Transport Agreements (GTAs), previously recognised as onerous. The prior year cash flow of $(80) million reflects the onerous portion of payments related to legacy wind farm agreements recognised part way through the prior year and Yabulu PPA and GTAs.\n\nThe movement in other assets/liabilities of $43 million related to unearned revenue and employee provisions, partly offset by payments for rehabilitation works. The prior year cash flow of $(30) million largely related to payments for rehabilitation works.\n\nCash tax paid during FY22 was lower than FY21, in line with lower profit before tax and utilisation of prior year tax losses.\n\nInvesting cash flow of $(885) million reflected capital expenditure, the acquisition of Tilt Renewables, and the sale of investments in Energy Impact Partners' Fund, Activate Capital Partners, and Ecobee Inc. The prior year Investing cash flow of $(937) million reflected capital expenditure and the acquisitions of Click Energy, Solgen and Epho. For further details on capital expenditure, see Section 3.1.6.\n\nFinancing cash flow of $(303) million reflected the net repayment of borrowings with $(317) million of dividend payments offset by $317 million proceeds from the issue of shares related to the fully underwritten dividend and DRP. The prior year cash flow of $(366) million included dividend payments of $(573) million and a net borrowings drawdown of $212 million.\n\n## 4.3 Financial position\n\n## Summary Statement of Financial Position\n\nAt 30 June 2022 AGL's total assets were $19,270 million, an increase from $15,450 million at 30 June 2021, primarily due to a $3,661 million increase in energy derivatives and $1,253 million increase in trade receivables reflecting significant energy price increases affecting the closing balances. This was partly offset by a reduction in equity investments driven by the disposal of Activate Capital Partners and Energy Impact Partners' Fund and the impairment of the Newcastle Gas Storage Facility (refer to Section 4.1.2).\n\nTotal liabilities at 30 June 2022 were $12,753 million, an increase from $9,944 million at 30 June 2021, primarily reflecting a $3,466 million movement in energy derivatives and an increase in AEMO related trade payables, partly offset by a decrease in onerous contracts provisions and borrowings (refer to Section 4.1.2).\n\nTotal equity at 30 June 2022 was $6,517 million, up from $5,506 million, reflecting the Statutory Profit for the period and dividends paid. AGL's return on equity, calculated on a rolling 12-month basis was 3.7%, down from 30 June 2021.\n\n|                               | FY22 $m   | FY21 $m   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Assets                        |           |           |\n| Cash and cash equivalents     | 127       | 88        |\n| Other current assets          | 8,504     | 3,587     |\n| Property, plant and equipment | 6,013     | 6,283     |\n| Intangible assets             | 3,252     | 3,302     |\n| Other non-current assets      | 1,374     | 2,190     |\n| Total assets                  | 19,270    | 15,450    |\n| Liabilities                   |           |           |\n| Borrowings                    | 2,878     | 3,185     |\n| Other liabilities             | 9,875     | 6,759     |\n| Total liabilities             | 12,753    | 9,944     |\n| Net assets/total equity 1     | 6,517     | 5,506     |\n\n## 4.3.1 Movement in fair value of financial instruments\n\n## Approach to hedging\n\nAGL's approach to managing energy price risks, through physical ownership of energy generation, contracting for energy supply and financial hedging, reflects the need to provide pricing certainty to customers and limit exposure to adverse wholesale market outcomes. AGL generates electricity or has contracted gas supply in excess of its customers' demand in some states. In other states, AGL has sources of supply less than its customers' demand.\n\nAGL uses certain financial instruments (derivatives) to manage these energy price risks and to manage its exposure to interest and foreign exchange rates arising in the normal course of business, provided the overall AGL risk appetite is not exceeded. The majority of these financial instruments exchange a fixed price for a floating market-based price of a given commodity, interest rate, currency or a quoted asset, with the net differential being settled with the counterparty. AGL is exposed to price volatility on the sale and purchase of energy-related commodities in the normal course of business, and therefore enters into contracts that minimise the price risk to AGL on both sold and purchased forecast exposures.",

        "page_content": "## Operating & Financial Review\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2022\n\nAGL has in place a governance framework that establishes the policy guidelines under which energy hedging activities are conducted. Key components of that policy include segregation of duties, independent risk oversight, earnings-at-risk limits, compliance management and regular reporting to the Board. The risk policy represents the Board and Senior Management's commitment to an effective risk management function to ensure appropriate management and oversight of AGL's risks related to wholesale markets energy risk. The policy allows for commercial optimisation of the portfolio provided that AGL adheres to overall earnings-at-risk limits that reflect its risk appetite.\n\n## Energy price risk\n\nAGL's energy-related derivatives recognised in profit or loss include sell and buy positions, where AGL receives or pays a fixed price from or to a counterparty in exchange for a floating price paid or received.\n\nAGL is required to make margin payments in respect of futures contracts traded through the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Initial margin call payments are made at the time contracts are entered in order to manage intra-day credit exposure. The quantum of initial margin depends on the volume traded, the expected market volatility as well as forward electricity prices at the time. The initial margin call can move subsequently as forward prices move. AGL also receives or makes payments known as variation margin calls, which cover mark to market movements of AGL's open futures position. These typically reverse through future earnings as contract positions roll off.\n\n## Treasury related risk\n\nAGL's treasury related risk primarily relates to interest and foreign currency rate fluctuations. Contracts to minimise the exposure to market-based fluctuations are executed pursuant to AGL's treasury risk management policy. These contracts primarily result in fixed interest and foreign currency rates. These contracts are designated in hedge relationships when they can be matched to forecast transactions with sufficient probability of the forecast transaction occurring.\n\nIn addition to the above, AGL is counterparty to cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements to convert its fixed interest rate US dollar private placement borrowing instruments to floating interest rate Australian dollar equivalent borrowing instruments. The cross-currency interest rate swap arrangements are designated as fair value and cash flow hedge relationships.\n\n## Movement in fair value\n\nA movement in the fair value of financial instruments of $373 million compared with $367 million in the prior year. The net gain reflected a positive fair value movement in AGL's net buy oil & gas derivative contract position as a result of higher forward prices. Electricity sell and buy derivative contracts largely offset each other resulting in a relatively flat position.\n\nThe initial fair value of a derivative is the consideration paid or received (the premium). Fair value movements in any given period are a function of changes to underlying indices, market prices or currencies and the roll-off of realised contractual volumes or amounts. A reconciliation of the movements in financial instruments carried at fair value for FY22 is presented in the following table.\n\n| Net assets/(liabilities)                                   | FY22 $m   | FY21 $m   | Change $m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|\n| Energy derivative contracts                                | 937       | 711       | 226         |\n| Cross currency and interest rate swap derivative contracts | 219       | 72        | 147         |\n| Total net assets for financial instruments                 | 1,156     | 783       | 373         |\n| Change in net assets                                       | 373       |           |             |\n| Premiums paid                                              | (56)      |           |             |\n| Premium roll off                                           | 43        |           |             |\n| Equity accounted fair value                                | (72)      |           |             |\n| Total change in fair value                                 | 288       |           |             |\n| Recognised in equity hedge and other reserve               | 149       |           |             |\n| Recognised in borrowings                                   | (14)      |           |             |\n| Recognised in profit or loss - pre-tax                     | 153       |           |             |\n| Total change in fair value                                 | 288       |           |             |\n\n|",

The net gain reflected a positive fair value movement in net buy oil and gas derivative contract positions as a result of higher forward prices. Net movements on electricity derivative contracts were minimal during the year due to the offsetting nature of the buy and sell contract portfolio.\n- \u00b7 A currency related fair value loss of $(14) million recognised in borrowings was due to depreciation of the AUD/USD foreign exchange rate and an increase of AUD yield curve. The $157 million movement in hedge reserve was largely driven by an increase in the forward curve.\n\n## 4.3.2 Net Debt Reconciliation\n\nNet debt at 30 June 2022 was $2,662 million, down from $2,997 million at 30 June 2021 due to debt facility repayments driven predominately by favourable creditor closing balances on the high May and June energy prices.\n\nAGL's gearing (measured as the ratio of net debt to net debt plus adjusted equity) at 30 June 2022 was 29.2% compared with 35.1% at 30 June 2021.\n\nAGL maintained its credit rating of Baa2 (negative outlook) throughout the period as provided by Moody's Investors Service. Key metrics consistent with this credit rating at 30 June 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 Interest cover: 9.8 times\n- \u00b7 Funds from operations to net debt: 32.3%\n\nAGL's funds from operations has been calculated with a similar methodology to Moody's whereby the movement in all current and non-current tax assets and liabilities is treated as working capital.\n\n|                                                                              | FY22 $m   | FY21 $m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Net debt reconciliation                                                      |           |           |\n| Borrowings                                                                   | 2,878     | 3,185     |\n| Less: Adjustment for cross currency swap hedges and deferred borrowing costs | (89)      | (100)     |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                                    | (127)     | (88)      |\n| Net debt                                                                     | 2,662     | 2,997     |",

Segmental Analysis\n\nAGL manages its business in three key operating segments: Customer Markets, Integrated Energy and Investments. Further detail on the activities of each operating segment is provided below.\n\nAGL manages and reports a number of expense items including Information Technology under Centrally Managed Expenses. These costs are not reallocated to AGL's operating segments because their management is the responsibility of various corporate functions.\n\nA reconciliation of segment results and Underlying Profit after tax is provided in the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 Segment information.\n\n## 5.1 Customer Markets\n\nCustomer Markets comprises the Consumer and Large Business customer portfolios responsible for the retailing of electricity, gas, broadband/ mobile/voice, solar and energy efficiency products and services to residential, small and large business customers. Customer Markets sources its energy from Integrated Energy at a transfer price based on methodologies that reflect the prevailing wholesale market conditions and other energy costs in each state. Customer Markets also includes sales, marketing, brand, and AGL's customer contact and call centre operations.\n\n## 5.1.1 Underlying EBIT\n\nCustomer Markets Underlying EBIT was $181 million, down 10.8% due to lower gross margin across Consumer, Large Business and Perth Energy Portfolios, partially offset by lower operating costs. The decrease in Consumer gross margin was due to milder weather, higher cost of energy associated with increased solar volumes, and margin compression due to customers swapping to lower-priced products. Perth Energy margin was impacted by higher wholesale costs and capacity charges that were previously recognised under Integrated Energy, and Large Business margin was lower due to heightened market activity.\n\n|                                                           | FY22 $m   | FY21 $m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Consumer Electricity gross margin                         | 471       | 500       |\n| Consumer Gas gross margin                                 | 259       | 264       |\n| Large Business Electricity gross margin                   | 33        | 34        |\n| Large Business Gas gross margin                           | 8         | 10        |\n| Fees, charges and other gross margin                      | 12        | 13        |\n| Telecommunications gross margin                           | 11        | 9         |\n| Perth Energy gross margin                                 | 2         | 14        |\n| Sustainable Business Energy Solutions gross margin        | 15        | 10        |\n| Gross margin                                              | 811       | 854       |\n| Operating costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation) | (491) 1   | (517)     |\n| Underlying EBITDA                                         | 320       | 337       |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                             | (139)     | (134)     |\n| Underlying EBIT                                           | 181       | 203       |\n\n- \u00b7 Consumer Electricity gross margin was $471 million, down 5.8%, driven by lower average demand due to milder weather, higher cost of energy associated with higher solar volumes, and margin compression due to customers swapping to lower-priced products.\n- \u00b7 Consumer Gas gross margin was $259 million, down 1.9%, driven by lower average demand due to milder weather, and margin compression due to customers swapping to lower-priced products.\n- \u00b7 Large Business Electricity gross margin was $33 million, broadly flat compared with prior year.\n- \u00b7 Large Business Gas gross margin was $8 million, down 20.0% driven by increased competition.\n- \u00b7 Fees, charges and other gross margin was $12 million, down 7.7%, due to the impacts of COVID-19 on movers resulting in lower real estate non energy revenue.\n- \u00b7 Telecommunication gross margin was $11 million, up 22.2%, driven by growth in the customer base since the launch of AGL Telecommunications in the prior year, partially offset by increased costs associated with investment in network upgrades to support continued customer growth.\n- \u00b7 Perth Energy gross margin was $2 million, down 85.7%, driven by power station capacity charges, which were reflected in Integrated Energy in the prior year, as well as margin compression as a result of higher wholesale costs with limitations to hedge in the first half of the year as a result of the forced outage at Kwinana Swift Power Station. This was partly offset by higher retail volumes.\n\n|",

SBES includes the sales of solar engineering, procurement, construction, asset maintenance services and distribution sales of wholesale solar components. Energy 360 was acquired by AGL in April 2022 and includes the sale of biogas plants for commercial and industrial customers. SBES gross margin was $15 million, up 50%, predominately due to the full year benefit following acquisition of Solgen and Epho.\n- \u00b7 Depreciation and amortisation was $(139) million, up 3.7% driven by an uplift of depreciation from the capitalisation of multi-product retailer assets and the acquisitions of Solgen, Epho and Energy 360.\n\n## 5.1.2 Operating costs\n\nCustomer Markets operating costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation) were $(491) million, down 5.0%, primarily due to a decrease in net bad debt expense following heightened repayment risk in the prior year and a reduction in campaigns and advertising spend due to cost reductions achieved through digital and marketing campaign efficiencies. This was partially offset by incremental opex following the acquisitions of Solgen, Epho and Energy 360, and operating costs associated with the growth of AGL Telecommunications and the Retail Next Program.\n\n|                                                           | FY22 $m   | FY21 $m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Labour and contractor services                            | (215)     | (191)     |\n| Net bad debt expense                                      | (80)      | (127)     |\n| Campaigns and advertising                                 | (88)      | (98)      |\n| Other expenditure                                         | (108)     | (101)     |\n| Operating costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation) | (491) 1   | (517)     |\n| Add: depreciation and amortisation                        | (139)     | (134)     |\n| Operating costs (including depreciation and amortisation) | (630)     | (651)     |\n\n- 1. Includes $7 million Future Business operating costs, previously recognised in Centrally Managed Expenses.\n- \u00b7 Labour and contractor services costs was $(215) million, up 12.6% driven by the acquisitions of Click Energy, Solgen, Epho and Energy 360, the growth of AGL Telecommunications, Future Business costs integrated into Customer Markets (previously recognised in Centrally Managed Expenses) and the Retail Next Program. Excluding the impact of Solgen, Epho and Energy 360, Future Business, growth of AGL Telecommunications and the Retail Next program, labour and contractor services costs were $(177) million, down 1.1% from prior year.\n- \u00b7 Net bad debt expense was $(80) million, down 37.0% due to the reduction of repayment risk following the impact of COVID-19 in the prior year, strong collections performance, increased bad debt recoveries, and non-continuation of discounted settlements for impacted small business and large business customers in the prior year. Excluding the impact of the COVID-19 from the prior year, net bad debt expense was down 18.4% due to strong collection performance and higher bad debt recoveries.\n- \u00b7 Campaigns and advertising costs were $(88) million, down 10.2% due to cost reductions achieved through digital and marketing campaign efficiencies.\n- \u00b7 Other expenditure was $(108) million, up 6.9%, due to the full year impact following the acquisition of Solgen and Epho, the transfer of Future Business operating costs from Centrally Managed Expenses, growth of AGL Telecommunications and the Retail Next program.\n\n## 5.1.3 Consumer profitability and operating efficiency\n\nNet operating costs per consumer service was $(99), down 8.3% compared with the prior year due to improved net bad debt recoveries and lower campaign and advertising spend offsetting the increase in AGL Telecommunications operational costs due to its launch in November 2020. The continued focus on digital efficiencies (lower marketing, advertising and loyalty spend) in energy services have been partly offset by the increase in operating costs associated with the strong organic growth in telecommunications services.\n\n|                                                     | FY22   | FY21   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Gross margin ($m)                                   | 741    | 773    |\n| Net operating costs ($m) 1                          | (415)  | (444)  |\n| EBITDA ($m)                                         | 326    | 329    |\n| Average consumer services ('000)                    | 4,184  | 4,121  |\n| Gross margin per consumer service ($)               | 177    | 188    |\n| Net operating costs per consumer service ($)        | (99)   | (108)  |\n| EBITDA per consumer service ($)                     | 78     | 80     |\n| Net operating costs as a percentage of gross margin | 56.0%  | 57.4%  |\n\nAverage consumer services increased compared with the prior year largely due to growth in Telecommunications services offsetting the decline in energy services from prior year.",

        "page_content": "## Operating & Financial Review\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2022\n\nGross margin per consumer service decreased compared with prior year driven by lower average demand in the consumer portfolio due to milder weather, higher cost of energy associated with higher solar volumes, margin compression due to customers swapping to lower-priced products, and growth in AGL Telecommunications services with associated lower margin relative to energy services.\n\n## 5.2 Integrated Energy\n\nThe Trading and Origination components of Integrated Energy are responsible for managing the price risk associated with procuring electricity and gas for AGL's customers and for managing AGL's obligations in relation to renewable energy schemes. They also control the dispatch of AGL's owned and contracted generation assets and associated portfolio of energy hedging products.\n\n- \u00b7 Trading and Origination - Electricity reflects the procurement of key fuel inputs and hedging of AGL's wholesale electricity requirements, and also includes Eco Markets, which reflects the management of AGL's liabilities relating to both voluntary and mandatory renewable and energy efficiency schemes.\n- \u00b7 Trading and Origination - Gas reflects the sourcing and management of AGL's gas supply and transportation portfolio. Trading and Origination - Gas is also responsible for the management of the price exposures related to AGL's oil-linked wholesale gas contracts.\n- \u00b7 Trading and Origination - Other reflects the Trading and Origination resourcing and support, in addition the Decentralised Energy Resources business responsible for the management of other growth initiatives in AGL's orchestration pathway.\n\nThe other components of Integrated Energy comprises AGL's power generation portfolio and other key sites and operating facilities across the Coal, Gas Generation, Renewables, Natural Gas, and Other business units.\n\n- \u00b7 Coal primarily comprises AGL Macquarie (Bayswater and Liddell power stations) and AGL Loy Yang.\n- \u00b7 Gas Generation primarily comprises AGL Torrens, Barker Inlet Power Station, Kwinana Swift Power Station and Somerton Power Station.\n- \u00b7 Renewables primarily comprises hydroelectric power stations, the operation of solar power as well as wind power generation. Operational costs to maintain the wind farms are reported within Trading and Origination - Electricity to align with the gross margin of the related power purchase agreements.\n- \u00b7 Natural Gas includes the Silver Springs underground gas storage and production facility, the natural gas compression and LPG separation facility, the natural gas production assets at Camden in New South Wales, the Newcastle Gas Storage Facility which was classified as held for sale for the duration of the current financial year and subsequently impaired as at 30 June 2022, and the North Queensland gas assets, including the Moranbah Gas Project.\n- \u00b7 Other primarily consists of the Energy Hubs business focused on the development and construction of greenfield growth opportunities, and technical and business support functions.\n\nRefer to the map in Section 1.1 for asset locations and details.\n\n## 5.2.1 Underlying EBIT\n\nIntegrated Energy Underlying EBIT was $643 million, down $476 million or 42.5% largely due to lower gross margin from Trading and Origination - Electricity. This was partly offset by reduced operating costs including a reduction in depreciation and amortisation.\n\n|                                                           | FY22 $m   | FY21 $m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Gross margin                                              | 1,871     | 2,420     |\n| Operating costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation) | (725)     | (790)     |\n| Underlying EBITDA                                         | 1,146     | 1,630     |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                             | (503)     | (511)     |\n| Underlying EBIT                                           | 643       | 1,119     |\n\nGross margin was down largely due to the impact of lower realised contracted and customer prices, unplanned outages on availability at Loy Yang and the non-recurrence of $125 million of Loy Yang Unit 2 insurance proceeds recognised in the prior year, of which $120 million was recognised in gross margin and $5 million in operating costs. This was partly offset by increased generation at AGL Macquarie and higher gas revenue rates for customers.\n\nOperating costs (excluding depreciation and amortisation) were $725 million, a decrease of $65 million compared with the prior year due to decreased labour and maintenance costs as a result of operational efficiencies and organisational restructuring, lower maintenance resulting from the AGL Torrens A station closure, lower Liddell expenditure following closure of one unit in April 2022, lower turbine repair costs at the Kwinana Swift Power Station and reduced insurance premiums.

The decrease in gross margin was driven by lower contracted prices and customer prices, lower generation at Loy Yang driven partly by the recent Loy Yang Unit 2 unplanned outage, and the absence of Loy Yang Unit 2 insurance proceeds recognised in the prior year. This was partly offset by higher generation at AGL Macquarie during the first three quarters and a favourable contracted position in QLD at high prices.\n- \u00b7 Trading and Origination - Gas gross margin was $239 million, down 0.8%, driven by higher supply cost and lower volumes largely offset by higher rates for customers. Consumer customer volumes were 1.8 PJ lower as per commentary in 3.1.2. The impact of lower cost legacy supply contracts maturing compressed gas customer margins which was partly offset by higher margin gas market sales.\n- \u00b7 Trading and Origination - Other Underlying EBITDA was $(40) million, up 11.1% mainly due to expansion of the Decentralised Energy Resources business to develop future growth opportunities.\n- \u00b7 Coal Underlying EBITDA was $(406) million, up 6.9%, driven by lower Liddell expenditure following closure of one unit in April 2022, higher Loy Yang cost recovery, decreased labour and maintenance costs as a result of operational efficiencies and organisational restructuring, and non-recurrence of COVID-19 response costs. This was partly offset by the absence of AGL Loy Yang Unit 2 insurance proceeds for material damages received in the prior year of $22 million and increased labour costs due to Enterprise Agreement wage escalations.\n- \u00b7 Gas Generation Underlying EBITDA was $(43) million, up 27.1%, predominantly driven by lower operating costs resulting from the closure of two A station units at AGL Torrens in September 2020, a Kwinana Swift Power Station capacity charge to Customer Markets, and lower Kwinana Swift Power Station turbine repair costs.\n- \u00b7 Renewables Underlying EBITDA was $(18) million, up 25.0% due to the non-recurrence of the commercial settlement of a historic legal dispute.\n- \u00b7 Natural Gas Underlying EBITDA was up $7 million driven by an increase in Silver Springs oil and gas sales predominantly due to higher prices, and lower field development costs relating to the Moranbah Gas Project joint venture.\n- \u00b7 Other Underlying EBITDA was $(41) million, up 24.1%, predominantly driven by cost efficiencies decreasing insurance premiums, technical support costs and discretionary spend.",

Portfolio Review Summary\n\nThe portfolio review for the Electricity (Section 6.2) and Gas (Section 6.3) businesses outlines the margin achieved for each of AGL's portfolios across operating segments, and demonstrates how value is generated within each business. The portfolio reviews in Section 6.2 and 6.3 start with volume information before summarising external customer revenue, customer network and other costs, fuel and gas costs net of hedging, and costs of managing and maintaining owned and contracted generation assets, to arrive at a portfolio's margin. A per unit rate ($/MWh for electricity and $/GJ for gas) is derived from each category of revenue and cost using the relevant associated volumes.\n\nThe tables in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 should be read in conjunction with Section 6.4 to reconcile the segmental revenue and costs allocated to each portfolio with Group Underlying EBIT.\n\n## 6.1 Portfolio Review Summary to Underlying Profit after Tax\n\n|                                                              | FY22 $m   | FY21 $m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Electricity Portfolio                                        |           |           |\n| Total revenue                                                | 6,614     | 6,934     |\n| Customer network, green compliance, and other cost of sales  | (3,447)   | (3,461)   |\n| Fuel costs                                                   | (852)     | (857)     |\n| Generation running costs                                     | (669)     | (635)     |\n| Depreciation and amortisation                                | (471)     | (465)     |\n| Net portfolio management                                     | (155)     | 58        |\n| Electricity Portfolio Margin (a)                             | 1,020     | 1,574     |\n| Gas Portfolio                                                |           |           |\n| Total revenue                                                | 2,511     | 2,389     |\n| Customer network and other cost of sales                     | (556)     | (555)     |\n| Gas purchases                                                | (1,104)   | (967)     |\n| Haulage, storage and other                                   | (342)     | (347)     |\n| Gas Portfolio Margin                                         | 509       | 520       |\n| Natural Gas                                                  | (7)       | (36)      |\n| Gas Portfolio Margin (including Natural Gas) (b)             | 502       | 484       |\n| Other AGL                                                    |           |           |\n| Other margin 1                                               | 64        | 33        |\n| Customer Markets operating costs                             | (491)     | (517)     |\n| Integrated Energy other operating costs                      | (76)      | (90)      |\n| Investments operating costs                                  | (21)      | (2)       |\n| Centrally Managed Expenses operating costs                   | (259)     | (310)     |\n| Other depreciation and amortisation                          | (238)     | (213)     |\n| Net finance costs                                            | (217)     | (224)     |\n| Income tax expense                                           | (66)      | (199)     |\n| Total Other AGL (c)                                          | (1,304)   | (1,522)   |\n| Underlying Profit after Tax (a + b + c)                      | 218       | 536       |\n| Non-controlling interests 2                                  | 7         | 1         |\n| Underlying Profit after tax attributable to AGL shareholders | 225       | 537       |",

Pool generation revenue is a function of volume and pool prices, which are set by the real-time market in each state. In the NEM, the total volume demanded by AGL customers is then purchased from the pool according to the geographical profile of customer demand and is reported as pool purchase volumes and costs. Where AGL's customer demand volumes exceed pool generation volumes, the generation volume deficit needs to be purchased from the pool by AGL.\n\n|                                                                                  | FY22 GWh   | FY21 GWh   | Movement %   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|--------------|\n| Pool purchase volume to satisfy Consumer customers                               | 15,145     | 15,117     | 0.2%         |\n| Pool purchase volume to satisfy Large Business customers and Wholesale customers | 24,953     | 26,390     | (5.4)%       |\n| Pool purchase volume 1                                                           | 40,098     | 41,507     | (3.4)%       |\n| Add: Net generation volume surplus/(deficit)                                     | 657        | (370)      | (277.6)%     |\n| Pool generation volume                                                           | 40,755     | 41,137     | (0.9)%       |\n| Consumer customers sales                                                         | 14,371     | 14,608     | (1.6)%       |\n| Large Business customers sales                                                   | 10,543     | 10,207     | 3.3%         |\n| Wholesale customers sales                                                        | 14,042     | 15,752     | (10.9)%      |\n| Total customer sales volume                                                      | 38,956     | 40,567     | (4.0)%       |\n| Energy losses                                                                    | 1,142      | 940        | 21.5%        |\n| Pool purchase volume 1                                                           | 40,098     | 41,507     | (3.4)%       |\n\nRefer to Section 3.1.4 for commentary on generation volumes.\n\nRefer to Section 3.1.2 for commentary on customer energy demand.\n\n|                                | Portfolio Margin   | Portfolio Margin   | Per Unit   | Per Unit   | Volume Denomination   | Volume Denomination   |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------|------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Revenue                        | FY22 $m            | FY21 $m            | FY22 $/MWh | FY21 $/MWh | FY22 GWh              | FY21 GWh              |\n| Consumer customers             | 3,975              | 4,134              | 276.6      | 283.0      | 14,371                | 14,608                |\n| Large Business customers       | 1,539              | 1,597              | 146.0      | 156.5      | 10,543                | 10,207                |\n| Wholesale customers 1          | 985                | 1,108              | 70.1       | 70.3       | 14,042                | 15,752                |\n| Operations (ancillary revenue) | 115                | 95                 |            |            |                       |                       |\n| Total revenue                  | 6,614              | 6,934              | 169.8      | 170.9      | 38,956                | 40,567                |\n\nTotal revenue was $6,614 million, down 4.6%.\n\n- \u00b7 Revenue from Consumer customers was $3,975 million, down 3.8% due to lower volumes and impact of customers moving to lower-priced products compared to the prior year.\n- \u00b7 Large Business customer revenue was $1,539 million, down 3.6%, driven by lower east coast consumption as a result of COVID-19 and a decline in average revenue rates due to a decrease in wholesale costs in the east coast.\n- \u00b7 Wholesale customer revenue was $985 million, down 11.1%, largely driven by a decrease in volumes and prices sold to Wholesale customers in addition to a reduction in green certificates sold compared with the prior year at lower prices.\n- \u00b7 Operations revenue was $115 million, up 21.1% primarily driven by an internal Kwinana Swift Power Station capacity charge.

John held this position until he departed AGL on 30 June 2022. John's qualifications are a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Laws from the University of New South Wales and a Masters in Arts from the National University of Ireland (University College Dublin). John is also admitted as a Solicitor of the Supreme Court of New South Wales.\n\nMelinda Hunter was appointed as Company Secretary on 23 May 2017.

Melinda is admitted as a Solicitor of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and has been practising corporate law for over 20 years.\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe Directors have declared a final dividend of 10.0 cents per share, compared with 34.0 cents per share for the prior final dividend. The annual dividend for the year ended 30 June 2022 was 26.0 cents per share compared with 75.0 cents per share for the prior year. The final dividend will be 100% unfranked and will be paid on 27 September 2022. The record date to determine shareholders' entitlements to the final dividend is 2 September 2022. Shares will commence trading ex-dividend on 1 September 2022.\n\nThe following dividends have been paid or declared by the Directors since 30 June 2021:\n\n| Final dividend of 34.0 cents per share (100% unfranked) paid on 29 September 2021    | $212 million   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Interim dividend of 16.0 cents per share (100% unfranked) paid on 30 March 2022      | $105 million   |\n| Final dividend of 10.0 cents per share (100% unfranked) payable on 27 September 2022 | $67 million    |\n\nAGL targets a payout ratio of approximately 75% of Underlying Profit after tax. Before declaring each dividend the Directors satisfied themselves that:\n\n- \u00b7 AGL's assets exceeded its liabilities immediately before declaring the dividend and the excess was sufficient for the payment of the dividend;\n- \u00b7 the payment of the dividend was fair and reasonable to AGL's shareholders as a whole; and\n- \u00b7 the payment of the dividend would not materially prejudice AGL's ability to pay its creditors.\n\nGiven the status of the review of AGL's strategic direction, in order for AGL to manage its ongoing continuous disclosure obligations the Board has determined that the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) will not operate for the final FY22 dividend. It is the Board's intention to reinstate the DRP when circumstances allow.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2022\n\n## 8. Remuneration Report\n\nThis Remuneration Report forms part of the Directors' Report.\n\n## Message from the Chair of the People & Performance Committee\n\nDear fellow shareholders,\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Remuneration Report for AGL Energy Limited (AGL) and its consolidated entities for the year ended 30 June 2022 (FY22).\n\n## The year in review\n\nIn last year's letter I noted that FY21 was a challenging year for AGL. FY22 has been significantly more challenging. Despite a lower financial result as anticipated, our core underlying business remained resilient amidst very challenging market conditions, underscored by the strength of our low cost baseload generation position, large customer base and robust risk management framework.\n\nExecutives' short-term incentive (STI) outcomes continue to be measured against scorecards containing group and individual objectives. The Board's decision to withdraw the demerger proposal was a consideration in determining FY22 STI outcomes against their scorecards. The long-term incentive (LTI) metrics were changed for FY22 with the return on equity (ROE) objective removed and relative total shareholder return (TSR) increased to 75% and carbon transition metrics reduced to 25%. This reflects strong shareholder return alignment and a focus on the critical energy transition.\n\n## Linking FY22 remuneration outcomes to performance\n\nThe only executive to receive a fixed remuneration increase in FY22 was Damien Nicks, Chief Financial Officer, who had not received an increase since his appointment in 2019. Mr Nicks received an increase of 9.5% in September 2021, reflective of his experience and the inclusion of technology leadership in his role.\n\nThe STI scorecard outcomes for FY22 reflect mixed performance across financial and non-financial measures. In summary:\n\n- \u00b7 Underlying profit after tax was $225m, at threshold levels of original guidance. This outcome reflects ongoing energy sector challenges and the impact of earlier closure dates of AGL's coal fired power stations. Additionally the unexpected Loy Yang A Unit 2 outage negatively impacted this measure combined with the costs of market suspension and volatility during the month of June.\n- \u00b7 The targeted $150m operating expenditure (opex) savings were achieved in FY22.\n- \u00b7 A significant reduction in combined employee/contractor total injury frequency rate (TIFR) has been achieved and the serious impact and fatality potential metric was at target.\n- \u00b7 Strategic Net Promoter Score (NPS) increased to +6, a historical high score for AGL. Event NPS has remained stable. Telecommunications grew, with 50,000 services added, offsetting a 43,000 reduction in energy services, predominantly driven by anticipated churn related to Click Energy.\n- \u00b7 Our employee engagement score decreased from 62% in 2021 to 57%, reflective of the disruption over the past 12 months and the impact this has had on our people.\n\nLast year in undertaking a holistic review of the balanced scorecard the Board determined to adjust STI outcomes to zero for executives as financial thresholds were not met. This year we have again considered the overall outcomes particularly with regard to the factors outlined above. Using our discretion guidelines, the Board has determined no discretion should apply to FY22 STI outcomes.\n\nThis resulted in STI outcomes of 42.9% of maximum for the Managing Director & CEO and between 50.0-51.7% of maximum for other executives. The Board believes this provides a commensurate level of reward to executives who have navigated extreme uncertainty and market volatility.\n\nThe FY20 LTI bridging grant, implemented to bridge the extension of vesting periods from three years to four years, was tested at the end of FY22. The relative TSR and ROE hurdles were not met and therefore there will be no vesting. This is in line with the shareholder experience over the period of the grant.\n\nNon-Executive Director fees remained unchanged in FY22. The last fee change was in January 2020.\n\n## Transition remuneration arrangements\n\nThe Board prioritised continuity in leadership through the demerger preparation. To support this, special arrangements were put in place during FY22 for select key executives. Limited variable rewards in recent periods and the talent market implications of closed borders created a significantly heightened flight risk.\n\nWith the uncertainty created by the proposed demerger, Mr Nicks and Chief Operating Officer, Markus Brokhof, were provided with retention awards delivered as a combination of cash and equity over a 12 to 16 month period, respectively. This acknowledged their key roles in demerger planning, delivery and proposed ongoing leadership positions.\n\nFormer Chief Customer Officer and AGL Australia Managing Director & CEO-elect, Christine Corbett, carried substantial additional responsibility associated with establishing a new entity. The Board determined that a monthly CEO-elect allowance was appropriate. The allowance ceased at the time the demerger was withdrawn in May. Ms Corbett did not participate in any retention arrangement.\n\n## The year ahead\n\nIn FY23, the AGL remuneration framework remains consistent with prior years, driving performance while enabling transition and providing continuity. The Board will, as always, review and monitor remuneration structures and performance metrics to ensure they align with AGL's strategy. This is somewhat challenging given the outcomes of the review of our strategic direction are not yet determined. AGL will have a refreshed Board and management team continuing the objective of delivering long-term shareholder value creation in the context of Australia's energy transition.\n\nWe welcome your feedback on the remuneration practices and disclosures for AGL and look forward to your support at our 2022 AGM.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDiane Smith Gander AO\n\nChair, People & Performance Committee\n\n|",

Any changes to the framework will not come into effect until FY24.\n\n## 8.3 FY22 performance and executive remuneration outcomes\n\n## 8.3.1 Fixed remuneration approach and FY22 outcomes\n\n## What is the purpose of fixed remuneration?\n\n- \u00b7 The purpose of establishing fixed remuneration is to attract and retain the right person for the job to lead AGL in tackling the challenges confronting the energy industry.\n- \u00b7 Fixed remuneration at AGL therefore needs to be competitive to ensure the company can attract and retain those executives with experience in companies or industries undergoing similar transformation.\n\n## How is fixed remuneration established?\n\n- \u00b7 Fixed remuneration is determined by considering market benchmarks in peer companies.\n- \u00b7 AGL's approach is to set an executive's fixed remuneration initially at a level reflecting their skill and experience that allows progressive increases to apply as the executive performs and becomes more experienced in their role.\n- \u00b7 Fixed remuneration is reviewed annually in the context of market positioning and performance. This may or may not result in an increase for executives.\n\n## What were the changes to fixed remuneration in FY22?\n\n- \u00b7 The fixed remuneration for Damien Nicks, Chief Financial Officer, was increased by 9.5% to $775,000 effective 1 September 2021. Mr Nicks' fixed remuneration was initially established at a level to reflect his developing experience. Mr Nicks had not received any increase since commencement in the role in May 2019. In line with the approach outlined above, and the transition of technology to his role, Mr Nicks' fixed remuneration was increased during FY22 to reflect his relative experience and provide alignment with market benchmarks.\n- \u00b7 No other changes were made to executives' fixed remuneration levels during FY22.\n\n## Are there any other considerations in setting fixed remuneration?\n\n- \u00b7 AGL is committed to gender pay equity across employees, including executives. There are no gender pay gaps in fixed remuneration for current executives in roles of equivalent size.",

Cost reduction through the delivery of operating expenditure (opex) targets is also included for FY22.\n- \u00b7 The group strategic measures are focused on safety, customer and employee engagement and are aligned with the Business Value Drivers.\n- \u00b7 Individual strategic objectives focus on key initiatives to drive the overall AGL purpose. This is aligned with the delivery of value creation for shareholders.\n\n## How are performance targets established?\n\n- \u00b7 Annual performance targets are determined with reference to a number of inputs: the previous year's performance outcomes, external market conditions, and longer-term business forecasts. Performance targets are set at levels which are considered to be a \"stretch\" in the context of these inputs, stretched beyond business as usual performance standards.\n- \u00b7 The STI target range for net profit after tax is established early in the financial year based on AGL's budget and the perceived degree of difficulty in that budget based on internal forecasts and prevailing market conditions at that time.\n- \u00b7 AGL's budget may not reflect the market guidance range. Guidance is generally released at the time of AGL's results in August and may change during the year. Guidance provides one input into determining the STI target and can have a broader range than incentive targets.\n\n## What is the FY22 award opportunity?\n\n- \u00b7 The opportunities for STI awards, as a % of fixed remuneration, are as follows:\n\n## MD & CEO :\n\n## Other executives:\n\nTarget = 44%\n\nMaximum = 67%\n\nTarget = 70%\n\nMaximum = 84%\n\n## How does the Board assess performance?\n\n- \u00b7 In assessing outcomes under the STI, the Board assess the quality of the results and the manner in which they were achieved as well as ensuring that those outcomes are aligned with the experience of AGL's shareholders.\n- \u00b7 The starting point for considering STI outcomes is Statutory Profit. The Board may adjust Statutory Profit in consideration of any non-cash fair value movements in financial instruments and non-recurring significant items that materially affect AGL's financial results to derive Underlying Profit after tax. This is to ensure that management are not unfairly advantaged or disadvantaged by items outside their control.\n- \u00b7 The Board expects an executive delivering against all performance objectives to achieve STI outcomes at their target levels given that performance targets are set at \"stretch\" levels.\n- \u00b7 The Board applies discretion in the treatment of any significant items and their impact on outcomes against performance targets and subsequent STI awards.\n\n## How are STI awards delivered?\n\n- \u00b7 Awards are delivered as a mix of cash and Restricted Shares (no performance conditions apply, restrictions lift after two years):\n\n## MD & CEO :\n\n## Other executives:\n\n50% cash\n\n50% Restricted Shares\n\n75% cash\n\n25% Restricted Shares\n\n- \u00b7 Although the remuneration framework provides for 50% deferral into Restricted Shares for the Managing Director & CEO, due to Mr Hunt's pending cessation of employment, his FY22 STI award will be delivered as 100% cash (no deferral component), consistent with past participants. The same approach is applicable for Ms Corbett.\n- \u00b7 Restricted Shares carry voting rights and are entitled to receive dividends.\n\n## What happens upon cessation of employment?\n\n- \u00b7 When an executive leaves the organisation prior to the STI payment date by way of resignation or dismissal for cause, the executive would not be eligible to receive any STI award for the relevant year.\n- \u00b7 Where the Board determines that an executive is a \"good leaver\" they may be entitled to a pro-rated award for the year. The grant and treatment of Restricted Shares is subject to Board discretion.",

This outcome reflects the ongoing energy sector challenges and the acceleration of depreciation implicit in the earlier closure dates of the Loy Yang A and Bayswater coal fired power stations in AGL's most recent Climate Commitments. Additionally the unexpected Loy Yang A Unit 2 outage, which is uninsured, negatively impacted this measure combined with the costs of market suspension and market volatility during the month of June. The targeted $150m opex savings were achieved in FY22.\n- \u00b7 Safety: total injury frequency rate was 2.1, down from 2.3 for FY21, a strong indicator that the ongoing focus on safety is helping to keep employees and contractors safe. The serious impact and fatality ratio was 2.8:1, an improvement from 2.7:1 for FY21.\n- \u00b7 Customer: the AGL Net Promoter Score (NPS) has continued the progress made in FY21 with an outcome of +6 up from +5 in FY21, the fourth consecutive year of improvement. AGL ranked #1 against tier 1 competitors in Victoria. Despite rising energy costs, event NPS, now measured on a rolling quarterly basis to align with strategic NPS, has remained stable at 22.2 compared to the same period in FY21.\n- \u00b7 Employee engagement: an engagement score of 57%, down from 62% in FY21, is reflective of the amount of change and disruption for employees over the past 12 months. It is also indicative of the unique position and path that the organisation is currently on.\n\nThe FY22 STI scorecard results in STI outcomes of between 42.9-51.7% of maximum for executives (excluding Ms Egan's STI outcome determined in accordance with her previous role). In FY21, the Board implemented discretion guidelines and applied it to adjust STI outcomes to zero for executives. For FY22, the Board considered the application of discretion in relation to performance outcomes, particularly with regard to exceeding the savings achieved in the cost out program, the impact of the updated Climate Commitments, the unexpected Loy Yang A Unit 2 outage and the costs of market suspension and impact of volatility in June. After detailed consideration, the Board determined that the outcomes appropriately reflect the company's performance and executive's contributions against the scorecard for the year.",

Relative TSR = 75% weighting. A comparative, external market performance benchmark against companies in the S&P/ASX100 Index. Provides a direct link between executive reward and shareholder return.\n- 2. Carbon transition metrics = 25% weighting. Provides the focus for executives to deliver against carbon transition objectives. Comprises three sub-metrics to ensure a balanced assessment.\n\nThe vesting schedules are provided below under FY22 offer - terms.\n\n## What is the performance period?\n\n- \u00b7 The performance metrics are measured either over a four-year period or at the end of the four-year period (1 July 2021 30 June 2025).\n- \u00b7 All performance measures are to be tested once at the end of the performance period to determine the vesting percentage.\n\n## What is the award opportunity?\n\n- \u00b7 The opportunities for LTI awards, as a % of fixed remuneration, are as follows:\n\n## MD & CEO:\n\n## Other executives:\n\nThreshold = 83.5%\n\nMaximum = 167%\n\nThreshold = 50%\n\nMaximum = 100%\n\n- \u00b7 The number of Performance Rights granted is based on a 30-day volume weighted average share price (VWAP) up to the commencement of the performance period.\n\n## How does the Board assess performance?\n\n- 1. Relative TSR: independent assessment of TSR by external advisors is undertaken, based on 30-day average VWAP, and provides the outcome for the Board to consider the final evaluation of performance.\n- 2. Carbon transition: internal calculations are undertaken and are subject to limited assurance by external auditors on an annual basis. Revenue from green electricity and carbon neutral products and services is derived from the reported revenue. The Board determines the final outcome.\n\n## How are the LTI awards delivered?\n\n- \u00b7 Awards are delivered in Performance Rights. Participants are not entitled to receive dividends.\n\n## What happens upon cessation of employment?\n\n- \u00b7 Unvested Performance Rights lapse if a participant ceases employment with AGL before the end of the performance period.\n- \u00b7 Where the Board determines that an executive is a \"good leaver\" they may be entitled to retain a pro-rated number of Performance Rights which remain subject to the plan rules until performance testing at the end of the performance period.\n\n|",

Similarly, the Chief Operating Officer, Mr Brokhof, was provided with a retention award of $450,000 in August 2021 to be paid in August 2022 as 50% cash and 50% equity. It was intended to provide the equity component as shares in the demerged entities but with the withdrawal of the demerger proposal, Restricted Shares in AGL will be provided in FY23.\n\nWith the announcement in June 2021 that Ms Corbett, the former Chief Customer Officer, was to be appointed as Managing Director & CEO of AGL Australia, the Board determined that a retention award was not required. However, to recognise the substantial additional responsibility associated with preparing for the proposed demerger and the establishment of a new entity, the Board determined that a monthly CEO-elect allowance of $35,714 (up to a maximum of $250,000) was to be paid in cash to Ms Corbett from December 2021 until the date that that the proposed demerger was to be effective in June 2022. As the demerger was withdrawn on 30 May 2022, the allowance ceased at that time.\n\nAmounts are disclosed in Table 8.5.1.1.\n\n## 8.3.5 Prior year awards - Restricted Shares\n\nFY20 Restricted Shares - STI Deferral\n\n## Table 8.3.5.1: FY20 STI Deferred Restricted Share awards outstanding (FY20 STI deferral)\n\nTable 8.3.5.3: FY21 Restricted Share awards outstanding at 30 June 2022\n\n| Executive 1   | Allocation date   | Number of awards allocated   | Value at allocation date $ 2   | Release date 3   |\n|---------------|-------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------|\n| Current       |                   |                              |                                |                  |\n| M Brokhof     | 25 August 2020    | 2,508                        | 38,938                         | 25 August 2022   |\n| D Nicks       | 25 August 2020    | 3,960                        | 61,482                         | 25 August 2022   |\n| Former        |                   |                              |                                |                  |\n| C Corbett     | 25 August 2020    | 9,783                        | 151,888                        | 25 August 2022   |\n\n## Table 8.3.5.2: FY20 STI Deferred Restricted Share awards released during FY22 (FY20 STI deferral)\n\n| Executive 1   | Allocation date   | Number of awards released   | Value at release date $ 2   | Release date 3   |\n|---------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------|\n| Current       |                   |                             |                             |                  |\n| D Nicks       | 25 August 2020    | 3,960                       | 27,443                      | 25 August 2021   |\n\n## FY21 Restricted Shares\n\nMr Hunt was appointed interim Managing Director & CEO in April 2021. At that time, to provide immediate shareholder alignment and in lieu of participation in any incentive plans, Restricted Shares valued at $600,000 were offered to Mr Hunt with the intention that Mr Hunt would remain in the role until the implementation of the proposed demerger. However, on his appointment to the Managing Director & CEO role on a permanent basis, the Board determined that it was appropriate for Mr Hunt to participate in AGL's incentive plans for FY22 to ensure his reward outcomes were determined by, and aligned to, company performance.\n\nTherefore, to ensure Mr Hunt was not receiving both Restricted Shares and be eligible for incentive awards for the same period, a pro-rata factor was applied to the value of the Restricted Shares to cover only the interim period from 22 April 2021 to 30 June 2021. The value of Restricted Shares was subsequently adjusted down to $165,354. Due to AGL's share trading blackout period between the end of the financial year and release of its full-year financial results, Mr Hunt's Restricted Shares were granted on 20 August 2021 with the restrictions to remain in place until 1 July 2022.\n\n| Executive   | Allocation date   | Number of awards allocated   | Value at allocation date $ 1   | Release date 2   |\n|-------------|-------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------|\n| Current     |                   |                              |                                |                  |\n| G Hunt      | 20 August 2021    | 17,975                       | 165,347                        | 1 July 2022 3    |\n\n|",

Arrangements are in place to ensure any advice is independent of management.\n- \u00b7 During FY22, the Committee engaged EY to act as independent remuneration advisers. EY did not provide any remuneration recommendations as defined in the Corporations Act 2001 to the People & Performance Committee during FY22.\n\n## Further details\n\n- \u00b7 The complete People & Performance Charter is reviewed at least every two years and is available on AGL's website: agl.com.au/BoardAndCommitteeCharters .\n\n## 8.4.2 Management of risk and remuneration\n\nThe AGL remuneration framework is designed to ensure that executives focus on delivering against the strategic objectives, ensuring that company and shareholder outcomes are primary considerations in the decision-making processes. The framework is structured to mitigate against any excessive risk-taking or short-term decisions by executives through the establishment of scorecard metrics that align with strategic objectives. The use of deferred equity in both the short and long-term incentive plans, and the clawback provisions within those equity plans also assists the company in managing risk.",

This discretion ensures that the quantum of executive remuneration is appropriate.\n- \u00b7 Discretion guidelines provide a framework to assist the Board with identifying one-off/extraordinary circumstances (e.g. impairments) and whether those circumstances require an adjustment to incentive outcomes. The guidelines support consistency in application over time and does not limit the Board's overarching discretion under AGL's incentive plans.\n\n## 8.4.4 KMP share ownership\n\nTo provide for shareholder alignment, AGL operates a minimum shareholding policy for KMP and other executives reporting to the Managing Director & CEO, subject to compliance with AGL's Securities Dealing Policy. Shareholdings are reported in Table 8.7.2.\n\nThe minimum shareholding policies stipulate the following requirements:\n\n|                         | Shareholding requirement   | Period to satisfy requirement                                                                                           |\n|-------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Non-Executive Directors | 100% of base annual fee    | Four years; 50% within two years of appointment; encouraged to hold 10% by the end of the financial year of appointment |\n| Executives              |                            |                                                                                                                         |\n| MD & CEO                | 100% of fixed remuneration | Up to five years from their initial appointment date to an eligible role                                                |\n| CFO                     | 75% of fixed remuneration  | Up to five years from their initial appointment date to an eligible role                                                |\n| Other executives        | 50% of fixed remuneration  | Up to five years from their initial appointment date to an eligible role                                                |\n\n|",

Represents cash salary and fees including any salary-sacrificed items (such as additional superannuation contributions and charitable donations) and unpaid annual leave.\n- 2. Represents cash payments under the STI achieved in the year (payable following the relevant financial year-end), excluding the Restricted Share portion (to be allocated following the relevant financial year-end). The Restricted Share portion is disclosed under the STI Restricted Shares column.\n- 3. Includes benefits such as, but not limited to, the provision of car parking, expatriate benefits and fringe benefits tax (FBT) on all benefits, where applicable. FBT included is in respect of the FBT year ended 31 March 2022.\n- 4. Includes other cash payments and benefits, such as allowances and retention payments.\n- 5. For members of the default employee superannuation fund, AGL funds the cost of Death and Permanent and Total Disablement insurance premiums. For Mr Brokhof, Mr Nicks and Ms Corbett, these premiums lifted them above the $25,000 concessional superannuation contributions cap for FY21 and generated an additional taxation liability. AGL paid an additional superannuation contribution to offset the impact of the excess concessional contributions tax generated in their superannuation fund.\n- 6. Includes the value of all STI Restricted Shares in relation to the performance year to be allocated following the financial year-end.\n- 7. Includes a proportion of the fair value of all outstanding LTI offers at the start of the year or offered during the year (including the LTI bridging grant). Under Australian Accounting Standards, the fair value is determined as at the offer date and is apportioned on a straight-line basis across the expected vesting period after adjusting at each reporting date for an estimation of the number of shares that will ultimately vest.\n- 8. Includes a proportion of the fair value of all Restricted Shares held at the start of the year, or which were granted during the year, generally for retention or sign-on purposes.\n- 9. Represents the sum of cash STIs and Performance Rights/Restricted Shares/other equity as a percentage of total remuneration, excluding termination payments.\n- 10. Includes leave accruals upon ceasing to be a KMP.\n- 11. Mr Brokhof's retention award, payable in August 2022, will be delivered as 50% cash and 50% Restricted Shares.\n- 12. The second tranche of Mr Nicks' retention award, payable in August 2022, will be delivered as 50% cash and 50% Restricted Shares.\n- 13. Ms Corbett received a monthly cash allowance from December 2021 to May 2022 to recognise the additional duties she was required to perform in respect of the proposed demerger.\n- 14. Ms Corbett ceased to be a KMP on 24 June 2022. She continues to be an employee. Amounts have been disclosed for KMP period only. All termination benefits will be provided in accordance with the terms of her employment contract and will be paid on cessation of employment.",

The fee pool is regularly reviewed by the Board and, if appropriate, adjusted (subject to shareholder approval), having regard to the anticipated time commitment, workload and responsibilities attached and the fees paid by comparable organisations. The current fee pool was approved by shareholders at the 2016 AGM.\n\n## 8.6.2 Fee policy\n\nNon-Executive Directors receive a base fee. Members of a Committee receive a Committee fee to recognise the associated higher workload and extra responsibilities, and chairing a Committee attracts a higher fee. The Chairman of the Board receives a higher base fee in recognition of the added responsibility and time commitment; but does not receive any extra fees for participating in or chairing any Committees. Fees are inclusive of superannuation. There are no additional fees in relation to the Nominations Committee.\n\nIn setting Non-Executive Directors' fees, the Board considers the following:\n\n- \u00b7 time commitment.\n- \u00b7 workload.\n- \u00b7 risk and responsibility.\n- \u00b7 market benchmark data, sourced from companies with a similar market capitalisation.\n\nTo ensure independence, Non-Executive Directors do not receive performance-related remuneration. This allows the Board to focus on governance and both short and long-term strategy.\n\n## 8.6.3 FY22 fees\n\nFees for Non-Executive Directors remained unchanged during the financial year.\n\n## Table 8.6.3.1: Non-Executive Director fees\n\nTable 8.6.3.2: Non-Executive Director remuneration for FY22\n\n| Board/Committee                                       | Chair fee $   | Member fee $   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------|\n| Board base fee                                        | 603,000       | 201,000        |\n| Audit & Risk Management Committee                     | 55,200        | 27,600         |\n| People & Performance Committee                        | 44,900        | 21,200         |\n| Safety, Customer & Corporate Responsibility Committee | 44,900        | 21,200         |\n\n| Non-Executive Director   | Year                           | Director fees $   | Superannuation $   | Total $   |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|-----------|\n| Current                  |                                |                   |                    |           |\n| P Botten                 | FY22                           | 579,432           | 23,568             | 603,000   |\n|                          | FY21                           | 291,607           | 21,261             | 312,868   |\n| M Bloom                  | FY22                           | 247,812           | 23,420             | 271,232   |\n|                          | FY21 (from 1 July 2020)        | 223,775           | 20,603             | 244,378   |\n| G Cockroft               | FY22 (from 1 January 2022)     | 119,228           | 3,736              | 122,964   |\n| P McKenzie               | FY22                           | 227,091           | 22,709             | 249,800   |\n|                          | FY21                           | 228,128           | 21,672             | 249,800   |\n| D Smith-Gander           | FY22                           | 261,208           | 5,892              | 267,100   |\n|                          | FY21                           | 261,676           | 5,424              | 267,100   |\n| V Sullivan               | FY22 (from 1 March 2022)       | 75,077            | 7,442              | 82,519    |\n| Former                   |                                |                   |                    |           |\n| J Hey                    | FY22 (until 30 May 2022)       | 229,104           | 21,604             | 250,708   |\n|                          | FY21                           | 251,806           | 21,694             | 273,500   |\n| J Stanhope               | FY22 (until 22 September 2021) | 59,191 1          | 5,456              | 64,647    |\n|                          | FY21                           | 255,706           | 21,694             | 277,400   |\n| G Hunt                   | FY21 (until 21 April 2021)     | 469,180           | 17,476             | 486,656   |\n| L Hosking                | FY21 (until 7 October 2020)    | 61,353            | 5,829              | 67,182    |\n| TOTAL                    | FY22                           | 1,798,143         | 113,827            | 1,911,970 |\n|                          | FY21                           | 2,043,231         | 135,653            | 2,178,884 |",

        "page_content": "## Other Required Disclosures\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2022\n\nThese Other Required Disclosures (pages 82 to 83) are attached to and form part of the Directors' Report.\n\n## 9. Other Required Disclosures\n\n## 9.1 Changes in state of affairs\n\nIn the opinion of the Directors there were no significant changes in the state of affairs of the AGL consolidated entity that occurred during the financial year other than those included in this Directors' Report.\n\n## 9.2 Proceedings on behalf of the company\n\nNo person has applied under Section 237 of the Corporations Act for leave of the Court to bring proceedings on behalf of AGL or intervene in any proceedings to which AGL is a party for the purpose of taking responsibility on behalf of AGL for all or any part of those proceedings. AGL was not a party to any such proceedings during the year.\n\n## 9.3 Commercial in confidence information\n\nFurther information about likely developments in the operations of AGL and its consolidated entity and the expected results of those operations in the future has been included in this Directors' Report except to the extent disclosure of the information would be likely to result in unreasonable prejudice to the consolidated entity.\n\nThe type of information not disclosed includes commercial in confidence information such as detailed operational plans and strategies that would provide third parties with a commercial advantage.\n\n## 9.4 Auditor and non-audit services\n\nNon-audit services have been provided during the year by the external auditor, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Australia ( Deloitte ). Disclosure of the details of these services can be found in Note 26 of the Financial Report 2022.\n\nThe Board has a formal policy on the provision of auditing and related services. Specifically, the external auditor is precluded from providing any services that might threaten its independence or conflict with its assurance and compliance role. Semi-annual reports on the provision of auditing and related services are provided to the Board through the Audit & Risk Management Committee. The Directors are satisfied that the provision of other accounting advice and services by the external auditor is compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors.\n\nThe policy and procedures in place, and the review by the Audit & Risk Management Committee, enable the Directors to conclude that non-audit services provided did not compromise the external auditor's independence requirements of the Corporations Act.\n\nThere is in place an agreed rotation policy for the senior auditor of Deloitte. Mr Jason Thorne (Partner, Deloitte) acted as AGL's lead audit partner from 2017 until the year ended 30 June 2022. Under the Corporations Act, Mr Thorne could only play a \"significant role in the audit\" of AGL for five successive financial years, unless the Board resolved to extend Mr Thorne's role as lead audit partner for a period of one (or two) years. In light of the complexity of the accounting and financial control environment over the year ending 30 June 2022 due to the proposed demerger and the need to maintain the quality of the audit over this period, in FY2021 the Board resolved to extend Mr Thorne's role as lead audit partner in accordance with\n\nthe Corporations Act. Mr Thorne was replaced as AGL's lead audit partner by Ms Harriet Fortescue (Partner, Deloitte) for the financial year beginning 1 July 2022.\n\nThe external auditor annually provides a letter to the Company Secretary on its independence within the meaning of relevant legislation and professional standards. No officers of AGL were partners or directors of Deloitte during this or prior periods.\n\n## 9.5 Rounding\n\nAGL is an entity to which ASIC Corporations Instrument 2016/191 applies and, in accordance with that Instrument, amounts in the Financial Report and this Directors' Report have been rounded to the nearest million dollars, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## 9.6 Auditor's Independence Declaration\n\nA copy of the external auditor's declaration under Section 307C of the Corporations Act in relation to the audit for the financial year is attached to the AGL Financial Report 2022.\n\n## 9.7 Indemnification and insurance of officers\n\nAGL's constitution indemnifies, to the extent permitted by law, officers of the consolidated entity when acting in their capacity in respect of:\n\n- \u00b7 liability to third parties (other than related entities) when acting in good faith; and\n- \u00b7 costs and expenses of successfully defending legal proceedings and ancillary matters.\n\nThe Directors named earlier in this Report and the Company Secretary have the benefit of the indemnity, together with any other person concerned in, or who takes part in, the management of the consolidated entity.\n\nDuring the year, AGL paid premiums in respect of contracts insuring all Directors of AGL as listed earlier, all Directors of related bodies corporate of AGL, secretaries and other Officers of the consolidated entity against liabilities incurred in their capacity as Director or Officer, as the case may be, of the consolidated entity.\n\nThe contract prohibits disclosure of the nature of the liabilities covered and the amount of premium.",

        "page_content": "## Other Required Disclosures\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2022\n\n## 9.8 Subsequent events\n\n## Board and management renewal\n\nAs announced on 30 May 2022, AGL is currently undertaking a Board and Management Renewal process, including a search process for a new Chair of the Board and Managing Director and CEO. The process is ongoing at the date of this report and AGL will make announcements to ASX once the roles are appointed.\n\n## Review of strategic direction\n\nAs announced on 30 May 2022, AGL is in the process of undertaking a review of strategic direction. The review will focus on four key areas, review of existing strategies, decarbonisation objectives, optimal energy mix and capital structure. Initial outcomes of the review are expected to be presented in late September 2022.\n\nApart from the matters identified above and in the financial statements or notes thereto, there has not been any other matter or circumstance that has arisen since the end of the financial year, that has significantly affected or may significantly affect the operations of AGL, the results of those operations, or the state of affairs of AGL in future financial periods.\n\n## 9.9 Non-IFRS Financial Information\n\nThe Operating & Financial Review attached to and forming part of this Directors' Report includes a number of non-International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) financial measures. AGL management uses these non-IFRS financial measures to assess the performance of the business and make decisions on the allocation of resources.\n\nPrincipal among these non-IFRS financial measures is Underlying Profit. This measure is Statutory Profit/(Loss) adjusted for:\n\n- \u00b7 significant items (which are material items of revenue or expense that are unrelated to the underlying performance of the business); and\n- \u00b7 changes in the fair value of financial instruments recognised in the statement of profit or loss (to remove the volatility caused by mismatches in valuing financial instruments and the underlying asset differently).\n\nAGL believes that Underlying Profit provides a better understanding of its financial performance than Statutory Profit/(Loss) and allows for a more relevant comparison of financial performance between financial periods.\n\nUnderlying Profit is presented with reference to ASIC Regulatory Guide 230 'Disclosing non-IFRS financial information', issued in December 2011. AGL's policy for reporting Underlying Profit is consistent with this guidance. The Directors have had the consistency of the application of the policy reviewed by the external auditor of AGL.\n\n## 9.10 Corporate governance\n\nA copy of AGL's Corporate Governance Statement can be found on the AGL website at agl.com.au/CorporateGovernance .\n\n## 9.11 Environmental regulation\n\nAGL's businesses are subject to a range of environmental laws and regulations as well as project and site-specific environmental permits and approvals issued at both the federal and state government levels.\n\nOn 10 and 11 March 2021, two events occurred at AGL Macquarie Pty Limited ( AGLM ) where air emission limits were exceeded at discharge points 4 and 3 respectively for Particulates as prescribed in the Liddell Environmental Protection Licence ( EPL ) 2122. AGLM notified the NSW Environment Protection Authority ( NSW EPA ) of the event on 14 April 2021 and undertook a review of emissions monitoring resulting in corrective actions being put into place. On 13 October 2021, the NSW EPA issued one Penalty Infringement Notice to AGLM for the contravention of a licence condition.\n\nOn 6 July 2021, AGLM notified the NSW EPA upon becoming aware that the air concentration limits for nitrogen oxides contained in EPL 779 - being the 99th percentile concentration limit, had been exceeded in relation to monitoring point 6. AGLM undertook a review of emissions monitoring resulting in corrective actions being put into place. On 11 August 2021, the NSW EPA issued an Official Caution to AGLM for an exceedance of a concentration limit.\n\nOn 16 September 2021, AGLM became aware that the air concentration limits for nitrogen oxides contained in EPL 779 being the 99th percentile concentration limit, had been exceeded in relation to monitoring point 6. AGLM notified the NSW EPA of the event and undertook a review of emissions monitoring resulting in corrective actions being put into place. On 8 November 2021, the NSW EPA issued an Official Caution to AGLM for Contravention of Licence Condition L3.1.\n\nOn 19 August 2021, an event occurred at Bayswater Power Station involving a discharge from the lime softening plant, resulting in the release of lime sludge into a nearby grassed drainage line. AGLM notified the NSW EPA of the event. AGLM carried out clean up actions, repaired the relevant section of the pipeline and undertook additional maintenance activities to prevent further releases. On 14 September 2021, the NSW EPA issued an Official Caution for an alleged pollution of waters offence.\n\nOn 24 May 2022, AGLM notified the NSW EPA that a discharge of saline water from the Lake Liddell Seepage Return System had been identified adjacent to Point 23 under EPL 779. There was no planned discharge at the time under the Hunter River Salinity Trading Scheme. AGLM carried out repairs to the pump. On 30 June 2022, the NSW EPA issued an Official Caution to AGLM for an alleged offence under section 120 of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997, for the pollution of waters.\n\n## Approval of Directors' Report\n\nThis Directors' Report is made in accordance with a resolution of the Board of Directors and is signed for and on behalf of the Board this 19th day of August 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPeter Botten\n\nChairman\n\n19 August 2022\n\n|",

Segment information\n\n## Operating Segments\n\nAGL reports segment information on the same basis as the internal management reporting structure.\n\nFor the majority of the year the internal management reporting structure was aligned with the proposed demerged businesses (the 'Proposed Demerged Segments') including for Accel - \"Operations\", \"Trading and Origination\", and for AGL Australia - \"Customer\", \"Supply and Trading\" and \"Investments\". Following the withdrawal of the proposed demerger in May 2022, management commenced the process of re-integrating the businesses, including realigning the operating segments into Customer Markets, Integrated Energy, and Investments (the 'Re-integrated Segments').\n\nIn order to bridge the Proposed Demerged Segments reported for a substantive part of the year and the Re-integrated Segments that were in use at year end and will be used going forward, the segment information for the year ended 30 June 2022 is presented under both Proposed Demerged Segments and Re-integrated Segments, along with a reconciliation of the two.\n\n## Proposed Demerged Segments\n\nAccel:\n\n- \u00b7 Operations : comprised the power generation portfolio and other assets that were to be allocated to Accel. The segment included the costs associated with the operation and maintenance of the baseload generation fleet and other assets.\n- \u00b7 Trading and Origination : comprised the wholesale electricity and C&I customer portfolio that were to be allocated to Accel. This segment included the revenues for the sale of energy to the AGL Australia Supply and Trading segment and wholesale and C&I customers, along with costs of generation, and the outcomes of the trading and hedging strategies employed.\n\n## AGL Australia:\n\n- \u00b7 Customer : comprised the Consumer and Large Business customer portfolios responsible for the retailing of electricity, gas, solar and energy efficiency products and services to residential, small and large business customers and the retailing of telecommunications that were to be allocated to AGL Australia. This segment included revenue from the sale of energy, telecommunications and other products to customers, and the cost of supply and operating costs to support AGL Australia's 4.2 million customer services.\n- \u00b7 Supply and Trading : comprised the wholesale electricity, gas and eco markets trading and operating activities that were to be allocated to AGL Australia. This segment sources the electricity and gas required to serve AGL Australia's customers. It also operated and maintained the flexible generation assets that were to be allocated to AGL Australia. This segment earned inter-segment revenue through sales to the Customer segment.\n- \u00b7 Investments : comprised interests in the ActewAGL Retail Partnership, Tilt Renewables, Energy Impact Partners Europe and other investments that were to be allocated to AGL Australia.\n\n## Re-integrated Segments\n\n- \u00b7 Customer Markets: comprises the Consumer and Large Business customer portfolios responsible for the retailing of electricity, gas, broadband/mobile/voice, solar and energy efficiency products and services to residential, small and large business customers. Customer Markets sources its energy from Integrated Energy at a transfer price based on methodologies that reflect the prevailing wholesale market conditions and other energy costs in each state. Customer Markets also includes sales, marketing, brand, and AGL's customer contact and call centre operations.\n- \u00b7 Integrated Energy: operates AGL 's power generation portfolio and other key assets, including coal, gas and renewable generation facilities, natural gas storage and production facilities, and development projects. Integrated Energy manages price risk associated with procuring electricity and gas for AGL's customers, manages AGL's obligations in relation to renewable energy schemes, and controls the dispatch of AGL's owned and contracted generation assets, third party gas agreements and associated portfolio of energy hedging products.\n- \u00b7 Investments: comprises AGL's interests in the ActewAGL Retail Partnership, Tilt Renewables, Energy Impact Partners Europe and other investments.\n\nIn the segment financial results, the 'Other' category consists of various Corporate activities. These are not considered to be reportable segments.",

Segment information (cont.)\n\n## Segment financial results\n\nThe measurement of segment results is in line with the basis of information presented to the Board of Directors for internal management reporting purposes. The performance of each segment is measured based on their Underlying earnings before interest and tax (Underlying EBIT) contribution to AGL. Certain items of income and expense are excluded from the segment results to show a measure of underlying performance. These items include changes in fair value of financial instruments and significant items.\n\nAASB 8 Operating Segments requires AGL to report segment information on the same basis as the internal management structure. As a result, the AGL Australia Customer segment reports the revenue and margin associated with satisfying the gas, electricity and telecommunication requirements of AGL Australia's consumer and business customer portfolio, whilst Accel Operations, Trading and Origination and AGL Australia Supply and Trading segment reports the revenue, expenses and margin related to operating sites and wholesale energy portfolio. The same approach also applies to the Re-integrated Segments, in that the Customer Markets segment reports the revenue and margin associated with satisfying the gas, electricity and telecommunication requirements of AGL consumer and business customer portfolio and Integrated Energy reports the revenue, expenses and margin related to AGL's operating sites and AGL's wholesale energy portfolio.\n\n## Proposed Demerged Segments\n\n|                                                                                             | Accel Energy   | Accel Energy            | AGL Australia   | AGL Australia      | AGL Australia   |       |         |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------|-------|---------|\n| 2022 $m                                                                                     | Operations     | Trading and Origination | Customer        | Supply and Trading | Investments     | Other | Total   |\n| Revenue                                                                                     |                |                         |                 |                    |                 |       |         |\n| Total segment revenue                                                                       | 146            | 6,551                   | 7,500           | 2,460              | 17              | -

Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services is transferred to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which AGL expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\n\nThe majority of contractual energy supply arrangements with customers have no fixed duration, generally require no minimum consumption by the customer and are able to be terminated by either party at any time without incurring significant penalty. Given this, the enforceable contracts are considered short term (less than 12 months) in nature. There are some longer term contracts particularly those with business and wholesale customers.\n\nAGL has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements because it controls the goods or services before transferring them to the customer.\n\nAGL's primary performance obligations are the supply of energy (electricity or gas) over the contractual term. There are either individual contracts representing separate purchasing decisions of customers, or the units of supply of energy represent a series of distinct goods that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer and hence is considered one performance obligation satisfied over time. For the shorter term contracts, the performance obligations are considered to be satisfied, and revenue is recognised, as and when the units of energy are delivered. Additionally, in relation to AGL's longer term contracts, AGL determines that the right-toinvoice approach to measure the progress towards completion\n\nof the performance obligation is most appropriate as it depicts AGL's performance. AGL uses the units of energy delivered to the customer as estimated as part of the unbilled process (and later verified by meter readings) or as indicated by the customer's energy meter (where these are known more frequently).\n\nIn most instances, the transaction price is determined by the unbilled process. For some wholesale contracts, AGL also considers the effects of variable consideration and for some business sales, there is non-cash consideration and consideration payable to the customer relating to renewable energy certificates (RECs).\n\n## Electricity and Gas revenue Residential electricity and gas sales\n\nResidential energy sales relate to the sale of energy (electricity and gas) to retail customers. Residential sales are classified as individual, short term, day-by-day contracts and are recognised as revenue on a day-by-day basis upon delivery of energy to customers.\n\nWhere the customers are eligible to receive additional discounts (e.g. pay on time discounts to encourage timely payment of energy invoices), AGL considers this to be variable consideration, which is estimated as part of the unbilled process.\n\n## Portfolio approach for residential electricity and gas sales\n\nAGL recognises revenue from contracts with its residential customers at the electricity and gas portfolio levels. Furthermore, AGL has elected to apply the portfolio approach in accounting for the fair valuing of RECs, accounting for connection fees and sales commissions. Recognition at the portfolio level would not differ materially from applying the standard on a contract-bycontract basis.\n\n|",

Revenue (cont.)\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n## Business electricity and gas sales\n\nBusiness sales represent the sale of energy to business customers. Revenue recognition is largely consistent with residential sales. These contracts are longer term in nature and represent a series of distinct goods that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer and are treated as one performance obligation satisfied over time based on the output delivered to the customer. For a large majority of business sales customers, revenue is recognised when AGL has the 'right to invoice' the customer for consideration that has been determined to correspond directly with the value of units of energy delivered to that customer.\n\nSome business sales arrangements also include the transfer of RECs to the customer, which can, in some instances, represent a separate performance obligation.\n\n## Material right applicable to residential and business sales\n\nWhere a fixed fee (e.g. connection fee, distribution fee, capacity reservation charge, etc.) received from a customer does not represent a transfer of a good or service to a customer, but the customer is charged an upfront amount, the customer contract contains a material right in that the customer is effectively able to buy additional units of energy at a lower cost per unit.\n\nThe material right is valued based on its relative standalone selling price. If standalone selling prices are not directly observable, the price is estimated by taking into consideration the discount the customer would receive in a standalone transaction and the likelihood that the customer would exercise the option.\n\nRevenue from a material right is recognised as and when the right is exercised by the customer or the right expires, whichever is earlier.\n\n## Wholesale energy sales\n\nWholesale energy sales represent the sale of electricity and gas to wholesale customers. These involve a high volume of energy usually over an extended period of time. Supply of energy represents a series of distinct goods that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer and is the major performance obligation. It is treated as one performance obligation which is satisfied over time. In some instances, there is an additional performance obligation in these contracts by way of a material right.\n\nRevenue is recognised for these arrangements when AGL has the 'right to invoice' the customer for consideration that has been determined to correspond directly with the value of units of energy delivered to that customer.\n\nSome wholesale electricity arrangements may involve the transfer of RECs to the customer, which may represent a separate performance obligation.\n\n## Renewable energy certificates (RECs) applicable to business and wholesale sales\n\nThere are two main instances where RECs pass between AGL and its customers. These include those transferred under a selfsurrender arrangement as part of the consideration for energy and those that are sold to customers.\n\n## Received from customer (self-surrender)\n\nAs a retailer, AGL incurs costs in relation to its renewable energy obligations for which RECs must be surrendered to the government. For most customers, the costs associated with meeting these renewable energy obligations is factored into the cost of energy (i.e. there is a REC cost component built into the price paid). For some customers, instead of paying for the cost of the energy in cash, they have the option to elect to pay for their energy usage in the form of cash and by self-surrendering RECs.\n\nThe obligation to remit RECs to the regulator remains with AGL, but the customer is choosing to meet part of its payment by way of surrendering its own RECs rather than paying for the cost of the RECs as part of the overall cost of the energy.\n\nThe transfer of RECs as consideration in exchange for energy is a form of non-cash consideration. AGL measures non-cash consideration at its fair value at the date of surrender (i.e. the date of transfer by the customer).\n\n## Transferred to the customer\n\nFor some customer contracts, AGL sells both energy and RECs to the customer. A customer may purchase RECs to meet its own REC obligations and/or where it wants actual title to the RECs.\n\nThe RECs sold to a customer represent a separate performance obligation, i.e. a good, as the customer can benefit from the RECs on their own and the promise to transfer RECs to the customer is separately identifiable from the other promises in the contract (e.g. promise to deliver energy).\n\nAGL determines the portion of the transaction price that it allocates to the RECs using the relative standalone selling price method.\n\nThe transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the proportion of the stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation to the sum of the stand-alone selling prices of all of the performance obligations in the contract.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nFor the year ended 30 June 2022\n\n## 2. Revenue (cont.)\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\nRevenue is recognised as and when the control of the RECs are transferred to the customer, which occurs at a point in time. Where the customer is entitled to all the RECs generated at a specified power plant (e.g. in cases where power plants are located at the customer's site), transfer of control to the customer occurs as and when the RECs are generated. In other cases where the RECs are transferred to the customer from inventory, control of the RECs transfers upon receipt by the customer.\n\n## Pool revenue\n\n## Pool generation sales\n\nPool generation sales and pool purchase costs relate to sales by AGL's generation assets to the grid and purchases of energy by AGL wholesale on behalf of AGL's retail business. AGL has assessed it is acting as the principal in relation to such sales and purchases of energy to the pool and therefore the transactions are recognised on a 'gross' basis. Revenue from these arrangements is recognised at the spot price achieved when control of the energy passes to the grid.\n\n## Variable consideration\n\nIf the consideration in a contract includes a variable amount, AGL estimates the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods to the customer. The variable consideration is estimated at contract inception and constrained until it is highly probable that a significant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved.\n\n## Significant financing component\n\nAGL applies the practical expedient in that it does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if it expects, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of the promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.\n\n## Costs to obtain a contract\n\nCosts that are incurred regardless of whether a contract is obtained are expensed as incurred, unless those costs are explicitly chargeable to the customer. Discretionary bonuses\n\npaid to sales staff based on meeting annual sales targets, overall profitability and individual performance evaluations are expensed as incurred as they are not directly attributable to identifiable contracts and do not meet the criteria for capitalisation. The direct costs of establishing customer contracts are recognised as an asset when they relate to a specific customer acquisition campaign. The direct costs are amortised over the minimum contract term. Direct costs include customer acquisition fees paid to channel partners and upfront account purchase payments.\n\n## Costs to fulfil\n\nThe costs incurred by AGL to fulfil a contract with a customer, which may qualify for capitalisation include connection fees paid/incurred by AGL (including those charged by distribution businesses to provide such network services, or those incurred directly by AGL in connecting a customer). These costs do not fall within the scope of any other standard (i.e. the cost is not part of inventory, an intangible asset or property, plant and equipment). Therefore, these costs are capitalised as a contract cost (cost to fulfil) asset and amortised over the life of the customer contract or customer relationship, where material.\n\n## Cost sharing arrangements\n\nAGL enters into cost sharing arrangements whereby the costs to operate and maintain assets that are shared with parties outside the AGL Group are recharged to the parties in accordance with their beneficial interest. These recharged amounts are recognised as revenue when the associated costs to which they relate impact the statement of profit or loss. Revenue is measured with reference to the fair value of the consideration received.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that AGL will comply with the conditions of the grant and the grant will be received.\n\nGovernment grants that require AGL to construct an asset are recognised as deferred revenue in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and transferred to profit or loss on a systematic basis over the useful life of the related assets.\n\n|",

Revenue (cont.)\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\n## Variable consideration and constraints\n\nAGL includes variable consideration in the transaction price as estimated at the inception of a contract. However, if it is considered 'highly probable' that a significant reversal of revenue recognised will occur in the future, the variable consideration is constrained and not included in the transaction price.\n\nAGL's contractual arrangements contain a number of variable pricing elements including pay-on-time discounts, payment plans, and escalations. Some of these variable elements are resolved during the reporting period. Where they are not, management estimates the likelihood of the variable pricing\n\nelement eventuating and recognises the variable pricing element to the extent it is not highly probable that it will reverse.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nAGL recognises revenue from gas and electricity services once the gas and/or electricity has been consumed by the customer. Management estimates customer consumption between the last invoice date and the end of the reporting period when determining gas and electricity revenue for the financial period.

AGL's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which AGL expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if AGL has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either:\n\n- \u00b7 the same taxable entity; or\n- \u00b7 different taxable entities that intend either to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.\n\n|",

Income tax (cont.)\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n## Current and deferred tax for the period\n\nCurrent and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in profit or loss, except when they relate to items recognised outside profit or loss (whether in other comprehensive income or directly in equity) or a business combination.\n\n## Tax consolidation\n\nAGL Energy Limited (the Parent Entity) and its wholly-owned Australian resident subsidiaries formed a tax-consolidated group pursuant to Australian taxation law with effect from 25 October 2006 and are therefore taxed as a single entity from that date. AGL Energy Limited is the head entity in the tax-consolidated group.\n\nOn 23 July 2012, AGL Generation Holdco Pty Ltd, a subsidiary 99.99% owned by AGL, and AGL Generation Pty Ltd elected to form a tax-consolidated group with Loy Yang Marketing Holdings Pty Limited and its wholly-owned subsidiary, in addition to the existing group. On 27 July 2012, Great Energy Alliance Corporation Pty Limited (GEAC) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\n## Deferred tax assets relating to tax losses\n\nAGL recognises a deferred tax asset relating to tax losses incurred by a subsidiary.

Trade and other receivables are recognised at amortised cost, less an allowance for expected credit loss. AGL's policy requires customers to pay in accordance within agreed payment terms. Depending on the customer segment, trade receivables are generally due for settlement within 30 days.\n\nAGL assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\n## Expected credit loss on trade receivables and unbilled revenue\n\nAGL uses an allowance matrix to measure expected credit losses of trade receivables and unbilled revenue from its customers. Trade receivable amounts are disaggregated into customer segments.\n\nLoss rates are estimated in each age category and are based on the probability of a receivable progressing through to write-off. Factors to estimate the loss rate are based on risk assessment performed for each customer segment and economic factors such as wholesale electricity forward curves, commodity fuel forward curves and prevailing macro-economic information.\n\nThe methodology for calculating the allowance for expected credit loss has not changed as a result of COVID-19, however certain assumptions have been updated and further segmentation of the customer base has been introduced to reflect observed payment behaviours. The key assumptions impacted are external macro-economic trends such as unemployment and small business impacts.\n\nFor trade receivables, unbilled revenue, contract assets and lease receivables, AGL applies the simplified approach, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.\n\n## Unbilled revenue\n\nUnbilled revenue represents estimated gas and electricity services supplied to customers but unbilled at the end of the reporting period. Unbilled gas and electricity revenue is not collectible until such time as customers' meters are read and bills rendered.\n\n## Unbilled revenue\n\nAGL recognises revenue from gas and electricity sales once the gas and/or electricity has been consumed by the customer. Management estimates customer consumption between the last invoice date and the end of the reporting period when determining gas and electricity revenue for the financial period. Various assumptions and financial models are used to determine the estimated unbilled consumption.\n\nSome of the assumptions and estimates include:\n\n- \u00b7 Volume and timing of energy consumed by the customers\n- \u00b7 Various pricing plans prevalent and allocation of the estimated volume to such pricing plans\n- \u00b7 Loss factors\n- \u00b7 Behavioural discounts.",

Associates are those entities in which AGL has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies of the entity. A joint venture is an arrangement in which AGL has joint control and AGL has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method, investments in associates and joint ventures are initially recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial\n\nPosition at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise AGL's share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associates and joint ventures. An impairment loss is measured by comparing the recoverable amount of the investment with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss and is reversed if there has been a favourable change in estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. Unrealised gains on transactions between AGL and an associate or a joint venture are eliminated to the extent of AGL's interest in the associate or joint venture. Unrealised losses are also eliminated, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of an impairment.\n\n|",

Property, plant and equipment (cont.)\n\n## Property, plant and equipment under construction\n\nThe net carrying amount of property, plant and equipment disclosed above includes expenditure recognised in relation to plant and equipment which is in the course of construction of $375 million (2021: $353 million).\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.\n\nCost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of the asset. Finance costs related to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised. Cost may also include transfers from other comprehensive income of any gain or loss on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property, plant and equipment.\n\nSubsequent costs are capitalised when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to AGL and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Other costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.\n\nThe gain or loss arising on disposal or retirement is recognised in profit or loss.\n\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost of each asset over its expected useful life to its estimated residual value. Leasehold improvements are amortised over the period of the relevant lease or estimated useful life, whichever is the shorter. Land is not depreciated.\n\nThe estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate at the end of each annual reporting period.\n\nThe following estimated useful lives are used in the calculation of depreciation:\n\n- \u00b7 Leasehold improvements - lesser of lease period or up to 50 years\n- \u00b7 Plant and equipment - Up to 50 years\n\nAs announced in February 2022, AGL committed to responsibly transitioning operations by closing thermal coal power stations in the following time frames to reduce AGL's environmental footprint:\n\n- \u00b7 Liddell Power Station: April 2023\n- \u00b7 Bayswater Power Station: 2030-2033\n- \u00b7 Loy Yang A Power Station: 2040-2045\n\n## Right-of-use assets (ROU assets)\n\nA ROU asset is recognised in relation to each lease and is initially measured at cost comprising the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made before the commencement date (reduced by lease incentives received), plus initial direct costs incurred in obtaining the lease and an estimate of costs to be incurred in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, restoring the site on which it is located or restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease, unless those costs are incurred to produce inventories.\n\nA ROU asset is subsequently measured using the cost model less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of the lease liability. AGL does not apply the revaluation model but instead carries all ROU assets at cost. The ROU asset is depreciated over its useful life. The useful life of a ROU asset for depreciation purposes is the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term. Where the ROU asset is adjusted due to changes in the lease liability, the depreciation for the ROU asset is adjusted on a prospective basis.\n\nThe following estimated useful lives are used in the calculation of depreciation on ROU assets:\n\n- \u00b7 Plant and equipment - ROU assets: lesser of lease period or up to 50 years\n- \u00b7 Other - ROU assets: lesser of lease period or up to 50 years\n\n## Short-term and low value leases as lessee\n\nAGL has elected to apply the practical expedients available for short-term leases (i.e. where the lease period is 12 months or less) and low-value asset leases. As a result of application of these practical expedients, the measurement requirements of accounting standards do not apply and the expense for these leases is recognised on a straight-line basis.\n\n|",

Property, plant and equipment (cont.)\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n## Impairment of non-financial assets excluding goodwill\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, AGL reviews the carrying amounts of its assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, AGL estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.\n\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use.

The cost of an intangible asset acquired in a business combination is its fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.\n\nThe useful lives of intangible assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed at least annually for impairment. Finite lived intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful life and tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.\n\nThe estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each annual reporting period.\n\nThe following estimated useful lives are used in the calculation of amortisation for intangible assets with finite lives:\n\n- \u00b7 Customer relationships and contracts - 3 to 20 years\n- \u00b7 Software - 3 to 7 years\n- \u00b7 Licences - the lesser of licence term and asset useful life\n\nAn intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of the acquisition of the business less accumulated impairment losses, if any.\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of AGL's CGUs or groups of CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination, and tested for impairment at least annually.\n\nA CGU or group of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the CGU or group of CGUs is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU(s) and then to the other assets of the CGU(s) pro rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU(s). Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised directly in profit or loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\n\n## Software\n\nSoftware is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition or development of the software.\n\n## Licences\n\nLicences are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.",

Intangible assets (cont.)\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n## Customer relationships and contracts\n\nCustomer relationships and contracts acquired in a business combination are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the period during which economic benefits are expected to be received.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\n## Impairment assessment for year ended 30 June 2022\n\nAs disclosed in the 31 December 2021 half year report, effective 1 July 2021 the internal reporting structure of AGL was updated resulting in the formation of new operating segments. Following review of the associated CGUs it was determined that there were changes to the CGUs that impacted AGL's impairment assessment. The major CGUs for the purpose of impairment assessment at 31 December 2021 were:\n\n- \u00b7 Customer Markets\n- \u00b7 Generation Fleet\n- \u00b7 Flexible Generation\n- \u00b7 Wholesale Gas\n\n## Impairment testing methodology\n\nAGL is subject to a number of external forces that will impact the performance of its business over the life of its assets. This includes external regulatory and social factors that may impact the life of assets, competitor behaviour and new entrants, technology change, and market prices. To respond to the range of potential outcomes that can result from these factors, AGL has adopted a scenario analysis approach to determining the recoverable amount of its assets and cash generating units. Each of the scenarios were assigned a probability weighting to estimate the value in use of each CGU. The methodology of analysing several possible outcomes is consistent with AGL's external reporting disclosures such as the TCFD reports.\n\nManagement has modelled eight differing scenarios that have been used in determining the recoverable value of the CGUs. The eight scenarios modelled represent a range of possible outcomes including differing wholesale market prices, asset lives, and impacts of increased competition and includes scenarios consistent with those used in AGL's TCFD reporting.\n\nThe recoverable amounts for Customer Markets, Generation Fleet, Flexible Generation and Wholesale Gas were determined\n\nThe direct costs of establishing customer contracts are recognised as an asset when they relate to a specific customer acquisition campaign. The direct costs are amortised over the minimum contract term. Direct costs include customer acquisition fees paid to channel partners and upfront account purchase payments. All other customer acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nusing value-in-use models including an appropriate terminal value, where applicable. The key assumptions in the calculation of value in use include:\n\n- \u00b7 Pool prices;\n- \u00b7 Plant closure date;\n- \u00b7 Discount rate;\n- \u00b7 Terminal growth rate;\n- \u00b7 Customer numbers and churn;\n- \u00b7 Gas margins and volumes;\n- \u00b7 Generation volumes;\n- \u00b7 Gross margin including assumptions around regulatory outcomes, constraints that impact pricing of market contracts, customer product swaps and customer discounts; and\n- \u00b7 Probability weighting applied to each scenario.\n\nThe estimate of regulatory outcomes is based on actual regulatory decisions for the current operating period, which are publicly available, together with AGL's expectations of regulated network prices and regulated pricing (Victorian Default Market Offer/Default Market Offer) beyond the current reset period and market prices in unregulated markets. The assumed future gross margin in unregulated markets is determined with reference to historic achieved revenue rates along with AGL's expectations of future price changes, and the impact of expected customer discounts. Customer numbers and consumption volumes are estimated based on historical experience in various segments, together with marketing strategies for the retention and winning of customers and the expected competition from new entrants. Gas procurement costs are estimated based on the actual contract portfolio, together with an estimate of future margins and volumes beyond the period of the actual contract portfolio.\n\n|",

Intangible assets (cont.)\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\nIn the case of AGL's generation fleet and flexible generation finite life assets, cash flow forecasts are based on discrete and long-term cash flow forecasts that reflect the life of the assets. The long-term modelling reflects AGL's view of the cash flows anticipated from operations, factoring in known events and expectations, and allows for quantification of sensitivities and scenarios.\n\nDiscount rates used are the post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 6.7% (FY21: 6.7%).\n\nWhere applicable, a terminal value for certain CGUs is estimated. The terminal value is based on final year free cash flow, with normalised operating and capital expenditure, extrapolated into perpetuity with a growth rate of 2.0% (FY21: 2.0%).\n\nAt 30 June 2022, management conducted additional sensitivity analysis to understand the potential impact of changes in market conditions subsequent to the value in use models and scenario analysis being completed. The sensitivity analysis concluded that the recent market conditions would not change the outcome of the impairment assessment. The sensitivity analysis included consideration of key assumptions such as discount rates, pool prices, customer churn and asset closure dates.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of a CGU is estimated to be less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount of the CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount with any impairment recognised immediately in the statement of financial performance.\n\n## Generation Fleet CGU\n\nThe recoverable amount is sensitive to reasonably possible changes in assumed pool prices as well as expected asset closure dates. It is reasonably possible that a change in these assumptions could lead to a reduction in recoverable value. The interrelationship of changes in these and other assumptions is complex. Changes in the external operating environment, such as closure of high demand consumers such as aluminium smelters; significant new generation capacity or delays in the closure of other non-AGL owned power stations; or changes to government policies could result in the decrease in pool prices or may reduce the operating lives of our assets which could give rise to a further impairment.\n\nAGL announced on 30 May 2022, following withdrawal of the proposed demerger, it would undertake a review of strategic direction. The review includes consideration of AGL's decarbonisation objectives, which may also impact the intended operating lives of AGL assets and could give rise to further impairment.\n\nNo other reasonably possible changes in key assumptions have been identified which may cause the carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.\n\n## Wholesale Gas CGU\n\nThe recoverable amount is sensitive to reasonably possible changes in assumptions. The recoverable amount of the CGU would equal its carrying amount if:\n\n- \u00b7 The volumes sold to retail customers is reduced by 4% per annum in isolation; or\n- \u00b7 The gas margin forecast is reduced by $0.24/GJ in isolation.\n\nNo other reasonably possible changes in key assumptions have been identified which may cause the carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.\n\n## Customer Markets CGU and Flexible Generation CGU\n\nManagement do not believe that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would result in an impairment.\n\n## Impact of climate change related risk\n\nAGL recognises that there is an increased pace of change in the energy industry, community perspectives and associated political landscape.\n\nThe scenario analysis undertaken as part of AGL's impairment analysis includes scenarios that are consistent with the TCFD analysis performed. Our assessment shows that a change to the planned closure dates of AGL's coal-fired/thermal generation plants as a result of climate change may have a material impact on the National Electricity Market and may result in a material change to AGL's estimated cash inflows. Similarly, any change to policy in relation to climate change may have a material impact on the National Electricity Market and may result in a material change to AGL's estimated cash inflows.\n\n## Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives\n\nAGL determines whether goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives are impaired at least on an annual basis. This requires an assessment of impairment indications, and an estimation of the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units, using a value in use discounted methodology, to which the goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives are allocated.",

Given the schemes are surrendered on a calendar year basis, the liability is calculated based on the best estimated unit cost at the time of expected surrender.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\n## Accrued distribution costs\n\nAGL recognises distribution costs once the gas and electricity has been delivered to the customer and is measured through a regular review of usage meters. Management estimates customer consumption between the last invoice date and the end of the reporting period when determining distribution costs for the financial period. Various assumptions and financial models are used to determine the estimated unbilled consumption.\n\n## 18.

To manage the foreign exchange risk arising from the future principal and interest payments required on the US$395 million, the notes were converted back to approximately A$522 million through cross currency interest rate swaps. On 8 December 2016, AGL further issued A$50 million of fixed rate unsecured senior notes in the US private placement market with a 10 year maturity.\n\nOn 8 September 2010, AGL issued US$300 million of fixed rate unsecured senior notes in the US private placement market, comprising two tranches of 12 year and 15 year maturities for US$165 million and US$135 million, respectively. To manage the foreign exchange risk arising from the future principal and interest payments required on the US$300 million, the notes were converted back to approximately A$338 million through cross currency interest rate swaps.\n\n$239 million has been classified as current as these tranches are maturing within 12 months from 30 June 2022.\n\n## Bank loans\n\nIn June 2018, AGL extended its existing $410 million term loan facility to mature in June 2025. As at 30 June 2022, this facility was fully utilised.\n\nIn September 2019 AGL executed a A$600 million 5-year syndicated Sustainability Linked Loan. At the end of FY22, this facility was fully utilised. The rest of $2,152 million of bank debt comprises of bilateral facilities. During FY22, $275 million of bilateral debt facilities matured and no new debt was raised. All commitments related to the respective demerging entities were conditional upon the success of the demerger and did not proceed.\n\nOn 28 July 2022, AGL entered into a new unsecured loan with Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited for $200 million. The loan contains two tranches, with tranche A of $100 million maturing in July 2023 and tranche B of $100 million maturing in July 2025.\n\n## CPI bonds\n\nCPI bonds rank pari passu with other unsecured debt and will mature in May 2027.\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n## Borrowings\n\n## Interest bearing liabilities\n\nAll loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, being the amount received less attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, interest bearing liabilities are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.\n\n## Leases\n\nAt inception of a contract, AGL assesses whether a contract is, or contains a lease. A contract is, or contains a lease, if the contract conveys to the customer a right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\nAGL assesses whether:\n\n- \u00b7 The contract involves the use of an identified asset - the asset may be explicitly or implicitly specified in the contract. Capacity portions of larger assets would be considered an identified asset if the portion is physically distinct or if the portion represents substantially all of the capacity of the asset. An asset is not considered an identified asset if the supplier has the substantive right to substitute the asset throughout the period of use.\n- \u00b7 The customer in the contract has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the period of use.",

Borrowings (cont.)\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n- \u00b7 The customer in the contract has the right to direct the use of the asset throughout the period of use - the customer is considered to have the right to direct the use of the asset only if either:\n- -The customer has the right to direct how and for what purpose the identified asset is used throughout the period of use; or\n- -The relevant decisions about how and for what purposes the asset is used are predetermined and the customer has the right to operate the asset, or the customer designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose the asset will be used throughout the period of use.\n\nAGL has applied the above approach in identifying leases in contracts entered into, or modified, on or after 1 July 2018. For contracts entered into before 1 July 2018, AGL has elected to apply the grandfathering practical expedient on transition. Consequently, the transition and measurement requirements only apply to arrangements that were identified as leases pursuant to the previous leases standards as at and subsequent to 1 July 2018.\n\n## AGL as lessee\n\nIn contracts where AGL is a lessee, AGL recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the commencement date of the lease for all leases other than short-term or low-value asset leases.\n\n## Lease Liabilities\n\nA lease liability is recognised in relation to each lease and is initially measured at the present value of future lease payments at the commencement date. To calculate the present value, the future lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease (IRIL), if the rate is readily determinable. If the IRIL cannot be readily determined, the incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date is used. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;\n- \u00b7 Variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date (e.g. payments that vary due to changes in CPI, or commodity prices); and\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\n## Leases\n\n## Lease term\n\nWhere lease arrangements contain options to extend the term or terminate the contract, AGL assesses whether it is 'reasonably certain' that the option to extend or terminate the contract will be made. Consideration is given to the prevalence of other contractual arrangements and or the economic circumstances relevant to the lease contract, that may indicate the likelihood of the option being exercised. Lease liabilities and ROU assets are measured using the reasonably certain contract term.\n\n|\n\n- \u00b7 Amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees, purchase options and termination penalties (where relevant).\n\nVariable payments other than those included in the measurement of the lease liability above (i.e. those not based on an index or rate) are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occur.\n\nFor contracts containing lease and non-lease components, AGL accounts for each lease component separately from the non-lease components of the contract, where material. The consideration in the contract is allocated to the components based on their relative stand-alone prices.\n\nSubsequently, the lease liability is measured in a manner similar to other financial liabilities, i.e., at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. This means the liability is:\n\n- \u00b7 Increased to reflect interest on the lease liability;\n- \u00b7 Decreased to reflect lease payments made; and\n- \u00b7 Remeasured to reflect any reassessment of lease payments or lease modifications, or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments.\n\nAfter commencement date, the following amounts are recognised in profit or loss with respect to the payments pursuant to the lease:\n\n- \u00b7 interest expense: recognised as finance cost; and\n- \u00b7 variable lease payments not based on an index or a rate: recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs.\n\n## Short-term and low value leases\n\nAGL has elected to apply the practical expedients available for short-term leases (i.e. where the lease term is less than 12 months) and low-value asset leases. As a result of application of these practical expedients, the measurement requirements above do not apply and the expense for these leases is recognised on a straight-line basis.",

Borrowings (cont.)\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n## Lease discount rates\n\nThe discount rate applicable to a lease arrangement is determined at the inception of the contract or when certain modifications are made to the contract. The discount rate applied is the rate implicit in the arrangement, or if unknown, AGL's incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate is\n\ndetermined with reference to AGL's borrowing portfolio at the inception of the arrangement or the time of the modification and the amount and nature of the lease arrangement. If the arrangement relates to a specialised asset, incremental project financing assumptions are considered.\n\n## 19.

Provisions (cont.)\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n## Environmental rehabilitation\n\nThe provision for future rehabilitation costs is the best estimate of the present value of the expenditure required to settle the rehabilitation obligation at the end of the reporting period, based on current legal requirements and current technology. Future rehabilitation costs are reviewed periodically and any changes are reflected in the provision at the end of each reporting period.\n\nThe initial estimate of the environmental rehabilitation provision relating to exploration, development and production facilities is capitalised into the cost of the related asset and depreciated/ amortised on the same basis as the related asset. Changes in the estimate of the provision for environmental rehabilitation are treated in the same manner, except that the unwinding of the effect of discounting on the provision is recognised as a finance cost rather than being capitalised into the cost of the related asset.\n\n## Restructuring\n\nA restructuring provision is recognised when AGL has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\n## Provision for environmental rehabilitation\n\nAGL estimates the future removal and rehabilitation costs of electricity generation assets, oil and gas production facilities, wells, pipelines and related assets at the time of installation of the assets. In most instances, removal of these assets will occur many years into the future. The calculation of this provision requires management to make assumptions regarding the removal date, application of environmental legislation, the extent of rehabilitation activities required and available technologies.\n\nThe provisions for environmental rehabilitation represents the best estimate of the present value of the expenditure required to settle the obligation. In line with AGL's accounting policy, the Provisions for Environmental Rehabilitation are reviewed on a regular basis. The decrease in environmental rehabilitation is predominately driven by changes in assumptions due to current market conditions, relating to an increase in discount rates and an increase in inflation rates, partially offset by changes to the assumed timing of cashflows following changes to asset closure dates announced in February 2022.\n\n## Provision for onerous contracts\n\nAASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets defines an onerous contract as a contract in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic benefits expected to be received under it. The unavoidable costs under a contract reflect the least net cost of exiting from the contract, which is the lower of the cost of fulfilling it and any compensation or penalties arising from failure to fulfil it. A provision for onerous contracts is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract.\n\nAGL is party to certain power purchase agreements where the purchase price is above the forward price for electricity and renewable energy certificates and are considered onerous contracts under AASB 137. The agreements were primarily entered between 2006 and 2012 to support the development of the renewables sector at that time. A provision for onerous contracts for these power purchase agreements was initially recognised in FY21.\n\nThe uplift in forward prices on both electricity and renewable energy certificates from FY23 onwards together with an increase in discount rates have resulted in a reduction in the estimated provision in FY22. Provisions relating to two contracts previously recorded as onerous were derecognised in FY22 as the purchase price in these contracts is now lower than the forward price.\n\n|\n\nvalid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it. Future operating losses are not provided for.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nA liability is recognised for benefits accruing to employees in respect of wages and salaries, annual leave, long service leave and sick leave when it is probable that settlement will be required and they are capable of being measured reliably.\n\nLiabilities recognised in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at their nominal values using the remuneration rate expected to apply at the time of settlement.\n\nLiabilities recognised in respect of long-term employee benefits are measured as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows to be made by AGL in respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period.",

Contingent assets and liabilities\n\n## Market Suspension by AEMO\n\nA series of conditions affecting the National Electricity Market (NEM) between 12 and 23 June 2022 triggered administered pricing, spot market suspension and around 500 separate market interventions by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) under the National Electricity Rules. The nature and scale of these events was unprecedented in the NEM.\n\nMarket Participants 5 , primarily electricity generators, adversely impacted by AEMO's market interventions can claim compensation under various mechanisms outlined in the National Electricity Rules. Those compensation payments will be recovered from Market Customers ,5 , including electricity retailers, in proportion to their share of electricity purchased during the period and regions the interventions occurred.\n\nAGL will make claims for compensation as a Market Participant and will share in the aggregate of all claims paid as a Market Customer.  AGL has not recognised any benefit in relation to claims it will make under the National Electricity Rules as a Market Participant for the interventions that occurred in June 2022 as the outcome of those claims is uncertain.\n\nAt 30 June 2022, as a Market Customer, AGL has recognised its share of the provisional compensation amounts published by AEMO including provisional amounts for directions compensation and payments made under Reliability and Emergency Reserve Trader Contracts. It is not possible to reliably estimate the value of further compensation claims that may be made by Market Participants or approved by AEMO and the AEMC (Australian Energy Market Commission) under the National Electricity Rules for the market interventions made by AEMO in June 2022. Those claims may be significant. AGL expects updates to be provided by AEMO and AEMC from time to time however final positions may not be available until AEMO issues revision statements in November 2022, January 2023 or later.\n\nIt is probable that further claims will be approved by AEMO and the AEMC, and these will be recovered from Market Customers, including AGL, in a future period. Had those amounts been known or estimable, at 30 June 2022 AGL would have recognised additional liabilities associated with its proportionate share of the compensation claims net of amounts passed through to customers. The value of the unrecognised liabilities may be material to the financial performance or position of AGL at 30 June 2022.\n\n## Other contingent liabilities\n\nCertain entities in AGL are party to various legal actions and claims which have arisen in the ordinary course of business. Any liabilities arising from such legal actions and claims are not expected to have a material adverse effect on AGL.\n\nProvisions are not required in respect of these matters, as it is either not probable that a future sacrifice of economic benefits will be required or the amount is not capable of reliable measurement.",

Defined benefit superannuation plans\n\nAGL contributes to superannuation plans that provide defined benefit members a lump sum on retirement, death, disablement and withdrawal. Some defined benefit members are eligible for pension benefits in some cases. Lump sum benefits are calculated based on years of service and final average salary. The defined benefit plans are closed to new members.\n\nThe plans are the Equipsuper Fund (EF), Electricity Industry Superannuation Scheme (EISS), State Superannuation Scheme (SSS), State Authorities Superannuation Scheme (SASS) and the State Authorities Non-contributory Superannuation Scheme (SANCS).\n\nThe Superannuation Industry Supervision (SIS) legislation governs the superannuation industry and provides the framework within which superannuation plans operate. The SIS regulations require an actuarial valuation to be performed for each defined benefit plan every three years, or every year if the plan pays defined benefit pensions.\n\nThe plans' trustees are responsible for the governance of the plans. The trustees have a legal obligation to act solely in the best interests of plan beneficiaries. The trustees have the following roles: administration of the plans and payment to the beneficiaries from plan assets when required in accordance with the plan rules; management and investment of the plan assets; and compliance with other applicable regulations.\n\nThere are a number of risks to which the plans expose AGL. The most significant risks are investment risk, salary growth risk, inflation risk, interest rate risk, legislative risk and changes in the life expectancy for members.\n\nAGL also contributes to defined contribution superannuation plans for employees, which are also provided by these plans. Contributions made to these defined contribution plans are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Amounts recognised in profit or loss\n\n|                                                                            |   2022 $m |   2021 $m |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Current service cost                                                       |        17 |        17 |\n| Net interest expense                                                       |         1 |         4 |\n| Expense recognised in profit or loss as part of employee benefits expenses |        18 |        21 |\n\n## Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income\n\n|                                                                                        | Remeasurements   | Remeasurements   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest expense)             | 30               | (65)             |\n| Actuarial loss arising from changes in demographic assumptions                         | -                | 5                |\n| Actuarial (gain) arising from changes in financial assumptions                         | (136)            | (34)             |\n| Actuarial loss/(gain) arising from experience                                          | 3                | (3)              |\n| Remeasurement (gain) on defined benefit plans recognised in other comprehensive income | (103)            | (97)             |\n\n|",

Defined benefit superannuation plans (cont.)\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting period, while holding all other assumptions constant.\n\nDefined benefit obligation\n\n|                                                                | Increase 2022 $m   | Decrease 2022 $m   | Increase 2021 $m   | Decrease 2021 $m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Discount rate (0.5 percentage point movement)                  | (30)               | 35                 | (43)               | 47                 |\n| Expected salary increase rate (0.5 percentage point movement)  | 12                 | (11)               | 15                 | (15)               |\n| Expected pension increase rate (0.5 percentage point movement) | 10                 | (9)                | 14                 | (13)               |\n\nThe sensitivity analyses presented above may not be representative of the actual change in the defined benefit obligation as it is unlikely that the change in assumptions would occur in isolation of one another as some of the assumptions may be correlated.\n\nThere was no change in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses from prior years.\n\n## Funding arrangements and employer contributions\n\nEmployer contributions are determined based on actuarial advice and are set to target the assets of the plans exceeding the total of members' vested benefits. Funding levels are reviewed regularly. Where assets are less than vested benefits, a management plan must be established to restore the coverage to at least 100%.\n\nAGL expects to contribute $13 million to the defined benefit plans during the year ending 30 June 2023.\n\nThe weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation as at 30 June 2022 was EF 10 years; EISS 11 years; and SSS, SASS and SANCS 12 years.\n\n## Defined contribution superannuation plans\n\nAGL makes contributions to a number of defined contribution superannuation plans. The amount recognised as an expense for the year ended 30 June 2022 was $48 million (2021: $49 million).\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n## Defined benefit superannuation plans\n\nFor defined benefit superannuation plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at the end of each reporting period. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, in the period in which they occur.\n\nChanges in the net defined benefit liability, including all actuarial gains and losses that arise in calculating AGL's obligation in respect of the plan are recognised in other comprehensive income when they occur. All other expenses relating to the defined benefit plans are recognised as an expense in the profit or loss. Any defined benefit superannuation plan asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\n## Defined contribution superannuation plans\n\nContributions to defined contribution superannuation plans are recognised as an expense when employees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\n## Defined benefit superannuation plans\n\nVarious actuarial assumptions are utilised in the determination of AGL's defined benefit obligations. AGL uses external actuarial experts to determine these assumptions.",

Share-based payment plans\n\nAGL operates the following share-based payment plans:\n\n- \u00b7 The Share Reward Plan; and\n- \u00b7 The Long-Term Incentive plan.\n\nAGL has the following other equity arrangements:\n\n- \u00b7 The Share Purchase Plan; and\n- \u00b7 The Restricted Equity Plan.\n\n## Share Reward Plan (SRP)\n\nThe SRP is AGL's complying broad-based employee share plan that enables eligible employees to be granted up to $1,000 of ordinary shares in AGL for no consideration each financial year. The SRP is governed by the AGL General Employee Share Plan Rules. The grant of shares is subject to the achievement of performance metrics and can therefore be scaled down in years where all objectives are not met. Shares granted pursuant to the SRP are subject to a trading restriction of the earlier of three years or the participant's cessation of employment.\n\nEligible participants include all AGL employees with at least 12 months service at the eligibility date (generally 1 September following the financial year end). Participants in the long-term incentive plan are excluded from any SRP grant.\n\nDetails of share movements in the SRP during the year are set out below:\n\n| Grant date                     | Balance at 1 July Number   | Granted during the year Number   | Fair Value per share $   | Released during the year Number   | Balance at 30 June Number   |\n|--------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 2022                           |                            |                                  |                          |                                   |                             |\n| 30 September 2021              | -                          | 293,737                          | $ 5.96                   | (58,764)                          | 234,973                     |\n| 28 September 2020              | 212,037                    | -                                | -                        | (44,505)                          | 167,532                     |\n| 28 September 2019              | 124,221                    | -                                | -                        | (23,970)                          | 100,251                     |\n| 28 September 2018              | 117,260                    | -                                | -                        | (117,260)                         | -                           |\n| Total Share Reward Plan shares | 453,518                    | 293,737                          |                          | (244,499)                         | 502,756                     |\n| 2021                           |                            |                                  |                          |                                   |                             |\n| 28 September 2020              | -                          | 233,496                          | $14.39                   | (21,459)                          | 212,037                     |\n| 28 September 2019              | 136,629                    | -                                | -                        | (12,408)                          | 124,221                     |\n| 28 September 2018              | 127,556                    | -                                | -                        | (10,296)                          | 117,260                     |\n| 29 September 2017              | 76,836                     | -                                | -                        | (76,836)                          | -                           |\n| Total Share Reward Plan shares | 341,021                    | 233,496                          |                          | (120,999)                         | 453,518                     |\n\nThe expense recognised in profit or loss, as part of employee benefits expense during the year in relation to the SRP, was $2 million (2021: $3 million).\n\n## Long-Term Incentive (LTI) Plan\n\nThe LTI plan provides for a grant of performance rights to eligible participants subject to AGL's performance against pre-determined metrics over a four-year performance period (prior to FY20, a three-year performance period applied). The LTI is governed by the AGL Employee Share Plan Rules. Participation is determined annually at the discretion of the Board.\n\nGenerally, performance rights are forfeited on cessation of employment. The Board has discretion with reference to the relevant facts and circumstances of the cessation to vest all or part of the balance, or to authorise a portion of the award to be retained and assessed postemployment.\n\nIn FY20, the LTI performance period was extended from three years to four years to better reflect the business planning cycle. To ensure executives a smooth transition to the extension of the performance period, a Bridging Grant was made at the same quantum as the FY20 LTI to supplement the new four-year grant by providing an opportunity for LTI vesting every year.\n\n|",

Expected volatility is based on the historical share price volatility over the past three years.\n\n|                                                     | 2022 FY22 LTI   | 2021 FY21 LTI   | 2020 FY20 LTI   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Grant date                                          | 29 October 2021 | 28 October 2020 | 18 October 2019 |\n| Weighted average fair value at grant date           | $2.39           | $8.38           | $12.72          |\n| Share price at grant date                           | $5.72           | $12.93          | $19.13          |\n| Expected volatility                                 | 27.0%           | 23.0%           | 21.0%           |\n| Expected dividend yield                             | 6.0%            | 5.3%            | 4.8%            |\n| Risk free interest rate (based on government bonds) | 0.7%            | 0.2%            | 0.8%            |\n\nThe expense recognised in profit or loss as part of employee benefits expense during the year in relation to performance rights granted to executives under the LTI Plan was $2 million (2021: nil).\n\n## Shares purchased on-market\n\nDuring the financial year ended 30 June 2022, 293,737 (2021: 308,720) AGL shares were purchased on-market at an average of $5.96 (2021: $14.66) per share, for a total consideration of $1,750,673 (2021: $4,525,545), to satisfy employee entitlements pursuant to the SRP and the LTI Plan.\n\n## Other equity arrangements\n\n## Share Purchase Plan (SPP)\n\nThe SPP is AGL's salary sacrifice plan that enables eligible employees to contribute up to $5,000 per financial year from their ongoing fixed remuneration and/or short-term incentive (STI) award into acquiring ordinary shares in AGL. The SPP is governed under the AGL General Employee Share Plan Rules. Shares granted pursuant to the SPP are subject to a trading restriction of the earlier of four years (from the start of the financial year in which they are acquired) or the participant's cessation of employment. The holding lock is in place to provide for a deferral of income tax for participants.\n\nEligible participants include all permanent AGL employees. Non-Executive Directors, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, and members of the executive team are excluded from SPP participation.\n\nDetails of share movements in the SPP during the year are set out below:\n\n| Share movements                  | Balance at 1 July Number   | Granted during the year Number   | Fair Value per share $   | Released during the year Number   | Balance at 30 June Number   |\n|----------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 2022                             |                            |                                  |                          |                                   |                             |\n| Employees                        | 531,681                    | 378,196                          | $7.08                    | (244,433)                         | 665,444                     |\n| Total share purchase plan shares | 531,681                    | 378,196                          |                          | (244,433)                         | 665,444                     |\n| 2021                             |                            |                                  |                          |                                   |                             |\n| Employees                        | 333,851                    | 296,199                          | $11.06                   | (98,369)                          | 531,681                     |\n| Total share purchase plan shares | 333,851                    | 296,199                          |                          | (98,369)                          | 531,681                     |",

The fair value is measured at grant date and recognised over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the performance rights. The fair value at grant date is determined by an independent valuer.\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, AGL revises its estimate of the number of performance rights expected to vest. The amount previously recognised as an expense is only adjusted when the performance rights do not vest due to non-market related conditions.\n\nPursuant to the AGL Share Reward Plan, shares are issued to eligible employees for no consideration. On the grant date, the market value of the shares issued is recognised as an employee benefits expense, with a corresponding increase in the employee equity benefits reserve. Shares under the AGL Share Reward Plan are subject to disposal restrictions and holding locks.\n\n|",

Financial instruments (cont.)\n\n## Estimation of fair values\n\nThe following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 Receivables/payables with a remaining life of less than six months, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value. All other receivables/payables are discounted to determine the fair value if the effect of discounting is material.\n- \u00b7 The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates that reflect the credit risk of various counterparties. Interest rate and cross currency swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates that reflect the credit risk of various counterparties.\n- \u00b7 The fair value of borrowings is determined as the present value of future contracted cash flows and credit adjustments. Cash flows are discounted using standard valuation techniques at applicable market yield having regard to timing of cash flows.\n- \u00b7 The fair value of energy derivatives is determined as the present value of future contracted cash flows and credit adjustments. Cash flows are discounted using standard valuation techniques at applicable market yield having regard to timing of cash flows.\n- \u00b7 The fair value of lease liabilities is estimated as the present value of future cash flows discounted where the effect of discounting is material.\n- \u00b7 The fair value of deferred consideration is determined as the present value of future contracted cash flows and credit adjustments. Cash flows are discounted using standard valuation techniques at applicable market yield having regard to timing of cash flows.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of fair value movements in Level 3 financial instruments.\n\n|                                                    | 2022 $m   | 2021 $m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Opening balance                                    | 741       | 456       |\n| Total gains or losses recognised in profit or loss |           |           |\n| Settlements during the year                        | (456)     | 33        |\n| Changes in fair value                              | (917)     | 229       |\n| Acquisition                                        | -         | (7)       |\n| Transfer from Level 3 to Level 2 1                 | (1)       | -         |\n| Premiums                                           | -         | 5         |\n| Purchases                                          | (12)      | 25        |\n| Disposals                                          | (156)     | -         |\n| Closing balance                                    | (801)     | 741       |\n\nThe total gains or losses for the year included a loss of $870 million relating to energy derivative Level 3 contracts held at the end of the reporting period (2021: a gain of $189 million). Fair value gains or losses on energy derivatives are included in other expenses in the line item 'Gain on fair value of financial instruments' in Note 4.\n\nThe sensitivity of Level 3 contracts with significant unobservable inputs, where the inputs are higher by 10 percent is $(276) million and lower by 10 percent is $276 million (profit after tax (decrease)/increase)). Input changes were applied to forward prices with references to electricity market and emissions schemes, cost-based indexes, contract volumes and management's assumptions on long-term commodity curves.\n\n## (c) Capital risk management\n\nAGL's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an appropriate capital structure of debt and equity.\n\nIn order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, AGL may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. AGL's overall capital management strategy remains unchanged from 2021.\n\nThe capital structure of AGL consists of net debt (borrowings offset by cash and cash equivalents) and total equity (comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings).\n\nAGL monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio and funds from operations (FFO) to interest expense cover.\n\n|",

AGL's overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of markets and seeks to manage the impact of these risks on its financial performance. AGL uses a range of derivative financial instruments to hedge these risk exposures.\n\nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the risk management policy and framework. The Board has established the Audit & Risk Management Committee (the Committee), which is responsible for approving AGL's risk management policy and framework for identifying, assessing and managing risk. The Committee is also responsible for reviewing and updating the risk profile, monitoring the effectiveness of the risk management framework and reviewing at least annually the implementation of the risk management policy and framework. The Committee reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities.\n\nAGL has written policies covering specific areas, such as interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, energy price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments. Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed on a continuous basis.\n\n## (e)  Interest rate risk management\n\nAGL is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. The risk is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, and by the use of interest rate swap contracts or other hedging instruments.\n\nAGL regularly analyses its interest rate exposure, by taking into consideration forecast debt positions, refinancing, renewals of existing positions, alternative financing, hedging positions and the mix of fixed and floating interest rates.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, AGL had the following financial assets and liabilities exposed to floating interest rate risk:\n\n| Floating rate instruments                               | 2022 $m   | 2021 $m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Financial assets                                        |           |           |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                               | 127       | 88        |\n| Total financial assets                                  | 127       | 88        |\n| Financial liabilities                                   |           |           |\n| USD senior notes (after effect of cross currency swaps) | 860       | 860       |\n| Bank loans                                              | 1,670     | 1,950     |\n| Interest rate swap contracts                            | (1,545)   | (1,600)   |\n| Total financial liabilities                             | 985       | 1,210     |",

The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is the Australian Bank Bill Swap (BBSW) reference rate. AGL will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis. During the year, some hedges have been de-designated due to forecast change. All underlying forecast transactions remain highly probable.\n\n## Interest rate sensitivity\n\nThe following sensitivity analysis has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the end of the reporting period and the stipulated change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, if interest rates had been 150 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, AGL's profit after tax and other comprehensive income would have been affected as follows:\n\n|                                         | Profit/(loss) after tax increase/(decrease)   | Profit/(loss) after tax increase/(decrease)   | Other comprehensive income increase/(decrease)   | Other comprehensive income increase/(decrease)   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n|                                         | 2022 $m                                       | 2021 $m 1                                     | 2022 $m                                          | 2021 $m                                          |\n| Interest rates +1.5% (150 basis points) | (9)                                           | (4)                                           | 2                                                | 4                                                |\n| Interest rates -1.5% (150 basis points) | 9                                             | 4                                             | -                                                | (4)                                              |\n\n## (f) Foreign currency risk management\n\nAGL undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies; consequently, exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise. Foreign currency risk arises primarily from overseas term borrowings and firm commitments for the purchase of plant and equipment which are denominated in foreign currencies. Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swap contracts.\n\n## Forward foreign exchange contracts - cash flow hedges\n\nAGL's Corporate Treasury policy requires the hedging of foreign currency risk using forward foreign exchange contracts. The Corporate Treasury's policy is to hedge currency exposures of anticipated cash flows in excess of $2 million and to not enter into forward foreign exchange contracts until a firm commitment is in place.\n\n|",

Financial instruments (cont.)\n\nAGL enters into contracts to purchase plant and equipment denominated in foreign currencies. AGL enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising from these anticipated future purchases, which are designated as cash flow hedges. During the year, no hedges were de-designated and all underlying forecast transactions remain highly probable to occur as per original forecast.\n\nThere were $1 million of forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the end of the reporting period (2021: $139 million).

Financial instruments (cont.)\n\n## (g) Energy price risk management\n\nAGL is exposed to energy price risk associated with the purchase and/or sale of electricity, gas, oil and environmental products. AGL manages energy risk through an established risk management framework consisting of policies to place appropriate risk limits on overall energy market exposures and transaction limits for approved energy commodities, requirements for delegations of authority on trading, regular reporting of exposures and segregation of duties.\n\nIt is AGL's policy to actively manage the energy price exposure arising from both forecast energy supply and customer energy load. AGL's risk management policy for energy price risk is to hedge forecast future positions for up to five years into the future.\n\nExposures to fluctuations in the wholesale market energy prices are managed through the use of various types of hedge contracts including derivative financial instruments.\n\nThe following table details the fair value of energy derivatives outstanding at the end of the reporting period:\n\n|                                                       | 2022 $m   | 2021 $m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Energy derivative financial assets - current          |           |           |\n| Energy derivatives - economic hedges                  | 4,559     | 447       |\n|                                                       | 4,559     | 447       |\n| Energy derivative financial assets - non-current      |           |           |\n| Energy derivatives - economic hedges                  | 216       | 637       |\n|                                                       | 216       | 637       |\n| Energy derivative financial liabilities - current     |           |           |\n| Energy derivatives - economic hedges                  | 3,475     | 264       |\n|                                                       | 3,475     | 264       |\n| Energy derivative financial liabilities - non-current |           |           |\n| Energy derivatives - economic hedges                  | 364       | 109       |\n|                                                       | 364       | 109       |\n\n## Energy derivatives - economic hedges\n\nAGL has entered into certain derivative instruments for economic hedging purposes under the Board-approved risk management policies, which do not satisfy the requirements for hedge accounting under AASB 9 Financial Instruments . These derivatives are therefore required to be categorised as held for trading and are classified in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as economic hedges. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in profit or loss as part of (loss)/gain on fair value of financial instruments.\n\n|",

The movement in other comprehensive income is due to the reclassification and/or amortisation of historical hedge accounted derivatives.\n\n## (h) Hedge effectiveness\n\nThe following table details the effectiveness of the hedging relationships and the amounts reclassified from hedging reserve to profit or loss:\n\n|                                                                         | Cash flow hedges   | Cash flow hedges   | Cash flow hedges   | Fair Value Hedges   | Fair Value Hedges   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| 2022                                                                    | USD CCIRS $m       | IRS $m             | FX $m              | Energy $m           | USD CCIRS $m        |\n| Carrying amount of the hedging instrument                               |                    |                    |                    |                     |                     |\n| - Assets                                                                | 143                | 122                | -                  | -                   | -                   |\n| - Liabilities                                                           | -                  | (1)                | -                  | -                   | (48)                |\n| Total carrying amount of the hedging instrument                         | 143                | 121                | -                  | -                   | (48)                |\n| Change in value of hedging instrument                                   | 89                 | 143                | -                  | -                   | (92)                |\n| Change in value of hedged item                                          | (89)               | (143)              | -                  | -                   | 94                  |\n| Change in value of the hedging instrument recognised in reserve         | 2                  | 123                | -                  | -                   | n/a                 |\n| Amount recognised in profit or loss on discontinued hedge relationships | -                  | 3                  | -                  | -                   | -                   |\n| Hedge ineffectiveness recognised in profit or loss 1                    | -                  | -                  | -                  | -                   | (2)                 |\n| Amount reclassified from hedge reserve to profit or loss 2              | 87                 | 21                 | -                  | -                   | n/a                 |\n| Balance in cash flow hedge reserve for continuing hedges                | (4)                | 127                | -                  | -                   | n/a                 |\n\n- 1.

AGL's exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread among approved counterparties.\n\nTrade and other receivables consist of approximately 3.95 million residential, small business and large commercial and industrial services to customers, in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia. Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of customers and, where appropriate, an allowance for expected credit loss is raised. AGL does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single customer or any group of customers.\n\nAGL limits its exposure to credit risk by investing surplus funds and entering into derivative financial instruments only with approved financial institutions that have a credit rating of at least A from Standard & Poor's and within credit limits assigned to each financial institution. Derivative counterparties are limited to high creditworthy financial institutions and other organisations in the energy industry. AGL also utilises International Swaps and Derivative Association (ISDA) agreements with derivative counterparties in order to limit exposure to credit risk through the netting of amounts receivable from and amounts payable to individual counterparties.\n\nAt the end of the reporting period, there was a significant concentration of credit risk with certain counterparties in relation to energy derivatives undertaken in accordance with the AGL's hedging and risk management activities. The carrying amount of the financial assets recognised in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the maximum exposure to credit risk.\n\nAGL does not hold any collateral or other credit enhancements to cover this credit risk.\n\n## (j) Liquidity risk management\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that AGL will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, who have established an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of AGL's short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.\n\nAGL manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.\n\nThe following table details AGL's remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities with agreed repayment periods. The amounts are based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities on the earliest date on which AGL can be required to pay. The table includes both interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are at floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate curves at the end of the reporting period.\n\n|",

Financial instruments (cont.)\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\n## Financial assets\n\n## Non-derivative financial assets\n\nClassification\n\nAGL classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:\n\n- \u00b7 those to be measured subsequently at fair value (either through other comprehensive income, or through profit or loss), and\n- \u00b7 those to be measured at amortised cost.\n\nThe classification depends on AGL's business model for managing financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows. For assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or other comprehensive income. For investments in debt instruments, this will depend on the business model in which the investment is held. For investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether AGL has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity instrument at fair value through other comprehensive income. AGL reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.\n\n## Measurement\n\nAt initial recognition, AGL measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss.\n\n## Debt instruments\n\nSubsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on AGL's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which AGL classifies its debt instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 Amortised cost: Assets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. A gain or loss on a debt instrument that is subsequently measured at amortised cost and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised or impaired. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method.\n- \u00b7 Fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI): Assets that are held for collecting contractual cash flows and through sale on specified dates. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVOCI is recognised in other comprehensive income.\n- \u00b7 Fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL): Assets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss and is not part of a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss and presented net in the statement of profit or loss within other gains/(losses) in the period in which it arises.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nOn initial recognition, AGL elects to classify each equity instrument as FVTPL or FVOCI. AGL subsequently measures all equity investments at fair value. Where AGL has elected to present fair value gains or losses on equity investments in other comprehensive income, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains or losses to profit or loss following the derecognition of the investment. Dividends from such investments continue to be recognised in profit or loss as other income when AGL's right to receive payments is established. Impairment losses (and reversal of impairment losses) on equity investments measured at FVOCI are not reported separately from other changes in fair value. Changes in the fair value of equity instrument financial assets classified as FVTPL are recognised in expenses in the statement of profit or loss as applicable.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments are stated at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Where derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of changes in fair value depends on the nature of the item being hedged. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging relationship is revoked, the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.\n\nAGL documents at the inception of the hedging transaction the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items including whether the instrument is expected to offset changes in cash flows of hedged items. AGL documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions at the inception of each hedge relationship.\n\n## Fair value hedge\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The change in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the change in the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in profit or loss in the line item relating to the hedged item.\n\n|",

Financial instruments (cont.)\n\n## ACCOUNTING POLICY\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised to profit or loss from that date.\n\n## Cash flow hedge\n\nThe effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity, limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item on a present value basis from the inception of the hedge. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss, within other expenses.\n\nWhen option contracts are used to hedge forecast transactions, AGL may elect to designate only the intrinsic value of the option contract as the hedging instrument. Gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the change in intrinsic value of the option contracts are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve in equity. Gains or losses related to the time value element of the option are recognised in a cost of hedging reserve.\n\nWhen cross-currency contracts are used to hedge forecast transactions, AGL may elect to designate only the change in fair value of the cross-currency contract related to the spot component as the hedging instrument. Gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the change in the spot component of the cross-currency contracts are recognised in the cash flow\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\n## Fair value of financial instruments\n\nManagement uses their judgement in selecting an appropriate valuation technique for financial instruments not quoted in an active market. For derivative financial instruments, assumptions are made based on quoted market rates adjusted for specific features of the instrument. Other financial instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow analysis based on assumptions supported, where possible, by observable market prices and rates.\n\nhedge reserve in equity. The change in the currency basis spread element of the contract that relates to the hedged item is recognised within other comprehensive income in the costs of hedging reserve within equity. In some cases, AGL may designate the full change in fair value of the cross-currency contract (including currency basis spread) as the hedging instrument. In such cases, the gains or losses relating to the effective portion of the change in fair value of the entire cross-currency contract are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve within equity.\n\nAmounts accumulated in equity are reclassified in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss, as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of hedge contracts are ultimately recognised in profit or loss as the hedged item affects profit or loss within expenses.\n- \u00b7 The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of the interest rate swaps hedging variable rate borrowings is recognised in profit or loss within 'finance costs'.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires, or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative deferred gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging in equity at that time remains in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. When the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss and deferred costs of hedging that were reported in equity are immediately reclassified to profit or loss. Hedge ineffectiveness is recognised in profit or loss within other expenses.",

Summary of other significant accounting policies\n\nAGL Energy Limited (the Parent Entity) is a company limited by shares incorporated in Australia whose shares are publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). The address of its registered office is Level 24, 200 George Street, Sydney NSW 2000 Australia.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise the Parent Entity and its controlled entities (together referred to as AGL). For the purposes of preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Parent Entity is a for-profit entity.\n\nThe principal activities of AGL are described in Note 1.\n\n## (a) Statement of compliance\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are general purpose financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations as issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and the Corporations Act 2001 .\n\nThe consolidated financial statements also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Directors on 19 August 2022.\n\n## (b) Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of historical cost, except for derivative financial instruments and equity instrument financial assets, which are measured at fair value. Historical cost is generally based on the fair values of the consideration given in exchange for assets. All amounts are presented in Australian dollars, which is the functional and presentation currency of AGL, unless otherwise noted.\n\nThe Parent Entity is a company of the kind referred to in ASIC Corporations Instrument 2016/191, dated 24 March 2016, and in accordance with that Instrument, amounts in the financial statements are rounded off to the nearest million dollars, unless otherwise indicated.\n\nThe significant accounting policies that have been adopted in the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements are set out below.\n\n## (c) Adoption of new and revised accounting standards and Interpretations\n\nAGL has applied the required amendments to Standards and Interpretations that are relevant to its operations and effective for the current reporting period for the first time for the financial year commencing 1 July 2021. These did not have any material impact on the disclosures or on the amounts recognised in AGL's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## (d) Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Parent Entity and entities (including special purpose entities) controlled by the Parent Entity (its subsidiaries). Control is achieved when the Parent Entity is exposed to or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\nAll intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full on consolidation.\n\n## (e) Foreign currency transactions and balances\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate at the end of the reporting period.\n\nNon-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.\n\nForeign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.\n\n## (f) Standards and Interpretations on issue not yet adopted\n\nThe following accounting standards, accounting standard amendments and interpretations are due for adoption for the year ending 30 June 2024:\n\n- \u00b7 AASB 2020-1 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current;\n- \u00b7 AASB 2020-6 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Classification of Liabilities as Current or Noncurrent - Deferral of Effective Date;\n- \u00b7 AASB 2021-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Disclosure of Accounting Policies and Definition of Accounting Estimates; and\n- \u00b7 AASB 2021-5 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction.\n\nThe standards and interpretations listed above and the impact of the IBOR reform are not expected to have a material impact on AGL's financial results or financial position on adoption.",

Our  responsibilities  under  those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Report section of this report.  We  are  independent  of  the  Group  in  accordance  with  the  auditor  independence  requirements  of  the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board's APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the 'Code') that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia.

In particular, forecast price and  volume assumptions  and  their  interrelationship with  forecast  emissions  costs  and  energy procurement costs may not appropriately reflect actual changes  in  supply  and demand  due  to  the  potential  impact  of climate change.\n- \u00b7 As  disclosed  in  Section  3.2.4  of  the operating  &  financial  review  within  the annual report and Note 15 to the financial statements, management  has  brought forward the closure dates of thermal coal power  stations  in  line  with  AGL's  climate commitments  announced  in February 2022.  The  forecast  useful  lives  of  the thermal coal power stations may be further reduced  as  Australian  federal  and  state governments  move  towards  'net  zero' emissions  targets.  As  a  consequence,  the depreciation  expense  may  be  materially increased, a material impairment of property,  plant  and  equipment  may  be required in the future and the provision for environmental rehabilitation  may need to be materially increased due to the potential acceleration of timing of performing rehabilitation.\n\nAs  disclosed  in  Section  3.2.4  of  the  operating  and financial  review  within  the  annual  report,  AGL  has not produced a stand-alone Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosure (TCFD) report this year. AGL will release updated TCFD scenario analysis of different decarbonisation pathways for the National Electricity  Market following the review of strategic direction  which  AGL  is  currently  completing.  The\n\n## How the scope of our audit responded to the Key Audit Matter\n\nWe  held  discussions  with  management  and  a  group  of internal specialists with specific climate change, audit and accounting  specialisation  to  identify  how  the  potential financial  reporting  impact  of  climate  change  affects  the financial statements.\n\nIn respect of forecast assumptions used by management in assessing  the  recoverable  amount  of  property,  plant  and equipment and intangible assets, our procedures included, but were not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 in conjunction  with  our  valuation  specialists assessing and challenging the key assumptions for forecast price and volume assumptions used in the forecast cash flows, by comparing these assumptions  to  historical  results,  economic  data and  industry  forecasts,  considering  the  potential impact  of  climate  change,  where  applicable.  In doing  this,  we  obtained  third  party  reports  and information  assessing  the  National  Electricity Market,  which  included  information  related  to energy  pricing,  emissions  costs,  procurement costs,  supply,  demand,  government  policy  and estimated  plant  closure  dates.  This  included  the Australian Energy Market Operator's 2022 Integrated  System  Plan  and  other  third-party National Electricity Market outlook reports.\n\nIn respect  of  the  forecast  useful  lives  adopted  by management,  our  procedures  included,  but  were  not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 assessing and challenging management's changes to useful lives during the year, including the impact to  the  financial  statements,  and  assessing  and challenging management's assertion as at 30 June 2022  that  no  further  changes  were  required  to useful  lives  as  a  consequence  of  the  potential impact  of  climate  change.  In  doing  this,  we obtained  third  party  reports  and  information assessing  the  National  Electricity  Market,  which included  information  related  to  energy  pricing, emissions costs, procurement  costs,  supply, demand, government policy and estimated plant closure dates. This included the Australian Energy Market  Operator's  2022  Integrated  System  Plan and  other  third-party  National  Electricity  Market outlook reports.\n\n|",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material  uncertainty  exists,  we  are  required  to  draw attention  in  our  auditor's  report  to  the  related disclosures  in  the  financial  report  or,  if  such  disclosures  are  inadequate,  to  modify  our  opinion.  Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and  whether  the  financial  report  represents  the  underlying  transactions  and  events  in  a  manner  that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities  within  the  Group  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  financial  report.  We  are  responsible  for  the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.",

A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.  Accordingly, we do not express a reasonable assurance opinion about whether the subject matter information has been properly prepared, in all material respects, in accordance the Reporting Criteria.\n\n|",

Additionally, non-financial data may be subject to more inherent limitations than financial data, given both its nature and the methods used for determining, calculating, and sampling or estimating such data.\n\n## Restricted Use\n\nThis report has been prepared for use by the management of AGL for the purpose of assisting directors and management in their reporting of the Selected Annual KPI scorecard disclosures.

The Investor Centre provides you with easy access to important information about AGL's performance, including annual reports, investor presentations, share price graphs and general security holder information.\n\nThe Shareholder Services section in the Investor Centre also provides access to update your details with the Share Registry, Computershare, including:\n\n- \u00b7 checking your holding balance;\n- \u00b7 viewing, saving or printing interest payment summaries, transaction summaries and dividend statements for shareholders;\n- \u00b7 updating or amending your bank account or DRP Instructions for shareholders;\n- \u00b7 electing to receive communications electronically; and\n- \u00b7 downloading a variety of forms.\n\nComputershare also offers shareholders the ability to register and create a portfolio view of their holdings. Registration is free and enables shareholders to view and update multiple holdings in AGL (or other clients Computershare act as registry for) using a single login. To create a portfolio, please go to wwwau.computershare.com/investor\n\n## Share Registry\n\nShareholders with enquiries about their shareholdings can also contact AGL's Share Registry:\n\nComputershare Investor Services Pty Limited GPO Box 2975\n\nMelbourne Victoria 3001 Australia\n\nTelephone:\n\n1800 824 513 (free call within Australia)\n\nInternational:+61 3 9415 4253\n\nEmail:\n\naglenergy@computershare.com.au\n\nWebsite:\n\nwww-au.computershare.com/Investor\n\nWhen communicating with the Share Registry, it will assist if you can quote your current address together with your Security Reference Number (SRN) or Holder Identification Number (HIN) as shown on your Issuer Sponsored/CHESS statements.\n\n## Final share dividend\n\nThe final dividend of 10.0 cents per share, unfranked, will be paid on 27 September 2022. As the final dividend will only be paid via direct credit, Australian and New Zealand shareholders need to nominate a bank, building society or credit union account within these jurisdictions. Payments are electronically credited on the dividend payment date and confirmed by a mailed or electronic payment advice. Payment instructions can either be lodged online or an appropriate form can be downloaded from Computershare's website.\n\n## Dividend Reinvestment Plan\n\nGiven the status of the review of AGL's strategic direction, in order for AGL to manage its ongoing continuous disclosure obligations the Board has determined that the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) will not operate for the final FY22 dividend. It is the Board's intention to reinstate the DRP when circumstances allow.\n\n## On-market share buy-back and shares purchased onmarket\n\nAGL is not currently undertaking an on-market share buy-back.\n\nDuring the financial year ended 30 June 2022, 689,908 AGL shares were purchased on-market at an average price of $6.80 per share to satisfy employee entitlements under the AGL Share Reward Plan, AGL Share Purchase Plan, AGL Restricted Equity Plan and the AGL Long-Term Incentive Plan.\n\n## Reporting to shareholders\n\nThe Corporations Act requires AGL to provide shareholders with access to this Annual Report on AGL's website, unless a shareholder has specifically requested to be sent a printed copy. Shareholders seeking a printed copy of the Annual Report should contact Computershare. The online Annual Report is available at agl.com.au/ about-agl/investors/annual-reports . Past annual reports are also available via AGL's website.\n\n## Change of name, address or banking details\n\nShareholders who are Issuer Sponsored should advise the Share Registry immediately of a change of name, address or banking details for dividends electronically credited to a bank account. All such changes must be advised online or in writing and cannot be accepted by telephone. For a change of name, supporting documentation must accompany your written advice. Appropriate forms can also be downloaded from the Share Registry's website.\n\nShareholders who are CHESS Sponsored should instruct their sponsoring broker in writing to notify the Share Registry of any change.\n\n## Tax File Number (TFN)/Australian Business Number (ABN)\n\nIt is not compulsory to provide a TFN or ABN. However AGL will be required to deduct tax at the top marginal rate from the unfranked portion of any dividend paid to shareholders who have not provided either a TFN/ABN or details of a relevant TFN exemption. TFN/ABN notification forms can be obtained by contacting the Share Registry, by lodging your details online or by downloading the appropriate form from the Share Registry's website.\n\n## Consolidation of shareholdings\n\nShareholders who wish to consolidate multiple shareholdings into a single shareholding should advise the Share Registry or their sponsoring broker, whichever is applicable, in writing.\n\n## Company Secretary\n\nMelinda Hunter BCom LLB\n\n|",
