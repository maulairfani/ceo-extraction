And now - as we write - our thoughts are with colleagues and all those in T\u00fcrkiye and Syria following the terrible earthquakes recently.\n\nWe take this opportunity to offer joint reflections on what bp has delivered during this time. We do so mindful of the different roles and responsibilities we each perform, but with a shared belief that by working closely together we can continue to deliver value for you, the owners of the company.\n\n## Safety above all\n\nThe progress we summarize below is built on a recognition that nothing is more important than safe and reliable operations.\n\nWhile we have made some improvements, for example, seeing 19% fewer tier 1 and 2 process safety events , we have also had challenges. Tragically, four people lost their lives while working for bp last year, and a pedestrian was killed in a collision with one of our vehicles.\n\nbp continues to focus on actions to maintain and enhance the effectiveness of the safety processes and procedures at bp operations, including supporting a culture of care for others. We firmly believe that when colleagues care deeply about each other, then they really look out for each other, and everyone is safer.\n\n## Performing while transforming\n\nGuided by our purpose - to reimagine energy for people and our planet - bp's focus has been to perform while transforming. Put another way - on delivering the energy the world wants and needs today and tomorrow while creating long-term sustainable value for shareholders. It is still early in our transformation, but we believe the company has made substantial progress. We are a stronger bp today.\n\nIn 2022 bp delivered its highest upstream plant reliability on record and its lowest per-barrel production costs since 2006. These two performance measures, combined with high commodity prices, contributed towards operating cash flow of $40.9 billion for the year, an underlying replacement cost profit a of $27.7 billion, ROACE b of 30.5% and net debt c of $21.4 billion at the end of the year.\n\nIn a sign of increasing confidence in our strategy, the board decided to increase the dividend per ordinary share by 21% through the year and we announced a total of $11.25 billion to shareholders in buybacks from 2022 surplus cash flow . We are delivering for shareholders by executing our clear, consistent and disciplined financial frame.\n\n- a Nearest GAAP equivalent measure to underlying replacement cost profit of $27.7 billion, which is loss for the year adjusted for inventory holding gains and net of adjusting items.\n- b Nearest GAAP equivalent measure to ROACE of 30.5%.

        "page_content": "In terms of transformation, the proportion of bp's total capital investment in what we call our transition growth engines has risen from around 3% in 2019 to around 30% in 2022. This included:\n\n- \u00b7 The acquisition in 2022 of Archaea Energy, a leading US producer of renewable natural gas, accelerating the growth of our bioenergy business.\n- \u00b7 The establishment of new businesses in offshore wind and hydrogen.\n- \u00b7 A tripling in the number of bp pulse EV charge points  globally, from more than 7,500 in 2019, to around 22,000.\n- \u00b7 The addition of more than 750 strategic convenience sites  to our global retail network since 2019.\n\nSince 2019, bp has also reduced emissions from our oil and gas operations and production, further rationalized the portfolio and started up 13 major projects .\n\n## The energy trilemma\n\nRecent events have made it clear that the world wants and needs a better and more balanced energy system, delivering energy that is not only lower carbon, but secure and affordable too this is known as the energy trilemma.\n\nTransforming today's global energy system so that it can consistently deliver all three is a complex challenge. To tackle it, the energy transition must accelerate. When bp published the Energy Outlook 2023 earlier this year, one of its insights was that Russia's war in Ukraine is likely to accelerate that transition. At the same time, the energy transition needs to be orderly - decarbonizing rapidly while maintaining the balance of supply and demand that's needed to help avoid, as best as possible, the energy shortages and price rises that have been so difficult for people and businesses.\n\nbp's integrated energy company strategy is deliberately designed to help on both counts: contributing to the energy transition and keeping energy flowing today.\n\n## Leaning in further\n\nThe increasing confidence we have in bp's strategy - along with how the world has changed - are what in February convinced us to lean further into our strategy.\n\nFirst, by planning to invest more into our transition growth engines through this decade than under our previous plans - up to $8 billion more by 2030. That includes making investments that can help people decarbonize their lives and their businesses sooner - such as EV charging, sustainable aviation fuels and\n\nhydrogen for hard-to-abate industries. Our cumulative investment in these transition growth engines is expected to be in a range of $55-65 billion between 2023 and 2030.\n\nSecond, by planning to invest more into oil and gas - again, up to $8 billion more by 2030. With investments into resilient, high-quality oil and gas projects - prioritizing where we can deliver quickly and efficiently, and in ways that minimize additional emissions and maximize our contribution to energy security.\n\nAs a result of these changes, bp is aiming for its oil and gas production to be around two million barrels a day by 2030. This is around 25% lower than in 2019, but higher than our previous aim of around a 40% reduction by 2030. With this in mind, bp's aim to lower the emissions from the use of its production has been adjusted to 20-30% by 2030. That is lower than our previous aim of 35-40% by 2030, but still significant. Taken in its entirety, we believe bp's strategy including its specific net zero aims across operations, production and sales - remains consistent with the Paris goals.\n\n## Plan for growth\n\nThis is a plan for delivery, for growth and for value creation. And as bp's earnings grow, we can:\n\n- \u00b7 Invest more in bp's transition and in the energy transition.\n- \u00b7 Invest more in today's energy's security.\n\n- \u00b7 Create more value for bp's shareholders.\n- \u00b7 Benefit governments and society with the taxes and revenues generated by bp's increased earnings.\n\nWe have a plan. The strategy is working, and our people are fully behind it. Now it is about execution - operationally and strategically.\n\n## Closing thanks\n\nYour company is running well. It continues to build capability and skills, including attracting talent to bp from a broad range of sectors. And it is becoming more diverse, and stronger for that.\n\nThank you - as always - for your support. In a challenging year, some of our most rewarding moments were the many meetings we enjoyed with shareholders. Whether you are a long-term bp shareholder or a recent investor, we thank you for the faith you have placed in bp.\n\nFinally, we thank bp's employees for all their work during 2022. Quite simply, they have been outstanding.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHelge Lund Chair 10 March 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBernard Looney Chief executive officer",

Concerns about energy security, fuel prices and emissions are boosting prospects for non-fossil fuels - especially renewables - as the world transitions towards a lower carbon future.\n\n## 2.3%\n\nyear-on-year increase in global oil consumption in 2022 a\n\n## (0.8)%\n\nestimated decrease in global gas consumption in 2022 b\n\n## 10.8%\n\nexpected year-on-year increase in renewable electricity capacity in 2022 c\n\nThe global economy experienced a broad-based slowdown in 2022, following a post-COVID-19 lockdown economic rebound in 2021.\n\nSoaring energy prices, multi-decade high inflation levels, tightening monetary policy conditions, the Russia-Ukraine war, and COVID-19 contributed to a below-average growth rate of 3.4% for the global economy in 2022 d .\n\nGrowth in advanced economies was 2.7%, following falls in GDP in the US during the first half of the year, and an economic slowdown in the euro area in the second half. Growth in emerging markets slowed to 3.9%, with eastern Europe hit hard by the Russia-Ukraine war and China experiencing extended COVID-19 lockdowns and a slowdown in the property sector.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGlobal oil production increased by 4.7mmb/d in 2022 (+4.9%) a . Despite western sanctions on Russian oil exports, Russian export volumes remained at 97% of pre-invasion levels, as oil shipments to the EU and OECD Asian countries are redirected to China, India, and T\u00fcrkiye.\n\nThe EU imported 2.1mmb/d of crude and products in December 2022, ahead of the products-related embargo coming into effect in early February 2023.\n\nGlobal oil demand continued its post-COVID-19 recovery a , increasing by 2.2mmb/d in 2022 (+2.3%). Europe's energy crisis, a strong US dollar, and persistent COVID-19 lockdowns in China all contributed to slower energy demand growth and weaker oil demand growth. Brent increased by $30.4/bbl in 2022 as a result of the rebound in oil demand and the oil risk premium associated with the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\n## Natural gas\n\nThe loss of Russian pipeline gas supply to the EU in 2022 - equivalent to around 20% of EU gas consumption in 2021 - following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, drove European gas and Asian LNG prices to record-high levels. e\n\nEuropean efforts to replace Russian gas supply and recover storage stocks in time for winter led to fierce global competition for spot LNG cargoes, as Europe priced up to attract LNG supply away from other demand regions.\n\nIn Asia, spot LNG prices increased to encourage fuel switching and minimize LNG demand.\n\nCOVID-19 measures suppressed gas demand in China and, combined with higher gas supply from other sources, saw Chinese LNG demand drop -22bcm, equivalent to around a third of the year-on-year increase in LNG imports to the EU and UK in 2022. f\n\nIn Europe, in addition to higher LNG imports, a reduction in natural gas demand also helped offset the loss of Russian gas pipeline supply to the EU. Fuel switching, efficiency improvements and imported product substitution supported lower gas demand in industry. A mild start to winter significantly reduced gas demand, limiting the need for storage withdrawals in the fourth quarter of 2022. EU storage stocks exited the year 83% full g , 13% above the five-year average.\n\nIn the US, average Henry Hub gas prices increased to levels not seen since before the 'shale revolution' on tightening factors across demand as well as supply fundamentals.\n\nUS gas consumption is estimated to have increased 6% in 2022 h , in part due to higher heating demand in the first half of the year as well as heatwaves in the summer, which increased power demand for cooling. Gas-fired generation was used to fill more of the thermal gap as coal-fired generation was constrained by weak coal supply and low coal stockpiles. US LNG exports grew with the ramp-up of new export capacity, increasing gas demand for LNG feedgas (partially offset by an outage at one of the LNG export facilities through the second half of the year). On supply, gas production growth remained subdued due to capital discipline constraints and supply chain bottlenecks through most of the year, before increasing to record high levels at the end of the summer.",

RMM values averaged a record $33.1/bbl for 2022, which was $13/bbl higher than the previous record in 2012 and around $20/bbl higher than 2021. As countries began to avoid taking Russian oil and refined products, especially diesel, middle distillate cracks rose significantly. Refining operating costs climbed steeply on the back of an increase in natural gas and electricity prices.\n\n## Power and renewables\n\nTotal renewable capacity additions in 2022 are expected to total over 350GW, 65GW more than 2021 c . This was mainly driven by an increase in solar PV and wind installations in China and Europe. Although on average and globally, the unit cost of renewable capacity increased in 2022, driven by higher commodity, freight, and energy prices, the price of natural gas, oil and coal rose much faster, helping to improve the competitiveness of renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and hydropower.\n\n- a IEA Oil Market Report, January 2023.\n- b IEA Gas Market Report, Q4 2022.\n- c IEA Renewables Report, December 2022.\n- d IMF World Economic Outlook, January 2023 update.\n- e EU Directorate-General for Energy, European Transmission System Operator data, bp Statistical Review of World Energy 2022 .\n- f S&P Global, LNG Waterborne Trade data.\n- g GIE (Gas Infrastructure Europe).\n- h EIA (Energy Information Administration).\n- i Refinitiv Data Service (Dated Brent spot price).\n- j Refinitiv Data Service (West Texas Intermediate).\n- k Refinitiv Data Service (Urals CIF Rotterdam).\n\n2022 saw a significant step change in the scale of policy support for renewables and low carbon energy in some regions, including the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) - the single largest investment in climate and energy in US history - and the RepowerEU plan, which aims to diversify Europe's energy supply and speed up the roll-out of renewables.\n\nIn Europe, high natural gas prices caused power prices to reach record highs, leading to some European countries to implement caps on the price of wholesale electricity, and support packages to help protect consumers from the increase in the cost of living. High European power prices also led to an increase in coal consumption and temporary lifetime extensions for coal-fired power plants. And a global resurgence in nuclear energy occurred, with Japan committing to restart idled nuclear reactors and some EU countries postponing reactor closures.\n\n- l Platts Henry Hub cash price.\n- m   Platts Dutch TTF Day Ahead price.\n- n Platts JKM spot price.\n- o The RMM may not be representative of the margin achieved by bp in any period because of bp's particular refinery configurations and crude and product slates. In addition, the RMM does not include estimates of energy or other variable costs.\n- p This number is updated from 13.2/bbl as stated in the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021 to reflect the 2022 RMM, which has been updated to reflect changes in bp's portfolio.\n- q Hydrogen Council.\n\n## Hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS)\n\nGlobal momentum behind hydrogen's role in decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors is accelerating, notably in industry and longdistance transportation. Several countries have published national hydrogen strategies and this is increasingly being followed by announcements of policy support. 2022 was a significant year in terms of policy support for hydrogen production.\n\nHydrogen and CCS tax credits in the IRA and the additional renewables tax credits accessible by green hydrogen  projects allow blue and green hydrogen to compete with grey hydrogen  in the near to medium term.\n\nRepowerEU outlined hydrogen production targets and allocated several billion euros in subsidies for low carbon hydrogen projects.\n\nThe pipeline of announced projects has continued to scale rapidly with cumulative clean hydrogen production capacity in 2030 projected to be 26Mtpa q .\n\nMomentum also grew for CCS in 2022, in part driven by governments providing additional incentives. Interest in CCS has been bolstered by the need to abate process emissions from heavy industries such as cement and steel manufacture, together with a growing acknowledgement of the need for negative emissions to meet the Paris goals.\n\nb",

        "page_content": "## 2023 Energy Outlook updates\n\nThe scenarios in the bp Energy Outlook 2023 (2023 Outlook) have been updated to account for two major developments: the Russia-Ukraine war and the passing of the US Inflation Reduction Act a .\n\nRussia-Ukraine war: The Russia-Ukraine war is likely to have a persistent effect on the future path of the global energy system. The 2023 Outlook models this impact through three main channels:\n\n- \u00b7 Energy security: The increased focus on energy security triggered by concerns about energy shortages and vulnerability to geopolitical events is assumed to increase countries' and regions' preference for energy produced domestically rather than imported.\n- \u00b7 Economic growth: The higher food and energy prices associated with the RussiaUkraine war have contributed to a sharp slowing in global economic growth. Further out, the war is assumed to reduce somewhat the pace of global integration and trade.\n- \u00b7 Composition of global energy supplies: The scenarios in the 2023 Outlook assume there is a persistent reduction in Russian exports of hydrocarbons.\n\nUS Inflation Reduction Act (IRA): Also included in the modelling is the IRA, which includes a package of largely supply-side measures supporting low carbon energy sources and decarbonization technologies in the US.\n\nThe impact of the IRA is concentrated in the New Momentum scenario, which represents the current pace of the energy transition and acknowledges ambition from governments and the corporate sector. In this scenario emissions are predicted to fall from 40Gt of CO 2 e in 2019 to 29Gt of CO 2e by 2050.\n\nThe Accelerated and Net Zero scenarios are less affected by the IRA given the scale of policy support already embodied in these scenarios.\n\nNet Zero delivers emissions reductions of 95% by 2050 versus 2019, in line with a 1.5 degrees rise. In Accelerated, emissions are reduced by around 75% by 2050 and can be considered consistent with a well-below-2\u00b0C rise pathway.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information see\n\nbp.com/energyoutlook\n\n## Scenarios for strategic decision making\n\nWe use scenarios to inform strategy, manage risk, and improve decision making.\n\nThe scenarios we used to inform our ambition and strategy, which we set out in 2020, were based on a collaborative approach between our economists, strategists and extended leadership team and board.\n\nSome scenarios start from today and project forward over a timeframe in which the current structure of the energy system helps to inform the pace and nature of the transition path. Others start in the future, breaking free from the inherent inertia in the energy system and look back to the present from that new perspective.\n\nIn thinking about appropriate scenarios to inform our strategy, we used both approaches.\n\n## How scenarios inform our strategy\n\nThe use of scenarios described in the 2023 Outlook, and from other organizations, aids our understanding of the energy transition and helps us to think about how different outcomes might impact our strategy.\n\nThe use of a broad range of scenarios to inform our strategy supports our efforts to make it robust and resilient to the range of uncertainty we face. Given that, we believe that it is neither useful nor sensible to try to identify one scenario as being more or less likely than another.\n\nBy considering various time horizons, we can identify key milestones or signposts which might emerge over the next five, 10 or 30 years and inform our view of the key sources of uncertainty affecting the global energy system.\n\nWe actively monitor for changes in the external environment, and refresh or review our scenarios as needed in response to these signals, as we have done with the RussiaUkraine war and the IRA.\n\nFor the purposes of testing the resilience of our strategy to the range of uncertainty in the energy transition we have used scenarios drawn from the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) 'Climate Scenario Analysis Reference Approach for Companies in the Energy System'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more on our resilience analysis and the outcome of that work, see page 58\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How we create scenarios\n\nWe quantify a range of scenarios in the 2023 Outlook using our global energy modelling system. This comprises a suite of models developed over the past 10 years to help us understand the supply and demand dynamics of the global energy system as well as production in intermediate sectors.\n\nThe modelling framework uses historical data based on the bp Statistical Review of World Energy , the International Energy Agency (IEA) and a range of other data sets.\n\nEach scenario is determined by a set of key assumptions including population and economic growth, pace of technological change, resource constraints and government policies. These are informed by expert views from external organizations including United Nations, Oxford Economics, Rystad Energy and a proprietary integrated assessment model. We benchmark our scenarios against external organizations including the IEA, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), IHS Markit and the WBCSD.\n\nPrices are used to balance supply and demand. The modelling techniques used vary by sector and include a combination of econometric modelling, least-cost optimization, adoption curves and consumer choice modelling.",

It comprises 100% of Scope 1 and 2 emissions or activities within bp's operational control boundary.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2022 performance\n\nScope 1 (direct) emissions, covered by aim 1, were 30.4MtCO 2 e - a decrease of 8% from 33.2MtCO 2e in 2021. Of these Scope 1 emissions, 29.7MtCO 2e were CO2 and 0.7MtCO2e methane b . Emissions decreased due to divestments, delivery of Sustainable emissions reductions (SERs) and other temporary operational changes. Scope 2 (indirect) emissions decreased by 0.9MtCO 2 e, to 1.5MtCO 2e, a 38% reduction compared with 2021. This decrease resulted from lower carbon power agreements, including those at our Gelsenkirchen, Cherry Point and Rotterdam sites.\n\n## Methane intensity (%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe define methane intensity as the amount of methane emissions from our upstream oil and gas operations as a percentage of the gas that goes to market from those operations. This applies to methane emissions within our operational control boundary, where we have the highest degree of control. Methane emissions from non-producing activities, such as exploration drilling, are excluded.

It is underpinned by a cash balance point of around $40 per barrel Brent, $11 per barrel RMM and $3 per mmBtu Henry Hub (all 2021 $ real). For the second quarter of 2022 bp announced a 10% increase in its quarterly dividend per ordinary share. This increase reflected the underlying performance and cash generation of the business which has enabled strong progress in delivering share buybacks and net debt reduction.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2022 bp announced a further ~10% increase in the dividend per ordinary share. This increase is underpinned by\n\nstrong underlying performance and supported by the confidence we have in delivering higher adjusted EBITDA as a result of our updated investment plans. As a result, the announced dividend per ordinary share of 6.61 cents for the fourth quarter 2022 is 21% above the level announced for the fourth quarter 2021.\n\nBased on our current forecasts, at around $60 per barrel Brent and subject to the board's discretion each quarter, we expect to have capacity for an annual increase in the dividend per ordinary share of around 4% per annum.\n\n## #2 Strong investment grade credit rating\n\nbp is committed to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating, targeting further progress within the 'A' grade credit rating. For the full year 2022 we reduced net debt by $9.2 billion to $21.4 billion - the lowest since the third quarter of 2013. And since the start of 2020 we have now increased the duration of our debt book to over 10 years and have increased the proportion of fixed rate debt to over 60%.\n\nFor 2023 we intend to allocate 40% of 2023 surplus cash flow to further strengthen the balance sheet.\n\n## Disciplined investment allocation\n\nWe are focused on the disciplined allocation of capital to deliver on our strategic objectives. In 2022 capital expenditure was $16.3 billion. We expect capital expenditure to be in a range of $16-18 billion in 2023 and $14-18 billion per annum between 2024-30. This includes expenditure on inorganic opportunities.\n\nInvestment is allocated across our businesses based on a set of criteria that balances strategic alignment, stringent hurdle rates, volatility, integration value, sustainability and risk.\n\n## #3 Investing to grow our transition growth engines\n\nWithin our $14-18 billion range (2023 $16-18 billion range) for capital expenditure, we plan to allocate $6-8 billion in 2025 rising to $7-9 billion in 2030 to our transition growth engines. This equates to over 40% of 2025 capital expenditure rising to around 50% of 2030 capital expenditure. Our cumulative investment in these transition growth engines is expected to be in a range of $55-65 billion between 2023 and 2030.\n\nIn bioenergy - biofuels and biogas - we expect cumulative capital expenditure of around\n\n40%\n\n2023 surplus cash flow\n\nTarget further progress within an 'A' grade credit rating\n\n60%\n\n2023 surplus cash flow bc\n\nCommitment to allocate \u226560% surplus cash flow b to share buybacks\n\n## Disciplined investment allocation\n\n## $16-18bn\n\n2023 capital expenditure 2024-2030: $14-18bn p.a.\n\nTransition growth engines\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOil, gas, refining and other businesses\n\n<!-- image -->",

In hydrogen and renewables & power we expect cumulative capital expenditure of around $30 billion between 2023 to 2030. In hydrogen we expect double-digit unlevered IRR and in renewables we expect 6-8% unlevered IRR.\n\n## #4 Investing to drive returns in resilient hydrocarbons\n\nThe balance of our capital expenditure will be invested outside our transition growth engines - into our oil, gas, refining and other businesses.\n\nAs we invest, our balanced investment criteria for final investment decisions (see page 32) include:\n\n- \u00b7 Seeking a payback of less than 10 years for investments in upstream oil and refining.\n- \u00b7 Seeking a payback of less than 15 years for upstream gas.\n- \u00b7 Testing against 15-20% investment hurdle rates in oil & gas at $60 per barrel.\n\nThis focused and disciplined capital frame is coupled with a deep hopper of attractive investment opportunities in oil and gas.\n\n## #5 Share buybacks\n\nWe are committed to returning at least 60% of surplus cash flow through share buybacks, subject to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating. In considering the quantum of share buybacks and in setting the dividend per ordinary share each quarter, the board will take account of factors including the cumulative level of, and outlook for, surplus cash flow, the cash balance point and the maintenance of a strong investment grade credit rating.\n\nFor 2022 we announced share buybacks of $11.25 billion from surplus cash flow. We have now announced share buybacks from 2021 and 2022 surplus cash flow of $15.4 billion.\n\nFor 2023, and subject to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating, we are committed to using 60% of surplus cash flow for share buybacks.\n\nBased on our current forecasts, at around $60 per barrel Brent and at the lower end of the capital expenditure range, we expect to be able to deliver buybacks of around $4.0 billion per annum, subject to the board's discretion each quarter.\n\nIn addition to the commitment to share buybacks from surplus cash flow, we intend to offset the expected dilution from vesting of awards under employee share schemes through share buybacks. During the first quarter 2022 we executed a $500-million share buyback to offset the expected dilution from the 2022 vesting of awards under employee share schemes.\n\n## Our investor proposition\n\nOur strategy and financial frame together underpin our investor proposition of delivering long-term value for shareholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- b By 2025, $70/bbl (2021 real), at bp planning assumptions.\n- c On average, based on bp's current forecasts, at around $60 per barrel Brent and subject to the board's discretion each quarter, bp expects to be able to deliver buybacks of around $4 billion per annum and have capacity for an annual increase in the dividend per ordinary share of around 4%.\n- d By 2025.\n\n## 2023 guidance\n\n|                                                                                       | 2022 actual   | 2023 guidance                        |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Upstream  reported production (guidance is  both reported and underlying production ) | 2.3mmboe/d    | Expected to be  broadly flat vs 2022 |\n| Total capital expenditure                                                             | $16.3bn       | $16-18bn                             |\n| Depreciation, depletion and amortization                                              | $14.3bn       | Slightly above 2022                  |\n| Divestments and other proceeds a                                                      | $3.1bn        | $2-3bn                               |\n| Gulf of Mexico oil spill payments b  (pre-tax)                                        | $1.4bn        | ~$1.3bn                              |\n| Other businesses and corporate underlying  annual charge                              | $1.2bn        | $1.1-1.3bn                           |\n| Underlying effective tax rate                                                         | 34% c         | Expected to be  around 40%           |",

It is designed to create long-term value for shareholders, while enabling delivery of our net zero ambition - to become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner, and to help the world get to net zero. It is designed to be resilient to the uncertainty of the energy transition across many different potential pathways, including various Paris-consistent pathways.\n\nIn the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021 we set out, based on three key principles, why the board considers our strategy to be consistent with the Paris goals.\n\nHere we set out, on the same three grounds, why the board continues to consider this to be the case.\n\n## Informed by Paris-consistent energy transition scenarios\n\nWe use scenarios described in the bp Energy Outlook and from other organizations to inform our core beliefs about the energy transition.\n\nWe believe that it is generally neither useful nor sensible to identify one scenario as being more or less likely than another. Therefore, considering a broad range of scenarios from multiple sources to develop and test our strategic thinking helps to reinforce our confidence in the robustness and resilience of our strategy to the range of uncertainty we face.\n\nWe are confident that our approach is sciencebased. We see the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as the most authoritative source of information on the science of climate\n\nchange and we use it and other sources to inform our strategy. The IPCC highlights that there are a range of global pathways by which the world can meet the Paris goals, with differing implications for regions, industry sectors and sources of energy.\n\nThe bp Energy Outlook 2023 has been updated to reflect the significant developments in global energy markets over the past year, including the possible impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on the pace of the energy transition. It includes three main scenarios - two of which we regard as Paris-consistent (Accelerated and Net Zero) - that we use to inform our strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## See Energy outlook, page 8 and bp.com/energyoutlook\n\n## Strategic resilience\n\nWe believe our strategy positions bp for success and resilience in a Paris-consistent world - a world that is progressing on one of the many global trajectories considered to be Parisconsistent, and ultimately meets the Paris goals.\n\nThe strategy diversifies bp's portfolio and business interests, reducing the risk that challenges facing a single business area might adversely affect bp's strategic resilience. In addition, within the inevitable constraints associated with factors such as long-term capital investments, contractual commitments and organizational capabilities at any given time, bp's ability to maintain its strategic resilience rests, in part, on the governance used to keep the strategy and associated targets and aims under review in light of new information and changes in circumstances.\n\nIn our climate-related financial disclosures on page 58, we describe how we have conducted an analysis to test our view of the resilience of our strategy to different climate-related scenarios, using the update on strategic progress presented in February 2023. This includes scenarios that are classified by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) to be consistent with well-below 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C outcomes a .\n\nAs further explained on page 58, while the results of any such analysis must be treated with caution overall, this resilience test again reinforced our confidence in the resilience of our strategy to a wide range of ways in which the energy system could evolve throughout this decade, including in scenarios consistent with limiting temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C.\n\nThe analysis also highlighted that, while WBCSD data may point towards a broad directional correlation between oil price and the temperature goal with which scenarios are associated, there is considerable uncertainty as to the extent of this correlation. This is demonstrated by the range within, and overlap between, the prices indicated for each scenario family.\n\nIn the version of the WBCSD catalogue used for the analysis, the lowest oil price is associated with a 1.5\u00b0C scenario, however a number of the 1.5\u00b0C and well-below 2\u00b0C scenarios have oil prices in 2030 that are substantively higher. And when compared to bp's own oil price planning assumption for 2030, the oil price in a number of the 1.5\u00b0C and well-below 2\u00b0C scenarios is also higher, supporting our view that our oil price planning assumption is broadly consistent with Paris-consistent scenarios.\n\n## Contributes to net zero\n\nWe believe that our strategy enables bp to make a positive contribution to the world achieving net zero GHG emissions and meeting the Paris temperature goals - outcomes which we believe to be in the best interests of bp as well as beneficial to society generally.\n\nWe see huge opportunity in the energy transition - the transformation of the energy system that we believe to be a necessary feature of the world's efforts to meet the Paris goals. There are many ways a company at the heart of the energy sector can make a meaningful contribution to the world getting to net zero. These include: policy advocacy and seeking to use the company's influence with trade associations (who conduct climate-related advocacy); low carbon collaboration and support for others in their own decarbonization efforts (such as cities and companies); and investment in low carbon and technology development. bp seeks to advance these areas through our aims in support of our net zero ambition, including aims 6-10 which are focused on activities which can help the world get to net zero, see page 47 .\n\nAnd, as we pursue our strategy, our diversification and the growth of our low carbon businesses may also contribute to helping the world get to net zero. For example, in Teesside in the UK, we have worked to advance components of the East Coast Cluster - a vision for decarbonizing local heavy industries at scale, with CO2 from their emissions taken offshore for permanent storage through Northern Endurance Partnership's carbon capture and storage",

This has the potential to store up to 27 million tonnes of CO2 emissions a year by 2030.\n\nSome ways of contributing are more readily measured by quantitative metrics than others but all can be important, whether or not they translate into GHG reductions for bp.\n\nTo illustrate this, in terms of low carbon investment \uf0ab , by 2030 we aim to increase to 50GW the amount of developed renewables to FID \uf0ab , supported by the capital expenditure we plan to invest in our transition growth engines. This aim supports the Paris goals by increasing the low carbon options available to energy consumers. However, it does not reduce our\n\nScope 1, 2 or 3 emissions. And it may not result in a decrease in the overall carbon intensity of bp's sold products, because that is dependent on the extent to which we - rather than another party such as a buyer of the developed project - market the resulting renewable power, which is a commercial consideration. Where we do not sell that power, our development of the renewables is effectively 'invisible' in terms of our GHG metrics.\n\nAs another example, our aim 6 is to more actively advocate for policies that support net zero, including carbon pricing. Helping policymakers to design and put in place low carbon policies can help deliver our strategy and\n\n## Strategic report\n\ncapitalize on the huge opportunities associated with achieving the Paris goals, but the benefit of such advocacy, if successful, extends well beyond any implications for bp's own GHG metrics. That is because well-designed low carbon policies can also advance the decarbonization of a whole economy something potentially of far greater impact than anything a single company can achieve through its own portfolio. We publish examples of our activity in support of aim 6 online at bp.com/advocacyactivities .\n\n## Responding to increased shareholder interest on Paris consistency\n\nIn 2019 the board recommended that shareholders support a special resolution requisitioned by Climate Action 100+ (CA100+) on climate change disclosures. The CA100+ resolution passed with more than 99% of the vote. This is the fourth year we have included responses throughout the annual report. We have adopted a similar approach to that taken in the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2020 and 2021 .\n\nThe CA100+ resolution, which includes safeguards such as protections for commercially confidential and competitively sensitive information, is on page 389 .

They are also used to inform decisions about internal planning and the value-in-use impairment testing of assets for financial reporting.\n\n## The role of price assumptions\n\nAs part of our regular review of strategy, we consider our portfolio and capital requirements to deliver our strategy. This work (and, where applicable, our decisions on individual investments) is informed by our view of the price environment and considers the balanced investment criteria discussed below. Together, these create a framework that seeks to ensure investments align with our strategy and add shareholder value.\n\nOur price assumptions continue to reflect a range of possibilities, including that the transition to a lower carbon economy and energy system could accelerate. They also now reflect new supply side constraints that have emerged a result of the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\n2022 was a particularly volatile year for energy markets. Our investment appraisal assumptions, which take a long-term perspective, allow us to look past near-term volatility and focus on the fundamental trends affecting the energy sector and our businesses when we make our investment decisions.\n\nThroughout 2022 we held our key investment appraisal price assumptions constant at the levels set out in the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021 . For relevant investment cases assessed in 2023, we have applied and plan to continue to apply the prices shown in the key investment appraisal assumptions table (right) for our central price case. Brent oil and Henry Hub gas assumptions average around $61/bbl and $3.8/mmBtu respectively (2021 $ real) from 2023 to 2050. We consider these prices to be broadly consistent with a range of transition paths compatible with meeting the Paris goals, but they do not correspond to any specific Paris-consistent scenario. We also consider a range of other price assumptions for our investment appraisal.\n\nWe continue to apply carbon prices rising to $100/tCO2e in 2030 and $250/tCO2e by 2050 (2021 $ real) for operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in certain investment cases, as explained on page 30.\n\n## Impairment testing\n\nOur best estimate of future prices for use in value-in-use impairment testing continues to be based on our investment appraisal price assumptions, with quarterly review of near-term prices to confirm that the assumptions appropriately reflect any changes to expectations due to short-term market trends.\n\nImpairment price assumptions were held constant in 2022 at the levels disclosed in the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021 until the fourth quarter, when the updated investment appraisal price assumptions shown below were used for value-in-use impairment testing, with the\n\n## Key investment appraisal assumptions\n\na\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2021 $ real\n\n|                                     |   2023 |   2025 |   2030 |   2040 |   2050 |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Brent oil ($/bbl)                   |     70 |     70 |     70 |   58   |   45   |\n| Henry Hub gas ($/mmBtu)             |      4 |      4 |      4 |    3.5 |    3.5 |\n| Refining marker margin b \uf0ab  ($/bbl) |     14 |     14 |     14 |   11   |    8.5 |\n\nIn addition to the prices shown we also test whether investments meet our return expectations (see page 30) using other prices, including a $60/bbl Brent oil price series.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Carbon price (US$/tCO2e)\n\n2021 $ real\n\n|        |   2023 |   2025 |   2030 |   2040 |   2050 |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Carbon |     50 |     50 |    100 |    200 |    250 |\n\n## Investment process price assumptions\n\nAll investments are evaluated against relevant price assumptions for oil, natural gas, refining margins and other commodities across a range of alternative price series (central, upper and lower). In addition, all investment cases with anticipated annual GHG emissions from operations above 20,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent (bp net basis) must estimate those anticipated GHG emissions and include an associated carbon cost in the investment economics.\n\nOur investment price assumptions place some weight on scenarios in which the transition to a low carbon energy system is sufficiently rapid to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, as well as scenarios in which the transition may not be sufficiently rapid. They also place some weight on a range of other factors that can drive prices, and which are not directly related to the Paris goals.\n\nThese price assumptions do not link to specific scenarios or outcomes, but instead try to capture the range of different possibilities surrounding the future path of the global energy system. The nature of the uncertainty means that the price ranges inevitably reflect considerable judgement. The ranges are reviewed and updated as necessary, as our understanding of and judgements about the energy transition evolve.\n\nIn addition to consideration of a range of price assumptions, investment cases are asked to assess the impact of alternative assumptions covering a range of other variables related to the economics of the investment. These variables may include cost, resource, policy changes and schedule, to assess the robustness of investment cases to a range of other factors.\n\n- a The values in the table represent the central case.\n- b The disclosed RMM assumption in this table excludes carbon pricing impacts and assumes a normalized cost of renewable identification numbers (RINs).\n\nexception that the Brent price assumption used for 2023 was $77/bbl (2021 $ real).\n\nFor investment appraisal, potential future operational emissions costs that may be borne by bp are included as bp costs, as described in the next section (generally without assuming incremental revenue), in order to incentivize engineering solutions that reduce carbon emissions on projects.\n\nFor the treatment of emission cost assumptions in value-in-use impairment testing, see Financial statements Note 1.",

It enables investments to be assessed in a consistent way against a range of criteria relevant to our strategy, including environmental and other sustainability criteria.\n\nInvestments follow an integrated stage-gate process designed to enable our businesses to choose and develop the most attractive investment cases. A balanced set of investment criteria is used, see page 30 . This allows for the comparison and prioritization of investments across an increasingly diverse range of business models.\n\nThe governance framework specifies that proposed investments are evaluated using relevant assumptions, including carbon prices for projected operational emissions where applicable. It also sets out requirements for assurance by functions independent of the business before a final investment decision (FID) is taken.\n\n## The role of the board\n\nThe board assesses capital allocation across the bp portfolio, including the level and mix of capital expenditures and divestments, strategic acquisitions, distribution choices and deleveraging, as well as reviewing certain investment cases for approval.\n\n## Resource commitment meeting\n\nFor capital investments above defined financial thresholds for organic or inorganic spend, investment approval is conducted through the executive-level resource commitment meeting (RCM), which is chaired by the chief executive officer.\n\nThe RCM reviews the merits of each investment case against a balanced set of criteria and considers any key issues raised in the assurance process.\n\nThe CA100+ resolution \uf0ab requires bp to disclose how we evaluate the consistency of new material capex investments \uf0ab with (i) the Paris goals and (ii) a range of other outcomes relevant to bp's strategy.\n\nbp's evaluation of the consistency of such investments with the Paris goals was undertaken by the RCM for new material capex investments sanctioned in 2022, see page 31.\n\nbp's evaluation of an investment's consistency with 'a range of other relevant outcomes' is achieved by considering its merits against bp's balanced investment criteria, described on page 30.\n\n## bp board\n\nReviews and approves investment cases of more than $3 billion for resilient hydrocarbons, more than $1 billion for all transition or low carbon investments \uf0ab and any significant inorganic acquisition that is exceptional or unique in nature.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Resource commitment meeting\n\nForum for approval of investments related to existing and new lines of business above $250 million organic and $25 million inorganic, or which exceed the relevant EVP's financial authority, and any project considered strategically important such as a new market entry.\n\n## Investment allocation committees\n\nEVP-level forums to review investment cases within a business group as per individual EVP financial authority (up to $250 million organic, $25 million inorganic capital investment).\n\n## Business group investment governance meetings\n\nSVP-level forums which review investment cases within a business group, enabler or integrator up to the individual SVP's financial authority.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cross-group meetings and forums\n\nMeetings and forums to allow cross-group discussions and integration across wider strategic planning. The forums do not hold investment decision rights, but inform and underpin the decision-making process delivering integration opportunities across bp.\n\n## Investment in non-oil and gas\n\nOur aim 5 is to increase the proportion of investment we make into our non-oil and gas businesses. We have restated the scope of businesses included under aim 5 to align with our transition growth investment \uf0ab . As a result, the proportion of capital expenditure which counts towards our aim 5 2025 target has changed from $3-4 billion in low carbon activity investment \uf0ab to transition growth investment of $6-8 billion, and our 2030 aim has changed from around $5 billion in low carbon investment capital spend (excludes cash costs) to $7-9 billion of transition growth investment. We expect more than 40% of total annual capital investment to be on transition growth engines by 2025, and are aiming for it to increase to around 50% in 2030. For more information see page 46 .\n\nBioenergy: In October 2022 we announced our ~$3 billion deal to acquire Archaea Energy (see page 15), a leading US producer of renewable natural gas (RNG). This will expand bp's presence in the US biogas industry and accelerate our bioenergy transition growth engine.\n\n## Strategic report\n\nEVs: Together with our strategic convenience site networks, our investment in EV charging will help us to offer low carbon solutions to customers. We believe that, for road transport to decarbonize at the pace and scale needed to achieve the goals of the Paris climate agreement, it is necessary for the roll-out of EV charging infrastructure and usage of electric vehicles to be scaled up in parallel with - or even ahead of - the decarbonization of electricity grids. As a result, in some geographies it may be some years before grid decarbonization begins to drive down the lifecycle carbon intensity of EV charging. In 2022 EV charge points installed and energy sold grew by more than 65% and around 150%, respectively, compared to 2021, with charge points now at ~22,000. See page 41 for more information.\n\nConvenience: We have 2,400 strategic convenience sites and aim to grow this to around 3,000 by 2025 and to around 3,500 by 2030. In the UK, we negotiated an extension to our partnership with M&S until at least 2030, following a successful 16-year collaboration. See page 16 for more information, including our new global strategic partnership with Uber.\n\nRenewables & power: In 2022, in offshore wind in the US, we progressed Empire Wind 1 and 2 projects with Equinor and development work continued on Beacon Wind. In January 2022, together with EnBW, we were awarded a 2.9GW gross offshore wind lease, under project Morven, located off the east coast of Scotland. In power, in December 2022, we completed the purchase of EDF Energy Services, which will expand bp's presence in the US commercial and industrial retail energy business (see page 19).\n\nHydrogen: We aim to build a leading position globally in hydrogen, initially supplying our own refineries, scaling up to meet growing customer demand and in parallel, as markets develop, developing global export hubs for hydrogen and its derivatives. In 2022 we progressed Net Zero Teesside and Northern Endurance Partnership projects. Both form part of the East Coast Cluster which aims to remove nearly 50% of all UK industrial cluster CO 2 emissions. In Western Australia we acquired a 40.5% interest and will operate the Australian Renewable Energy Hub, AREH (see page 18). The hub aims to supply renewable power and sustainable fuels to both local mining customers and export markets.\n\n## Low carbon activity investment\n\nIn 2022 low carbon activity investment a subset of our total aim 5 transition growth investment - accounted for more than 80% of our total aim 5 investment. It increased from $2.2 billion in 2021 to more than $4 billion. Most of this investment was in biogas, offshore wind, electric vehicle charging and hydrogen. Going forward, we anticipate that more than 80% of our 2030 transition growth investment \uf0ab being on low carbon activity \uf0ab .",

        "page_content": "## Our investment process continued\n\n## Balanced investment criteria\n\nAll investment cases must set out their investment merits and are considered against a set of balanced investment criteria. This standardized approach is intended to create a level playing field for decision making and allows portfolio-wide comparisons of investment cases. The decision to endorse an investment based on the information provided represents our evaluation that it is consistent with what the 2019 CA100+ resolution \uf0ab refers to as 'a range of other outcomes relevant to bp's strategy'. In 2022 we further embedded sustainability into our investment governance process by developing our sustainability assessment template for investments linked to our sustainability frame, for use in all investment cases reviewed by RCM. The template provides information on a case's impact on our net zero aims 1-3, its expected GHG intensity, and significant impacts on or contribution to certain aims concerning people and planet. This helps to maintain the consistency of our investments with our strategy and sustainability aims.\n\nWhen taking investment decisions, we consider six investment criteria, although these decisions may also take other factors into account as appropriate:\n\nStrategic alignment: For all investment cases, we consider whether the investment supports delivery of our strategy, including our net zero aims. We also assess if the investment case involves distinctive capability that bp has, or intends to develop, and whether it adds to an existing 'scale' business within the portfolio or could help us create one.\n\nSafety and risks: For all investment cases, we provide an assessment of the key risks to the investment that have a significantly higher probability than usual or have a significantly greater impact (relative to the size of the project) were they to occur. Safety risk management at\n\n## Paris consistency evaluation process\n\nOur new material capex investments \uf0ab are intended to support the delivery of bp's strategy.\n\nFor evaluations conducted in 2022, investments in scope for evaluation were defined as:\n\n- \u00b7 New: investment in a new project or extension of an existing project/asset or share of an entity that is new to bp or a substantial increase in bp's share.\n- \u00b7 Material: more than $250 million capex investment.\n\nWe evaluated new material capex investment using our central price assumptions (see page 28 ), and, where applicable, using our\n\nbp is underpinned by our operating management system \uf0ab that is designed to help us sustainably deliver safe, reliable and compliant bp operations.\n\nSustainability: For all investment cases, we consider how any proposed business opportunity is connected to the energy transition, societal needs and the environment. This approach is underpinned by our purpose and sustainability frame. Investment cases above defined thresholds for anticipated annual GHG emissions from operations must estimate those anticipated emissions and incorporate carbon pricing for those emissions into the investment economics. All RCM cases must consider significant impacts of an investment on key sustainability aims, informed by the sustainability assessment template, referred to above.\n\nInvestment economics: For all investment cases, we consider investment economics against a range of relevant measures. Depending on the nature of the investment case, these may include internal rate of return (IRR), net present value, discounted payback, and profitability index, reflecting assumptions about relevant commodity prices, margins and carbon prices, see page 28. Investments are considered against differentiated return expectations, depending on business segment. We also refer to these expectations as hurdle rates, although as noted, each case is assessed according to its combined merit against our full set of balanced criteria.\n\n- 1. For our resilient hydrocarbons portfolio, we seek a payback of less than 10 years for upstream oil and refining and 15 years for upstream gas; together with an IRR of 15-20%.\n- 2. For bioenergy, we seek an IRR in excess of 15%.\n- 3. For our convenience and EV charging businesses, we seek a portfolio-level IRR in excess of 15%.\n\nlower-price case. Where relevant the evaluation also incorporated our carbon price assumptions, applied to the anticipated operational GHG emissions associated with the investment, through 2050 (see page 31 ).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Quantitative evaluations\n\nFor our investment economics and sustainability investment criteria we considered quantitative guide levels, as set our below, to inform the evaluation of each investment's consistency with the goals of the Paris Agreement. As was the case last year, we have again lowered our operational carbon intensity guide level in line with our decreasing portfolio average. As our approach matures with experience, we may continue to adjust or supplement our\n\n- 4.  For our hydrogen investments, we expect double-digit (unlevered) IRR.\n- 5. For renewables & power investments, we seek an unlevered IRR of 6-8%.\n\nFor investments in our oil and gas and refined products businesses, as well as any other investments that do not fall within one of the specific hurdles set out above, we also compare the internal rate of return in our lower-price case to a cost of capital hurdle rate. For additional capital discipline for investments in oil and gas production, we also consider a case in which the Brent oil price starts at $60/bbl in 2023 and later declines to the level of our key appraisal assumptions by 2050 (see page 28 ).\n\nVolatility and rateability: Our investment economics metrics also consider the degree of uncertainty of the cash flows when considering investment cases. For example, some cases have more certainty of future costs and revenue projections. Variations in net present values for the key variables in an investment case are quantified by sensitivity analysis to give a range of potential outcomes against our key investment hurdles.\n\nOptionality and integration: Our assessment considers the degree of optionality offered by a project - the ability to adapt our business to changing circumstances. This could be an option to sell a product with a floor price, or the right to purchase additional equity in a joint venture at specific terms. Other types of options include the right to develop (or not develop) extensions to existing projects, or to change the course of a project's development depending on market circumstances. We likewise seek out integration along value chains across multiple products, services, geographies and customers. For example, our gas production can supply liquefaction plants whose LNG is monetized by our trading business. Likewise, future carbon sequestration projects may allow us to add value to our gas production by converting it to low carbon power.\n\nmethodology. There may be instances when new material capex investments are evaluated as consistent with the Paris goals despite either the economic or sustainability guide levels not being met. The RCM may also take account, in its Paris consistency evaluation, of the six balanced investment criteria (above) using qualitative assessments.\n\nInvestment economics: We calculate economic indicators using our central price, and where applicable, our lower-price cases and applying our carbon price assumptions to relevant operational GHG emissions (for our key central case oil and natural gas price assumptions, see page 28 where we also set out our view on their consistency with achieving Paris goals. We then compare the economic indicators to the relevant",

All were evaluated as being consistent with the Paris goals.\n\n## Evaluation of investment performance against quantitative guide levels a\n\nAll five investments met the relevant IRR guide level, as shown in the chart. The guide level shown in the chart is typically based on the IRR hurdle for the central-price case, except where the investment case's business area does not have a specific hurdle rate assigned to it, in which case the guide level is based on our lower-price, cost-of-capital hurdle.\n\nFor three of the investment cases we have emissions intensity guide levels that were applied to the relevant expected operational carbon intensity. The carbon intensity of each evaluated investment was below the relevant guide level (one of the three had almost no incremental emissions, so no bar is visible). The other two investment cases were in transition growth businesses that do not have a carbon emissions intensity guide level.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Decisions taken in 2022\n\nIn 2022 five new material capital expenditure investment decisions (more than $250 million) were evaluated for Paris consistency.\n\n## Archaea Energy\n\nbp acquired Archaea Energy, a leading US biogas producer focused on converting naturally occurring waste emissions from landfills and anaerobic digesters into low carbon biogas and electricity. The deal accelerates the growth of bp's strategic bioeneregy transition growth engine, advancing our ongoing transformation to an integrated energy company.\n\n## Angola New Gas Consortium\n\nbp and Angola New Gas Consortium (NGC) partners are developing non-associated gas and condensate from the Quiluma and Maboqueiro fields. The project scope includes the installation of unmanned wellhead platforms and multiple production wells, as well as pipelines and an onshore gas treatment plant (GTP). bp's interest in Angola NGC has been transferred to the new Azule Energy joint venture.\n\n## EDF Energy Services energy supply\n\nbp acquired EDF Energy Services, LLC (EDF ES), a US-based commercial and industrial retail energy supply business. The acquisition of EDF ES expands bp's reach down the power value chain, providing immediate scale and adjusted EBITDA \uf0ab contribution, and broadening our geographical reach. The acquisition supports our aim 3, delivering energy sales with a lifecycle carbon intensity below our current portfolio average to end-use customers.\n\n## Kwinana renewable fuels\n\nWe approved investment in detailed engineering design and long-lead contracts for the Kwinana renewable fuels project at our former refinery site in Western Australia. The project aims to produce renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel and bio-naphtha. The integrated energy hub will support our net zero ambition.\n\n## Cypre development\n\nThe Cypre development is a subsea tieback to the existing Juniper platform in Trinidad & Tobago. Cypre will access power from Juniper, eliminating the need for additional power generation, allowing increased production without any significant increase in bp Trinidad's operating emissions. Output from the project will go towards satisfying existing gas supply commitments.\n\n- a The 2022 investments have been compared to relevant guides (as applicable to the evaluation of each investment) and are presented here in order of the ratio to the relevant central-price case IRR or relevant carbon intensity guide level. As a result, the evaluations against the economic and sustainability benchmarks do not necessarily follow the same order.\n- b  We applied the corresponding operational emissions intensity guide to the three investment cases with relevant guide levels.\n\nSustainability: Where appropriate, we compare the expected operational carbon intensity \uf0ab of the investment relative to that of the portfolio average shown in the bp sustainability report 2021 for the segment or the related business activity (upstream and refining). We normally target a\n\nratio of less than 100%, meaning that the investment is expected to reduce the average operational carbon intensity of that portfolio. The potential impact of new material capex investments on bp's net zero aims is a further consideration.\n\n## Strategic report",

        "page_content": "At 31 December 2021, the group's reportable segments were gas & low carbon energy, oil production & operations, customers & products and Rosneft. The group has ceased to report Rosneft as a separate segment in the group's financial reporting for 2022. For more information see Financial statements - Note 1 Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - Investment in Rosneft.\n\nFrom the first quarter of 2022, the group's reportable segments are gas & low carbon energy, oil production & operations and customers & products. Each are managed separately, with decisions taken for the segment as a whole, and represent a single operating segment that does not result from aggregating two or more segments. See Financial statements - Note 5 Segmental analysis.\n\nFor the period from 1 January 2022 to 27 February 2022, net income from Rosneft is classified as an adjusting item. As the circumstances leading to this classification were not present prior to first quarter 2022 the net income from Rosneft has not been classified as an adjusting item for comparative periods.\n\n## Results\n\nThe loss for the year ended 31 December 2022 attributable to bp shareholders was $2.5 billion, compared with a profit of $7.6 billion in 2021. Adjusting for inventory holding gains, RC loss was $3.5 billion, compared with a profit of $4.7 billion in 2021.\n\nAfter adjusting RC profit for a net impact of items which bp has classified as adjusting of $31.2 billion (on a post-tax basis), underlying RC profit for the year ended 31 December 2022 was $27.7 billion. The result reflected higher gas and liquids realizations and higher refining margins, partially offset by higher tax and the absence of bp share of earnings from Rosneft.\n\nFor 2021, after adjusting RC profit for a net adverse impact of items, which bp has classified as adjusting of $8.1 billion (on a post-tax basis), underlying RC profit was $12.8 billion. The result reflected higher oil and gas prices and refining margins, and strong trading results.\n\nFor a discussion of bp's financial and operating performance for the year ending 31 December 2020 and 31 December 2021, see bp's Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021 , pages 37-50.\n\n## Adjusting items\n\nIn 2022 the net adverse pre-tax impact of items, which bp has classified as adjusting was $29.8 billion including:\n\n- \u00b7 A pre-tax charge of $24.0 billion relating to bp's decision to exit its 19.75% shareholding in Rosneft.\n- \u00b7 Adverse fair value accounting effects (FVAEs)\n\nrelative to management's measure of performance of $3.5 billion primarily arising from an increase in forward gas prices during the year and the changes in the fair value of derivatives entered into by the group to manage currency exposure and interest rate risks relating to hybrid bonds. Under IFRS, reported earnings include the mark-to-market value of the hedges used to risk-manage LNG contracts, but not of the LNG contracts themselves. The underlying result includes the mark-to-market value of the hedges but also recognizes changes in value of the LNG contracts being risk managed. The impacts of FVAEs relative to management's internal measure of performance are provided on page 354.\n\n- \u00b7 Net impairment charges of $4.8 billion principally as a result of expected portfolio changes in our oil production & operations segment, the annual review of price assumptions used for investment appraisal and value-in-use impairment testing and the annual review of discount rates used for impairment tests; partially offset by\n- \u00b7 A non-taxable gain of $1.9 billion arising from the contribution of bp's Angolan business to Azule Energy.\n\nIn 2021 the net adverse pre-tax impact of items which bp has classified as adjusting was $8.7 billion including:\n\n- \u00b7 Adverse fair value accounting effects relative to management's measure of performance of $8.1 billion primarily arising from the exceptional increase in forward gas prices.\n- \u00b7 Net impairment reversals of $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion relating to a gain from the divestment of a 20% stake in Oman Block 61.\n\nSee Financial statements Note 1 Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - Investment in Rosneft and Note 4 for more information on impairments, and pages 353 and 354 for more information on adjusting items and fair value accounting effects.\n\n## Taxation\n\nThe charge for corporate income taxes was $16,762 million in 2022 compared with $6,740 million in 2021. The increase mainly reflects higher taxable profits and the impact of the UK Energy Profits Levy. The effective tax rate (ETR) on the profit before taxation for the year in 2022 was 109%, compared with 44% in 2021. The ETR on the profit before taxation for the year in 2022 was impacted by the pre-tax charges relating to bp's decision to exit its shareholding in Rosneft, and the UK Energy Profits Levy. The ETR on the profit before taxation for the year in 2021 was impacted by fair value accounting effects. Excluding inventory holding impacts and\n\nadjusting items, the underlying ETR \uf0ab in 2022 was 34% compared with 32% in 2021. The underlying ETR \uf0ab in 2022 is higher due to the absence of equity-accounted earnings from Rosneft, and the UK Energy Profits Levy on North Sea profits, partly offset by changes in the geographical mix of profits. The underlying ETR for 2023 is expected to be around 40% but is sensitive to the impact that volatility in the current price environment may have on the geographical mix of the group's profits and losses. Underlying ETR is a non-GAAP measure. A reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 398 .\n\n## Outlook for 2023\n\nMacro outlook\n\n- \u00b7 We expect oil and gas prices and refining margins to remain elevated in 2023 as a result of the continuing impact of the war in Ukraine and the resulting energy supply repositioning.\n\n## 2023 guidance\n\n- \u00b7 We expect both reported and underlying upstream \uf0ab production to be broadly flat compared with 2022. Within this, we expect underlying production \uf0ab from oil production & operations to be slightly higher and production from gas & low carbon energy to be lower. We expect the start-up of Mad Dog Phase 2 in the second quarter of 2023 and first gas from the Tangguh expansion and GTA Phase 1 Tortue projects in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n- \u00b7 In our customers business, we expect inflationary cost pressures to continue and in Castrol base oil prices to remain high, although lower than in 2022.\n- \u00b7 In products, we expect industry refining margins to remain elevated due to low product stocks and sanctioning of Russian crude and product, although uncertainty remains depending on the implementation and enforcement of the EU ban on Russian products.\n- \u00b7 The other businesses & corporate underlying annual charge is expected to be in a range of $1.1-1.3 billion for 2023. The charge may vary from quarter to quarter.",

Compared with 2021, operating cash flows in 2022 reflected higher profits from operations partly offset by working capital movements and higher tax payments.\n\nMovements in working capital \uf0ab adversely impacted cash flow in the year by $6.3 billion, including an adverse impact from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill of $1.3 billion. Other working capital effects were principally an increase in other current assets and inventory offset by an increase in other current liabilities. bp actively manages its working capital balances to optimize and reduce volatility in cash flow.\n\nOperating cash flow for the year ended 31 December 2021 was $23.6 billion, $11.4 billion higher than 2020. Compared with 2020, operating cash flows in 2021 reflected higher oil and gas realizations and higher refining margins partly offset by higher tax payments.\n\nMovements in working capital adversely impacted cash flow in 2021 by $0.6 billion, including an adverse impact on working capital from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill of $1.4 billion. Other working capital effects were principally an increase in other current assets and inventory offset by an increase in other current liabilities.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended 31 December 2022 increased by $8.0 billion compared with 2021.\n\nThe increase mainly reflected $3.0 billion for the acquisition of Archaea Energy, net of cash acquired, and $0.5 billion for the earlier than expected completion of the acquisition of EDF Energy Service, and lower divestment proceeds received in 2022.\n\nTotal capital expenditure for 2022 was $16.3 billion (2021 $12.8 billion), of which organic capital expenditure \uf0ab was $12.5 billion (2021 $11.8 billion). Sources of funding are fungible, but the majority of the group's funding requirements for new investment comes from cash generated by existing operations. For 2023 bp expects capital expenditure of $16-18 billion and for 2024-30 now expects capital expenditure in a range of $14-18 billion including inorganic capital expenditure \uf0ab .\n\nTotal divestment and other proceeds for 2022 amounted to $3.1 billion including $0.7 billion relating to the formation of Azule Energy and $0.3 billion relating to the disposal of bp's interest in the Sunrise oil sands project in Canada. Other proceeds for 2022 consist of $0.6 billion of proceeds from the disposal of a loan note related to the Alaska divestment. The cash was received in the fourth quarter 2021, reported as a financing cash flow and was not included in other proceeds at the time due to potential recourse from the counterparty.\n\nTotal divestment and other proceeds for 2021 amounted to $7.6 billion, including $2.4 billion from the divestment of a 20% stake in Oman Block 61, $2.2 billion of proceeds relating to the 2020 divestment of bp's Alaska business to Hilcorp and the $1.0 billion final instalment for the sale of the petrochemicals business. Other\n\nproceeds for 2021 include $675 million from the sale of a 49% interest in a controlled affiliate holding certain refined product and crude logistics assets onshore US and this transaction was reported within financing activities in the group cash flow statement.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, $15.9 billion of proceeds were received against our target of $25 billion of divestment and other proceeds between the second half of 2020 and 2025. bp now expects divestment and other proceeds of $2-3 billion in 2023.\n\n## Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended 31 December 2022 was $28.0 billion, compared with $18.1 billion in 2021. Compared with 2021, financing cash flows in 2022 primarily reflected the increase in share buybacks, as part of the share buyback programme announced on 27 April 2021, and an increase in net payments related to short-term and long-term debt including $1.0bn related to the settlement of debt and warrant liabilities acquired with Archaea Energy.\n\nIn 2022, 1,900 million of ordinary shares (2021 707 million) were repurchased for cancellation for a total cost of $10.0 billion (2021 $3.2 billion), including transaction costs of $54 million (2021 $17 million).\n\nTotal dividends paid to shareholders in 2022 were 22.932 cents per share, 1.512 cents higher than 2021. This amounted to total dividends paid to shareholders of $4.4 billion in 2022 (2021 $4.3 billion). The board decided not to offer a scrip dividend alternative in respect of the 2022 and 2021 dividends.\n\n## Debt\n\nFinance debt at the end of 2022 decreased by $14.2 billion from the end of 2021 reflecting activity to manage the group's debt portfolio. The finance debt ratio at the end of 2022 decreased to 36.1% from 40.3% at the end of 2021.\n\nNet debt at the end of 2022 decreased by $9.2 billion from the 2021 year-end position. Gearing at the end of 2022 decreased to 20.5% from 25.3% at the end of 2021. The decrease in net debt and gearing reflected strong operating performance and related cash flow generation during the year. Net debt and gearing are non-GAAP measures. See Financial statements - Notes 26 and 27 for further information on finance debt and net debt.\n\nFor information on financing the group's activities see Financial statements - Note 29 and Liquidity and capital resources on page 356.",

Natural gas decreased by 53% (13% decrease for subsidiaries and 89% decrease for equityaccounted entities). This includes a 9,013mmboe reduction in our equity-accounted entities resulting from our decision to exit our Russia joint ventures and our shareholding in Rosneft.\n\nExcluding the impact of our exit from Russia, there was a net decrease from acquisitions and disposals of 84mmboe (decrease of 434mmboe within our subsidiaries and increase of 350mmboe within our equity-accounted entities). Acquisition and divestment activity occurred in our equity-accounted entities in the Southern Cone and the North Sea, and divestment activity in our subsidiaries in Canada, the US and the North Sea. The creation of Azule Energy in Angola resulted in divestment of subsidiary entities and purchase of equityaccounted entities.\n\nTotal hydrocarbon production for the group was 26.5% lower compared with 2021. The decrease comprised a 0.2% decrease (6.1% decrease for liquids and 6.0% increase for gas) for subsidiaries and a 66.8% decrease (67.8% decrease for liquids and 63.5% decrease for gas) for equity-accounted entities. The production decrease in the equity-accounted entities is due to absence of bp share of production from Rosneft.\n\nExcluding the impact of Rosneft, total hydrocarbon production for the group was 1.6% higher compared with 2021. The increase comprised a 0.2% increase (6.1% decrease for liquids and 6.0% increase for gas) for subsidiaries and a 13.5% increase (25.0% increase for liquids and 6.9% decrease for gas) for equity-accounted entities.",

The increase reflects higher realizations, higher production and an exceptional gas marketing and trading result.\n\nItems which bp has classified as adjusting for 2021 had a net adverse impact of $5,395 million including adverse fair value accounting effects of $7,662 million (relative to management's view of performance) primarily arising from the exceptional increase in forward gas prices, partly offset by the gain on the partial divestment in Oman and net impairment reversals.\n\nSee Financial statements Note 5 for further information on segmental analysis.\n\n## Operational update\n\nReported production for 2022 was 957mboe/d, 4.9% higher than the same period in 2021. Underlying production \uf0ab for the full year was 4.9% higher due to the ramp-up of major projects \uf0ab partially offset by base decline.\n\nRenewables pipeline \uf0ab at the end of the year was 37.2GW (bp net). In 2022 the pipeline grew by 14.1GW primarily as a result of bp and its partner EnBW being awarded a lease option off the east coast of Scotland to develop an offshore wind project (1.5GW bp net) in the first quarter of 2022, net additions to Lightsource bp's pipeline\n\n(3.8GW), and the additions to the renewables pipeline in the fourth quarter in support of hydrogen in Australia (10.3GW) offset by promotions of projects to final investment decision (FID).\n\nIn renewables by the end of 2022 we had brought 5.8GW developed renewables to FID \uf0ab\n\n## Strategic progress\n\n## Gas\n\nIn Trinidad, we took the FID on the Cypre project offshore, our third subsea gas development, which is expected to start drilling in 2023, with first gas expected in 2025. The Cassia C compression platform safely delivered first gas in November. And we and the other shareholders reached an agreement to restructure Atlantic LNG with the Trinidad Ministry of Energy. The new structure is expected to be effective in October 2024 and will enable increased focus on operational efficiency and reliability and underpin future upstream investments.\n\n.",

        "page_content": "In Indonesia, we participated in the Timpan-1 discovery offshore, the successful well was drilled in the Andaman II licence by Harbour Energy. We also extended the Tangguh PSC \uf0ab licence by 20 years to 2055, and signed 30-year PSC with the government of Indonesia for Agung I and II blocks.\n\nIn Egypt, we were awarded five exploration blocks in the Mediterranean Sea by the Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company.\n\nIn Mauritania, we signed a 30-month exploration and production sharing agreement for the BirAllah resource. In January 2023, our floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel for GTA Phase 1 sailed away from China towards the project site in Mauritania and Senegal.\n\nIn February 2023 we completed the sale of bp's upstream business in Algeria to Eni, including the gas producing In Amenas and In Salah concessions.\n\nIntegrated gas and power and LNG trading\n\n- \u00b7 In February 2022, construction started on the Gas Natural Acu (GNA) 2 power plant at the Port of Acu, Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. GNA 2 is expected to have an installed capacity of 1.7GW. bp is the exclusive LNG supplier for GNA 1 and GNA 2 which, together, are expected to achieve 3GW of installed capacity. GNA is a joint venture among bp, Prumo, Siemens and SPIC.\n- \u00b7 In April bp and the Korea Gas Corporation (KOGAS) signed a long-term agreement to supply 1.58 million tonnes of LNG per year from 2025 to KOGAS through a new 18-year contract.\n\nSee Oil and gas disclosures for the group on page 358 for more information on oil and gas operations in the regions.\n\n## Low carbon energy\n\nHydrogen and carbon capture and storage In Hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS), we progressed 1.8mtpa net to bp of hydrogen opportunities to project pipeline (concept development stage) .\n\nOur progress in hydrogen is focused on growing scale in key regionally integrated markets, such as Europe and US, using our refineries as demand anchors. As hydrogen markets develop, we aim to create a portfolio of globally advantaged supply hubs.\n\n- \u00b7 In the UK, in October, we submitted a bid to the UK government for our proposed green hydrogen \uf0ab project. HyGreen Teesside is one of the UK's largest proposed green hydrogen plants and aims to produce an initial 80 megawatts equivalent (MWe) of hydrogen by\n\n2025 and 500MWe by 2030. In addition, we announced that Abu Dhabi's ADNOC will work with us in our blue hydrogen \uf0ab project H2Teesside, Masdar signed a memorandum of understanding to acquire a stake in bp's proposed HyGreen Teesside green hydrogen project, and that bp and ADNOC would commence a study for a new world-scale blue hydrogen project in Abu Dhabi.\n\n- \u00b7 In Europe, in February 2022, jointly with HyCC we announced plans to develop H2-Fifty, a 250MWe green hydrogen production plant in the port area of Rotterdam. The facility could supply bp's refinery in the city and has the potential to reduce CO2 emissions by up to 350,000 tonnes per year.\n- \u00b7 In the US, in May 2022, we announced our plans to develop a major CCS project to advance decarbonization efforts to store up to 15 million metric tons of CO2 across the Texas Gulf Coast. We expect that this project will enable low carbon hydrogen production and decarbonize bp facilities and third-party emitters.\n- \u00b7 In Asia Pacific, in September 2022, we acquired a 40.5% equity stake in Australian Renewable Energy Hub (AREH) in the Pilbara region of Western Australia, which is one of the world's largest planned integrated green hydrogen hubs (InterContinental Energy 26.4%, CWP Global 17.8% and Macquarie Capital and Macquarie's Green Investment Group 15.3%).\n- \u00b7 In January 2022, we and Oman's Ministry of Energy and Minerals signed a Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA) and a Renewables Data Collection Agreement which will support the potential development of a multiple gigawatt, world-class renewable energy and green hydrogen development in the country by 2030.\n- \u00b7 In November and December 2022, we signed memoranda of understanding with the governments of Mauritania and Egypt, to explore the potential for establishing green hydrogen production facilities in the countries.\n\n## Renewables and power\n\n## Offshore wind\n\nIn offshore wind, in 2022 we built scale and progressed projects in two of the most attractive markets, US and UK. These positions in offshore wind will enable us to leverage integration opportunities with green hydrogen, EV mobility and power trading as we build the business.\n\nIn January 2022 in partnership with EnBW we were awarded a lease option off the east coast of Scotland to develop a major offshore wind project with a total generating capacity of 2.9GW (1.45GW net).\n\n## Strategic report\n\nIn the US, bp and its partner Equinor signed a 25-year purchase and sales agreement with the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) for 2.5GW of power sale agreements for our Empire Wind II and Beacon Wind I projects.\n\nWe are building global presence in offshore wind. In March 2022 we announced a partnership with Marubeni to explore a selected offshore wind development opportunity in Japan. We have agreed to form a strategic partnership for offshore wind and potentially other decarbonization projects.\n\nIn February 2023, we formed a joint venture with Deep Wind Offshore to develop up to 6GW offshore South Korea. We acquired a 55% stake in Deep Wind Offshore's early-stage offshore wind portfolio, which includes four projects across the Korean peninsula.\n\n## Onshore renewables\n\nIn solar, we continue accelerating growth in our pipeline through our Lightsource bp partnership, projects in service of hydrogen and developing our portfolio of US solar projects acquired in July 2021.\n\n- \u00b7 Lightsource bp brought 2.7GW to FID (1.3GW bp net) in full year 2022, an increase of 32% compared with 2.0GW (1.0GW bp net) in 2021. In addition, through Lightsource bp, we have 28GW (14GW bp net) of pipeline and additional 19GW (9.5GW bp net) of early stage opportunities in the hopper for a total of 47GW.\n- \u00b7 In Australia, we have added 4GW bp net in support of hydrogen as part of the AREH project.\n- \u00b7 We started construction in Arche, our first US solar 134MWdc (107MWac) project in Fulton County, Ohio; Power Purchase Agreement secured with Meta.\n\nIn onshore wind, we agreed with our Flat Ridge 2 joint venture partner to purchase their 50% ownership in that wind farm. Since December, we own 100%, adding an additional 235MW of capacity to bp's renewables portfolio. We added 6.3GW to our pipeline in Australia in support of the hydrogen project as part of AREH.\n\n## Power trading\n\nWe acquired EDF Energy Services, expanding bp's presence in the US commercial and industrial retail power and gas business.",

Underlying production \uf0ab for the year was 2.1% higher compared with the same period of 2021 reflecting bpx energy performance, major projects \uf0ab and reduced weather impacts in the US Gulf of Mexico partly offset by base performance.\n\nProgressed operational performance in upstream \uf0ab in 2022, delivering the highest bp-operated upstream plant reliability \uf0ab on record at 96%.\n\n## Strategic progress\n\n- \u00b7 In 2022 we started up a major project Herschel Expansion in the US deepwater Gulf of Mexico.\n- \u00b7 We completed the creation of Azule Energy, a 50:50 joint venture combining our Angolan assets with those of Eni.\n- \u00b7 bp has strengthened its renewal options partnering with Petrobras in a successful drill stem test at the Cabo Frio discovery in the Campos Basin offshore Brazil.\n- \u00b7 The transaction to sell bp's 50% interest in the Sunrise oil sands project in Alberta, Canada, to Calgary-based Cenovus Energy completed in August. As part of the deal, bp acquired Cenovus's interest in the Bay du Nord project in eastern Canada, adding to its sizeable acreage position offshore Newfoundland and Labrador.\n- \u00b7 bp expects the start-up of the Mad Dog Phase 2 project in the Gulf of Mexico in the second quarter of 2023 (bp operator 60.5%, Woodside Energy 23.9%, Chevron 15.6%).\n- \u00b7 bp was awarded operatorship of the Bumerangue block, in the Santos Pre Salt Basin, in Brazil.\n- \u00b7 The National Agency for Petroleum, Gas and Biofuels (ANPG), ExxonMobil Angola and the Angola Block 15 partners announced a new discovery at the Bavuca South-1 exploration well. Azule Energy, the bp and ENI 50:50 joint venture, owns 42% of block 15.\n- \u00b7 In the Permian, methane flaring intensity averaged <0.5% in 2022, the lowest recorded in bpx energy.\n\nSee Oil and gas disclosures for the group on page 358 for more information on oil and gas operations in the regions.",

The higher result reflects a stronger performance in refining and oil trading.\n\nItems which bp has classified as adjusting for 2021 had a net adverse impact of $1,044 million (including favourable fair value accounting effects of $436 million - relative to management's view of performance), principally relating to impairment charges arising due to increased future expenditure and anticipated\n\nportfolio changes in the products business (see Financial statements - Note 4).\n\nCustomers - the convenience and mobility result, excluding Castrol, for 2022 was higher than 2021. The result benefited from stronger convenience, retail fuels, aviation and midstream, including biofuels performance. The full-year results were partially offset by inflationary cost pressures and adverse foreign exchange impacts.\n\nCastrol result for 2022 was lower than 2021, due to higher input costs, ongoing COVID-19 restrictions, notably in China, and adverse foreign exchange impacts.",

It is one of the biggest networks of roadside travel centres in the US and is expected to add around 280 sites to our retail network, strategically located on major highways in 44 states in the US. To support growing demand for lower carbon mobility solutions, over time we plan to expand and develop new offers, such as electric vehicle (EV) charging, biofuels, renewable natural gas and hydrogen. This deal is subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.\n\n## EV charging\n\nEV charge points installed and energy sold grew by more than 65% and around 150%, respectively, compared to 2021, with charge points now at around 22,000. In addition:\n\n- \u00b7 In March 2022, bp announced plans to invest \u00a31 billion over the next 10 years to support the roll-out of fast, convenient charging infrastructure across the UK and to nearly triple our number of UK public charge points.\n\n- \u00b7 In June 2022, bp signed a contract with Shenzhen Huize New Energy Co. Ltd to operate China's largest fast a EV charging hub, in Shenzhen, offering charging options for consumers, fleets and heavy-duty truck users.\n- \u00b7 In July 2022, bp and Iberdrola announced their intent to form a strategic collaboration to accelerate EV charging infrastructure roll-out.

It focuses on three areas - getting to net zero, improving people's lives and caring for our planet.\n\n## Reporting on sustainability\n\nFor the purposes of this section, we have covered selected sustainability issues informed by our sustainability report materiality assessment, which took into account external developments related to sustainability and ESG issues - along with information in the following areas:\n\n## Getting bp to net zero\n\nOur ambition to be a net zero company by 2050 or sooner, and to help the world get to net zero, remains unchanged. Since 2020 we have made the following updates:\n\n- \u00b7 We now aim for a 50% reduction in our operational Scopes 1 and 2 emissions in 2030 (formerly 30-35%).\n- \u00b7 For aim 3 we are aiming to reduce to net zero the average carbon intensity of sold energy\n- \u00b7 Getting to net zero, see pages 45-46.\n- \u00b7 Climate-related financial disclosures, see pages 50-62.\n- \u00b7 Improving people's lives, see page 63.\n- \u00b7 Caring for our planet, see page 64.\n- \u00b7 Our approach - values and code of conduct, safety, people, ethics and compliance, see page 65.\n\nproducts by 2050 or sooner (previously an aim for a reduction of 50%). For 2030 we are aiming for a 15-20% reduction in the lifecycle carbon intensity of these products. (previously >15%). We also expanded aim 3 to include physically traded energy products .\n\n- \u00b7 Our aim 5 is now aligned with our transition growth engines (see page 46). This means we expect to invest more than 40%,\n\n## Net zero performance\n\nProgress against our five aims to help bp get to net zero in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Aim                      | Measure / coverage                  | 2022  performance   | 2025 target   | 2030 aim        | 2050,  or sooner, aim   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------------|\n| 1 Net zero operations    | Scope 1 and 2                       | 41% a               | 20% a         | 50% a           | Net zero                |\n| 2 Net zero production    | Scope 3                             | 15% a               | 10-15% ab     | 20-30% ab       | Net zero                |\n| 3 Net zero sales         | Average lifecycle carbon  intensity | 2% ch               | 5% c          | 15-20% c        | Net zero                |\n| 4 Reducing methane       | Methane intensity                   | 0.05% d             | 0.20% e       | 50% reduction e | 50% reduction e         |\n| 5 More $ into transition | Transition growth investment        | $4.9bn f            | $6-8bn g      | $7-9bn g        | $7-9bn g                |\n\n- a Reduction in absolute emissions against the 2019 baseline.\n- b Updated February 2023.

The 50% reduction we are aiming for is against a new baseline, which we plan to set based on that new measurement approach.\n\n- f In 2022 capital expenditure against aim 5 activities (transition growth investment \uf0ab ) increased from $2.4 billion on an equivalent basis, in 2021 ($2.2 billion based on previous aim 5 low carbon investment metric). Most of this spend related to investments in biogas, EV charging, offshore wind, power and convenience.\n- g 2025 target has been updated from $3-4 billion (in low carbon activity investment \uf0ab ) to $6-8 billion in transition growth investment and 2030 aim has increased from ~$5 billion to $7-9 billion, respectively.\n- h Calculated in accordance with the expanded sales boundary (now the average carbon intensity of our sold energy products including physically traded energy products \uf0ab ), methodology improvements for power, updated carbon intensity factors and physical/ chemical properties, and so differs from those presented in the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2019-2021, sustainability report and ESG datasheet.

It is associated with the CO 2 emissions from the assumed combustion of upstream production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs).\n\n## Average carbon intensity of sold energy products (gCO2e/MJ) bc\n\n|                                                  |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Average carbon intensity of sold energy products |     77 |     78 |     77 |     79 |\n| Refined energy products                          |     92 |     92 |     92 |     95 |\n| Gas products                                     |     67 |     67 |     67 |     68 |\n| Bioproducts                                      |     43 |     43 |     44 |     47 |\n| Power products                                   |     52 |     56 |     59 |     57 |\n\nSince 2019, these estimated Scope 3 emissions covered by aim 2 have reduced by 15% which is at the upper end of our revised 2025 target of a 10-15% reduction against our 2019 baseline.\n\nHowever, between now and 2025, we expect to see growth in underlying production due to major project start-ups, deferred divestments and growth in bpx production. Our aim to reduce our oil and gas production from 2019 levels by around 25% by 2030 underpins our 2030 aim of a 20-30% reduction in Scope 3 emissions covered by aim 2 against a 2019 baseline.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAim 3 is to reduce to net zero the average carbon intensity of sold energy products  by 2050 or sooner.\n\nThis aim applies to the average carbon intensity of sold energy products. It is estimated on a lifecycle (full value chain) basis from the use, production, and distribution of sold energy products per unit of energy (MJ) delivered.\n\nIn February 2022, we expanded aim 3 to include physically traded energy products as well as marketed sales. In future, it may also cover certain other products, for example, those associated with land carbon projects.\n\nWe are reporting on this basis for the first time this year and have recalculated our 2019-2021 data accordingly.\n\nIn 2022, the average carbon intensity of the energy products we sell was 77gCO2 e/MJ. This represents a 2% decrease from our 2019 baseline, primarily driven by a reduction in lifecycle emissions associated with the energy products we sell.\n\nThe estimated Scope 3 emissions from the carbon in our upstream oil and gas production were 307MtCO 2 a in 2022, a slight increase from 304MtCO 2 in 2021, mainly associated with an increase in underlying production  due to the ramp-up of major projects and higher asset performance.\n\n- a Excluding bp's share of production in Rosneft. On 27 February 2022, following the war in Ukraine, the bp board announced that bp intends to exit its 19.75% shareholding in Rosneft Oil Company (Rosneft).\n- b Please see the bp basis of reporting for more information on the list of energy products covered at bp.com/basisofreporting .\n- c The aggregate lifecycle emissions and energy values used in the calculation of the average carbon intensity of sold energy products  is provided in our ESG datasheet on bp.com .\n- d In 2022 capital expenditure against aim 5 activities (transition growth investment ) increased from $2.4 billion on an equivalent basis, in 2021 ($2.2 billion based on previous aim 5 low carbon investment metric). Most of this spend related to investments in biogas, power and offshore wind, and convenience and EV charging.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAim 4 is to install methane measurement at all our existing major oil and gas processing sites by 2023, publish the data, and then drive a 50% reduction in methane intensity of our operations.\n\nAnd we will work to influence our joint ventures to set their own methane intensity targets of 0.2%.\n\nOur methane intensity in 2022 was 0.05%, an improvement from 0.07% in 2021. Methane emissions from upstream operations, used to calculate our intensity, continued on the declining trend they have followed since 2016, when we reported 111kt, decreasing by 35% to around 28kt, from 43kt in 2021. Variations in production and divestments accounted for approximately 85% of the absolute reductions reported for 2022, and methane reductions from SERs, accounted for 14%. Marketed gas volumes increased by 4.8% from 3,057bcf in 2021 to 3,205bcf in 2022. We remain on track to deliver against the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring Initiative by 2030, and in our bpx energy operations by 2025.\n\nAnd we remain on course to deliver our methane measurement aim by the end of 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAim 5 is to increase the proportion of investment we make into our non-oil and gas businesses.\n\nOver time, as investment goes up in low and zero carbon, we see it going down in oil and gas.\n\nIn 2022 transition growth investment  was $4.9 billion compared to $2.4 billion in 2021, this was around 30% of total capital expenditure for the year, up from around 3% in 2019. As we pursue our net zero ambition, we are targeting increasing our transition growth investment to $6-8 billion in 2025 and we are aiming for $7-9 billion in 2030, see page 29. Some capital investment goes into large transactions, like our acquisition of Archaea Energy and EDF Energy Services in 2022.",

It focused on several themes during 2022, including methane emissions reductions, the need for increased climate policy and regulation, and zero and low carbon transportation.\n\nThe Climate Action 100+ Net Zero Company Benchmark assessed our Climate Policy Engagement as 'Aligned' - on the basis that we take up Paris Agreement-aligned climate lobbying positions.\n\nWe publish examples of our activity in support of aim 6 online at bp.com/advocacyactivities .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAim 7 is to incentivize our global workforce to deliver on our aims and mobilize them to become advocates for net zero.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis will include continuing to allocate a percentage of remuneration linked to emissions reductions for leadership and around 32,000 a employees. Our annual bonus for all eligible employees, including the bp leadership team, has been linked to a sustainability measure since 2019. The bonus scorecard against which our employees are measured incentivizes our\n\npeople based on three themes: safety and sustainability (30%), operational performance (20%) and financial performance (50%).\n\nIn 2022 we expanded the sustainability measures in our long-term incentive plan scorecard for group leaders. This included explicitly linking performance to progress on our net zero operations aim. We also included two social measures - on employee engagement and on improved ethnic minority representation in our senior-level leader population. Collectively, these changes mean that more than 30% of our long-term incentive plan is linked to sustainability measures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee the Directors' remuneration report on page 112 and Share ownership on page 68\n\nAim 8 is to set new expectations for our relationships with trade associations around the globe.\n\nWe periodically assess the alignment of key associations with our position on climate. In 2022 we reviewed 51 of our most significant trade association memberships. In comparison, we reviewed 30 memberships in our inaugural 2020 report. In 2022 we found that 41 associations aligned with our climate positions, and 10 were partially aligned - this means we disagreed on some positions or they did not take a public stance.\n\nWe plan to provide an update on partially aligned associations in 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## See bp.com/tradeassociations\n\nAim 9 is to be recognized as an industry leader for the transparency of our reporting. On 12 February 2020, we declared our support for the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). We intend to work constructively with the TCFD and others - such as the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) - to develop good practices and standards for transparency.\n\nWe support work to align global reporting standards and want to play our part in the development of quality, reliable, comparable standards that enable companies to prepare and disclose material, decision-useful information to stakeholders. In 2022 we\n\nshared our views on consultations from the SEC, ISSB and UK Transition Plan Taskforce. Our responses are available at bp.com/ advocacyactivities.\n\nFor the second year running, we have reported in line with the FCA Listing Rule LR 9.8.6(8). It requires us to report on a 'comply or explain' basis against the TCFD Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures. We consider our 2022 climate-related financial disclosures to be consistent with all of the TCFD Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures, and therefore compliant with the Listing Rule.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSee TCFD disclosures on page\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAim 10 is to provide integrated clean energy and mobility solutions.\n\nOur regions, corporates and solutions team is working to help countries, cities and corporations around the world decarbonize.\n\nWe do this through our one-stop-shop offer and integrated approach. In 2022 this included:\n\n- \u00b7 Working to advance components of the East Coast Cluster - a vision for decarbonizing local heavy industries at scale, with CO2 from their emissions taken offshore for permanent storage through Northern Endurance Partnership's carbon capture and storage facilities.\n- \u00b7 Signing a memorandum of understanding with Thyssenkrupp Steel that focuses on developing a long-term supply of low carbon hydrogen and renewable power in steel production.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbp.com/rcs",

        "page_content": "## Streamlined energy and carbon reporting (SECR) information continued\n\n## Energy efficiency measures\n\nSince 2016 we have delivered 8.0MtCO 2e of sustainable emissions reductions (SERs) across our operated sites.\n\nThis is our key metric for tracking annual reductions in GHG emissions from energy efficiency savings and direct GHG emissions.\n\nA total of 152 SERs were delivered in 2022 leading to reductions of 1.5MtCO 2 e. This compares with 120 SERs and a reduction of 1.6MtCO 2e in 2021, which included reduced fuel consumption in the North Sea, waste heat recovery in the Azerbaijan Georgia T\u00fcrkiye (AGT) region, the automation of gas turbine generators (power export optimization) in Oman, projects across bpx energy sites in the US Permian basin including electrification and removal of existing compressors to reduce fuel use.\n\nEnergy efficiency projects delivered in 2022 include:\n\n- \u00b7 bpx energy - projects across its sites, which focused on improving energy efficiency including the removal of redundant compressors and installation of smart control systems which optimize engine fuel use.\n- \u00b7 Tangguh LNG - a steam heat recovery project delivering reduced fuel gas consumption through rerouting excess steam to drive turbines.\n- \u00b7 Refining - projects delivered across refining including cogeneration (combined heat and power) at Whiting refinery and waste heat recovery at Castell\u00f3n where steam from hydrotreaters is routed to new heat exchangers to recover energy.\n- \u00b7 bp shipping - advanced hull coatings have been applied on a selected class of vessels. This reduced the speed of biofouling, improving the efficiency of ships and enabling a reduction in fuel consumption. Application of advanced hull coating will be applied to further class vessel types in the coming years.\n- \u00b7 North Sea - existing sea water lift pumps were replaced with smaller pumps leading to energy savings of 125KWh. Glen Lyon reduced fuel consumption through delivering spinning reserve reductions.\n\nAs part of managing energy efficiency, we take a portfolio-wide approach to assessing and prioritizing spinning reserve reduction opportunities.\n\nSpinning reserve involves running additional power generation machines to provide an excess of energy supply. This can help to protect production from plant vulnerabilities, including power generation reliability.\n\nReducing spinning reserve can increase exposure to power fluctuations for production. We take a risk-based approach when considering reducing the number of running machines. This allows bp to realize emissions and maintenance cost reductions from fewer running machines, while managing the associated production risk.\n\nIn 2022 we worked on improving operational performance through updating unit key energy indicators and developing real-time digital carbon and energy dashboards. We also developed maintenance, operational and project opportunities to improve emissions and energy performance at several sites. New carbon and energy steering committees were also set up at some sites.\n\nbp is involved in several external groups working on energy efficiency including the Oil & Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), International Association of Oil & Gas Producers (IOGP) and Energy Star. We run an annual training course for new chemical engineers which includes energy efficiency and offers GHG emissions and energy efficiency training for more experienced engineers and practitioners.\n\n## Reporting methodology\n\nOur approach to reporting GHG emissions broadly follows the IPIECA, API, IOGP and Petroleum Industry Guidelines for Reporting GHG Emissions. We calculate GHG emissions based on the fuel consumption and fuel properties for major sources, such as flares. We report CO2 and methane. We do not include nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride as they are not material to our operations and it is not currently practical to collect this data at scale.\n\nEnergy consumption is monitored and reported centrally from all operated sites by fuel type. This includes all energy, both imported and self-produced, used to run our operations aligned with our GHG reporting boundary, but excludes energy content of flared or vented gas. Although flaring and venting reflects loss of energy resources, it does not reflect energy use required for production or manufacturing of products.\n\n## Ratio of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions to gross production\n\nbp reports a ratio of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions to gross production, see SECR table on page 48. This covers all our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions on an operational control boundary and uses gross operated sales from our operated oil and gas facilities, refinery throughput and petrochemicals produced. The denominator uses output from production businesses, refineries and petrochemical facilities, which account for 95% of total operated emissions. The intensity ratio has improved due to our aim 1 reductions, as described on page 46.\n\nThe ratio provided in the SECR table uses production and throughput from our operated upstream, refining and chemicals businesses as a measure of output which can be consistently reported against. We report data on a consolidated basis in the Annual Report and Form 20-F and this differs to the production and throughput used for the ratio in the SECR table which aligns with the operated emissions reporting boundary.",

The CEO is responsible for proposing bp's strategy to the board for approval and leading the bp leadership team in delivering bp's strategy and annual plan.\n\nUnder this delegation, the CEO is responsible for overseeing the implementation of a comprehensive system of internal controls that are designed to, among other things (a) identify and manage risks that are material to bp, (b) protect bp's assets, and (c) monitor the application of bp's resources in a manner that meets external regulatory standards. Risks, for these purposes, include the climate-related risks and opportunities for bp associated with the issue of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy. This is set out in the CEO role profile at bp.com/board .\n\nThe assessment and management of climaterelated risks and opportunities is embedded across bp at various levels and delegated authority flows down from the board through the CEO. See page 69 for more information on risk governance and oversight.\n\n## 2022 activity\n\nWhere considered appropriate, climate-related risks and opportunities were discussed at bp leadership team meetings in 2022 as part of regular business performance updates produced for these meetings.\n\nThe bp leadership team provides oversight of risk, including climate-related risk, through the various committees described on page 69. The leadership team is informed about and monitors emerging risks via the 'emerging risk' paper, produced by the SVP, treasury which focuses primarily on short to medium term emerging risk. The members of the leadership team are also updated on the longer-term risks and\n\nopportunities associated with the energy transition via the 'tracking the energy transition, paper produced by our chief economist. These papers are shared with the board.\n\n## SVP level and beyond\n\nThe bp leadership team is supported by bp's senior-level leadership and their respective teams, with dedicated business and functional expertise focused on climate-related risks and opportunities or on matters which may be affected by such risks and opportunities, including health, safety, environment and carbon; risk; strategy and sustainability (which includes our carbon ambition, policy and economics teams). Alignment between group, business and functional leaders is fostered through other meetings, for example, the C&P Sustainability Management Forum or the TCFD working group which leads the preparation of bp's TCFD disclosures.\n\n## Management consideration of climate-related risks and opportunities is organized as follows:\n\n| Resource commitment meeting      | Forum for approval of investments related to existing and new lines of business above $250 million  (organic) and $25 million (inorganic), or which exceed the relevant EVP financial authority, and any  project considered strategically important such as a new market entry, see page 29.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Group sustainability committee   | Provides oversight, challenge and support in the implementation of bp's sustainability frame and  the management of potentially significant non-operational sustainability (including climate-related)  risks and opportunities.

During 2022 the committee considered progress  embedding sustainability, performance against targets and bp's position on certain strategic  sustainability issues that present risks or opportunities to delivery. This committee is chaired by the  EVP strategy, sustainability & ventures (SS&V) and comprises members of the bp leadership team.  The outputs from the committee are shared with the board and its committees, including the safety  and sustainability committee, as appropriate. |\n| Group operational risk committee | Provides oversight of safety and operational risk management performance for the group, where  appropriate.

Describe the organization's processes for identifying and assessing climaterelated risks.\n\nbp's risk management system and policy, described on page 69, are designed to address all types of risks including our principal risks and uncertainties described on page 73.\n\nAs part of this system, our businesses, integrators and enablers are responsible for identifying, assessing, managing, and monitoring risks associated with their business or functional area. The process for identifying risks is outlined on page 70 and guidance to support consistency has been made available to our businesses, integrators and enablers to provide them with a climate-related framework and taxonomy, which they are able to use as they see fit in their identification and assessment of risk.\n\nWhere risks - including climate-related risks - are identified, businesses, integrators and enablers are required to assess them, in line with our risk management policy. This includes an impact and likelihood assessment which supports the consideration of relative significance and prioritization of risk management activities.\n\nThe impact criteria outlined on page 70 include health and safety, environmental, financial and non-financial (such as regulatory impact) criteria and are used for assessing risks, including climate-related risks. This provides a consistent basis for assessment across bp.\n\nFor the purposes of our TCFD disclosures, we have made use of the TCFD's distinction between 'physical' and 'transition' climaterelated risks.",

Describe how processes for identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organization's overall Risk Management.\n\n## Risk Management process\n\nRisks which may be identified include potential effects on operations at asset level, performance at business level and developments at regional level from extreme weather or the transition to a lower carbon economy.\n\nAs part of our annual process the bp leadership team and board review the group's principal risks and uncertainties. Climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy has been identified as a principal risk, see page 74. It covers various aspects of how risks associated with the energy transition could manifest. Similarly, physical risks such as extreme weather, which may be affected or intensified by climate change, are covered in our principal risks related to safety and operations.\n\n## Physical risk\n\nPhysical risks are typically identified at the asset or project level and are managed depending on the level of risk assessed.\n\nIn the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico, regions more prone to severe weather conditions, our offshore facilities monitor meteorological and oceanographic conditions through the collection of measurements. This data is collated and periodically compared against the 'Basis of Design' for the facility. If significant differences are observed, then this may trigger an update to the 'Basis of Design', prompting action to reassess risks such as structural integrity and station-keeping and if necessary, implement additional risk mitigations, for example updating procedures for shutting down and removing personnel from facilities ahead of severe weather events. Updates may also be made as a result of other new knowledge, analysis methods and data, including climate projections where appropriate.\n\nOur major projects  are required to assess the potential impact of severe weather and projected climate-related physical impacts. Where relevant, potential changes in environmental conditions, such as sea level rise and ambient temperatures, over the expected lifetime of a project are to be considered as part of the design process.\n\nIn 2022 we undertook a top-down climate modelling exercise to help further understand potential changes in key parameters, including extreme precipitation, temperatures and sea level rise, at our major operating sites. Further analysis of the results of this exercise will be carried out to determine whether and how they might inform physical risk identification, assessment and management at those sites.\n\nFor other assets, such as our retail sites , that are typically not exposed to a comparable level of severe weather risk, climate-related risks such as flooding or wind damage may be managed where appropriate through the emergency response plans and business continuity plans which are mandated through company-wide policies.\n\nAdditionally, at a group level we recognize risk associated with the potential for increased water scarcity due to climate change and other factors and the impact this could have on our operations and in the catchments where we operate. In order to understand the water-related challenges that we face, we review our water impacts, risks and opportunities at our major operating sites. These reviews consider the quantity and quality of water used as well as any regulatory requirements. Over time, we anticipate site-level activities in support of our aim 17 contributing to our management of water-related risks and opportunities. Under aim 17, we aim to replenish more fresh water than we consume in our operations by being more efficient in operational fresh water use and effluent management. And, by collaborating with others to replenish fresh water in stressed and scarce catchment areas where we operate.\n\n## Transition risk\n\nThe board appraises bp's strategy and monitors bp's management and operations to obtain assurance over the delivery of its strategy. This approach enables the effective management of climate-related transition risks and opportunities facing bp associated with the energy transition. For the purposes of our TCFD disclosures, we have grouped transition risks identified by our businesses, integrators and enablers, into the three broad material climaterelated transition risks to bp, see page 55. However, we continue to assess and manage the component parts of those broad transition risks, including:\n\n## Policy and legal risks\n\nOur policy and partnerships team monitors and develops policy positions in line with bp's sustainability aims. This team works with our regional organization as well as corporate entities to discuss regional and global policy trends and support external positioning and interactions relating to policy and advocacy topics. Our group sustainability committee provides oversight of sustainability matters\n\nand our issues and advocacy meeting covers emerging advocacy issues.\n\nOur legal team manages bp's litigation, including climate-related litigation and advises on the management of associated risks. This includes the use of internal lawyers and, where appropriate, external counsel.\n\n## Market risks\n\nIn developing our business strategies, we consider market risks, controls and mitigations including future demand in the different geographies in which we might operate, the competitive landscape and the potential value proposition. We manage these risks through our investment decisions, our hedging and optimization activity, and through key business processes including the group investment assurance and approval process.\n\n## Reputational risks\n\nOur investor relations and communications & external affairs (C&EA) teams work to mitigate reputation-related risks, which include the risk of shareholder action. Our investor relations team co-ordinates engagement with key investors on both a bilateral basis and through investor initiatives to support understanding of bp's strategy and gain insights to inform feedback they provide to the group.\n\nOur C&EA team manages corporate reputation through identification and monitoring of key issues and both proactive and reactive engagement with relevant stakeholder groups to communicate bp's positions. Under our aim 6, which is to actively advocate for policies that promote net zero, the team also leads advocacy campaigns for policies that support net zero, see page 47.\n\n## Technology risks\n\nOur technology insights team work to both mitigate risks and identify opportunities associated with evolving and emerging technologies that play a role in the changing global energy system. The team generates technology assessments and disruptive technology reports for review by bp senior executives and the recommendations are overseen by the board through the Innovation Advisory Council. In appropriate cases this helps to underpin and appraise the business case for new investments, new partnerships, new customer offers or new business models where these are being driven by technology innovation.",

Describe the climate-related risk and opportunities that the organization has identified over the short, medium, and long term.\n\nIn setting and monitoring delivery of bp's strategy, the board and leadership team consider climate-related risks and opportunities across the:\n\n- \u00b7 Short term (to 2025): aligning with our near-term business and financial planning timeframe.\n- \u00b7 Medium term (to 2030): aligning with our group business outlook timeframe, and enabling us to think beyond our short-term targets and adjust course if appropriate.\n- \u00b7 Long term (to 2050): using scenarios to help explore the wide range of uncertainties surrounding the energy transition over the next 30 years. For more detail on our approach, see page 9.\n\nTCFD categorizes climate-related transition risk and opportunity as follows: policy and legal, market, reputation and technology. It also refers to climate-related acute and chronic physical risks and opportunities. Risks in each of these categories have been identified using a risk management process that our businesses, integrators and enablers are required to follow. For more about how the relative significance of identified risks is evaluated, see Risk Management on page 52.\n\n## Climate-related transition risks and opportunities\n\nAt a group level, we have identified three broad, material climate-related transition risks, underpinned by underlying risks that are assessed and managed through the risk process outlined overleaf on page 55. These transition risks may cut across our short, medium and long-term time horizons; however, we indicate below wherever there is a particular time horizon in which the risk has been considered.\n\nThe transition risks are also global in nature, so we do not discuss specific geographies here, but the underlying risks refer to specific geographies where appropriate a .\n\nWe also see significant potential for upside or opportunity - associated with some of these risks. These are discussed under each risk on page 55 and in respect of Recommended Disclosure (b) we also describe the potential impacts of both the risks and opportunities to bp.\n\n## Climate-related physical risks\n\nThe physical risks we have identified primarily relate to severe weather and often represent potential for increased drivers for safety and operational risks to our operations, particularly process safety, personal safety, and environmental risks, see Risk factors page 73. In addition, we have identified the potential for changes in the availability of freshwater, including as a result of climate change, as a risk to some of our operations.\n\nWe also recognize that we could also face other forms of physical climate-related risk over the longer term, for example associated with changes in sea level rise, extreme temperatures and flooding, which could impact our operations. As these risks are primarily operational, and location-specific, they are not grouped in the same way as transition risks.\n\n## Offshore facilities\n\nIn the case of our offshore facilities, climate change could create greater uncertainty around frequency and/or intensity of severe weather events, such as extreme waves, loop currents, and storms, particularly in the medium to long term. These factors could affect the future risk profile of an asset over its lifetime, and could also impact production or costs.\n\n## Water resources\n\nWater resources are increasingly under pressure from various factors, including climate change, and this poses a potential risk to some of our operations that depend on the availability of freshwater. Based on analysis using the World Resources Institute (WRI) Aqueduct Global Water Risk Atlas, five of our 17 major operating sites in 2022 were located in regions with medium to extremely high water stress. We have identified the potential for this risk to increase in the medium term. For more information on water consumption, see page 64.\n\nIn common with other businesses around the world, in the longer term we could face adverse market or value chain conditions associated with large-scale cumulative impacts of physical climate change if global mitigation and adaptation efforts are insufficient or unsuccessful. We support the goals of the Paris Agreement and believe that the best mitigation against these types of physical risk is to seek to contribute along with others to the success of global climate mitigation efforts. Our strategy seeks to position us to make such a positive contribution.\n\nWe do not currently foresee any material opportunities arising from changes in the physical environment as a result of climate change. However, the actions we are taking to make our operations more resilient, for example through improving efficiency of our freshwater use, may also bring about benefits such as reduced costs.\n\n## Recommended Disclosure:\n\nb. Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning.\n\n## bp's plans for the energy transition\n\nWe describe below how we believe our strategy and net zero ambition are both good for business and support society's drive towards the Paris goals.\n\nIn this section we talk about some of our plans for the transition and where we do so we have identified these with . b\n\nThroughout the strategic report we set out bp's strategy and plans for the energy transition. This includes our progress against our strategic focus areas and transition growth engines, see pages 10, 14-19.\n\nOur progress against our net zero aims and the actions we are taking to help the world get to net zero are described on pages 45-47.\n\nOur strategy is to transition to be an integrated energy company, focused on delivering solutions for customers. This strategy, together with our net zero ambition and aims (see page 45), has been informed by various inputs, including the climate-related risks and opportunities associated with the energy transition described above; the same is true of our financial and business processes. We describe how we use scenarios to inform our strategy on page 9.",

These  consequences could affect us in the short, medium or long term.  Alternatively, increased support from our stakeholders could enable access to additional capital and new investors,  strengthening our ability to deliver our strategy and enabling faster growth of our low carbon businesses.

This is less than previously assumed given the strong progress we have made improving operational reliability and commerciality across our portfolio over the past few years, which we expect to help enhance the resilience of those assets through the transition.\n\nAs a result, our 2030 production aim is now around 2mmboe/d after divestments.\n\nTo enable resilience to lower oil and gas prices which could result from the transition, as well as to deliver value, we intend to maintain the disciplined application of our balanced investment criteria, which include the consideration of hurdle rates of 15-20% from a balanced portfolio across oil and gas. We also intend to drive capital productivity through strong execution capability and sustain cost efficiency and reliability improvements. See more about our investment process on page 28.",

        "page_content": "## Climate-related financial disclosures continued\n\nIn 2022 we announced our agreement to sell our upstream businesses in Algeria to Eni and completed the formation of the Azule Energy joint venture with Eni in Angola. We also took steps to make our business in Canada more focused, resilient and competitive through the sale of our 50% interest in the Sunrise oil sands project together with the acquisition of a 35% position in the offshore Bay du Nord project.\n\nWe are aiming for the Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations - the majority of which are associated with the operating assets in our hydrocarbons portfolio - to be 50% lower in 2030 than in 2019, and the Scope 3 emissions from our upstream oil and gas production to be 20-30% lower in 2030 than in 2019 - see page 45.\n\nWe see cash flow from our oil and gas businesses as helping to fund our investment into transition growth engines, while delivering shareholder value and helping maintain a strong balance sheet.\n\nThe climate-related transition risks we have identified may also impact demand for certain refined products in the future, potentially leading to lower refinery margins and requiring less efficient refineries to be retired. Consequently, we are continuing to drive greater competitiveness and value from our refineries, targeting around 96% Solomon refining availability by 2025 and to maintain Solomon first quartile net cash margins.\n\nOur refineries are also a foundation for both our bioenergy and hydrogen transition growth engines. In biofuels, we plan to grow production to around 100,000 barrels per day by 2030 (of which ~20,000 barrels would be from co-processing at our refineries, focused on SAF). In hydrogen, our existing refining demand is intended to be an anchor to build scale. As a result, we expect throughput to be sustained around current levels while the average carbon intensity of our refined products declines.\n\nTaking account of some of the climate-related transition opportunities we have identified, we also aim to increase biogas supply volumes by around six times compared to 2022 levels, to about 70mboe/d by 2030, leveraging our position as the largest US biogas supplier to the road transportation sector and expanding our presence in Europe and internationally. Our acquisition of Archaea Energy, completed in December 2022, advances our access to feedstock and scales our upstream participation in the biogas value chain.\n\na\n\nConvenience & mobility: recognizing the growing opportunities in low carbon mobility that the energy transition offers, we are growing our EV charging network with the aim of having >100,000 charge points installed by 2030 and expanding our Castrol business into the EV sector. We see these and other businesses being supported by our focus to install on-the-go fast a charging and an end-to-end integrated fleet offer. As the aviation industry also transitions, we are aiming to be a sector leader in SAF.\n\nWe recognize the risk of a decline in demand for conventional vehicle fuels and products due to the energy transition and we are working to increase the efficiency and resiliency of our existing fuels and lubricants businesses through operating cost reductions and margin optimization. We are also using digital platforms to become more customer-centric, integrate our EV charging solutions, and expand our customer and loyalty engagement platforms.\n\nOur convenience business, which serves a broad range of customer needs (not only fuels-led) further serves to mitigate the risk of decreasing fuel demand at our retail sites , while providing the opportunity for us to bring our capabilities and reach in convenience together with EV charging - we see this enabling us over time to provide customerfocused, lower carbon transport solutions.\n\nIntegration of the customer-facing aspects of our strategy with our production of biofuels, hydrogen, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and electricity also helps to provide security of supply and to safeguard margins in a potentially supply-constrained faster transition or during periods of high market volatility.\n\nThe speed of the energy transition may impact the pace at which the EV, SAF, biofuels, hydrogen and LNG sectors develop, impacting the number of customer touchpoints  and revenue from these opportunities. If these sectors develop quicker or slower, or demand for products is different to that anticipated, it could result in under-utilization of assets in the short term, therefore impacting returns on capital we have allocated into these sectors.\n\n- Low carbon energy: we recognize the opportunity to scale up our low carbon energy businesses over the next decade underpinned by growing demand and regulatory support.\n\nIn hydrogen, our ambition remains to become a global leader. We aim to leverage bp's existing refinery demand and growing biofuels ambitions to build regional supply positions, providing low carbon energy solutions to our customers. As the hydrogen sector develops, we aim to create\n\na portfolio of global export hubs for hydrogen and hydrogen derivatives, aiming to scale our production to 0.5-0.7 million tonnes each year of primarily green hydrogen by 2030 while selectively pursuing blue hydrogen opportunities where there is regulatory support and CCS access.\n\nIn renewable power, we are focusing our investments in opportunities where we can create integration value and enhanced returns, participating in service of green hydrogen, green and e-fuels, EV charging and power trading (including low carbon flexible generation). We are building a global position in offshore wind, enabled by our capability in large-scale, complex offshore projects, and continue to progress a solar development and sell model with Lightsource bp. Within this, we aim to deliver, and largely operate, around 10GW net installed capacity in offshore wind, solar and onshore wind by 2030.\n\nAs the energy transition drives increasing electrification of the global energy system, our power trading business, which trades renewable and non-renewable electricity, allows us to optimize across the power value chain, from generation, including renewables and flexible generation, across grid markets, to customers. This becomes a differentiating factor in unlocking the full potential value of renewables for bp and helps position us for further electrification of the energy system as well as for further decarbonization of electricity. It may also increasingly help optimize across other value chains like green hydrogen and advanced mobility, that may be dependent on power as an anchor commodity.\n\nWe retain the ability to flex capital between our transition growth engines to optimize returns, recognizing the potential for the transition to occur faster or slower than anticipated and on different pathways. To help maintain resilience to the possibility of a slower transition, we also continue to consider whether the necessary regulatory support is in place and seek to secure a customer-backed route to market for a reasonable share of energy produced by our renewable power and hydrogen projects prior to final investment.\n\n## Impact on technology\n\nWe are investing in technology that can help to generate value for bp and also help to accelerate the transition through focused scale-up and innovation. Over time, we expect our research and development spend to be increasingly focused on technologies with the potential to reduce carbon emissions and enable our new low carbon businesses.

        "page_content": "We recognize the potential for disruptive technologies to impact our strategy, our bp ventures portfolio includes investments in emerging technologies and business models that may help enable the transition to a low carbon economy.\n\n## Physical risk\n\nThe potential impacts of the types of physical risks we have identified could include reduced production, throughput, or sales - for example as a result of damage to facilities or supply chain disruption - or in a most extreme case loss of life or an asset. Due to uncertainties associated with the impact of climate change on severe weather events in the future, it is difficult to quantify the potential impacts associated with any increase in these risks as a result of climate change.\n\nHaving considered both geographic factors and the ability of climate models to adequately represent future trends in physical climate parameters, we seek to take the uncertainties concerning climate-related physical risk into account in our approach to design and operating criteria for existing assets and new major projects . Where appropriate, we have updated our metocean design criteria to include consideration of both forward-looking and historic models including climate and synthetic models, in an attempt to mitigate both models and extrapolation uncertainty. The particular models chosen will depend in part on geographic location. See Risk Management, page 52, for how we manage these uncertainties.\n\nAs a step in seeking to improve the resilience of our operations to the physical changes that might result from climate change that we have described above, we have undertaken screening of present-day and future potential physical risk exposure for selected key assets and identified those sites with potential for heightened exposure to physical risks in order to prioritize these for further site-based assessment.\n\nAs part of this prioritized approach, in 2022 we completed a detailed site-based study at our Whiting refinery in the US, which found that the weather hazards contributing the most to risks at site include intense summer rainfall events, extremes of air temperature and coastal surge. Taking account of the results of the study, the Whiting integrity management team are assessing new risk barriers to support mitigation of potential risks.\n\nRecognizing the potential impact of climate change on water resources, as part of our aim 17 to become water positive by 2035, we are taking steps to be more efficient in operational freshwater use and effluent management (see page 64).\n\n## Impacts on our financial planning\n\nCapital allocation: We plan to invest sufficient capital to execute our strategy, enabling us to mitigate the risks and capture the opportunities we have identified. As part of our annual planning processes, we assess the distribution of capital across our business areas, including consideration of market evolution. In February 2023 we announced up to $2 billion each year more investment, on average, to 2030 than the plans underpinning our February 2022 strategy update previously anticipated. In aggregate this includes up to $8 billion more this decade in transition growth engine investment  and up to $8 billion more this decade into oil and gas. We now expect capital investment including inorganics to be in a range of $14-18 billion through 2030 a , with the proportion of that investment directed annually towards our five transition growth engines growing to around 50% in 2030. To help maintain resilience to the pace of transition and access opportunities, we will continue to flex capital as policies, technologies and markets evolve.\n\nAccess to capital: While there is potential for concerns about the energy transition to impact banks' or debt investors' appetite to finance hydrocarbon activity, we do not anticipate any material change to funding in the short to medium term, and our financial frame includes working to reduce net debt as well as targeting further progress within the 'A' range of a strong investment grade credit rating. In 2022 we reduced our net debt by over $9 billion. Since the end of 2019 we have repurchased around $15 billion of short-dated existing bonds and issued over $11 billion of new bonds with a duration of 20 years or longer, more than doubling the duration of our debt book to over 10 years. Additionally, we have continued to have good access to the commercial paper markets. We intend to allocate 40% of surplus cash flow  in 2023 to further strengthen the balance sheet, targeting further progress within the 'A' range. We provide more detail on financial risk factors, including liquidity risk in Financial statements - Note 29.\n\nInvestment criteria: investments are evaluated against a balanced set of investment criteria; the economic criteria utilize a set of price assumptions that reflect our view of market evolution (for our key investment appraisal price assumptions see page 28). In addition, the investment economics for all investment cases where annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from operations are anticipated to exceed specific thresholds include a carbon price for those emissions, that rises to $100/ teCO2 e (2021 $ real) in 2030.\n\nIn 2022 we further embedded sustainability into our investment governance process by developing our sustainability assessment template for investments, for use in all investment cases reviewed by the resource commitment meeting. This provides information about an investment case's impact on our net zero aims 1-3, its expected GHG intensity, and significant impacts on or contribution to certain aims concerning people and planet. This helps to maintain the consistency of our investments with our strategy and sustainability aims, see page 30 for further information.\n\n## Impacts on financial performance and position\n\nAssessing the impact of climate change and the energy transition requires the use of a number of judgements and estimates. We have set out the significant accounting policies, judgements and estimates used in assessing the impact of climate change in Financial statements Note 1.\n\nThis includes information on pricing, useful economic lives, timing of implementation of policies or decommissioning provisions, and assumptions related to how each might change over time and how such assumptions may impact our currently reported assets and liabilities.\n\nOur price assumptions, including those set out on page 28, reflect a range of future possible scenarios and take account of the potential impact of climate-related risks and opportunities as well as current economic and geopolitical factors. Consequently, impairment losses and impairment reversals consider inputs that arise from climate change and the energy transition. It is not possible to quantify separately the impact of these different inputs on our impairments. However in conducting our impairment sensitivity tests, that in part reflect transition downside risk, we consider prices consistent with the 1.5\u00b0C scenario family within the WBCSD data sets used for TCFD resilience testing below.\n\nFinancial statements - Note 1 provides information on impairment assumptions and sensitivities. Note 4 provides information on gains and losses on disposal or closure of business and operations, and impairments and impairment reversals, and Note 8 provides information on impairment losses relating to exploration for and evaluation of oil and natural gas resources. See Financial statements Note 1, Note 4 and Note 8 for more information.",

        "page_content": "## Climate-related financial disclosures continued\n\n## Recommended Disclosure:\n\n- c. Describe the resilience of the organization's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2\u00b0C or lower scenario.\n\nOur strategy is designed to be resilient to a range of climate-related scenarios including those consistent with well-below 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C outcomes, see page 26.\n\nTo help test our view of this, we have assessed the resilience of our strategy to different climate-related scenarios, including 1.5\u00b0C consistent scenarios. We did this in three steps:\n\n- 1.  First, we evaluated all business areas in our portfolio by i) quantitatively assessing their financial materiality, in the context of bp's total financial frame, to understand the potential scale of financial/strategic impact that could be put at risk if exposed to transition uncertainty, including 1.5\u00b0C; and ii) considered whether there is a key variable such as price, margin or demand - which would represent a principal transition driver of such risk.\n- 2.  Second, we quantitatively assessed the impact, to each business area, of potential transition exposure scenarios in 2030 - the point in our planning horizon at which there is widest uncertainty.\n- -  For each of those business areas with both sufficient scale and for which a specific transition risk driver was identified - which collectively represent over 80% of our 2030 adjusted EBITDA outlook - we performed a scenario analysis focused on that transition risk driver, across a range of transition pathways a , including 1.5\u00b0C, as set out below and in our methodology summary on page 60.\n- -  For each of the remaining business areas we performed a simplified quantitative scenario analysis, by testing the financial impact of 'a scenario in which each business area's expected 2030 adjusted EBITDA is assumed to be reduced to zero - an outcome at least as detrimental to that business area's adjusted EBITDA as could reasonably be expected to result from business-as-usual (BAU), well-below 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C transition pathways.'\n- In this way, all business areas were quantitatively tested at, or beyond, a range of transition scenarios.\n- 3.  Finally, on the basis of the results of steps 1 and 2, we identified those business areas for which the possible consequences of the downside scenario(s) were sufficiently material to potentially jeopardize group strategic resilience - the only business areas for which this was found to be the case were oil and gas production with respect to their exposure to oil price. For these business areas we assessed the potential implications for bp's strategic resilience (as defined below) over the full period from 2024 to 2030.\n\nTo undertake steps 2 and 3, we identified financial criteria which can be modelled as proxies for strategic resilience - choosing to do this through three lenses: our ability to continue to (i) deliver a resilient dividend to shareholders, (ii) maintain a strong investment grade credit rating, and (iii) make disciplined investment allocations within our capital frame.\n\nThis is not intended to represent a 'definition' of resilience beyond the purposes of this exercise, and a core assumption of this analysis is necessarily that, aside from any implications of the scenarios being tested, including potential controllable mitigations such as capital or cost management that we might naturally expect to take in response, bp will deliver the assumed underlying strategic and financial priorities out to 2030.\n\nOur approach, described in more detail in box 'Our approach to testing resilience to transition risk' on page 60, is directly applicable to transition risks #1 and #2 - as well as their associated opportunities - as these lend themselves to a financially quantified scenariobased analysis. The approach does not directly address transition risk #3 - however, we believe that some of the potential drivers for transition risk #3, namely policy and societal trends, may be implicit in these scenarios, and we believe that the successful execution of our strategy will, over time, help to mitigate this risk to bp as well as positioning us to take advantage of the potential associated opportunities. This scenario analysis exercise also does not directly\n\naddress climate-related physical risk, our strategic resilience to which is further discussed below.\n\n## Key insights from our scenario analysis and resilience test\n\nWhile the results of any such analysis must be treated with caution - each is necessarily dependent on numerous assumptions and methodological choices, and each has its own limitations - overall, this analysis and resilience test reinforced our confidence in the resilience of our strategy to a wide range of transition scenarios, including those consistent with limiting temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C, and in particular, as our greatest transition exposure, to oil price scenarios, tested to 2030. In undertaking this analysis we observed:\n\n- \u00b7 There is considerable uncertainty across, and often within, each WBCSD Scenario Catalogue family in the pace and nature of the transition to 2030 - and therefore considerable range of financial impact across some of the variables selected for the analysis, reflecting the complexity and interdependencies of the energy transition (see table on page 61). Generally, we observed that the faster the pace of transition, the greater the uncertainty in the exact shape of the resulting energy system in 2030.\n- \u00b7 Oil price is likely to remain the main source of climate-related transition uncertainty for our strategy through to 2030, reflecting both the wide range of potential pathways and the contribution to our expected total adjusted EBITDA over this period, that oil-price-linked businesses represent. In the 1.5\u00b0C family, the potential downside suggested by the lowest oil prices is around 28% of group adjusted EBITDA in 2030. However, in a number of the 1.5\u00b0C, well-below 2\u00b0C and BAU scenarios, based on the WBCSD Scenario Catalogue ranges, oil price could offer a financial upside relative to our reference 2030 group business outlook.\n- \u00b7 Even with the most extreme low oil price environment in any of the scenarios, sustained over the period from 2024-30, in our analysis we are able to deliver across the three lenses we use to consider strategic resilience, described above.\n- a Although such scenarios do not and cannot represent all possible futures, we value them as a simplified and schematic way to consider the potential implications of, and uncertainty inherent within, a range of possible energy transition pathways to a future bp portfolio mix.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 The maximum potential scale of downside impact on our 2030 expected group adjusted EBITDA (across the 1.5\u00b0C, well-below 2\u00b0C and BAU scenarios) from our other natural gas businesses was <8%, from our conventional refining and fuels businesses each <4% and from our low carbon activities each being <3%.\n- \u00b7 Our diversified portfolio helps mitigate the implications for our strategic resilience of the exposure of any of one of the individual business areas to the identified risk. It is reasonable to consider each potential outcome in isolation since the outcomes for different business areas vary across scenarios (see table on page 61).\n- \u00b7 In a BAU scenario, we believe our transitioning strategy mitigates the risk of what we and others have referred to as a 'delayed and disorderly' transition, which might follow in the medium to long term. Should the growth of any one of our in-scope transition growth engine areas be challenged by the downside range in the relevant variable, our analysis suggests that the impact of this on group adjusted EBITDA in 2030 would not be sufficient to impact the resilience of our strategy, as described above, in that timeframe.\n\nIt is important to note that insights from this analysis are necessarily limited by the scenarios, methodologies and business assumptions used. The analysis should not be taken as a prediction of the future.\n\n## Maintaining strategic resilience to the transition\n\nTaking into consideration potential constraints associated with factors such as long-term capital investment, contractual commitments and organizational capabilities at any given time, bp's ability to maintain strategic resilience rests, in part, on the governance used to keep the strategy under review in light of new information and changing circumstances. To enable us to understand and respond to the changing pace of the energy transition, we monitor and assess key indicators and metrics, such as policy development, renewables installed capacity, electric vehicle sales and low carbon technology costs. Our strategy and capital allocation, the associated risks, opportunities and their implications for our resilience are all reviewed by the bp leadership team and the board and updated as they consider appropriate.\n\n## Resilience to physical risk\n\nAs described on page 57, we have identified a number of physical risks which may affect our business and assets, the frequency or severity of which could be affected by climate change. Exposure to physical climate-related risk is highly dependent on geographical location and on factors such as asset design, and we seek to manage these risks accordingly. We consider that our approach to managing these risks, described in Risk Management Recommended Disclosure b) on page 53, supports our strategic resilience to them. For the purposes of this Recommended Disclosure, we have considered the potential for physical risks to bp-operated assets to increase as a result of climate change (namely, increases in the potential frequency or intensity of extreme weather events) to such an extent as to have the potential to impact the resilience of our strategy.\n\nDuring 2022, we undertook an analysis of potential changes in certain physical conditions, such as air temperature, precipitation, sea level rise and wave heights, for our onshore and offshore major operating sites, based on Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) emission scenarios 1-2.6, 2-4.5 and 5-8.5. Even in the highest emissions pathway (SSP5-8.5) the results of our analysis suggest that, on the basis of the 50th percentile values and compared to the baseline used (1991-2020), changes in the physical parameters considered are generally unlikely to be significant over the medium term. There is, however, uncertainty across different scenarios and wider variances were observed when looking at the 5th and 95th percentile values. Where the data do suggest greater potential for climate-related changes in physical conditions, we intend to consider whether further work is necessary to understand the potential for those changes to adversely impact our operations. For example, modelled changes in extreme precipitation by 2030 (50th percentile values) are less than 10% across all onshore major operating sites apart from Oman - where we have already undertaken hydrological studies and flood risk assessments that have supported the development of our operations there.\n\nOur transition risk scenario analysis identified impacts on the earnings of our oil-priced businesses as having the most potential to impact the resilience of our strategy in 2030. Therefore, and viewing resilience through the same lenses that we describe above, we have considered the extent to which our oil and gas production business would need to be impacted by evolving physical risk over the same timeframe for the scale of financial impact to be sufficient to jeopardize the resilience of our strategy out to 2030. We concluded that a significant proportion of our combined oil and gas portfolio would need to be either permanently shut in or temporarily shut down to jeopardize our strategic resilience in this way.\n\nHistorically, severe weather risks to our operated assets have not occurred at a scale which could reduce earnings so significantly as to jeopardize the resilience of our strategy. As reflected in the latest science from the IPCC, it is in the nature of climate-induced severe weather events that their occurrence, intensity and severity are unpredictable and uncertain. Our own analysis on major operating sites, described above, is consistent with this IPCC view.\n\nDespite this uncertainty, we have found no definitive basis in either the IPCC report or the limited number of detailed studies we have undertaken (see page 57), to conclude that climate-change-induced increases in the frequency or severity of severe weather events would be likely to result, at any point in time out to 2030, in disruption and shutdowns across our oil and gas portfolio on a scale that would reduce earnings so significantly as to jeopardize the resilience of our strategy.\n\nFor the purposes of this Recommended Disclosure, the resilience of our strategy was considered separately for the relevant transition and physical risks; accordingly, we did not seek to take account of any interdependencies or cumulative effects between the two types of climate-related risk, and the associated potential financial impact.",

        "page_content": "## Climate-related financial disclosures continued\n\n## Our approach to testing resilience to transition risk\n\nMost of our analysis focused on our mediumterm time horizon (2030) - far enough ahead to provide a divergent range of scenarios, while not so far ahead that it is unrealistic to attempt to generate credible financial metrics for bp, or an individual business area within bp. For variables considered most material (see below), we also assessed resilience over the period 2024-30.\n\nOur analysis sought to quantify the potential impact of a range of scenarios, including those consistent with 1.5\u00b0C, on bp's currently held (at the time the analysis was completed) internal reference group business outlook to 2030. This outlook is used for internal corporate planning and holds a current deterministic view of our portfolio, activity set, cost and capital frame. The outlook used in our analysis aligned to the strategic direction shared in the 'bp update on strategic progress' announced on 7 February 2023, and the financials lie within the range of financial outcomes set out in that announcement. a\n\nThe steps we took as part of our scenario analysis approach are outlined here at a high level.\n\n- 1. Whole company assessment: We defined, through quantitative analysis, which business areas could have both the financial scale and clear transition exposures to potentially impact bp's strategic resilience.\n- a.  We assessed the business areas in our portfolio by i) quantitatively evaluating each business area's 'potential significance' - i.e. its expected contribution to bp group adjusted EBITDA in 2030 and therefore the quantum of financial impact that might be put at risk by transition uncertainty (including pathways consistent with 1.5\u00b0C); and ii) by identifying, for each, whether there were primary potential value driver(s) that different transition pathways might impact ('transition risk driver(s)'). This was performed to allocate the most appropriate analysis technique to that business (see 1b and 1c).\n- b.  Ten business areas (see table on page 61), representing over 80% of our expected 2030 adjusted EBITDA, were identified as both providing a potentially significant financial contribution and facing primary transition risk drivers, and accordingly were subjected to the driver-based scenario analysis set out in steps 2a-2c below.\n- c.  The remaining business areas were taken forward to a simplified scenario analysis, per step 2d below.\n- 2. Scenario analysis: We tested the financial impact of transition on all of bp's business areas in 2030 through either specific 'driver-based' scenario modeling (that includes 1.5\u00b0C and current policies), or by 'simplified' conservative scenario analysis, that modeled cases likely to be beyond these ranges.\n- a.  For the driver-based scenario analysis, we selected the primary transition risk driver(s) for each business area - the variable(s) from the WBSCD Scenario Catalogue representing what we consider to be the primary driver(s) of that business area's exposure to the energy transition. For each transition risk driver, we extracted the full range of 2030 outcomes within each scenario 'family'. Given the global nature of the transition risks and opportunities we have identified, we used the 'world' values in the Catalogue except for gas price (see table on page 61).\n- b.  By calibrating the WBCSD Scenario Catalogue 2030 scenarios to relevant business metrics underpinning our strategic planning (for example, oil price or EV demand/utilization), we modelled the impact of each variable, across the full range of scenarios and each scenario family, on the 2030 expected earnings (adjusted EBITDA) for the associated business area(s). For example, we applied an earnings rule of thumb deemed appropriate to the period in question to the deviation of oil prices in WBCSD versus our reference case price. This analysis was unmitigated (see 'Other key considerations').\n- c.  This enabled us to assess the potential for each scenario to materially impact group adjusted EBITDA in 2030 (and by implication associated cash flows), against the reference group business outlook. By modelling the specific business area within the reference group business outlook (described in step 1b above), its exposure to the most extreme range of the respective scenario could be assessed to identify which (if any) variables(s) and scenario(s) could have the potential to impact strategic resilience (as defined below) most materially, and as such, which business areas should be carried forward into a multi-year resilience assessment.\n- d.  For the simplified scenario analysis, we took a simpler conservative approach, by evaluating whether a scenario in which each business area's expected 2030 adjusted EBITDA is assumed to be reduced to zero - an outcome at least as detrimental to that business area's adjusted EBITDA as could reasonably be expected to result from ranges associated with the trajectory of each of the 1.5\u00b0C, 2\u00b0C or BAU scenario families - could have the potential to impact strategic resilience (as defined below) materially.\n- 3. Multi-year resilience test: This step tested bp's resilience to the exposure of any sufficiently material business areas to downside scenarios that may have the potential to jeopardize the ability to generate surplus cash flow  and a strong cash cover ratio and gearing level financial metrics that were treated for the purposes of the analysis as representing financial evidence of delivery of bp's strategic priorities.\n\nFrom step 2, only the exposure to oil price was assessed as sufficiently material in this sense, and hence carried forward for multi-year resilience analysis. Our multi-year (2024-30) oil price resilience test considered sustained low oil prices consistent with the most extreme WBCSD Scenario Catalogue 2025 and 2030 scenarios - for 2025 the IEA (World Energy Model Net Zero Energy 2050) price at $36/ bbl, and for 2030 the UN PRI (Inevitable Policy Response Required Policy Scenario) at $30/bbl (both 2019 $ real).\n\n## Other key considerations\n\n- \u00b7 For the purposes of steps 2 and 3, we considered the resilience of our strategy to climate-related transition risk through the three lenses described on page 55. We defined the following as proxy indicators for these lenses:\n- -  Group surplus cash flow, to confirm whether after funding, among other things, our disclosed capital frame (7 February 2023 investor update) and the dividend/share assumed in our reference group business outlook, sufficient surplus cash flow remains to maintain or reduce net debt and/or make share buybacks.\n- -Healthy cash cover ratio and gearing as indicators of the ability to maintain a strong investment grade credit rating.\n- a As was the case for the analysis presented in the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021 , the financials used do not include any reference to the shareholding in Rosneft that bp announced its intention to exit from on 27 February 2022.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 For steps 2 and 3, we made the simplifying assumption that, aside from the driver being modelled, our strategy, operating model, cost basis, volumes, margins, sales proceeds and taxes would remain unchanged out to 2030. We have also not deviated from bp's reference view of potential future shareholder distributions and uses of surplus cash as a basis for analysis.\n- \u00b7 Therefore, for steps 2 and 3, while there are mitigations that we might naturally be expected to take in response to external trends, including cost reductions, portfolio adjustments or capital reallocation or reduction within the frames set out in our strategy, we have not applied these mitigations to the multi-year analysis. In reality, we keep our strategy under review and would seek to make use of opportunities to maintain our strategic flexibility in the face of the many uncertainties of the energy transition.\n- \u00b7 The design of a strategic resilience analysis involves numerous methodological choices and assumptions - any one of which could reasonably have been different, leading to different outcomes. We have found value in conducting this analysis; however, we are\n- mindful of the limitations to any such exercise and the highly qualified nature of any conclusions which may be drawn from it. The disclosures provided here should be read in conjunction with the rest of our strategic report, where we discuss how we have developed, and continue to evolve, our approach to strategy.\n- \u00b7 As outlined above, we utilized our latest internal reference group business outlook as the basis against which resilience has been tested, as this is our latest deterministic view against which to model the transition sensitivities to 2030 and aligns to the strategic update provided to investors in February 2023. Alongside disclosed elements such as the capital frame to 2030, this includes shaping assumptions such as future distribution and net debt management. Through conducting this analysis, we do not intend to imply or commit to a specific forward trajectory of usage of cash, beyond those disclosed in the full year and 4Q results update on 7 February 2023. While we cannot disclose, for confidentiality reasons, the detail of the deterministic case, the test assesses whether the resilience indicators in our reference group business outlook are\n\n## WBCSD Scenario Catalogue family ranges for 2030 key transition variables\n\n|                           |                                         |                                                               |                                           | BAU                       | BAU                       | Below 2\u00b0C                 | Below 2\u00b0C                 | 1.5\u00b0C                     | 1.5\u00b0C                     |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Business area             |                                         |                                                               | TCFD/WBCSD variable                       | Min                       | Max                       | Min                       | Max                       | Min                       | Max                       |\n| Resilient  hydrocarbons   | Oil and natural gas production          | Oil price a                                                   | ($2019/bbl) 62.82                         |                           | 81.77                     | 45.00                     | 78.45                     | 30.00                     | 71.22                     |\n| Resilient  hydrocarbons   |                                         |                                                               | Natural gas price b  ($2019/mmbtu)        | 2.59                      | 3.60                      | 2.63                      | 3.48                      | 1.90                      | 4.17                      |\n|                           | Refining                                | -

Further, by the nature of the timeframes considered, a variety of uncertainties exist around this deterministic case (including transition risk itself) as indicated by the range of adjusted EBITDA disclosed in the full year and 4Q results update on 7 February 2023. It is not practical, and we have not attempted, to extend the analysis conducted here to any other potential outcomes within the disclosed range of group adjusted EBITDA.\n\n- \u00b7 Where rules of thumb have been applied, to convert variance in hydrocarbon price to variance in adjusted EBITDA, these are deemed appropriate to the period in question - i.e. they reflect the respective 2030 (step 2) and 2024-30 (step 3) production portfolios and price leverage for this period. Due to the evolution of bp's portfolio, these rules of thumb may diverge from any short-term rule of thumb that we publish.",

        "page_content": "## Our approach to sustainability\n\nOur sustainability frame is built on strong foundations: our beliefs, our continued focus on safety, our commitment to ethics and compliance, our people and the economic value we create.\n\n## Safety\n\nSafety defines our beliefs, which guide how we work, and what we call 'Who we are'.\n\nEveryone at bp is expected to be a safety leader. We always want to do better on safety so we have refreshed our code, which helps us do the right thing, and made our operating management system (OMS) simpler, clearer and even more rigorous, to help prevent incidents. Updates to our OMS emphasize an even closer focus on human performance, our safety leadership principles and the IOGP Life Saving Rules.\n\nThe aim we set in 2021, to eliminate fatalities, life-changing injuries and tier 1 process safety events, provided the basis for our strategic focus in 2022 along with our work to embed a consistent safety culture.\n\nWe deeply regret that in 2022, four people lost their lives while at work for bp.\n\nIn February 2022 a contractor driving for Aral in Germany lost his life in a vehicle collision on a highway.\n\nIn April 2022 a specialist tank contractor lost his life in an explosion while repairing a tank at an Aral retail site in northern Germany.\n\nIn September 2022 two bp employees lost their lives in a fire at our Toledo refinery in the US.\n\nWe have offered our condolences to everyone affected and have supported their families and colleagues. We will take action to learn from these incidents and drive improvements in safety.\n\n## Keeping people safe\n\nWe monitor and report on key workforce personal safety metrics in line with industry standards. We include both employees and contractors in our data.\n\nIn addition to the fatalities reported for 2022, we recorded an increase of 14% in our recordable injury frequency (RIF) and an increase of 34% in our days away from work case frequency (DAFWCF), compared with 2021. We attribute this to an increase in the number of hand or ankle injuries suffered by retail employees in our customers and products business and consequently we have put in place a safety intervention plan to help avoid these injuries in future.\n\nIn our production and operations business, RIF and DAFWCF decreased compared with 2021. We attribute this to our sustained effort to improve safety, including our work on safety leadership, safety culture and human performance.\n\nWe expect to see further performance improvements as we roll out and embed the Life Saving Rules across bp.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## See our RIF key performance indicator on page 20\n\n|                                     |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Day away from  work case  frequency |  0.068 |  0.051 |  0.044 |\n| Severe vehicle  accident rate       |  0.037 |  0.034 |  0.009 |\n\n## Our operating management system\n\nThe way our businesses around the world are expected to understand and manage their environmental and social impacts is set out in our OMS. This includes requirements on engaging with stakeholders who may be affected by our activities. OMS is a group-wide framework designed to help us manage risks in our operating activities and drive performance improvements.\n\nIt brings together bp requirements on health, safety, security, the environment, social responsibility and operational reliability, as well as related issues, such as maintenance, contractor relations and organizational learning, into a common management system. Our OMS also helps us improve the quality of our activities by setting a common framework that our operations must work to.\n\nWe review and amend these requirements from time to time to reflect our priorities. Any variations in the application of our OMS, in order to meet local regulations or circumstances, are subject to a governance process. Recently acquired operations need to transition to our OMS.\n\nIn planning our projects, we identify potential impacts from our activities and use the results to identify actions and mitigation measures and look to implement these in project design, construction and operations. Our OMS requires each of bp's operating businesses and functions to create and maintain its own OMS handbook,\n\ndescribing how it will carry out its local operating activities. Through self-verification, local business processes are reviewed and areas for improvement are prioritized, allowing focus on delivering safe, reliable and compliant operations.\n\nWe use a 'three lines of defence' model to improve the effective management of all types of risk, including safety. The nature and extent of first, second and third lines of defence activities are based on the type and level of risk.\n\n## Driving safety\n\nDriving safely is one of the greatest personal safety risks we face at bp. In 2022, we recorded one driving-related contractor fatality and one vehicle accident that resulted in life-changing injuries to the driver. In total, 10 severe vehicle accidents occurred, the same as in 2021. The number of kilometres driven fell by almost 0.2% compare with 2021.\n\nWe took action to improve safety for those driving on behalf of bp in several ways - for example, issuing a group-wide alert that emphasized how important it is to be aware of vulnerable road users. A second alert was issued to help improve contractors' oversight processes for land transportation. We require all newly purchased or leased light vehicles used on behalf of bp to have a 5-star New Car Assessment Program safety rating (where available).\n\n## Preventing incidents\n\nWe carefully plan our operations, with the aim of identifying potential hazards and having rigorous operating and maintenance practices applied by capable people to manage risks at every stage. We design our new facilities in line with process safety, good design and engineering principles. We track our safety performance using industry-aligned metrics such as those found in the American Petroleum Institute recommended practice 754 and the International Association of Oil & Gas Producers recommended practice 456.\n\nOur combined tier 1 and tier 2 process safety events (PSEs) have generally decreased over the last 10 years, apart from in 2019. This downward trend continued in 2022, with 12 fewer (19%) reported than in 2021, due to a 28% reduction in tier 2 PSEs.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability continued\n\nWe investigate incidents including near misses, and we also use leading indicators, such as inspections and equipment tests, to monitor the strength of controls to prevent incidents.\n\n|                          | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Tier 1 and tier          |        |        |        |\n| 2 process  safety events | 50     | 62     | 70     |\n| Oil spills -             |        |        |        |\n| number                   | 108    | 121    | 121    |\n| Oil spills -  contained  | 57     | 73     | 70     |\n\n## Emergency preparedness\n\nThe scale and spread of bp's operations means we must be prepared to respond to a range of possible disruptions and emergency events. We maintain disaster recovery, crisis and business continuity management plans and work to build day-to-day response capabilities to support local management of incidents.\n\n## Security\n\nWe monitor for hostile actions that could harm our people or disrupt our operations. These actions might be connected to political or social unrest, terrorism, armed conflict or criminal activity. We take these potential threats seriously and assess them continuously. Our 24-hour response information centre in the UK uses state-of-the-art technology to monitor evolving high-risk situations in real time. It helps us to assess the safety of our people and provide them with practical advice if there is an emergency.\n\n## Cyber security\n\nThe severity, sophistication and scale of cyber attacks continues to evolve. The increasing digitalization and reliance on IT systems and cloud platforms makes managing cyber risk an even greater priority for many industries, including our own. Direct or collateral impact can come from a variety of cyber threat actors, including nation states, criminals, terrorists, hacktivists and insiders. As in previous years, we have experienced threats to the security of our digital systems and our barriers have worked well to mitigate and contain them to minimize any impact on our business.\n\nWe have a range of measures to manage this risk, including the use of cyber-security policies and procedures, security protection tools, threat monitoring and event detection capabilities, and incident response plans. We conduct exercises to test our response to, and recovery from, cyber attacks.\n\nTo encourage vigilance among our employees, our cyber security training and awareness programme covers topics such as phishing and the correct classification and handling of our information. We collaborate closely with governments, law enforcement and industry peers to understand and respond to threats.\n\n## Working with contractors\n\nThrough documents that help bridge between our policies and those of our contractors, we define the way our safety management system co-exists with those of our contractors to manage risk on a site. For our contractors facing the most risks, we conduct quality, technical, health, safety and security audits before awarding contracts. Once they start work, we continue to monitor their safety performance. Our OMS includes requirements and practices for working with contractors. Our standard model contracts include health, safety and security requirements. We expect and encourage our contractors and their employees to act in a way that is consistent with our code of conduct and take appropriate action if those expectations, or their contractual obligations, are not met.\n\n## Our partners in joint arrangements\n\nIn joint arrangements where we are the operator, our OMS, code of conduct and other policies apply. We aim to report on aspects of our business where we are the operator - as we directly manage the performance of these operations. We monitor performance and how risk is managed in our joint arrangements, whether we are the operator or not. Where we are not the operator, our OMS is available as a reference point for bp businesses when engaging with operators and co-venturers. We have a group framework to assess and manage bp's exposure related to safety, operational and bribery and corruption risk from our participation in these types of arrangements.\n\nWhere appropriate, we may seek to influence how risk is managed in arrangements where we are not the operator.\n\nThe people and governance committee reviews workforce policies and practices and their alignment with bp's strategy, purpose, values and culture and conducts workforce engagement measures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more on the people and governance committee, see page 98\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our beliefs and code of conduct\n\nIn 2022 we launched 'Who we are' - our new beliefs and supporting behaviours. They define what we stand for, building on our best qualities and the things most important to us. It comprises three key beliefs - 'Live our purpose', 'Play to win' and 'Care for others'. 'Who we are' is integrated into our updated code of conduct (our code), and is already guiding our approach to recruitment, development, performance management and reward.\n\nOur code sets standards and expectations for how we do the right thing and also empowers us to speak up without fear of retaliation. It puts safety first, and together with our safety leadership principles and OMS, helps us make safe and ethical decisions, act responsibly and comply with applicable laws.\n\nWe relaunched the code in January 2023, including updated content to incorporate our sustainability frame and 'Who we are'. The code also contains a new tool to help employees navigate difficult decisions.\n\nEmployees, contractors or other third parties who have a question about our code of conduct or see something that they feel is unethical or unsafe can discuss this with their managers, supporting teams, works councils (where relevant) or through OpenTalk, a confidential and anonymous helpline operated by an independent company.\n\nWe received more than 1,350 concerns or enquiries through these channels in 2022 (2021 1,400). We take steps to identify and correct areas of non-conformance and take disciplinary action where appropriate. In 2022, around 50 separations resulted from nonconformance with our code or unethical behaviour. This total excludes exits of contractors, vendors and staff employed at our retail stations",

We aim to recruit talented people from diverse backgrounds, and invest in training, development and competitive rewards for all our people. We focus our attraction, recruitment, development and retention activities to provide the support and skills they need to thrive and help bp succeed. In 2022 we continued our work to build skills forecasts and implement capability plans for our transition growth engines including hydrogen, offshore wind, digital and our EV charging network, bp pulse. Following the launch of 'Who we are', we integrated our beliefs into our core talent practices and leadership development, to inform how we assess, select, develop and reward our people.\n\nIn 2022 bp employees collectively completed more than 1.1 million hours of formal learning (2021 750,000 hours). This learning takes place within a development frame, applicable to all employees, which covers safety, technical depth, future skills (such as digital and agility) and leadership. Our training portfolio also includes a rigorous mandatory curriculum focused on compliance with applicable laws and regulations and conformance with our internal standards.\n\n## Diversity, equity and inclusion\n\nOur aim 14 is greater diversity, equity and inclusion for our workforce and our customers, and to increase supplier diversity spend to $1 billion. For more information see page 63.\n\nIn 2022 we expanded our long-term incentive plan scorecard for group leaders to include DE&I measures. We have equipped our leaders with better DE&I data which they can use to help identify areas for improvement, and better understand areas of progress. Our data is refreshed monthly, and available 24/7.\n\nWe also report information and disclose against targets on the representation of women and ethnic minorities on our board and executive management on a voluntary basis, see page 83.\n\n## Gender equality\n\nOverall, the proportion of women employed across bp remained at 39% of our global workforce in 2022. At the end of 2022 we had five female directors (2021 4) on our board. Our people and governance committee remains mindful of diversity when considering potential candidates.\n\nWe have committed to an ambition of gender parity for the top levels of leadership (top 120 roles) by 2025 and an ambition of parity for all executive-level employees (group leaders) by 2030. And we have committed to an ambition of 40% female representation (senior-level leaders) for the next layer of senior leadership by 2030.\n\nOur early engagement programmes, including Discovery Weeks and our new Future Talent Scholarship, support our future intern and graduate pipelines.\n\nOur understanding of gender identity is evolving and our ambitions will reflect this over time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRead our gender pay gap report at bp.com/ukgenderpaygap\n\nAnd we launched a new global learning platform, grow@bp, which gives our employees access to a wealth of learning content through a single point of access. This includes learning pathways that support our 20 aims, like 'sustainability at bp' which has now become one of our most utilized pathways.\n\n## Ethnic diversity\n\nIn 2022 we rolled out our LIFT programme to support the progression of Black and African American colleagues into senior leadership roles. Participants partner with each other and with senior leaders to enhance understanding of the experiences of working at bp and to build networks.\n\nAnd we rolled out our mandatory Race for Equity racial equity and inclusion training programme to all UK and US employees. The programme focuses on leadership and accountability and explores how we show up, speak up in tough situations and cultivate a culture of care.\n\nIn 2022, 33% of our group leaders came from countries other than the UK and the US (2021 31%).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Read our DE&I report at bp.com/diversity\n\nFor more on the composition of our board, see page 80\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Inclusion\n\nTo promote an inclusive culture, we provide leadership training and support employee-run advocacy groups in areas such as gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation and disability. As well as bringing employees together, these groups support our recruitment programmes and provide feedback on the potential impact of policy changes. Each group is sponsored by a senior executive.\n\nWe aim to provide equal opportunity in recruitment, career development, promotion, training and reward for all employees regardless of ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender, age, sexual orientation, marital status, disability or any other characteristic protected by applicable laws.\n\nWe have launched 'Hiring Inclusively', a set of globally consistent recruiting principles to help enable an inclusive, equitable approach to hiring. It allows recruiters to review internal and external market data for skills availability by gender and by other historically underrepresented groups in some geographies.",

Our overall engagement metric, employee engagement, increased to 70% (2021 64%), while pride in working for bp increased to a record 78% (2021 73%).\n\nWe focused on three action areas to drive employee engagement in 2022- strategy and purpose, inclusive culture and career development.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHow the board engaged with members of the workforce, see page 94 .\n\nOur employee engagement key performance indicator, see page 23 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Mental health and wellbeing\n\nOur aim 15 is to enhance the health and wellbeing of our employees, contractors and local communities.\n\nWe offer employees access to a range of mental health support services, including our well-established 24/7 Employee Assistance Programme.\n\nIn 2022, we continued our efforts to create a workplace in which people can talk openly about mental health and get help if they need it. We updated our mental health training programmes and provided specific training for line managers so they can discuss mental health with their teams. bp is a founding partner of The Global Business Collaboration for Better Workplace Mental Health and in 2022 we formed a new partnership with MindForward Alliance, to promote global standards for workplace mental health.\n\nWe use a wellbeing index, which is included in our Pulse employee surveys, to assess health and wellbeing across bp. In 2022 our wellbeing index was slightly higher than in 2021 at 68% (2021 67%), reflecting improved perceptions of leadership support and workload manageability.\n\nWe continued promoting our new wellbeing platform, Thrive@bp, to support our workforce and their friends and families. We also launched the Thrive Together global physical activity challenge along with a new approach to our health and wellbeing campaigns globally. We focused on six relevant health topics: cancer awareness, women's health, men's health, LGBT+ health, heart health and mental health.\n\n## Share ownership\n\nWe encourage employee share ownership and have a number of employee share plans in place. For example, we operate a ShareMatch plan, matching bp shares purchased by our employees. We also make annual share awards as part of our total reward package all for senior and mid-level employees globally, and a portion of our more junior professional grade employees.\n\nSee Directors' remuneration report on page 112 and our sustainable GHG emission reductions key performance indicator on page 23.\n\n## Ethics and compliance\n\n## Anti-bribery and corruption\n\nWe operate in parts of the world where bribery and corruption present a high risk. We have a responsibility to our employees, our shareholders and the countries and communities in which we do business to be ethical and lawful in all our work.\n\nOur code of conduct explicitly prohibits engaging in bribery or corruption in any form. Our group-wide anti-bribery and corruption policy and procedures include measures and guidance to assess risks, understand relevant laws and report concerns. They apply to all bp-operated businesses.\n\nWe provide training to employees appropriate to the nature or location of their role. In 2022 more than 7,500 employees completed anti-bribery and corruption training (2021 12,700). We assess any exposure to bribery and corruption risk when working with suppliers and business partners. Where appropriate, we put in place a risk mitigation plan or we reject them if we conclude that risks are too high.\n\nWe also conduct anti-bribery compliance audits on selected suppliers to assess their conformance with our anti-bribery and corruption contractual requirements. We take corrective action with suppliers and business partners that fail to meet our expectations, which may include terminating contracts. In 2022 the number of audit reports we issued increased to 37 (2021 4), due to the completion of a backlog of audits from 2021.\n\n## Political donations and activity\n\nWe prohibit the use of bp funds or resources to support any political candidate or party. We recognize the rights of our employees to participate in the political process and these rights are governed by the applicable laws in the countries where we operate. Our stance on political activity is set out in the code.\n\nIn the US we provide administrative support for the bp employee political action committee (PAC) which is a non-partisan, employee-led committee that encourages voluntary employee participation in the political process. All bp employee PAC contributions are weighed against the PAC's criteria for candidate support, reviewed for compliance with federal and state law, and publicly reported in accordance with US election laws.\n\n## Tax transparency\n\nOur code of conduct informs the responsible approach we take to managing taxes. We have adopted the B Team responsible tax principles and we engage in open and constructive dialogue with governments and tax authorities. We comply with the tax legislation of the countries in which we operate and we do not tolerate the facilitation of tax evasion by people who act for or on behalf of bp.\n\nWe are committed to transparency around our tax principles and the taxes we pay. We paid $12.5 billion in corporate income and production taxes to governments in 2022 (2021 $5.4 billion).",

These risks are described in Risk factors on page 73.\n\nbp's system of internal control is a holistic set of internal controls that includes policies, processes, management systems, organizational structures, culture and standards of conduct employed to manage bp's business and associated risks.\n\n## bp's risk management system\n\nbp's risk management system and policy is designed to be a consistent and clear framework for managing and reporting risks from the group's business activities and operations to management and to the board. The system seeks to avoid incidents and enhance business outcomes by allowing us to:\n\n- \u00b7 Understand the risk environment, identify the specific risks and assess the potential exposure for bp.\n- \u00b7 Determine how best to deal with these risks to manage overall potential exposure.\n- \u00b7 Manage the identified risks in appropriate ways.\n- \u00b7 Monitor and seek assurance of the effectiveness of the management of these risks and intervene for improvement where necessary.\n- \u00b7 Report up the management chain and to the board on a periodic basis on how principal risks are being managed, monitored and assured, with any identified enhancements that are being made.\n\n## Our risk management activities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Day-to-day risk management\n\nManagement and employees at our facilities, assets, and within our businesses, integrators and enablers (see page 14) seek to identify and manage risk, promoting safe, compliant and reliable operations. bp requirements, which take into account applicable laws and regulations, underpin the practical plans developed to help reduce risk and deliver safe, compliant and reliable operations as well as greater efficiency and sustainable financial results.\n\n## Business and strategic risk management\n\nOur businesses, integrators and enablers integrate risk management into key business processes such as strategy, planning, performance management, resource and capital allocation and project appraisal. We do this by using a standard framework for collating risk data, assessing risk management activities, making further improvements and in connection with planning new activities.\n\n## Oversight and governance\n\nThroughout the year, management, the leadership team, the board and relevant committees provide oversight of how principal risks to bp are identified, assessed and managed. They support appropriate governance of risk management including having relevant policies in place to help manage risks.\n\nSuch oversight may include internal audit reports, group risk reports and reviews of the\n\noutcomes of business processes including strategy, planning and resource and capital allocation. bp's group risk team analyses the group's risk profile and maintains the group's risk management system. bp's internal audit team provides independent assurance to the chief executive and board as to whether the group's system of internal control is adequately designed and operating effectively to respond appropriately to the risks that are significant to bp.\n\n## Risk oversight and governance\n\nKey risk oversight and governance committees include the following:\n\n## Board and committees\n\n- \u00b7 bp board.\n- \u00b7 Audit committee.\n- \u00b7 Safety and sustainability committee.\n- \u00b7 Remuneration committee.\n- \u00b7 People and governance committee.\n\n## Leadership team and committees\n\n- \u00b7 Leadership team meeting - for oversight and for strategic and commercial risks.\n- \u00b7 Group operations risk committee - for health, safety, security, environment and operations integrity risks.\n- \u00b7 Group financial risk committee - for finance, treasury, trading and cyber risks.\n- \u00b7 Group disclosure committee - for financial reporting risks.\n- \u00b7 People and culture committee - for employee risks.\n- \u00b7 Group ethics and compliance committee - for legal and regulatory compliance and ethics risks.\n- \u00b7 Group sustainability committee - for non-operational sustainability risks.\n- \u00b7 Resource commitment meeting - for investment decision risks.\n- \u00b7 bp quarterly internal audit meeting - for assurance on the oversight of bp's principal risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBoard activities see page 87 , bp governance framework see page 86 , committee reports see pages 98-112 and Risk management and internal control see page 149 .",

        "page_content": "## How we manage risk and risk factors continued\n\n## Risk management processes\n\nWe aim for a consistent basis of measuring risk to:\n\n- \u00b7 Establish a common understanding of risks on a like-for-like basis, taking into account potential impact and likelihood.\n- \u00b7 Report risks and their management to the appropriate levels of the organization.\n- \u00b7 Inform prioritization of specific risk management activities and resource allocation.\n\nbp's risk management policy sets out requirements for businesses, integrators and enablers to follow. These requirements support the consideration of the following risk types:\n\n- \u00b7 Strategic and commercial\n- \u00b7 Safety and operational\n- \u00b7 Compliance and control\n\nRisk identification - businesses, integrators and enablers identify risks across the three risk types.\n\nRisks are identified on an ongoing basis this can be done using a range of approaches including workshops, subject matter expertise, hazard identification processes and engineering requirements.\n\nRisk assessment - identified risks are assessed for potential impact across a number of criteria including:\n\n- \u00b7 Health and safety\n- \u00b7 Environmental\n- \u00b7 Financial\n- \u00b7 Non-financial (includes reputation and regulatory impact levels)\n\nLikelihood is also assessed using a standardized set of criteria. This aims to provide a consistent basis for the evaluation of potential impact and likelihood, facilitating a comparison across risks.\n\nRisk management and monitoring - risk management activities can be prioritized where improvements are needed based on a number of factors, including the risk assessment, strength of existing risk management measures, strategy and plans and legal and regulatory requirements. Risk management measures, including mitigations, are identified for each risk and monitored to the extent considered appropriate. To support leadership oversight of decisions relating to the risk assessment and management measures, risks are notified to, and the business's risk management measures are subject to endorsement at, the appropriate organizational level (EVP, SVP, VP) depending on the assessed potential impact and likelihood.\n\nAs part of bp's annual planning process, the leadership team and the board review the group's principal risks and uncertainties. These may be updated during the year in response to changes in internal and external circumstances.\n\nThere can be no certainty that our risk management activities will mitigate or prevent these, or other risks, from occurring. Further details of the principal risks and uncertainties we face are set out in Risk factors on page 73.\n\n## Our risk profile\n\nThe nature of our business operations is long term, resulting in many of our risks being enduring in nature. Nonetheless, risks can develop and evolve over time and their potential impact or likelihood may vary in response to internal and external events. These may include emerging risks which are considered through existing processes, including an emerging risk paper considered at board meetings, bp's risk management system, the bp Energy Outlook , bp's Technology Insights Radar and ongoing emerging technology scanning and group strategic reviews.\n\nWe describe above how risks are managed. The following section provides examples of the particular risk management activities for each of bp's principal risks.\n\n## Strategic and commercial risks\n\n## Prices and markets\n\nOur financial performance is impacted by fluctuating prices of oil, gas and refined products, technological change, exchange rate fluctuations, and the general macroeconomic outlook.\n\nOur strategy is designed to accommodate a range of scenarios and be resilient to the volatility in the energy markets. This is supported through a diversified portfolio, a strong balance sheet and operating within a resilient and disciplined financial frame. We test out investment and project development costs against a range of pricing and exchange assumptions.\n\nAccessing and progressing hydrocarbon resources and low carbon opportunities Inability to access and progress hydrocarbon resources and low carbon opportunities could adversely affect delivery of our strategy.\n\nFor hydrocarbon resources our subsurface team is accountable for the delivery of high-value, carbon-efficient resources to deliver predictable and reliable investments today as well as the long-term renewal of our hydrocarbon resources. Additionally, the subsurface team partners with innovation & engineering to prioritize technology development needs for the future. Our gas & low carbon energy business is accountable for the delivery of our low carbon opportunities through both organic and inorganic growth. This includes the development of our offshore wind, solar, onshore wind, hydrogen and carbon capture, use and storage businesses.\n\n## Major project delivery\n\nFailure to invest in the best opportunities or deliver major projects successfully could adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nWe seek to manage this risk through our projects organization which exists to frame, build and execute projects across bp. The organization contains capability which includes the centre of expertise for appraisal and optimization, expertise to manage the design and build of projects and programmes, and collaboration with our businesses and enablers to ensure project objectives are met. The projects team delivers using its major projects common process which is systematically reviewed and continuously improved.\n\n## Geopolitical\n\nThe diverse locations of our business activities and operations around the world expose us to a wide range of political developments and consequent changes to the economic and operating environment. Geopolitical risk is inherent to many regions in which we operate, and heightened political or social tensions or changes in key relationships could adversely affect the group.\n\nWe seek to manage this risk at multiple levels, through:\n\n- \u00b7 Identifying macro-level geopolitical trends in the geopolitical advisory council.\n- \u00b7 Providing a clear focal point for political risk management in our regions, corporates & solutions business.\n- \u00b7 Monitoring how geopolitical trends create risk at the country level through changes to our baseline threat assessments.\n\nMore broadly, we manage the risk on a day-today basis through development and maintenance of relationships with governments and stakeholders, and by being trusted partners in each country and region. In addition, we closely monitor events and implement risk mitigation plans where deemed appropriate.",

Supply and demand and the prices achieved for our products can be affected by a wide range of factors including political developments, interest rates, consumer preferences for low carbon energy, global economic conditions, access to capital markets and the influence of OPEC+.\n\nWe seek to manage this risk through bp's diversified portfolio, our financial framework, liquidity stress testing, maintaining a significant cash buffer, regular reviews of market conditions and our planning and investment processes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEnergy markets, page 6 , Liquidity and capital resources on page 356 and Liquidity, financial capacity and financial, including credit, exposure, page 73\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJoint arrangements and contractors Varying levels of control over the standards, operations and compliance of our partners, contractors and sub-contractors could result in legal liability and reputational damage.\n\nbp's exposure in non-operated joint ventures (NOJV) is primarily managed by the NOJV-facing business team in the business or entity where ownership of bp's interest in the NOJV sits. Support, verification and assurance is provided by the joint venture centre of expertise, safety & operational risk assurance and ethics & compliance functional assurance and group internal audit to drive a focused, deliberate and systematic approach to the set up and management of bp's interests in NOJVs.\n\nOur relationships with contractors are managed through the bp procurement processes with appropriate requirements incorporated into contractual arrangements.\n\n## Cyber security\n\nBoth targeted and indiscriminate threats to the security of our digital infrastructure and those of third parties continue to evolve rapidly and are increasingly prevalent across industries worldwide.\n\nWe seek to manage this risk through a range of measures, which include cyber security standards, security protection tools, ongoing detection and monitoring of threats and testing of cyber response and recovery procedures. We collaborate with governments, law enforcement agencies and industry peers to understand and respond to new and emerging cyber threats.\n\nWe build awareness with our employees, share information on incidents with leadership for continuous learning and conduct regular exercises including with the leadership team to test response and recovery procedures.\n\n## Climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy\n\nDevelopments in policy, law, regulation, technology and markets, including societal and investor sentiment, related to the issue of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy could increase costs, reduce revenues, constrain our operations and affect our business plans and financial performance.\n\nRisks associated with climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy impact many elements of our strategy and, as such, these risks are managed through key business processes including setting the bp strategy and annual plan, capital allocation and investment decisions. The outputs of these key business processes are reviewed in line with the cadence of these activities. See page 53 for further detail on how transition risks are managed.\n\n## Competition\n\nInability to remain efficient, maintain a highquality portfolio of assets and innovate could negatively impact delivery of our strategy in a highly competitive market.\n\nWe seek to manage this risk through our strategy, sustainability and ventures team by providing external insights on the economic, energy, market and competitive environment. Our strategy, sustainability and portfolio management teams use these insights to help define a resilient strategy for bp, including decisions related to portfolio, business development and resource allocation. The ventures team provides commercial innovation capacity that allows us to build new businesses.\n\n## Talent and capability\n\nInability to attract, develop and retain people with necessary skills and capabilities could negatively impact delivery of our strategy.\n\nOur people and culture team oversees all hiring activity for bp globally, both professional hiring and early careers. They help to ensure that the right talent and people capability is in place, using local market analysis, people analytics and insights to underpin our strategic workforce planning. Talent leadership focuses on translating bp's diversity, equity and inclusion ambitions and global framework for action into a robust and diverse talent pipeline, see page 67 for more information.\n\n## Crisis management and business continuity\n\nFailure to address an incident effectively could potentially disrupt our business or exacerbate the legal, financial or operational impacts of the crisis event.\n\nIncidents that could potentially disrupt our business are addressed using emergency response and business continuity plans which are mandated through company-wide policies. We use internationally recognized incident command structures and for significant events business support teams and executive support teams are established to provide oversight and management. In addition, we provide a trained cadre of crisis professionals and niche expertise for deployment across the company through our mutual response team.\n\n## Insurance\n\nOur insurance strategy could expose the group to material uninsured losses.\n\nOur insurance team is accountable for aligning our insurance approach with bp's strategy and they engage with the businesses, integrators and enablers to determine the appropriate level of insurance. We retain in-house expertise and partner with insurance industry leaders. Our captive insurance companies are regulated within the jurisdictions in which they operate.\n\n## Safety and operational risks\n\nProcess safety, personal safety and environmental risks\n\nThe nature of the group's operating activities exposes us to a wide range of significant health, safety and environmental risks such as incidents associated with releases of hydrocarbons when drilling wells, operating facilities and transporting hydrocarbons.\n\nOur operating management system helps us manage these risks and drive performance improvements. It sets out the standards and requirements which govern key risk management activities such as inspection, maintenance, testing, business continuity and crisis response planning and competency development. In addition, we conduct our drilling activity through a wells organization in order to promote a consistent approach for designing, constructing and managing wells.",

The enablers, in particular wells and production, are accountable for safety, risk, quality and operational delivery. They execute capital and operational activity and manage associated expenditure.\n\n## Security\n\nHostile acts such as terrorism, activism, insider acts or piracy could harm our people and disrupt our operations. We monitor for emerging threats and vulnerabilities to manage our physical and information security.\n\nOur intelligence, security and crisis management teams provide strategic and operational risk management to our businesses through a network of regional security managers who provide front line risk management as well as conduct assurance activities through a team independent of the business.\n\nWe continue to monitor threats globally and maintain disaster recovery, crisis and business continuity management plans.\n\n## Product quality\n\nSupplying customers with off-specification products could damage our reputation, lead to regulatory action and legal liability, and impact our financial performance.\n\nbp's product quality policy is aligned with our operating management system and sets requirements for our business to meet specifications and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Compliance and control risks\n\nEthical misconduct and legal or regulatory non-compliance\n\nEthical misconduct or breaches of applicable laws or regulations could damage our reputation, result in litigation, regulatory action and penalties, adversely affect results and shareholder value, and potentially affect our licence to operate.\n\nOur code of conduct, the foundation of who we are, is applicable to all employees and central to managing this risk. Additionally, we have various group requirements and training covering areas such as anti-bribery and corruption, anti-money laundering, competition/anti-trust law and international trade regulations. We offer an independent confidential helpline, OpenTalk, for employees, contractors and other third parties with the option to raise concerns anonymously.\n\n## Regulation\n\nChanges in the law and regulation could increase costs, constrain our operations and affect our strategy, business plans and financial performance.\n\nOur businesses, integrators and enablers all seek to identify, assess and manage legal and regulatory risks relevant to bp's operations, strategy, business plans and financial performance. To support this work, we seek to develop co-operative relationships with governmental authorities in line with our code of conduct, to allow appropriate focus on areas of potential risk or uncertainty while also protecting bp's interests within the law. The bp group ethics and compliance committee provides risk oversight and governance for legal compliance and ethics risks.\n\n## Trading non-compliance\n\nIn the normal course of business, we are subject to risks around our trading activities which could arise from shortcomings or failures in our systems, risk management methodology, internal control processes or employee conduct.\n\nWe have specific operating standards and control processes to manage these risks, including guidelines specific to trading, and seek to monitor compliance through our dedicated compliance teams. We also seek to maintain a positive and collaborative relationship with regulators and the industry at large.\n\n## Reporting\n\nFailure to accurately report our data could lead to regulatory action, legal liability and reputational damage.\n\nOur accounting reporting and control team provide assurance of the control environment and are accountable for building control and compliance into finance processes and digital systems.",

If these reductions are significant or for a prolonged period, we may have to write down assets and reassess the viability of certain projects, which may impact future cash flows, profit, capital expenditure, the ability to work within our financial frame and maintain our long-term investment programme. Conversely, an increase in oil, gas and product prices may not improve margin performance as there could be increased fiscal take, cost inflation and more onerous terms for access to resources. The profitability of our refining activities can be volatile, with periodic oversupply or supply tightness in regional markets and fluctuations in demand.\n\nExchange rate fluctuations can create currency exposures and impact underlying costs and revenues. Crude oil prices are generally set in US dollars, while products vary in currency. Many of our major project development costs are denominated in local currencies, which may be subject to fluctuations against the US dollar.\n\n## Accessing and progressing hydrocarbon resources and low carbon opportunities:\n\ninability to access and progress hydrocarbon resources and low carbon opportunities could adversely affect delivery of our strategy.\n\nDelivery of our strategy depends partly on our ability to progress hydrocarbon resources from our existing portfolio and access new resources in our existing core regions. Our ability to progress upstream resources and develop technologies at a level in line with our strategic outlook for hydrocarbon production could impact our future production and financial performance. Furthermore, our ability to access low carbon opportunities and the commercial terms associated with those opportunities could impact our financial performance and the pace of our transition to an integrated energy company in line with our strategy.\n\n## Major project delivery: failure to invest in the best opportunities or deliver major projects successfully could adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nWe face challenges in developing major projects, particularly in geographically and technically challenging areas. Poor investment choice, efficiency or delivery, or operational challenges at any major project that underpins production or production growth, could adversely affect our financial performance.\n\nGeopolitical: exposure to a range of political developments and consequent changes to the operating and regulatory environment could cause business disruption.\n\nWe operate and may seek new opportunities in countries, regions and cities where political, economic and social transition may take place.\n\nPolitical instability, changes to the regulatory environment or taxation, international trade disputes and barriers to free trade, international sanctions, expropriation or nationalization of property, civil strife, strikes, insurrections, acts of terrorism, acts of war and public health situations (including the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or any future epidemic or pandemic) may disrupt or curtail our operations, business activities or investments.\n\nThese may in turn cause production to decline, limit our ability to pursue new opportunities, affect the recoverability of our assets and our related earnings and cash flow or cause us to\n\nincur additional costs, particularly due to the long-term nature of many of our projects and significant capital expenditure required.\n\nEvents in, or relating to, Russia and the conflict in Ukraine, including trade restrictions, international sanctions or any other actions taken by governmental authorities or other relevant persons have had and could continue to have an impact on global energy supply and demand, market volatility and the prices of oil, gas and products. In February 2022, we announced that we would exit our shareholding in Rosneft and our other businesses with Rosneft in Russia. Trade restrictions, international sanctions, Russian counter restrictions and sanctions and other actions taken by governmental authorities or other relevant persons are expected to continue to impact our ability to exit those interests.\n\n## Liquidity, financial capacity and financial, including credit, exposure: failure to work within our financial framework could impact our ability to operate and result in financial loss.\n\nFailure to accurately forecast or work within our financial framework could impact our ability to operate and result in financial loss. Trade and other receivables, including overdue receivables, may not be recovered, divestments may not be successfully completed and a substantial and unexpected cash call or funding request could disrupt our financial framework or overwhelm our ability to meet our obligations.\n\nAn event such as a significant operational incident, legal proceedings or a geopolitical event in an area where we have significant activities, could reduce our financial liquidity and our credit ratings. Credit rating downgrades could potentially increase financing costs and limit access to financing or engagement in our trading activities on acceptable terms, which could put pressure on the group's liquidity.\n\nThey could also potentially require the company to review the funding arrangements with the bp pension trustees. In the event of extended constraints on our ability to obtain financing, we could be required to reduce capital expenditure or increase asset disposals in order to provide additional liquidity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLiquidity and capital resources, page 356 and Financial statements Note 29\n\n<!-- image -->",

If these are found to be lacking, there may be financial, operational or safety exposures for bp. Should an incident occur in an operation that bp participates in, our partners and contractors may be unable or unwilling to fully compensate us against costs we may incur on their behalf or on behalf of the arrangement. Where we do not have operational control of a venture or direct oversight of contractor activity, we may still be pursued by regulators or claimants in the event of an incident.\n\n## Digital infrastructure, cyber security and\n\ndata protection: breach or failure of our or third parties' digital infrastructure or cyber security, including loss or misuse of sensitive information could damage our operations, increase costs and damage our reputation.\n\nThe energy industry is subject to fast-evolving risks, including ransomware, from cyber threat actors, including nation states, criminals, terrorists, hacktivists and insiders. Current geopolitical factors have increased these risks. There is also growing regulation around data protection and data privacy. A breach or failure of our or third parties' digital infrastructure including control systems - due to breaches of our cyber defences, or those of third parties, negligence, intentional misconduct or other reasons, could seriously disrupt our operations. This could result in the loss or misuse of data or sensitive information, including employees' and customers' personal data, injury to people, disruption to our business, harm to the environment or our assets, legal or regulatory breaches, legal liability and significant costs including fines, cost of remediation or reputational consequences. Furthermore, the rapid detection of attempts to gain unauthorized access to our digital infrastructure, often through the use of sophisticated and co-ordinated means, is a challenge and any delay or failure to detect could compound these potential harms.\n\nClimate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy: developments in policy, law, regulation, technology and markets, including societal and investor sentiment, related to the issue of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy could increase costs, reduce revenues, constrain our operations and affect our business plans and financial performance.\n\nLaws, regulations, policies, obligations, government actions, social attitudes and customer preferences relating to climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy, including the pace of change to any of these factors, and also the pace of the transition itself, could have adverse impacts on our business including on our access to and realization of competitive opportunities in any of our strategic focus areas, a decline in demand for, or constraints on our ability to sell certain products, constraints on production and supply, adverse litigation and regulatory or litigation outcomes, increased costs from compliance and increased provisions for environmental and legal liabilities.\n\nInvestor preferences and sentiment are influenced by environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) considerations including climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy. Changes in those preferences and sentiment could affect our access to capital markets and our attractiveness to potential investors, potentially resulting in reduced access to financing, increased financing costs and impacts upon our business plans and financial performance.\n\nTechnological improvements or innovations that support the transition to a lower carbon economy, and customer preferences or regulatory incentives that alter fuel or power choices, could impact demand for oil and gas.\n\nDepending on the nature and speed of any such changes and our response, these changes could increase costs, reduce our profitability, reduce demand for certain products, limit our access to new opportunities, require us to write down certain assets or curtail or cease certain operations, and affect investor sentiment, our access to capital markets, our competitiveness and financial performance.\n\nPolicy, legal regulatory, technological and market developments related to climate change could also affect future price assumptions used in the assessment of recoverability of asset carrying values including goodwill, the judgement as to whether there is continued intent to develop exploration and appraisal intangible assets, the timing of decommissioning of assets and the useful economic lives of assets used for the calculation of depreciation and amortization.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClimate-related financial disclosures, page 50 and Financial statements Note 1\n\n## Competition: inability to remain efficient, maintain a high-quality portfolio of assets and innovate could negatively impact delivery of our strategy in a highly competitive market.\n\nOur strategic progress and performance could be impeded if we are unable to control our development and operating costs and margins, if we fail to scale our businesses at pace, or to sustain, develop and operate a high-quality portfolio of assets efficiently. Furthermore, as we transition from an international oil company to an integrated energy company, we face an expanded and rapidly evolving range of competitors in the sectors in which we operate. We could be adversely affected if competitors offer superior terms for access rights or licences, or if our innovation in areas such as new low carbon technologies, digital, customer offer, exploration, production, refining, manufacturing or renewable energy lags behind those of our competitors. Our performance could also be negatively impacted if we fail to protect our intellectual property.\n\n## Talent and capability: inability to attract, develop and retain people with necessary skills and capabilities could negatively impact delivery of our strategy.\n\nThe sectors in which we operate face increasing challenges to attract and retain diverse, skilled and capable talent. An inability to successfully recruit, develop and retain core skills and capabilities and to reskill existing talent could negatively impact delivery of our strategy.\n\n## Crisis management and business continuity: failure to address an incident effectively could potentially disrupt our business.\n\nOur reputation and business activities could be negatively impacted if we do not respond, or are perceived not to respond, in an appropriate manner to any major crisis.\n\n## Insurance: our insurance strategy could expose the group to material uninsured losses.\n\nbp generally purchases insurance only in situations where this is legally and contractually required. Some risks are insured with third parties and reinsured by group insurance companies. Uninsured losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, particularly if they arise at a time when we are facing material costs as a result of a significant operational event which could put pressure on our liquidity and cash flows.",

        "page_content": "## Safety and operational risks\n\n## Process safety, personal safety, and\n\nenvironmental risks: exposure to a wide range of health, safety, security and environmental risks could cause harm to people, the environment and our assets and result in regulatory action, legal liability, business interruption, increased costs, damage to our reputation and potentially denial of our licence to operate.\n\nTechnical integrity failure, natural disasters, extreme weather or a change in its frequency or severity, human error and other adverse events or conditions, including breach of digital security, could lead to loss of containment of hydrocarbons or other hazardous materials. This could also lead to constrained availability of resources used in our operating activities, as well as fires, explosions or other personal and process safety incidents, including when drilling wells, operating facilities and those associated with transportation by road, sea or pipeline. There can be no certainty that our operating management system or other policies and procedures will adequately identify all process safety, personal safety and environmental risks or that all our operating activities, including acquired businesses, will be conducted in conformance with these systems.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## See Safety page 65\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSuch events or conditions, including a marine incident, or inability to provide safe environments for our workforce and the public while at our facilities, premises or during transportation, could lead to injuries, loss of life or environmental damage. As a result we could face regulatory action and legal liability, including penalties and remediation obligations, increased costs and potentially denial of our licence to operate. Our activities are sometimes conducted in hazardous, remote or environmentally sensitive locations, where the consequences of such events or conditions could be greater than in other locations.\n\n## Drilling and production: challenging operational environments and other uncertainties could impact drilling and production activities.\n\nOur activities require high levels of investment and are sometimes conducted in challenging environments such as those prone to natural disasters and extreme weather, which heightens the risks of technical integrity failure. The physical characteristics of an oil or natural gas field, and cost of drilling, completing or operating wells is often uncertain. We may be required to curtail, delay or cancel drilling operations or stop production because of a variety of factors, including unexpected drilling conditions,\n\npressure or irregularities in geological formations, equipment failures or accidents, adverse weather conditions and compliance with governmental requirements.\n\n## Security: hostile acts against our employees and activities could cause harm to people and disrupt our operations.\n\nActs of terrorism, piracy, sabotage, activism and similar activities directed against our operations and facilities, pipelines, transportation or digital infrastructure could cause harm to people and severely disrupt operations. Our activities could also be severely affected by conflict, civil strife or political unrest.\n\n## Product quality: supplying customers with off-specification products could damage our reputation, lead to regulatory action and legal liability, and impact our financial performance.\n\nFailure to meet product quality specifications could cause harm to people and the environment, damage our reputation, result in regulatory action and legal liability, and impact financial performance.\n\n## Compliance and control risks\n\n## Ethical misconduct and non-compliance:\n\nethical misconduct or breaches of applicable laws by our businesses or our employees could be damaging to our reputation, and could result in litigation, regulatory action and penalties.\n\nIncidents of ethical misconduct or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations, including anti-bribery and corruption, competition and antitrust, and anti-fraud laws, trade restrictions or other sanctions, could damage our reputation, and result in litigation, regulatory action, penalties and potentially affect our licence to operate. In relation to trade restrictions or other sanctions, current geopolitical factors have increased these risks.\n\nRegulation: changes in the law and regulation could increase costs, constrain our operations and affect our strategy, business plans and financial performance.\n\nOur businesses and operations are subject to the laws and regulations applicable in each country, state or other regional or local area in which they occur. These laws and regulations result in an often complex, uncertain and changing legal and regulatory environment for our global businesses and operations. Changes in laws or regulations, including how they are interpreted and enforced, can and do impact all aspects of our business.\n\nRoyalties and taxes, particularly those applied to our hydrocarbon activities, tend to be high compared with those imposed on similar commercial activities. In certain jurisdictions there is also a degree of uncertainty relating to tax law interpretation and changes.\n\nGovernments may change their fiscal and regulatory frameworks in response to public pressure on finances, resulting in increased amounts payable to them or their agencies.\n\nChanges in law or regulation could increase the compliance and litigation risk and costs, reduce our profitability, reduce demand for or constrain our ability to sell certain products, limit our access to new opportunities, require us to divest or write down certain assets or curtail or cease certain operations, or affect the adequacy of our provisions for pensions, tax, decommissioning, environmental and legal liabilities. Changes in laws or regulations could result in the nationalization, expropriation, cancellation, nonrenewal or renegotiation of our interests, assets and related rights. Potential changes to pension or financial market regulation could also impact funding requirements of the group. Following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, we may be subjected to a higher level of fines or penalties imposed in relation to any alleged breaches of laws or regulations, which could result in increased costs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Regulation of the group's business, page 369\n\n## Trading and treasury trading activities:\n\nineffective oversight of trading and treasury trading activities could lead to business disruption, financial loss, regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation and affect our permissions to trade.\n\nWe are subject to operational risk around our trading and treasury trading activities in financial and commodity markets, some of which are regulated. Failure to process, manage and monitor a large number of complex transactions across many markets and currencies while complying with all regulatory requirements could hinder profitable trading opportunities. There is a risk that a single trader or a group of traders could act outside of our delegations and controls, leading to regulatory intervention and resulting in financial loss, fines and potentially damaging our reputation, and could affect our permissions to trade.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial statements -\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reporting: failure to accurately report our data could lead to regulatory action, legal liability and reputational damage.\n\nExternal reporting of financial and non-financial data, including reserves estimates, relies on the integrity of the control environment, our systems and people operating them. Failure to report data accurately and in compliance with applicable standards could result in regulatory action, legal liability and damage to our reputation.",

My belief in effective, purpose-driven boards has been reinforced by the way in which bp met those challenges last year.\n\nIn our decision to exit Russia, the board was alert to our responsibilities towards the company's owners and towards our wider stakeholders, including bp's employees.\n\nThe thoroughness of the board's review process - concluding within days of Russia's attack on Ukraine - was enabled by two factors.\n\nFirst, by robust governance, which required that a decision of this significance be reserved to the full board.\n\nSecond, by the trust that exists both among the board's members, and between the board and the leadership team. Of course, the board's decision had a material impact on bp, but the response from shareholders and employees was overwhelmingly positive - for which we are grateful. We remain convinced that the decision was the right one.\n\n## Strategic progress\n\nSince Russia's attack on Ukraine, the importance of transforming the global energy system has been brought into sharp relief. The world wants and needs a system that is not only lower carbon, but secure and affordable too. The threefold nature of this demand is known as the energy trilemma, and in 2022 the board and leadership team spent a great deal of time focused on how bp's strategy - designed to address all three elements of the trilemma might further evolve.\n\nOur consideration contributed to the strategic progress update announced in February 2023. That update reflects the growing confidence the board has in a strategy that is working well, with more investment both in our resilient oil and gas business and in what we call our transition growth engines - bioenergy, EV charging, convenience, hydrogen, and renewables & power.\n\nPrior to this update, in December 2022, we announced important progress on our bioenergy transition growth engine with the acquisition of Archaea Energy, a leading US producer of renewable natural gas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDuring 2022 we saw good strategic progress with the development of low carbon plans and opportunities in Abu Dhabi, Australia, Egypt, Mauritania, Oman, Spain, the UK, and the US.\n\nEarlier in 2022, at our May annual general meeting, the board invited shareholders to express their support for bp's journey to net zero, and we were pleased that the result delivered a clear mandate for continuing that journey - a mandate that I hope you agree we have put into action.\n\n## Board engagements\n\nDuring 2022 the board was able to travel more - visiting bp operations and meeting employees, investors, and communities in person. In April, we visited bp's offices in Aberdeen, and board members travelled offshore to bp's Glen Lyon production vessel. In September, we visited Houston, building the board's understanding of colleagues' work to keep energy flowing and also spending time reviewing the vital work of bp's security operations centre.",

        "page_content": "## Board representation\n\nThe board believes that better decision-making can be achieved when people with different backgrounds and perspectives come together with a common ambition. I am therefore pleased with the continued progress that bp has made on diversity, equity & inclusion (DE&I), including at the level of the board.\n\nOur board currently meets the new UK listing targets regarding the representation of women and ethnic minorities; however, there is more to do. With this in mind, the board's updated DE&I policy reflects the concrete actions we are taking to make bp a more diverse and inclusive place to work, setting as an example the diversity of our board.\n\n## Board capability\n\nAs I have already said, I am pleased with the productive working relationship that exists between the board and the leadership team. We have found that the high degree of trust between them allows for greater constructive challenge, rigour, and scrutiny. It has also made our decision-making processes swifter, allowing us to be more responsive to changing circumstances.\n\nWe seek continuously to improve the board's performance. After an external evaluation in 2021, we implemented changes in 2022 to further improve board processes and how we work, investing more time in understanding the opportunities presented through our five transition growth engines, such as the Archaea acquisition, while maintaining a strong focus on capital discipline and shareholder returns.\n\nWe have also taken steps to enhance capability by building a board that reflects the markets, customers, and communities bp serves and the strategic direction we have set for the company.\n\nIn 2022 it was a privilege to welcome Amanda Blanc to the board. She brings wide-ranging board experience and industry and regulatory expertise.\n\nMost recently, we welcomed Satish Pai and Hina Nagarajan, who both joined the board on 1 March 2023. Satish has broad experience in operations and technology in energy as well as in industries that complement bp's activities. Hina has a proven record in transforming businesses in complex emerging markets, and she brings deep experience in customerfocused businesses - an area of increasing strategic importance for bp.\n\nOur work to build the board and to optimize its composition continues.\n\n## Closing thanks\n\nIt would be impossible to thank everyone who contributed to bp's progress in 2022, but I do want to thank four groups in particular.\n\nFirst, bp's shareholders. I am grateful to you for placing your faith in bp during 2022, and for the engagement we have had with you. The board will work to retain and repay that faith.\n\nSecond, my fellow directors. They have created a boardroom that I believe to be open, trusting, and supportive - in which all perspectives can be shared and considered. I am convinced that our decisions benefit from this open atmosphere.\n\nThird, Bernard and his team, for their leadership and for all they have achieved so far. They have proven to be determined in delivering bp's strategy, but also perceptive of the world's evolving energy needs - and able to adjust as necessary.\n\nAbove all, praise goes to the almost 68,000 bp employees who make bp the company it is. The strong results of the engagement survey among bp employees in 2022 indicate the pride they feel in bp. In return, I speak on behalf of the entire board in saying how immensely proud we are of them.\n\n## Helge Lund\n\nChair 10 March 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have found that the high degree of trust between the board and the executive team allows for greater constructive challenge, rigour, and scrutiny.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Board activities\n\nThe board and its committees met regularly in 2022, as well as on an ad hoc basis, as required by business needs.\n\nThe board welcomed the return of in-person meetings in 2022, recognizing that this format allows for better interaction with the bp leadership team and with the workforce more generally.\n\nThe relaxation of COVID-19 travel measures in 2022 allowed two sets of board and committee meetings to be held at locations of key strategic significance for bp. Meetings were held at our offices in Aberdeen and Houston, enabling the directors to meet and engage with management and other employees based in these locations - the first time that this type of visit had been possible since 2019.\n\nTo ensure the most constructive and efficient use of their time together, the agenda for board meetings is structured along four distinct pillars: strategy, performance, people and governance, with a focus on monitoring strategic progress and tracking performance and delivery.\n\n## Primary tasks during 2022\n\nStrategic progress: The board monitored and oversaw the activities and performance of bp's leadership team in delivering the strategic aims and targets. This involved taking into account important changes to the wider economic environment, in particular the issue that the world wants and needs a better and more balanced energy system - one that can deliver more secure, more affordable as well as low carbon energy solutions.\n\nPeople: The board received briefings on executive succession and development discussing the leadership team's succession plans and reviewing development needs with the aim of identifying and working with future leaders.\n\nThe board was also consulted in the development of bp's new culture frame and specifically our new core beliefs, which we refer to as 'Who we are' (see page 66).\n\nValue generated for shareholders: In the second quarter of 2022, the board approved an increase in the ordinary dividend of 10% per ordinary share. After a structured review of the strategy during the second half of 2022, and consideration of the capital allocation options available to it, a further 10% increase in the ordinary dividend was approved by the board in February 2023. These increases are underpinned by strong underlying performance and the confidence we have in delivering higher adjusted EBITDA as a result of our updated investment plans.\n\nThe review also informed the board's confidence in the disciplined capital frame, delivering continued share buybacks while also reducing its level of net debt.\n\nClimate: The board considered a number of climate-related issues during the year including approving, and agreeing to put to shareholders the opportunity to vote on, the net zero ambition report at the 2022 AGM, a report which summarized bp's net zero ambition and the actions we plan to pursue it. For information on the board's other considerations of climaterelated issues, please see the 'Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures' (TCFD) box on the next page, and pages 50-62 for our full TCFD disclosure.\n\n## Strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReflecting on the evolving macro-economic situation, during 2022 the board engaged regularly with the bp leadership team to review bp's strategy. During the year, the board received business presentations, including a deep dive on our low carbon energy strategy and other transition growth engines.\n\nAfter a thorough review process, and satisfying itself that it was consistent with bp's growth strategy, the board approved the acquisition of Archaea Energy in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDecision making by the board, see page 89\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe board reviewed safety, project and operational performance throughout the year, as well as taking a retrospective look at the full-year delivery against plan. The company's financial performance, liquidity, credit position and associated financial risks were closely and regularly monitored by the board. These activities were also supported by the committees, with committee chairs providing regular update reports at board meetings.\n\nThe board also discussed the financial frame, and the various options available for modifying it, for example via incremental changes that will enhance the overall investor proposition, while retaining as much consistency as possible. Inputs that assisted the board in discharging its duty to oversee performance included reports from the CEO and CFO, quarterly and full-year results, and the annual plan and associated capital allocation commitments.\n\n## Emerging and principal risks\n\nThe board assessed bp's principal and emerging risks, in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code (Code). The board and committees also met regularly with senior members of management and sought updates on their review, evaluation and management of the principal and emerging risks allocated to them.\n\n## Internal controls\n\nThe board assessed the effectiveness of the group's system of internal control and risk management as part of the process through which it reviews, and ultimately approves, the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F . No specific areas of concern were identified in this assessment and the board concluded that the group's system of internal control and risk management continued to be resilient, fit for purpose and that the system generally meets external expectations of components to be included in internal control frameworks. In arriving at these conclusions, the board took into account reports from group risk and internal audit, as well as deep dive presentations and business reviews undertaken by the board and its committees during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHow we manage risk, see page 69 bp's system of internal control, see page 149\n\n<!-- image -->",

Advised by the people and governance committee, this included reviewing the board's composition, skills, experience and diversity, as well as that of the bp leadership team.\n\nAmanda Blanc's appointment to the board as a non-executive director was announced in July 2022, with her appointment taking effect from 1 September 2022. Amanda was appointed as a member of the remuneration and people and governance committees with effect from 1 January 2023.\n\nSatish Pai and Hina Nagarajan were appointed to the board with effect from 1 March 2023. Satish was also appointed to the safety and sustainability committee and Hina was appointed to the audit committee with effect from the same date.\n\nTo help inform board discussions and decisions, board members engaged directly with the workforce through various events, see page 94.\n\n## Diversity\n\nThe board diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) policy (the policy) sets out the board's approach to DE&I including targets for board diversity that align with those set out in the UK Listing Rules. The policy was reviewed in 2022, and amendments were made to reflect regulatory changes and market practice. The updated policy was then approved and published in February 2023.\n\nA copy of the policy is available at bp.com/ governance .\n\n## Culture\n\nThe board has a number of mechanisms to monitor culture. Through the people and governance committee, regular updates are provided by the EVP, people and culture as well as feedback from employee pulse surveys, global engagement sessions led by the CEO and also from workforce engagement programme sessions, of which a summary is reported to the board itself.\n\nAdvised by the people and governance committee, plans have been developed for a range of culture related data points and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The board's consideration of climate-related issues\n\nSome examples from the year ended 31 December 2022\n\n## Reviewing and guiding the strategy and approving the annual plan and budget\n\n- \u00b7 Considered and approved changes to bp's aims.\n- \u00b7 In reviewing and approving the annual plan and budget, the board considered, among other matters:\n- -  bp's emissions and methane reduction targets.\n- -  Delivery against net zero aims.\n- -Strategic priorities and opportunities, including in relation to electrification, offshore wind and hydrogen.\n- -  Key financial risks and uncertainties, including those associated with transition growth businesses.\n- \u00b7 The board received business presentations, including a deep dive on our low carbon energy strategy and other transition growth engines, which helped to inform its review of the budget and plan proposals. The board's review extended to planned capital commitments and their consistency with our strategy.\n\n- \u00b7 Monitored management's execution of bp's strategy, with updates from the CEO and CFO at every board meeting covering, among other matters, performance against bp aims 1-5 and updates on the current macro environment and ESG considerations.\n- \u00b7 Considered transition risks and opportunities as part of its review of the financial frame and total capital expenditure ahead of its decision to increase capital expenditure guidance in February 2023, see page 24.\n- \u00b7 Received updates from the chief economist on the macroeconomic environment, energy markets and energy transition scenarios.\n- \u00b7 Approved bp's 2022 net zero ambition report and agreed to put to shareholders the opportunity to vote on it at the 2022 AGM.\n\n## Risk management\n\n- \u00b7 The board reviews bp's principal and emerging risks twice per year, including those related to climate and the impact of geopolitics and macroeconomic developments on the pace of the energy transition.

For more information on this, and the progress made in relation to recommendations arising from the 2021 external evaluation, see page 97.\n\n## Capital expenditure, acquisitions and divestments\n\n- \u00b7 At every board meeting the CEO provides an update on business development. Updates cover projects across all of bp's businesses and include inorganic or divestment opportunities of more than $100 million or which would represent a new strategic business. This included the acquisition of EDF Energy Services for a total cash consideration of $0.5 billion, see page 31. The CFO provides verbal updates and, where appropriate, specific climate-related considerations are drawn out.\n- \u00b7 The board reviews and reserves for its approval all transition and low carbon investment opportunities  above $1 billion. In 2022 the board considered:\n- -  The capital commitment for Empire Wind offshore wind farms, see page 29.\n- -  The acquisition of Archaea Energy for a total cash consideration of $3.1 billion, supporting bp's biogas portfolio and our accelerated net zero aim 3, see page 29.",

The responsibility for the execution of this delegation of authority, including regularly monitoring it, is retained by the board.\n\nGiven the size and scale of bp, in practice there are relatively few matters that come to the board for a decision.\n\nUnder the framework, these matters would include, for example, transactions involving a capital commitment of $3 billion or more in the case of investment into oil and gas opportunities, or $1 billion or more for other investments, as well as decisions on strategy and distributions to shareholders.\n\n## How the board had regard to Section 172 factors\n\nDirectors must act in the way that they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of shareholders as a whole. The table below provides further information on how the directors had regard to the factors in section 172.\n\n| Section 172 factor                                                                    | Key examples                                                                                 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| The likely consequence of any decisions in the long term.                             | Our strategy and business model, pages 10-14.                                                |\n| Interests of employees.                                                               | How the board has engaged with shareholders, the workforce and other  stakeholders, page 91. |\n|                                                                                       | Sustainability: our people, page 67.                                                         |\n| Fostering the company's business relationships with suppliers,  customers and others. | How the board has engaged with shareholders, the workforce and other  stakeholders, page 91. |\n|                                                                                       | Our strategy and business model, pages 10-14.                                                |\n|                                                                                       | Sustainability: ethics and compliance, page 68.                                              |\n|                                                                                       | Sustainability: our values and code of conduct, page 66.                                     |\n| Impact of operations on the community and the environment.                            | Sustainability: caring for our planet, page 64.                                              |\n|                                                                                       | Sustainability: safety, page 65.                                                             |\n| Maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct.                      | Role of the board, page 87.                                                                  |\n|                                                                                       | Sustainability: ethics and compliance, page 68.                                              |\n|                                                                                       | Sustainability: our values and code of conduct, page 66.                                     |\n| Acting fairly between members of the company.                                         | How the board has engaged with shareholders, the workforce and other  stakeholders, page 91. |\n\nDetails of three key decisions that were taken by the board in the past year in the context of the framework are set out on page 90.",

        "page_content": "## Decision making by the board continued\n\nDetails of three key decisions taken by the board including how the board had regard to stakeholder considerations and impacts in relation to Section 172 (1) (a) to (f).\n\n## 1. Board decision\n\n## Net zero ambition updates\n\nJuly 2022 - February 2023\n\n## 2. Board decision\n\n## Acquisition of Archaea Energy\n\n## December 2022\n\n## 3. Board decision\n\n## Exit from Russia\n\n## February 2022\n\n## Board discussion\n\nAfter a number of extended board discussions with the bp leadership team that began in mid-2022, the board approved the strategic update announced on 7 February 2023. We have updated how we expect to achieve our short-medium term pathway to deliver our net zero production aim (aim 2) and are now targeting 10-15% reduction by 2025 and aiming for 20-30% reduction by 2030 (see page 45).\n\n## Stakeholder considerations and impacts\n\nWhen discussing the update to this element of bp's net zero ambition throughout the second half of 2022, the board considered the global demand and need for energy that is secure and affordable as well as lower carbon - all three together known as the energy trilemma. The board remains committed to the energy transition, and recognizes that responding today to what governments and customers are asking of companies like bp is important to many stakeholder groups. The board also agreed that investment into bp's transition would grow at the same time as increasing our investment into oil and gas. As a result, on 7 February 2023, we also set out that our aim 5 - to increase the proportion of investment into non-oil and gas - is aligned with our transition growth engines (see page 29) - meaning we expect to invest more than 40%, or $6-8 billion of our annual capital expenditure in transition growth engines by 2025, and are aiming for around 50% by 2030 - or $7-9 billion. In coming to this conclusion following the extended review process it had undertaken, the board continues to believe our strategy - and ambition and aims - taken together, are consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement, see page 26.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Board discussion\n\nWe completed the purchase of Archaea Energy, a leading US provider of renewable natural gas, in December 2022. With bioenergy being one of five transition growth engines which bp intends to grow rapidly through this decade, the acquisition of Archaea marked a key milestone in the growth of this business area.\n\nThe board discussed the acquisition with the bp leadership team throughout the second half of 2022 as the opportunity matured, in order to review the business case and what it offered. The board recognized with Archaea, the opportunity to rapidly expand bp's presence in the US biogas industry while progressing bp's aim to reduce the average carbon intensity of sold energy products .\n\n## Stakeholder considerations and impacts\n\nThe board saw the opportunity to deliver additional distinctive value through the integration of the Archaea business with bp's trading capabilities and broad customer base. The board recognized that the Archaea acquisition enhances bp's ability to support customers with reaching their decarbonization goals.\n\nIn considering the value of this acquisition to shareholders, the board noted that the business is expected to deliver rateable earnings growth. From around $140 million today, bp is targeting adjusted EBITDA from the business, when integrated with bp, of more than $500 million in 2025 and is aiming for around $1 billion by 2027, following completion of the development pipeline.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information about Archaea Energy, see page 15\n\n## Board discussion\n\nIn February 2022, shortly following Russia's attack on Ukraine, the board met with members of the bp leadership team and undertook a thorough review of the consequences of these events on bp's business and operations in Russia. After careful consideration, and just days after Russia's first attack, the board decided that bp would exit its shareholding in Rosneft. This review process considered a wide variety of factors, including how any decision should be informed by the company's purpose and strategy, as well as the implications of the decision for shareholder distributions and our financial frame.\n\n## Stakeholder considerations and impacts\n\nThe board concluded that bp's continuing involvement with Rosneft would be inconsistent with bp's purpose and strategy, believing the decision was in the best long-term interests of all our shareholders.\n\nImportantly, the board was clear that the decision meant that no changes to our strategy, financial frame or shareholder distributions guidance were required.",

These changes included: a greater focus on understanding company culture, more in-person sessions and engagement in a language other than English.\n\nThe P&GC considers the current approach is effective given the diversity of bp's workforce.

The programme prepares new board members for their role with bp, recognizing the importance of supporting directors in meeting their statutory duties, increasing their understanding of bp's strategy, and bringing them closer to the decision makers and leaders responsible for the day-to-day management of the business.\n\nBeyond the initial period of induction, the development needs of individual board members are reviewed regularly. Ongoing training aims to ensure that directors continue to be best placed to objectively assess and inform the evolution of bp's strategy and purpose. This approach also supports the role that non-executive directors have in scrutinizing and holding the leadership team to account.\n\nThe review of development needs is also informed by feedback received from the chair's individual meetings with directors and the outputs from the board's annual evaluation (see page 97). Together, these steps help to identify areas where a particular focus or a deeper dive into a business may support the board's understanding.\n\n## Induction of Amanda Blanc\n\nOn 1 September 2022, the board appointed Amanda Blanc as a new director. In advance of her appointment, a personalised induction programme was developed, taking account of Amanda's existing knowledge and expertise as a director of a UK FTSE 100 company.\n\nAs part of her induction, Amanda held a series of 1:1 introductory meetings with members of both the board and leadership team, together with selected senior management. Within those meetings a wide range of topics were covered including ESG, investor relations, financial, legal and regulatory updates together with business group overviews and discussions on bp's strategy.\n\n## 2022 learning opportunities\n\nFor all directors, after completing a structured induction programme, specific training and knowledge sessions are provided, either as part of the routine programme of meetings and site visits or in response to a specific request.\n\nIn addition to meeting in London, during 2022 the board travelled to Aberdeen and Houston.

Being able to meet with members of the bp leadership team across all three business groups, as well as bp's integrators and enablers was particularly valuable, helping me to understand their priorities and challenges first-hand. I look forward to developing my knowledge further in 2023 and beyond, particularly through undertaking site visits and meeting with teams in person.\n\n## Amanda Blanc\n\nIndependent non-executive director - appointed 1 September 2022\n\nmeetings, the directors took the opportunity to make site visits and engage with stakeholders in these key strategic locations.\n\nIn Aberdeen, the directors met with bp employees, contractors and other stakeholders representing our North Sea businesses. This included those associated with new growth opportunities linked to the ScotWind offshore wind project and the partnership to create the city hydrogen hub. Some members of the board visited Glen Lyon, one of our floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels located west of the Shetland Islands, and spent time with the key operational staff on board (see page 111). While in Houston, directors met the trading and shipping leadership team and visited the security operations centre which monitors and combats cyber threats.\n\nOutside of the scheduled board programme, knowledge sessions were held on the subject matters of hydrogen, liquefied natural gas and the mandatory regulations arising as a result of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. In addition, the directors visited the refineries in Whiting, US, and in Gelsenkirchen, Germany. At both locations, the board members met with local teams to discuss operational and safety matters associated with their sites.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The model that has been rolled out encompasses engagement with the board as a whole and individually, as well as opportunities to build relationships in informal environments around board meetings and visits across the businesses.\n\n## Board succession planning\n\nAmanda Blanc joined the board on 1 September 2022. The appointments of Satish Pai and Hina Nagarajan were also announced in 2022 and took effect from 1 March 2023.\n\nThe table on page 101 describes the different stages of our recruitment process for these three new non-executive directors identified and nominated to join the board. It sets out the search criteria defined by the committee for each role at the start of the process and the skills and experience the board believes that they each bring to bp.\n\nDuring 2022 the committee engaged with Egon Zehnder, MWM Consulting and Spencer Stuart in support of its ongoing search for new board candidates. Egon Zehnder provides advice and support on bp's executive development programme and Spencer Stuart support on executive recruitment. MWM Consulting has no other connection with the company. There are no connections between these search agents and individuals directors.\n\n## Workforce engagement\n\nThe committee reviewed both the results from the company's annual 'Pulse' survey and the plan regarding the roll-out of the company's new beliefs, which we refer to as 'Who we are'. Our Pulse survey captures our employees' thoughts on what it is like to work at bp and gives the opportunity to feedback on key issues and the committee was encouraged that the results showed the highest ever pride in the company - as well as the strongest response rate since it\n\n## The P&GC's consideration of climate-related issues\n\n## Some examples from the year ended 31 December 2022\n\nPerformance objectives\n\n- \u00b7 Reviewed people capability plans, analyzing the skills and experience required for bp to deliver its strategy, including the skills identified by management that bp needs to improve the capability of its people and, as required, to acquire new knowledge across key business areas and disciplines, including across the transition growth engines.\n\nMonitoring, implementation and performance\n\n- \u00b7 Reviewed the expansion of bp's executive succession planning framework which aims to identify the skills and experience bp needs to deliver our strategy and net zero ambition.\n\nbegan. Another focus for the committee in 2022 was to review the plans to raise awareness and understanding of 'Who we are' and the underlying values, beliefs and principles foundational to bp within the frame. In 2023, the committee will continue to monitor the culture within bp and how the practices and behaviours within our new beliefs are being reinforced. For more information, see workforce engagement on page 94.\n\n## Induction and training\n\nAll newly appointed directors receive a formal induction (see page 96). These induction programmes usually commence before appointment and are typically completed within the first three months of a director's appointment. Feedback is sought from the director each time a programme is completed to ensure it is continually updated and improved.\n\nIn addition to the induction process, further training and development is provided through online training, material provided through our secure board portal, targeted knowledge sessions and educational sessions with local management during site visits by the board or its committees.\n\n## Diversity of the board\n\nThe board believes that to deliver on our purpose and strategy, we must foster diversity of thought and an environment where everyone can bring their best and true selves to work. It is therefore pleasing that the board already meets the UK listing rule diversity benchmark target (as at 31 December 2022 and at the date of publication of this report) for at least 40% of the board comprises women, at least one of the senior board positions is a woman and at least one director is from a minority ethnic background, continuing the progress made in 2021.",

        "page_content": "## People and governance committee continued\n\nAfter a review by the committee, the board has approved changes to its diversity, equity & inclusion (DE&I) policy which complements bp's wider diversity policies and which embraces the group's values, code of conduct and sustainability frame. The full DE&I policy is available online at bp.com/corporategovernance .\n\nWhile the board aspires to achieve gender parity, progress against diversity targets is sensitive to the size and tenure of the board. In respect of other forms of diversity, three members of the board self-identify as being from a minority ethnic background (2021: one director). Diversity of the board remained a consideration as part of the identification and selection of new directors in 2022, with an additional female director, Amanda Blanc, appointed in 2022.\n\n## Diversity of senior leaders\n\nThe composition of senior management (as defined in the Corporate Governance Code 2018) and their direct reports comprise 51% women (2021 49%) and 25% Black, Asian and minority ethnic individuals (2021 26%). The committee supports the work undertaken by management to support career progression of under-represented groups in a sector that has historically been male-dominated with limited diversity in other forms. This includes the ambition to have females in 50% of the top 120 leader roles by 2025, our US minority ambition to have 20% of our group and senior leader roles held by minorities by 2025 and our UK ethnicity ambition to have 15% of our senior leader roles to be held by minorities.\n\n## Diversity of the workforce\n\nDiversity, equity and inclusion remain a key part of the group's people strategy. The board as a whole is supportive of the group's employee-led business resource groups (BRGs) which provide forums for employees to obtain support and networking opportunities around specific themes such as ethnicity and sexual orientation.\n\n## Skills matrix\n\n|                         | Background and experience   | Background and experience                    | Background and experience

Individuals were identified for initial engagement and to gauge their interest in a board role.\n\nStage 3 - Shortlist meetings\n\nFollowing confirmation of interest, a shortlist of candidates was agreed who were then invited to meet with the chair. Based on feedback from these meetings, preferred candidates met with the other committee members, as well as the CEO.\n\nStage 4 - Candidate selection\n\nFeedback from these individual candidate meetings with the members of the committee and the CEO was aggregated and discussed. Appointment recommendations were then made to the board subject to due diligence, satisfying independence criteria, and capacity to take on the role.\n\n## Search 1 recommendation Amanda Blanc\n\nHaving held a number of executive leadership positions the committee believed that Amanda's experience of leading insurance businesses in the UK and Europe and her deep connections throughout the UK's business and investment communities, allied to a strong interest in the energy transition would further enhance the board's ability to support bp as it transforms into an integrated energy company.\n\n## Search 2 recommendation Satish Pai\n\nWith over 30 years' experience in engineering and management roles, the committee believed the board would benefit from Satish's broad experience in operations and technology management in both resources and energy industries and the company would further benefit from his strong digital capability.\n\n## Search 3 recommendation Hina Nagarajan\n\nHaving spent over 30 years in the FMCG industry, the committee believed the board would benefit from Hina's deep and wide-ranging experience in customerfocused FMCG businesses, an area of increasing importance for bp, together with her proven track record in business transformation and development in complex emerging markets.\n\nStage 5 - Induction\n\nThe final stage is to provide the new directors with a comprehensive induction.

The committee has sought to understand the stressors and resilience of the business to volatile energy prices, with four updates received during the year. In addition, the committee has carefully reviewed the impact of energy prices on the LNG portfolio and the associated accounting treatment.\n\nEarlier in the year, the committee reviewed the accounting treatment of Rosneft, following the board's decision that bp would exit its shareholding as announced on 27 February 2022. An assessment of the going concern status and longer-term viability following this decision was also made and the committee concluded there was minimal impact of this decision.\n\nFollowing a successful roll-out of the nonfinancial reporting assurance framework for the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021 , the committee received a briefing on updates to the framework and discussed with management ways to enhance the framework over time to achieve a similar level of assurance to financial reporting for material metrics.\n\nThe five-yearly external effectiveness review of the internal audit function was completed during the year. The outcome of the review was overwhelmingly positive with further enhancements identified in the use of technology and digital tools.\n\nThe committee will monitor the implementation of the UK government's audit and corporate governance reform consultation and the FRC consultation on minimum standard for audit committees during 2023. The committee will continue to review the development of ESG reporting frameworks that may impact our reporting.\n\n## Key areas of focus in 2022\n\nLiquidity risk and credit risk - the committee reviewed management's response to increased volatility of energy prices at key points during the year. The wider macroeconomic environment has also led to increased credit exposures.\n\nRosneft accounting treatment - following bp's decision to exit its shareholding in Rosneft, the committee reviewed and challenged management's accounting judgements in respect of Rosneft.\n\nLNG market and accounting treatment - the committee reviewed the overall LNG market, bp's response and the fair value of these contracts.\n\nThe committee monitors the effectiveness of the group's financial reporting (including climate-related financial disclosures), systems of internal control and risk management and the integrity of the group's external and internal audit processes.\n\n## Meetings and attendance\n\nThere were 10 committee meetings in 2022. All members attended each meeting with the exception of Pam Daley who was unable to attend one meeting due to a prior commitment. Regular attendees include the chief financial officer, SVP, accounting reporting control, SVP, internal audit, EVP, legal and the external auditor.\n\n- Meeting attended\n- Did not attend\n\n## Tushar Morzaria\n\nMember (September 2020) and chair of the committee (May 2021)\n\nPamela Daley Member\n\nNon-financial reporting - reviewed the assurance framework in place for non-financial reporting, in particular related to climate disclosures.\n\nInternal audit external effectiveness review - oversaw the selection of the external reviewer and discussed the outcome of the assessment with management.\n\nMacroeconomic environment - the committee monitored the impact of increased energy market volatility on inflation and interest rates and related supply chain impacts. This included, in addition to credit risk referred to above, decommissioning liabilities and the impact of sanctions related to the Russia-Ukraine war.\n\nPaula Reynolds Member\n\nKaren Richardson Member",

The board has also determined that, as bp is a foreign private issuer, the audit committee meets the independence criteria provisions of Rule 10A-3 of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and that Mr Morzaria can be regarded as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 16A of Form 20-F.\n\n## Key responsibilities\n\n- \u00b7 Monitor and critically assess bp's financial statements and financial information, including the integrity of the financial reporting and related processes, context in which statements are made, compliance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and financial reporting standards, including the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n- \u00b7 Assess the going concern assumption and the longer-term viability statement as to bp's ability to continue to operate and meet its liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Review and challenge the application and appropriateness of significant accounting policies and financial reporting judgements.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the risk to quality and effectiveness of the financial reporting process and, where requested by the board, advise whether the annual report and accounts are fair, balanced and understandable.\n- \u00b7 Review the affordability of distributions to shareholders.\n- \u00b7 Oversee the appointment, remuneration, independence and performance of the external auditor and the integrity of the audit process as a whole, including the engagement of the external auditor to supply non-audit services to bp.\n- \u00b7 Review the effectiveness of the internal audit function, bp's internal financial controls and its systems of internal control and risk management.\n- \u00b7 Monitor the principal risks allocated to the committee by the board and review the mitigations proposed by management in respect of risks associated with bp internal financial controls and reporting responsibilities and such emerging risks that may fall within scope.\n\n- \u00b7 Review the systems in place to enable those who work for bp to raise concerns about improprieties in financial reporting or other issues, and for those matters to be investigated.\n\n## How risks were reviewed\n\nThe risk factors allocated to the committee for monitoring in 2022 are set out below. In addition to the specific areas identified below, the committee received quarterly reports from internal audit on their work associated with each of the risk factors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For a definition of the risk factors, see pages 73-75\n\nPrices and markets: The committee reviewed cash flow forecasts and business performance. Each quarter the committee assessed the affordability of distributions and the financial frame. It also reviewed the longer-term outlook for energy prices in line with bp's price assumptions for investment - see the committee's consideration of climate-related issues on page 107 for further information.\n\nAccessing and progressing hydrocarbon resources and low carbon opportunities: The committee reviewed the methodology behind oil & gas reserves disclosures, holding a deep dive with the business on its outlook to 2030 and key areas for development. It reviewed the financial risks around the business case for a follow-on investment in bp's Empire Wind development and recommended the follow-on investment to the board.\n\nLiquidity, financial capacity and financial, including credit, exposure: the committee received four updates during the year on liquidity and credit risk. It also reviewed off-balance sheet commitments and reviewed the longer-term viability statement at year end, together with the going concern basis of accounting at the full and half-year ends.\n\nJoint arrangements and contractors: A jointly held review was undertaken with the safety & sustainability committee to assess the management of this risk.\n\nDigital infrastructure, cyber security and data protection: The committee received updates on the control environment related to financial controls each quarter. It reviewed and challenged progress on the remediation of significant deficiencies with input from internal audit and the external auditor.\n\nInsurance: a review was undertaken and management's plan to mitigate this risk was challenged by the committee.\n\nEthical misconduct and non-compliance: the committee received updates on the system in place to identify and prevent fraud risk and progress on the roll-out of additional controls. It also received updates on management's disclosure committee meetings in connection with the quarterly results and any areas of compliance or fraud risk related to the results.\n\nRegulation: the committee received an update on compliance with regulation together with additional briefings during the year on the implementation of evolving sanctions regimes in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nTrading and treasury trading activities: the committee undertook two reviews of the trading & shipping business, including a floor walk of the trading floor in Houston.\n\nReporting: The committee reviewed and challenged the quarterly results, including key accounting judgements and the system of internal control over financial reporting. The committee reviewed the annual report (see page 104) and reviewed the assurance process of the same, together with receiving updates from the external auditor. A review was undertaken of the non-financial reporting assurance framework and the key non-financial metrics. The outcome of this review was the development of a project plan to enhance the assurance framework in response to an anticipated increase in regulatory requirements over time.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Visiting audit and ARC teams\n\nThe audit committee visited bp's Sunbury campus in the UK and met with the internal audit and accounting, reporting and control (ARC) leadership teams. The committee discussed the internal audit 2023 planning process and how emerging and enduring risks are considered in the allocation of audits. The ARC leadership team provided an overview of the team's work to modernize the control environment through automation and analytical tools and support for new business areas (including acquisitions). The committee also met with the technical accounting and external reporting teams.",

        "page_content": "## Internal control\n\nHow internal control and risk management was assessed\n\nInternal audit : Internal audit provides key assurance to the committee on the group's governance, risk management and system of internal control.\n\n## Key matters reviewed by the committee\n\nRegular updates from internal audit on the key findings during the year, progress against the internal audit plan and adjustments made to the plan during the course of the year. The committee challenged management's response and progress made on the closure of findings. Areas of interest for the committee included findings related to trading and treasury trading activities and crisis management and business continuity.\n\nThe committee also reviewed and approved the internal audit charter, which sets out the expectations for the function in accordance with the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors' (IIA) guidelines.\n\n## Internal audit effectiveness\n\nAn external effectiveness review was undertaken during the year following the last external review in 2017 and the committee's own review in 2021. The process is set out below. The outcome of the review was overwhelmingly positive with further enhancements identified in the use of technology and digital tools.\n\nIn addition to the external effectiveness review, the committee approved the annual plan and reviewed reports from internal audit. It also met privately with the SVP, internal audit, and\n\nreceived feedback from other key stakeholders on the effectiveness of the function. The committee concluded that internal audit had unrestricted scope, together with access to information and sufficient resources to fulfil its mandate.\n\nThe committee reviewed the independence and objectivity of the SVP internal audit, who has served for longer than seven years, in line with IIA best practice guidelines. The committee concluded that the SVP internal audit remained independent and objective. In reaching this conclusion, the committee considered feedback from key stakeholders, access to information and the resources available and the response of management to the challenge received, together with the outcome of the external effectiveness review. The committee discussed the succession plans for this role and the anticipated timeframe.\n\n## Non-financial reporting assurance framework\n\nThe committee reviewed the control and assurance framework for non-financial reporting (NFR) published by bp under a broad range of regulatory and voluntary disclosure frameworks and standards, including TCFD, following the introduction of the NFR framework in 2021. Following updates from management on regulatory developments over the course of the last year, the committee challenged management on the underlying assurance processes and whether bp had the most appropriate suite of metrics for disclosures against bp's strategy and aims and ambitions.\n\n## Training and briefings\n\nThe committee considered market updates and developments throughout the year.\n\n## Internal audit external effectiveness review process\n\n## Selection of external reviewer\n\n- \u00b7 Tender process conducted by procurement team.\n- \u00b7 Recommendation to audit committee chair.\n- \u00b7 PwC selected to undertake review.\n- \u00b7 Scope and objectives of review finalized based on guidelines from institute of internal auditors.\n\n## Review fieldwork undertaken\n\n- \u00b7 Assessment against IIA standards.\n- \u00b7 Stakeholder interviews and surveys, incorporating NEDs, management and internal audit staff.\n- \u00b7 Review audit files.\n- \u00b7 Benchmarking against other internal audit functions.\n\nThis included technical accounting updates from the SVP, accounting reporting control on developments in financial reporting and accounting policy.\n\nThe committee also received briefings on specific topics, including risk governance and the audit and corporate governance consultation outcome published by the UK government during 2022.\n\n## Regulatory correspondence\n\n## FRC request for information\n\nThe company received a request from the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) for information relating to segmental reporting of the gas & low carbon energy segment in the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021 . The committee reviewed the correspondence and proposed response, the outcome of which was the inclusion in this bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2022 of enhanced disclosures relating to the management of the gas & low carbon businesses and how reportable segments have been determined (see our financial reporting segments and business groups on pages 12 and 13, and Financial statements - Note 5).\n\nAn FRC review provides no assurance that the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021 was correct in all material respects. The FRC's role was not to verify the information provided, but to consider compliance with reporting requirements. Its letters are written on the basis that the FRC (which includes the FRC's officers, employees and agents) accepts no liability for reliance on them by bp or any third party, including but not limited to investors and shareholders.\n\n## Reporting\n\n## Outcome\n\n- \u00b7 Discussing outcome of review with chairs of the audit committee and safety and sustainability committee.\n- \u00b7 Presentation of findings and recommendations to a joint session of the audit and safety and sustainability committees.\n- \u00b7 Discussion of findings and recommendations by both committees with a focus on items where the function could be further enhanced.\n- \u00b7 Internal audit function performing well.\n- \u00b7 Committees appreciated the adaptability of the function, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n- \u00b7 Recommendations, such as the enhancement of data analytics to be taken forward by the function.\n- \u00b7 A well-planned onboarding process for the successor to the current SVP, internal audit should be put in place.",

        "page_content": "## Audit committee continued\n\n## FRC thematic review\n\nThe bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021 was included in the FRC's sample for its thematic review of TCFD disclosures and climate in financial statements. The committee noted the findings from the thematic review, where some of bp's disclosures were considered to be examples of better practice and how further improvements could be incorporated into the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2022 .\n\n## SEC review\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission reviewed the bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2021 and raised a number of comments including ones relating to the disclosures in the report relating to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and oil and gas reserve disclosures, to which bp responded. As a result, bp agreed to include additional line items in the oil and gas reserve disclosure in this bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2022 .\n\n## External audit\n\nHow the committee assessed audit risk The external auditor set out its audit plan for 2022, identifying significant audit risks. These included:\n\n- \u00b7 Impairment (including reversals) of oil and gas property, plant and equipment values.\n- \u00b7 Accounting for structured commodity transactions.\n- \u00b7 Valuation of level 3 instruments in trading and shipping and revenue recognition.\n- \u00b7 Decommissioning provisions.\n\nThe committee discussed with the auditor the scope of the audit and the overall coverage against profit, revenue and property, plant and equipment metrics, alongside the potential impact of volatility of energy prices on the materiality level. The committee received updates during the year on the audit process, including how the auditor had challenged the group's assumptions on the significant audit risks.\n\nA summary of the audit approach is set out in the independent auditor's report on page 153.\n\n## How the committee assessed audit fees\n\nThe audit committee reviews the fee structure, resourcing and terms of engagement for the external auditor annually. In addition, it reviews the non-audit services that the auditor provides to the group on a quarterly basis.\n\nFees paid to the external auditor for the year were $52 million (2021 $58 million), of which less than 1% was for non-audit and other assurance services (see Financial statements - Note 36). The audit committee is satisfied that this level of fee is appropriate in respect of the audit services provided and that an effective audit can be conducted for this fee. Non-audit or non-audit related services consisted of other assurance services.\n\n## How the committee assessed audit quality and effectiveness\n\nAs part of its overall assessment of audit quality and effectiveness, the committee requested reports from the external auditor and management (see below) on the audit process, quality procedures and the handling of key judgements. The committee also held private meetings with the external auditor during the year and committee members met separately with the external auditor at least quarterly. The committee chair also met with SVP, internal audit on a regular basis. The committee considered its interactions with the external auditor and the regular reporting received in relation to the quarterly results.\n\nThe committee assessed the auditor's approach to providing audit services, taking account of the external auditor insights report and management survey. The committee concluded that the audit team was providing the required quality in relation to the provision of the services.\n\nThe audit team had shown the necessary commitment and ability to provide the services together with a demonstrable depth of knowledge, robustness, independence and objectivity as well as an appreciation of complex issues. The team had posed constructive challenge to management and the committee noted the quality of reporting provided to it.\n\nIn challenging management, the committee was impressed by the external auditor's engagement with management on LNG cargo contract performance and decommissioning discount rates. The committee received a presentation on the external auditor's use of technology in their audit process and opportunities for further enhancements to the audit.\n\n## Reports received by the committee as part of its assessment of audit quality\n\n## External auditor insights report: the\n\ncommittee receives a summary of areas of opportunity for improvements to processes related to financial reporting or internal control identified as part of the audit process, management's response to the recommendations identified and progress made against any prior year items together with areas of focus for the forthcoming year.\n\nManagement survey: the survey sought views from key internal stakeholders and comprised questions across the following:\n\n- (i) The external auditor's performance, for which the main measurement criteria were:\n- \u00b7 Planning and scope.\n- \u00b7 Robustness of the audit process.\n- \u00b7 Independence and objectivity.\n\n## Quality of delivery\n\n- \u00b7 Quality of people and service.\n- \u00b7 Value added advice.\n\n(ii) bp's commitment to the audit.\n\nThe overall score from the survey increased compared to the prior year, with strong improvement in engagement, independence and team capability. Reductions in scores for use of technology and constructive recommendations were discussed by the committee with the external auditor.\n\n## How the auditor's reappointment and independence were assessed\n\nThe committee considers the reappointment of the external auditor each year before making a recommendation to the board. The committee assesses the independence of the external auditor on an ongoing basis, taking account of the information and assurances provided by the external auditor and the level of non-audit fees. The external auditor is required to rotate the lead audit partner every five years and other senior audit staff every five to seven years. No partners or senior staff associated with the bp audit may transfer to the group.\n\nExternal audit services were last tendered in 2016 and the external auditor has been in role for four years (since 2018). It is anticipated that a re-tender will be completed by 2026 or sooner, in line with relevant guidelines, for the 2028 audit. The committee believes that the anticipated timeline for the re-tender of audit services is in the best interests of shareholders. It provides an appropriate balance of factors such as the auditor knowledge of controls and risks, maintaining audit quality, independence and objectivity, and providing value for money.",

        "page_content": "The company is in compliance with the requirements of the Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014.\n\n## How the committee had oversight of non-audit services\n\nThe audit committee is responsible for bp's policy on non-audit services and the approval of non-audit services. Audit objectivity and independence are safeguarded through the prohibition of non-audit tax services being provided by the external auditor and the limitation of audit-related work which falls within defined categories. bp's policy on non-audit services states that the auditor may not perform non-audit services that are prohibited by the SEC, Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) or the UK Financial Reporting Council (FRC).\n\nThe audit committee approves the terms of all audit services as well as permitted audit-related and non-audit services in advance. The external auditor is considered for permitted non-audit services only when its expertise and experience of bp is important. Approvals for individual engagements of pre-approved permitted services below certain thresholds are delegated to the SVP, accounting reporting control or the chief financial officer. Any proposed service not included in the permitted services categories must be approved in advance either by the audit committee chair or the audit committee before engagement commences.\n\nThe audit committee, chief financial officer and SVP, accounting reporting control monitor overall compliance with bp's policy on auditrelated and non-audit services, including whether the necessary pre-approvals have been obtained. The categories of permitted and pre-approved services are outlined in principal accountant's fees and services on page 376.\n\n## The audit committee's consideration of climate-related issues\n\n## Examples from the year ended 31 December 2022\n\nThe committee's primary role in monitoring the effectiveness of bp's financial reporting, systems of internal control and risk management means that it is well placed to consider a range of risks and opportunities associated with climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy, together with the oversight of the assurance process for certain climate-related items. There are several ways in which the committee has considered climate risk and opportunities during the year, which are set out below.\n\n| Empire Wind follow-on investment decision   | Reviewed the cost base, capability and expertise of the team and joint venture partner, recruitment  and risks and opportunities related to opex and capex.                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| TCFD                                        | Reviewed the TCFD compliance assessment.

In February 2022, a contractor driving for Aral in Germany, lost his life in a vehicle collision. In April 2022, a specialist tank contractor lost his life in an explosion while repairing a tank at an Aral retail site in Germany. In September 2022, two bp employees lost their lives in a fire at our Toledo refinery in the US. We take action to share and embed lessons learned across the organization to mitigate against the risk of future accidents and drive improvements in safety.\n\n## Key areas of focus in 2022\n\nSafety - continued to oversee safety and environmental performance, with a specific focus on reducing tier 1 and 2 process safety incidents, advising the remuneration committee on safety outcomes for 2022 and the setting of safety and sustainability measures for the group's reward plans.\n\nSite visits - engaged with local management through site visits to the Glen Lyon floating production, storage and offloading vessel in the North Sea, the Gelsenkirchen refinery in Germany, and the security operations centre in Houston.\n\nOversight of principal risks - reviewed the company's strategies to mitigate the principal risks associated with cyber security and safety and operational risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Role of the committee\n\nThe committee and audit committee worked jointly, allowing them to better understand and review bp's non-operated joint venture risk exposure and how the associated risks are being managed.\n\nThroughout the year, the committee was also proactive in engaging with the business through its visits to the Gelsenkirchen refinery in Germany, the Glen Lyon floating production, storage and offloading vessel in the North Sea, and the security operations centre in Houston (see pages 94 and 111). The committee looks forward to additional site visits in 2023 to see first-hand how the company is putting safety and performance into practice.\n\n## Melody Meyer\n\nCommittee chair\n\nThe committee oversees the leadership team's identification, management and mitigation of significant non-financial risk. This extends to personal and process safety risks, security and cyber security risks, operational, environmental and social risks, ethics and compliance risks and modern slavery risk management.\n\nThe committee also monitors the effectiveness of the implementation of bp's sustainability frame, including the progress being made by management in the delivery of our net zero ambition and associated aims and targets. To support this oversight role, the committee receives assurance that processes to identify and mitigate such non-financial risks are appropriate in their design and effective in their implementation.\n\n## Meetings and attendance\n\nThere were six committee meetings in 2022. All members attended each meeting. At the conclusion of each meeting the committee holds private sessions for its members, without management in attendance, to discuss any issues arising and meeting quality. The CEO receives ad hoc invitations to private sessions and the SVP, internal audit is invited at least once per year.\n\n- Meeting attended\n- Did not attend\n\n## Melody Meyer\n\nMember (May 2017) and chair of the committee (November 2019)\n\nSir John Sawers Member\n\nJohannes Teyssen Member",

For full committee terms of reference go to bp.com .\n\n## Activities during the year\n\nThe review of operational risk and performance forms a large part of the committee's agenda, and it received regular reports from the business covering key risks within operations, security and cyber.\n\nThe committee attended a cyber security knowledge session, where they were briefed on the extent of bp's cyber threat and improvements being made to tooling and capability to maintain the health of cyber security barriers. This session was supplemented by the committee's visit to the\n\nsecurity operations centre in Houston, see the case study (right) for more information.\n\n## Oversight of principal risks\n\nThe committee reviewed reports from the leadership team on their review, management and mitigation of the principal risks assigned to the committee, including related to marine, wells, product quality, pipeline, explosion or release at bp facilities, major security incident, cyber security and ethics and compliance.\n\nDuring the year, the committee held focused reviews on compliance, process safety and maintenance improvements, cyber security drills and modern slavery, and worked jointly with the audit committee to review bp's non-operated joint venture risk exposure.\n\nThe committee also received a report on how the company is reducing risk of marine incident, be it via the examples of transportation of bulk hydrocarbons, stability of floating production assets, or integrity of marine vessels. Safety at bp is underpinned by the group's operating management system  and the committee reviewed the section of the framework supporting the management of marine risk.\n\nThe committee also discussed an in-depth report on bp's product quality risk, and the actions taken to manage and mitigate it.\n\nEthics and compliance remained a focus in 2022, and the committee reviewed the strategic objectives designed to mitigate the risk of major compliance incidents. The committee also reviewed the new ethics and compliance code of conduct and associated risk-based training and made a recommendation to the board to adopt it as of 1 January 2023, see page 66.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nThe committee considered reports on bp's delivery against aim 3, related to carbon intensity reduction, and aim 17, related to water positivity. See page 45 for information on all aims. In relation to aim 17, the committee discussed the benefits, challenges and roadmap for implementation in light of the global issue of water stress and scarcity.\n\n## S&SC's consideration of climate-related issues\n\n## Examples from the year ended 31 December 2022\n\nMonitoring, implementation and performance\n\n- \u00b7 Received updates regarding progress on each of bp's sustainability aims, including important trends and insights in relation to each of the aims.\n- \u00b7 Conducted a review of aims 3 and 17.\n- \u00b7 Considered sustainability assurance findings.\n\n- \u00b7 Received updates on the progress on our sustainability frame (which includes our net zero ambition and aims) via reports from the EVP, strategy, sustainability & ventures.\n- \u00b7 Consulted with the remuneration committee on emissions measures to be incorporated into annual performance scorecards. See the directors' remuneration report on page 112.\n\nUnder aim 13, bp's approach to develop a fair wage in countries where bp has employees was reviewed. The committee also reviewed how bp was managing labour rights and modern slavery risk across all of bp's operations.\n\nIn partnership with the remuneration committee, input was provided on the measures and targets relating to safety performance for executive and leadership team incentive plans to ensure they arrived upon outcomes that were well reasoned and well supported.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Glen Lyon visit\n\nIn April 2022, committee members visited Glen Lyon floating production, storage and offloading facility, located 130km west of Shetland. The visit provided an opportunity to speak with the 130-person crew and observe first-hand the asset's design and complex subsea structure. Discussions provided insight into the operational and safety challenges our people experience, particularly after being unexpectedly stranded due to weather overnight.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Securities operations centre (SOC) visit\n\nIn September of 2022, members of the committee, along with most of the bp board, visited the SOC to get a first-hand view of how the SOC identifies and stops cyber threats across bp's global digital footprint, 24x7. Board members took away a clearer understanding of how digital security works across the company to reduce any potential impact of attacks by monitoring billions of daily events correlated with cyber and business intelligence to keep bp safe.",

Inflation was increasingly embedded in the global economy, and was exacerbated by geopolitical events, notably the war in Ukraine and the prolonged impact of COVID-19 lockdowns in China. We have considered remuneration in this context for our executive directors and wider workforce.\n\nIn line with government regulation, the directors' remuneration report (DRR) is required to report on executive reward. However, the reader will note throughout how we have included discussion about bp's aim to be an employer of choice for bp's 60,000+ people around the world. Clearly this aim is about pay, but it's also about benefits, working environment, purpose, and programmes to assure the wellbeing of bp employees. Indeed, the welfare of bp people is critical to the company's success for shareholders. The committee spent considerable time in 2022 understanding engagement levels of the entire bp workforce.\n\nThe committee has conferred with a great number of shareholders and proxy advisory firms, seeking their input prior to reaching our decisions. The one piece of feedback we received from virtually every party was to lay out in detail how the committee came to its decisions. Thus, you will see contained within the DRR a deeper level of granularity than in prior years.\n\n## Summary of 2022 pay outcomes for executive directors\n\n|                                                                                          | CEO:  Bernard Looney      | CFO:  Murray Auchincloss   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Base salary                                                                              | \u00a31,371,876                | \u00a3782,000                   |\n| 2022 annual bonus                                                                        | \u00a32,365,542 (75.5% of max) | \u00a31,404,000  (78% of max)   |\n| Downward discretion applied to 2022  annual bonus, see page 120                          | 3.2% or -\u00a378,329          | 0%                         |\n| 2020-22 performance share plan Additional three-year post-vesting holding period applied | \u00a36,007,512  (54% of max)  | \u00a32,890,536  (54% of max)   |\n| Downward discretion applied to 2020-22  performance share plan, see page 122             | 10% or -\u00a3667,497          | 10% or -\u00a3321,172           |\n| Single figure outcome for 2022                                                           | \u00a310,025,782               | \u00a35,282,049                 |\n| Total downward discretion applied                                                        | - \u00a3745,826                | - \u00a3321,172                 |\n\nIn both the treatment of the period 2020-2022 and the proposals for the refreshed policy, the committee has sought to find the balance between rewarding performance and doing so with moderation of outcomes.\n\n## Meeting bp's challenges\n\nbp's employees have risen to the challenge again and again over the past three years. In 2020, shareholders endured an underlying replacement cost loss of $5.7 billion as the pandemic devastated worldwide demand for energy. But bp employees kept operations running safely despite the complexity of pandemic protocols; at the same time, they also undertook actions to reset the company's ambition towards net zero. In 2021, our people delivered a seamless return to full operations and an underlying replacement cost profit of $12.8 billion. In 2022 the war in Ukraine led to the board's decision to exit bp's businesses in Russia; we took an unprecedented write-down of $24 billion. Nevertheless, robust operational results across the globe allowed the company to achieve an underlying replacement cost profit of $27.7 billion in the year just ended.\n\nbp aims to provide the world with secure, reliable, and increasingly cleaner energy. During 2022, bp maintained high production at levels necessary to meet the challenges of a bifurcated energy market and responded to the supply emergency in Europe by bringing additional supplies of LNG to European shores. In the UK we pledged to bolster resource development in the North Sea, supporting the UK's supply security. At the same time, bp is enabling retail customers' choice to switch to EVs through our fast-charging network, and advancing our plans for offshore wind, hydrogen and carbon capture.\n\nAs we responded to the changing energy landscape, the committee stress-tested whether we are rewarding our employees appropriately for the responsibilities that they have undertaken and the superior performance they have delivered. Board members engaged with front-line employees who work in the North Sea as well as those who are employed in bp's retail forecourts across the UK. It is important to note that all UK employees, including forecourt employees, are paid at, or above, the real living wage. We listened to their concerns - they didn't hold back - and relayed such concerns to management to ensure that pay and benefits programmes, development, and work systems continue to evolve and remain fit for purpose.\n\n## Alignment with stakeholders\n\nIn reaching our recommendations for the 2022 remuneration of our executive directors, we also undertook an extended dialogue with shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nIn pursuing this dialogue, we have tried to make clear that we are a committee that keeps its commitments to all of bp's employees, including executives, and that any discretion we use or judgement we apply is thoughtfully undertaken and proportionate to the issues we seek to address (see page 116).\n\nOver the past six years, the committee has carefully sought to moderate outcomes for our executives, even as the roles they play have become more challenging. We hope you will agree that our judgements reflect a sensible approach to rewarding difficult jobs well-done in this several-year period. A summary of executive director pay outcomes is shown on page 113 and the details are provided in the following pages.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' remuneration report continued\n\n## Bernard and Murray's leadership\n\nBernard has been the CEO since 2020. He led the reset of bp's purpose and strategy, and the creation - and work towards - bp's net zero ambition and aims. He has led the reinvention of bp, through a pandemic and global energy supply crisis. Throughout, he has shown commendable resilience which contributed to bp's strong underlying 2022 results, while growing investment, growing value and growing distributions to shareholders.\n\nMurray has been the CFO since 2020. He has been instrumental in designing and rolling out our disciplined financial frame. Under his prudent leadership, bp has gained greater investor and credit agency confidence, while reducing our net debt to $21.4 billion, the lowest for almost a decade, and returning funds to shareholders through a revised distribution policy. He has shown similar resilience and has matured convincingly into the role of CFO.\n\n## Overview of 2022 performance and remuneration outcomes\n\nThe 2022 annual bonus plan applies to more than half of bp's workforce, including its two executive directors. The plan seeks to reward performance against six key measures in three categories of bp's bonus scorecard: safety and sustainability, operational and financial.\n\n## Safety and sustainability\n\nbp exceeded our annual sustainability targets for emissions reductions, delivering 1.5mte reductions in 2022, and 7.1mte cumulative reductions since 2017. Process safety events combined tier 1 and 2 - were at a record low, which continues a downward trajectory over the past few years and reflects our continuous focus on safety improvement.\n\nHowever, tragically, during 2022 four people died while working for bp. The committee takes the view - shared by bp's leadership - that at bp safety comes first and thus avoiding workplace safety incidents must be the top priority. We provide more information about the impact of safety on remuneration on page 121.\n\nAs such, we have applied additional downward discretion on the outcome for Bernard and relevant members of management which results in a score of 1.51 out of 2.00.\n\n## Operational\n\nOperationally, the reliability and availability of our plants and refineries were just below target. This was driven by lower-than-expected refinery availability offset by record high upstream plant reliability . Margin share from convenience and electrification was impacted this year by the market environment (see page 6). The committee decided to exercise its discretion under this measure to reflect underlying\n\nperformance by making two adjustments: 1) to adjust for the actual foreign exchange rate environment, which resulted in a minimal uplift to all participants, including the executive directors; and 2) recognizing actual underlying business unit decisions to maintain margin (see page 121), which provides a more material uplift. We believe this latter adjustment was appropriate for the wider workforce. The uplift was not included in the calculation of executive director bonuses.\n\n## Financial\n\nFinancial performance, as measured by adjusted free cash flow and cumulative cash cost reductions in the annual bonus scorecard, has been very strong. Adjusted free cash flow performance of $25.8 billion was above our stretch target even after targets had been adjusted upwards to reflect the actual price environment, ensuring that the executives do not benefit from higher prices.\n\nSimilarly, cumulative cash cost reductions, by the end of 2022 compared to the 2019 baseline, of $3.2 billion were above the scorecard target, delivering our cost reduction target a year ahead of plan.\n\nTaking performance against these measures into account, the outcome for the bonus plan was a score of 1.56 out of 2.0 for the CFO, or 78% of maximum, and 1.51 out of 2.0 for the CEO, or 75.5% of maximum.\n\n## Long-term performance\n\nUnder the remuneration policy that shareholders approved in 2020, a material portion of Bernard and Murray's remuneration is tied to longer-term performance under a performance share plan designed to drive strong alignment to the execution of bp's strategy.\n\nThe 2020-22 performance share awards were measured against a three-part scorecard:\n\n- \u00b7 Relative total shareholder return (rTSR) against seven industry peers.\n- \u00b7 Return on average capital employed (ROACE) .\n- \u00b7 Strategic progress.\n\nWhile absolute TSR growth was a great improvement over the prior year, bp delivered disappointing rTSR performance over the 2020-22 period, placing sixth out of eight industry peers. This resulted in nil vesting for this element of the scorecard. This outcome should be read in the context of a newlylaunched strategy. At the point of making the 2020-22 grants to the executive directors just months after the strategy launch, it was evident that investor confidence in that strategy, as demonstrated in our rTSR performance, would take time to build and be dependent on progressive execution and delivery over many\n\nyears. While a disappointing rTSR performance, this expectation has proved to be correct. Conversely, ROACE performance of 13.4% over the period was above our stretch target, reflective of strong progress over the three years culminating in a 30.5% return in 2022, which was a very strong result regardless of the price environment. The committee's view of strategic progress, as measured against three distinct aspects of our strategy - resilient hydrocarbons, convenience and mobility and low carbon energy - was very strong and resulted in maximum vesting. This element of the scorecard is a mixture of quantitative assessment and qualitative judgement, which we expand on in more detail on page 123 of the report.\n\nTaking performance against these measures into account, the formulaic outcome under the performance share plan was 60% of maximum. However, as we said we would do when making these awards in 2020, the committee also paid great attention to review the basis on which these awards were granted, at a time when the share price was materially lower than historical norms. Ultimately, the committee decided that despite this strong improvement over three years, an adjustment should be made to the vesting outcome of the 2020-22 awards.\n\nAfter much discussion and consultation, we arrived at an adjustment which, when coupled with a disappointing formulaic vesting outcome, leads to what we consider to be an appropriately modest level of vesting. We took the decision to exercise our discretion and to revise downwards the level of vesting to 54% of maximum.\n\nWe provide additional detail on this adjustment and the rationale behind it on page 124.\n\n## Decisions in the context of the wider workforce\n\nDecisions regarding the executive directors' base salary increases and incentive outcomes were made paying careful attention to the level of awards for the wider bp workforce.\n\nIn practice, in 2022 the committee used its discretion to reduce outcomes for the CEO under the annual bonus and the CEO and CFO under the performance share plan, while mostly maintaining formulaic outcomes for the wider workforce.\n\nEmployees in the wider workforce participating in the annual cash bonus plan received a score of 1.62 compared with 1.51 and 1.56 for Bernard and Murray respectively. Other senior leaders who participated in the 2020-22 performance share plan received the full formulaic outcome of 60%.",

        "page_content": "Our approach to the annual pay review for the wider workforce was also modified this year, responding to the unprecedented pressure on our employees due to the rising cost of living. Firstly, bp made a cash payment to most of bp's retail forecourt employees globally, equivalent to 8%, or one month's salary locally. The payment is being made in equal parts across the winter period. Secondly, all salaried employees (excluding retail forecourt employees) below the senior leadership team worldwide received a one-off payment in December, differentiated by geography and ranging from 4% to 8% of salary - a move which was welcomed by our people. Finally, all salaried employees will be eligible for a base pay adjustment effective 1 April 2023. We have set salary budgets this year that are reflective of the market environment in each country. In many cases these are higher than last year, reflecting the impact inflation is having on wages. For more information on remuneration and support for the wider workforce, see page 117.\n\nIn this context, the committee determined that Bernard would receive a base salary increase of 4% in 2023, lower than the wider UK workforce average, despite the outsized impact he has had on bp and his exemplary leadership during a very tough period. Murray will receive an increase of 5.5% in 2023 in line with the wider UK workforce average. In the view of the committee, Murray's contribution and impact as a CFO internally and externally, has grown rapidly since his appointment and we will continue to review his base salary in line with market expectations, his performance and his responsibilities in the role, but mindful of the wider workforce pay.\n\n## Refreshing our executive remuneration policy for 2023\n\nThe committee believes that the current policy, approved by 96.6% of shareholders in 2020, has operated as intended and can generally be retained and serve as the basis for the 2023 policy. As part of the policy review, the committee completed an extensive programme of shareholder engagement to ensure their views were reflected in the new policy.\n\nI would like to thank shareholders for their highly valued time, energy and feedback during this period. I outline a summary of the key changes here, and the full policy is on page 132.\n\n## Performance measures for incentive plans\n\nWe are proposing to fine-tune the performance measures that apply for the upcoming year and three-year performance periods to better align with bp's strategy; these changes do not\n\nrepresent a deviation from the current policy, as the existing policy already allows the committee to choose specific measures and relative weightings.\n\nFor the purposes of the annual bonus we propose to introduce a profit measure (adjusted EBITDA ) under the financials category, in place of cumulative cash cost reductions to reflect our strategic progress on costs and forwardlooking focus on earnings.\n\nFor our performance share plan (2023-25), we propose the introduction of one new emissions measure, to incentivize progress towards our aim 1 net zero operations. We will retain rTSR, ROACE, adjusted EBIDA per share CAGR and strategic progress. Having complementary emissions reduction measures in both the short and long-term plans ensures that annual delivery supports longer-term plans, as set out in our net zero ambitions under aim 1. For a summary of proposed measures and targets under both plans, see page 130.\n\n## Annual bonus deferral\n\nUnder our 2020 policy, the annual bonus has been paid 50% in cash, with 50% deferred into restricted share units that are subject to a three-year restricted period. This deferral has been an important way of increasing the executives' personal shareholdings and satisfying the already high bar we have set through our minimum shareholding requirement (MSR).\n\nIn our deliberations for 2023 we have recognized that the shareholdings of our executive directors can build quickly and, given that neither the committee nor the executives themselves expect them to sell shares while in office, the result is a high portfolio concentration exposure. Since our control mechanism for ensuring alignment with shareholders' interests is the MSR itself, we have concluded that once the MSR is met, the deferral rate should reduce. Thus, the 2023 policy has been updated to require a deferral rate of 33% once an executive has met bp's high minimum shareholding requirement threshold (5x salary for the CEO and 4.5x salary for the CFO). As on 17 February 2023 both the CEO and CFO have met the MSR requirement therefore, subject to shareholder approval, the 2023 policy will apply to 2022 bonus outcomes.\n\nOperationally robust and effective malus and clawback provisions remain in place and the committee is comfortable that sufficient shareholdings will be built under the new policy to apply these provisions to their fullest extent if necessary. For more detail see the policy report on page 131.\n\n## Retirement benefits\n\nIn 2021, as part of a holistic review and modernization of the UK reward package for the wider workforce, the UK defined benefits pension plan was closed and all remaining participants were entitled to a single contributory plan. This aligns to legacy defined benefit plan participants that received a cash allowance, which is being stepped down in value from 35% (in July 2021) to 20% (in April 2023). Except for the executive directors, all other participants had their cash allowance increased from 15% to 20%. Thus, the majority of the UK workforce (~62%) now receives a 20% cash allowance.\n\nThe 2020 policy sets the executive director benefit to be in line with the wider workforce, and therefore the current level for the executives is 15% of salary, which was in line with the wider UK workforce level at their appointment. We are proposing to amend our 2023 policy and adjust the cash allowance to 20% of salary, to match the arrangements now in place for the majority of the wider UK workforce.\n\nRecognizing the impact the increased pension allowance could have in absolute terms, and considering the overall remuneration package, the committee has decided to retain Bernard's pension allowance at 15% for 2023. The committee will bring the allowance into line with that of the wider workforce in 2024.\n\nAs you read this DRR, we hope you will appreciate the expanded focus on our underlying rationale, and how our stewardship is directed at both the executive directors and the wider workforce. We need all bp employees to feel fairly rewarded and we continue to do our utmost to show our appreciation to them within the context of the policies shareholders have previously approved.\n\nOn behalf of the committee, I hope you will agree that our judgements are a sensible approach to rewarding difficult jobs well-done in this several year period.\n\n## Paula Rosput Reynolds\n\nChair of the remuneration committee 10 March 2023\n\nIn this directors' remuneration report, underlying replacement cost profit, net debt, margin share from convenience and electrification, adjusted free cash flow, cumulative cash cost reductions, ROACE, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBIDA per share CAGR and organic capital expenditure are non-GAAP measures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThese measures are defined in the glossary on page 389 .",

In 2023, the proposed increase for our CEO is 4%, below that of  the wider UK workforce, and for our CFO is 5.5%, which is equal  to the average increase received by employees in the UK.

The average pay increase in the                                        | are effective after the 2023 annual general meeting (AGM).  Senior leaders, including the executive directors, were not  eligible for the December 2022 cash lump sum payment that the  wider workforce benefited from.                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Pensions and  benefits | We operate different pension plans by location and for those  parts of our business where market practice is markedly  different, e.g. our retail business. For our population of non-retail employees in the UK, covering  62% of the UK workforce, we provide a flexible cash benefits  allowance of 20% of salary.                                           | Following a review of reward for the UK workforce in 2021, the  flexible benefits allowance was increased to 20% of salary (in  parallel with the removal of future accruals for members of the  UK defined benefit pension plan). Following our principle to align  the executive directors' benefits with those provided to the wider  workforce, our 2023 policy therefore includes the same benefits |\n| Performance  shares    | our trading business. We operate share plans with three-year vesting for all our senior  leaders. Opportunity varies across two broad tiers: group leaders  (approximately 300) and senior-level leaders (approximately  4,000). Vesting is subject to bp performance outcomes for the  group leader population only - aligned to the executive directors.      | Performance shares for our executive directors have been  assessed using the same bp performance scorecard as is   used for the group leader performance shares. Executive directors share awards are subject to an additional  three-year holding period post vesting.

Murray Auchincloss's salary increased by 6.6% from \u00a3750,000 to \u00a3800,000 from the 2022 annual general meeting. Both the executive directors receive car-related benefits, coverage of tax return preparation, security assistance, health and life insurance and medical benefits. Changes in the healthcare benefits provided to the executive directors, as approved by the committee, and in the case of Bernard Looney professional advice provided to him in the course of his duties, are the primary drivers for the increase in the value of taxable benefits compared with 2021.\n\n## Cash in lieu of retirement benefits\n\nFrom their appointments as executive directors in 2020, Bernard and Murray ceased to receive any retirement benefits for their service and were aligned to the 15% cash allowance in lieu of benefit rate which applied to the majority of the wider UK workforce at that time. This is the rate that applied during 2022.",

The committee's review of safety performance is detailed on page 121 and in the safety and sustainability committee (S&SC) report on page 110.\n\nSustainable emissions reductions (SER) of 7.065mte cumulative (2022 vs. 2017) was more than target for the third year running and reflective of strong progress against our aim 1 milestones. At the start of the year bp identified opportunities for emission reductions, based on planned activity totalling only 635kt in 2022. However, an SER target of 1.3Mt was set, based on previous year delivery (1.2Mt) presenting a significant stretch\n\nfor bp. We have continued to embed a net zero mindset and ownership of emissions performance across the operating entities. This approach allowed our sites to review existing activity sets and identify projects with SER potential that were not in existing plans, e.g. Tangguh steam heat recovery project (86kt). Other key contributions across bp's portfolio, included the Gelsenkirchen refinery and chemicals and Rotterdam and Cherry Point refineries switching to low carbon power (662kt) and bpx energy projects including electrification, vapour recovery in Eagle Ford and centralized processing at Grand Slam (351kt).",

        "page_content": "Reliability and availability is a measure of bp-operated upstream plant reliability and bp-operated refining availability. bp-operated upstream plant reliability strengthened year-on-year to 96.0% (94% in 2021), a historical record. bp-operated refining availability was below the target outcome at 94.5%. It was impacted by an increase in maintenance activity.\n\nMargin share from convenience and electrification was below target with performance heavily influenced by adverse foreign exchange impacts and the volatility of bp's fuel sales margin, driven by the macroeconomic environment.\n\nFinancial performance, as measured by adjusted free cash flow and cumulative cash cost reductions , was very strong. bp generated adjusted free cash flow of $25.8 billion, which resulted in the maximum outcome. Our targets are environment-adjusted at year end and the revised target was \u00a324.7 billion. This result also excludes any cash flow from our stake in Rosneft. Cumulative cash cost reductions of $3.2 billion reflected continued discipline in cost management within our financial frame against a target of $3.0 billion.\n\nThe formulaic score for the 2022 annual bonus was 1.55 out of 2.00 (77.5% of maximum).\n\nWe took input from the audit committee and S&SC to ensure our conclusions were robust and reflected underlying and sustained performance. This included a detailed review of safety performance and how we are trending over time. We also noted the upwards adjustments made to the adjusted free cash flow targets to remove the impact of the external price environment, focusing on underlying performance (avoiding unintended gains or losses).\n\n## A focus on safety\n\nWe are deeply saddened by the loss of four colleagues in 2022. These losses are devastating for the families and our thoughts are with them. They have a profound impact on our organization and the communities in which we operate. For more detail on these incidents, our response and our safety performance, see page 65.\n\nThe remuneration committee seeks input from the S&SC on safety performance each year, both relative to the annual bonus scorecard, and underlying performance beyond the formal measures we link to remuneration.\n\nAlongside the S&SC, we have considered these tragic events and our underlying safety performance to agree the extent to which a discretionary adjustment should be applied to incentive outcomes. To be clear, there is no value that we would associate with a loss of human life and therefore we do not operate a formulaic policy in such situations.\n\nThe committee takes the view - shared by bp's leadership - that at bp safety comes first and thus avoiding workplace safety incidents must be the top priority. As such, the committee has applied downward\n\nAs part of the committee's holistic review of performance, it was identified that the formulaic outcome for the margin share from convenience and electrification measure was not reflective of underlying performance. Performance was negatively impacted by foreign exchange rate volatility (strengthening of the US dollar) which was not in the executives' control. The committee has therefore adjusted the target to reflect the actual (not plan) foreign exchange rate environment. This resulted in the formulaic score increasing by one point, from 1.55 to 1.56 for all participants. Performance under this measure was also impacted by the volatility of margins from fuel sales in 2022 compared with historical norms over the past five years. The committee determined that, for the wider workforce only, a further discretionary adjustment should be made to reflect the historic norms as intended by the committee at the point targets were set. The result of this adjustment is an increase in the formulaic score by six points, to 1.62 out of 2.00 (81% of maximum) for the wider workforce. The adjustment will not apply to the CEO and CFO.\n\nThe formulaic score for safety in the bonus scorecard is an outcome of process safety tier 1 and tier 2 events. In determining the overall bonus score the committee can apply judgement based on other factors such as fatalities and safety culture.\n\nSo, while underlying safety performance was strong, as measured by process safety tier 1 and tier 2 events, we tragically lost four colleagues during the year. The committee, alongside the S&SC, considered these events (see 'A focus on safety' below) and resolved to apply a downward adjustment to the annual bonus for the CEO and cascade this through the relevant members of the bp leadership team. The resulting score for the CEO has therefore been reduced from 1.56 to 1.51 (75.5% of maximum).\n\ndiscretion on the outcome for the CEO and relevant members of management for the associated business units. The resulting score for the CEO has therefore been reduced from 1.56 to 1.51.\n\nThe committee also reviews underlying safety performance as part of its holistic review of incentive outcomes. Safety performance in 2022 was strong, relative to the metrics we set at the start of the year - tier 1 and 2 process safety events. We recorded 50 events this year, a record low (2021 62). However, within this metric tier 1 events - the most serious - increased from 16 in 2021 to 17 in 2022. Two of the four fatalities impacted the number of tier 1 events. The committee determined that a further reduction for the same incidents was not appropriate beyond that already described above.\n\nTo improve the focus on process safety tier 1 events, the committee, with input from the S&SC, has decided to modify how we measure safety for the 2023 annual bonus scorecard so that both tier 1 and tier 2 events are measured independently, rather than as a combined metric. The greater focus on tier 1 delivery aligns with our goal to eliminate tier 1 events.",

        "page_content": "## Strategic progress\n\nStrategic progress is determined using a balance of quantitative assessment and qualitative judgement against bp's three strategic pillars; to deliver value through a resilient hydrocarbon business; to demonstrate track record, scale and value in low carbon energy, and; to accelerate growth in convenience and mobility. Following our review of achievements and progress towards bp's 2025 targets, the committee determined that bp's strategic progress over the 2020-22 period was fully on track. We therefore determined that maximum vesting under this measure of the 2020-22 scorecard is justified. The paragraphs below describe the qualitative and quantitative factors that led us to our determination.\n\n## Deliver value through a resilient hydrocarbon business\n\n| Measure                                     |   2020 |   2021 |   2022 | 2025  targets   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|-----------------|\n| Upstream unit production  costs ($/boe)     |   6.39 |   6.82 |   6.07 | ~6              |\n| bp-operated upstream  plant reliability (%) |  94    |  94    |  96    | 96              |\n| bp-operated refining  availability  (%)     |  96    |  94.8  |  94.5  | ~96             |\n\nUpstream production costs per barrel have now fallen from $6.8/boe (2019) to $6.1/boe over this cycle, placing bp well-ahead of the $6/boe target by 2025. Also, upstream plant reliability reached 96% in 2022 - a record outcome that already meets the 2025 target. While ahead on these two indicators, refining availability is lower in the period, with the 2022 result of 94.5% reflecting an increase in maintenance activity. Business improvement plans remain in place to meet the target of around 96% by 2025.\n\nbp continues to high-grade its portfolio, converting and consolidating the existing asset base. Great progress was made in 2022 with the Azule Energy JV in Angola, Iraq IJV, Sunrise divestment, Algeria and Toledo divestments announced. There are opportunities for refinery conversion or consolidation with five major projects announced, including the conversion of Kwinana to an Energy Hub. bp signed 30-year productionsharing contracts with the Indonesian government, paving the way for exploration activities in the Agung I and II offshore gas blocks and the Gulf of Mexico Herschel expansion project started up ahead of schedule and with no safety incidents. Overall, we find bp's hydrocarbon business has delivered significant value over the cycle, particularly in 2022, and is well-positioned to meet the targets set for 2025.\n\n## Demonstrate track record, scale and value in low carbon energy\n\n| Measure                                                  |   2020 |   2021 |   2022 |   2025  targets |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|-----------------|\n| Developed renewables to  final investment decision  (GW) |    3.3 |    4.4 |    5.8 |              20 |\n| Biofuels production (kb/d)                               |   30   |   26   |   27   |              50 |\n| LNG portfolio (Mtpa)                                     |   20   |   18   |   19   |              25 |\n\nbp has made strong progress over the first three years in the strategic pillar of low carbon energy focusing on hydrogen and renewables & power transition growth engines. In renewables and power bp has more than doubled since the end of 2019 renewables to FID and delivered a pipeline of renewable projects of 37GW bp net by the end of 2022. bp's share in LSbp has grown from 8GW in 2020 to 14GW in 2022 with LSbp expanding its presence to 19 countries. bp has established presence in UK and US\n\noffshore wind with 5GW pipeline, added 10GW renewable projects pipeline in support of hydrogen export hubs and acquired 7GW US solar projects pipeline. In hydrogen bp is in action building regional hubs in the UK, US and Europe and global export hubs in advantaged geographies like MENA and Asia Pacific. bp pipeline of hydrogen projects in concept development reached 1.8Mtpa bp net by end 2022.\n\nBioenergy, one of five strategic transition growth engines that bp intends to grow rapidly through this decade, is progressing well, especially with the recent acquisition of Archaea Energy, which is a leading US provider of renewable natural gas (RNG), building out our existing biogas business and helping us expand into the fast-growing US biogas market. Two new bioenergy measures were introduced in 2021; biofuels production and biogas supply. Against 2025 targets bp is on track with strong progress in 2022.\n\nIn LNG, bp began lifting cargoes from Mozambique under a long-term agreement to purchase 100% of output from the Coral Sul facility which has capacity to produce 3.4 million tonnes of LNG per year. bp's LNG portfolio is strong, with significant commitments in place for future projects, lending confidence that the company is on track to deliver 25Mtpa by 2025.\n\n## Accelerate growth in convenience and mobility\n\n| Measure                                                 | 2020   | 2021   | 2022    | 2025  targets   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------|-----------------|\n| Electric vehicle charge  points                         | 10,100 | 13,100 | ~22,000 | >40,000         |\n| Strategic convenience  sites                            | 1,900  | 2,150  | 2,400   | ~3,000          |\n| Margin share from  convenience and  electrification (%) | 2 7.6  | 29.1   | 28.5    | ~35             |\n\nIn convenience and mobility bp continues to make strong strategic progress. A new global convenience partnership was signed with Uber and bp are aiming to make around 3,000 retail locations available on Uber Eats by 2025. A new supply contract and brand partnership was signed with Julius Stiglechner GmbH, in Austria, establishing the bp brand in nearly 160 stores. In Air bp a strategic collaboration agreement was signed with DHL Express to supply sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) until 2026, and a SAF supply contract with Rolls-Royce in the UK and Germany.\n\nIn March 2022, bp announced plans to invest up to \u00a31 billion over the next 10 years to support the roll-out of fast, convenient charging infrastructure across the UK and to nearly triple our number of UK public charge points. Further progress has been evidenced by a new exclusive agreement in the UK with M&S to install fast charge points in around 70 of their stores; expansion of the strategic partnership with REWE in Germany to include the installation of fast a charge points at up to 180 of their sites; and building momentum in fleet business with plans to establish a bp pulse Gigahub network - a series of large, EV fast charging hubs designed to serve ride-hail and taxi fleets, near US airports and high-demand locations and we're collaborating with Hertz in the US, with plans to install and manage a national network of EV charging solutions, powered by bp pulse. Amply Power, acquired in 2021 (now rebranded as bp pulse), is working towards installing charging infrastructure at 25 Hertz rental locations in several states across the US.\n\nThe 2022 result on margin share from convenience and electrification has been impacted by fuels sales margin volatility and foreign exchange impacts, even though underlying progress in convenience and electrification has been strong. Looking forward, bp will simplify this measure to track growth in convenience and electrification gross margin.",

The underpin broadens our performance assessment, allowing us to consider vesting outcomes with overall alignment to absolute shareholder returns, environmental and safety factors and progress in low carbon and climate change matters. Where relevant, we take input from the safety and sustainability committee and the audit committee to deepen and enhance our perspective.\n\nBeyond the discretion applied to account for the low grant price in 2020, the committee concluded that there was no reason to apply a further discretionary adjustment and therefore the plan should vest at 54% of maximum.

This grant price represented a material reduction (-41%) from the prior year's grant price of \u00a35.33. Consequently, the CEO received a grant of ~2,000,000 shares in August 2020 (grant price of \u00a33.13) compared with a grant of ~1,200,000 shares he would have received in 2019 at a grant price of \u00a35.33 - both awards equated to the same relative value at grant (5x salary), as defined by the 2020 policy. The committee's decision at the point of grant was to defer consideration of this impact until the point of vesting.\n\nThe context of this decision is important - firstly, in February 2020, Bernard announced a significant change in strategic direction of the company followed by a major restructuring including a material reduction in our workforce. Secondly, as these changes were being absorbed, the world was confronted with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting impact on stock markets. Finally, in line with our 2020 policy, we were to price and award our 2020 grant based on the 90-day average share price prior to the date of the AGM in May a policy change driven by shareholder guidance that our earlier methodology of adopting the average Q4 share price of the year prior and awarding shares in March, required a change. In May 2020, given continuing volatility of stock markets the committee determined to delay the grant by a further three months to August to allow for the share price to stabilize. In August 2020 the committee noted that while prices were at historic lows, there was no line of sight to return to the pre-2020 pricing levels. As evidence of the volatile conditions, the share price dipped even further to its lowest level of the period to \u00a31.92 in October 2020.\n\nFor the two executive directors, the 2020 EDIP grant was the first grant they would receive as newly appointed executive directors. At this point they were facing the unprecedented challenge of running the company with a new purpose and strategy while managing great economic uncertainty driven by a pandemic with no end in sight. We conferred with shareholders at the time and the majority were sympathetic to our\n\ndilemma and reluctance to reduce the grant size. However, in the circumstance, we agreed that we would determine a fair and appropriate outcome three years hence and potentially use discretion as to how many shares would ultimately vest.\n\n## Assessment of the 'gain' by executives\n\nThe 2020 grant used a price of \u00a33.13 as the basis for determining the number of shares awarded. This could be compared with a range of prices to determine the theoretical 'gain' between the award price and the share price at vesting. bp's share price over the previous five years ranged from \u00a33.10 to \u00a35.98 resulting in quite different conclusions on the amount of any 'gain'. In the event, the committee determined to select the 2019-21 EDIP grant price of \u00a35.33, this being the highest price over the period since the 2019 award was made from which to assess the extent of any 'gain'.\n\nApplying this price, the 'gain' received by the CEO between the two awards was calculated as ~800,000 shares (~2,000,000 awarded in 2020 at a price of \u00a33.13 vs. ~1,200,000 that would have been awarded under the 2019 grant price of \u00a35.33). This formed the basis of the committee's determination for a discretionary downwards adjustment.\n\n## The committee's perspective\n\nIn considering a fair and appropriate adjustment the committee debated a number of factors including: our overarching policy and principles, the history of bp's share price movement before and after 2020, our relative share price performance vs our peers and other reward outcomes of 2020, as outlined below.\n\n## Consistent application of policy and principles\n\nOur consistent approach over many years has been to accept volatility as a natural aspect of share awards - we have neither adjusted up, or down, vesting outcomes based on share price volatility.",

        "page_content": "## Share price history\n\nThe fall, and subsequent recovery of the share price was not immediate and was driven by many converging factors; demand recovery, excellent pandemic and post-pandemic leadership, and a greater belief of the market in bp's strategy.\n\nIn particular, the share price remained at or below \u00a33.13 (the price used to determine the grant) until September 2021 and was within 10% of the grant price until the end of December 2021, demonstrating that the price used to determine the grant was not a short term low point.\n\nAdditionally, the average share price over the three financial years 2020-22 was \u00a33.48.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- a Grant prices are calculated as a share price average over a defined period. Positioning on the chart is illustrative.\n\n## Relative performance\n\nThe committee is mindful that bp experienced a slower recovery than many of our peers. This is measured in the performance share plan scorecard using relative total shareholder return (rTSR). Under the 2020-22 cycle this returned a nil vesting outcome. The committee is comfortable therefore that the poor relative performance has been tested and reflected appropriately in the outcome.\n\n## Alignment with our strategy and investor proposition\n\nbp's strategy has been, and remains, the primary driver of our remuneration policy. Each year the committee aims to set a remuneration structure for the executive directors that supports and incentivizes progress against our strategy. In a policy review year this becomes ever more important as it allows the committee a reflection point to assess whether the remuneration structures we have in place are fit-for-purpose, provide the flexibility needed for a transitioning company, and create the right alignment with the strategy and shareholder experience.\n\nAs discussed in detail throughout the strategic report (see page 4), we are leaning further into our strategy, investing in our transition and to accelerate the energy transition. bp is also investing more into today's oil and gas system. In light of this evolution, the committee believes the fundamental structure of remuneration for our senior leaders is appropriate - we are not proposing material changes to the 2020 policy because it provides the platform to meet our needs across three areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Creates alignment of strategy, performance and shareholder experience with reward outcomes.\n\n## Other reward outcomes for CEO and workforce in 2020\n\n- \u00b7 No bonus was paid for 2020 -worth ~\u00a31.5 million at target.\n- \u00b7 Performance shares granted in 2018 and vesting in 2020 experienced a 'windfall loss' of -46%.\n- \u00b7 All employees received shares/options in 2021 under the bp reinvent plan - the CEO and CFO were excluded.\n\nFinally, we are strongly of the view that executives should be aligned to the shareholder experience and that fluctuations in the share price are a function of share plan mechanics. The release of the 2020 award, and therefore the true value delivered to executives, will not occur until six years post-grant (a three-year performance period plus a three-year holding period) i.e. Q1 2026 at the earliest. This is further extended by the committee's expectation that executives will not sell shares until two years post-retirement (the point at which our minimum shareholding requirement policy ends).\n\n## The committee's decision\n\nUltimately, application of discretion in this type of scenario is complex. The committee has sought feedback during our engagement with shareholders and representatives of the primary proxy voting agencies. Our conclusion is that an adjustment to the vesting outcome is appropriate but must be fair, taking into account all of the above factors.\n\nThe formulaic performance-based vesting for the 2020-22 award is 60%. The 40% lost on account of performance is due to the rTSR measure. Given all of the considerations listed above, we propose a 25% reduction of the 'gain' of ~800,000 shares received by the CEO in 2020. This translates to 200,000 shares, which is 10% of the initial grant of 2,000,000 shares.\n\nApplying this 10% adjustment to the vesting outcome of 60% for the 2020-22 award results in a final vesting of 54% of maximum or a reduction of -\u00a3667,497 for the CEO.\n\nWe view this adjustment as discretionary in the extreme. While we believe the above factors are relevant, we do not intend that this reduction calculation should become embedded in policy. We will continue to use our discretion as we address the unique circumstances that surround share price variations that have been pervasive since March 2020.\n\nThe committee has also determined that no deduction will be applied to shares granted to the wider workforce.\n\n- \u00b7 Allows flexibility for the committee to apply judgement and discretion through the energy transition and in volatile economic conditions.\n- \u00b7 Provides a robust framework with which to track and measure performance and strategic progress.\n\nThe implementation of our policy is where the committee's focus has been, to ensure alignment of strategy, performance and the shareholder experience. Aligning pay outcomes with results delivered for shareholders is among the most important tasks that the committee undertakes. Our commitment remains to oversee this alignment with care, and to explain the basis for the judgements we make.\n\n## Alignment of strategy and remuneration\n\nEach year the committee will agree the performance framework for senior leadership, as set out in the performance scorecards under the annual bonus and performance share plan (see page 130 for 2023 scorecards). This involves a combination of performance measures, a frame for judgement to be applied through formal underpins, and the flexibility to make discretionary adjustments where the need arises.",

Safety and sustainability is a key thread that runs through all of our incentive arrangements either by formal measure or underpin.\n- \u00b7 Operational - a focus on operational delivery and returns that underpins sustainable financial success, which is critically important as we progress through the transition to an integrated energy company.\n- \u00b7 Financial - a headline performance indicator and a key measure of success by our shareholders. Commercial delivery within our financial frame will remain of primary importance.\n- \u00b7 Strategic - perhaps the most important aspect for strategic alignment, we have built into our remuneration structure a performance lens which focuses on ongoing multi-year progress against the three pillars of our strategy, beyond the headline measures of financial and operational performance.\n\nFor our senior leaders, remuneration measures under each of the categories balance delivery against our financial frame, investor proposition, and with our core value of safety. Our measures and weightings across annual bonus and performance share plans have evolved over time to balance a clear direction across performance cycles with the evolving nature of the transition.\n\n## Alignment of 2023 variable remuneration with strategy\n\n## Our ambition: Net zero by 2050 or sooner\n\n- Adjusted free cash flow 25% weighting\n- Earnings (adjusted EBITDA) 25% weighting\n\n## Key\n\n- Annual cash bonus performance measure Applies to the entire workforce that participates in the annual cash bonus plan\n- Performance share plan performance measure Applies to executive directors and senior leaders only\n- Tier 1 & 2 process safety events\n\n15% weighting\n\n- Sustainable emissions reductions 15% weighting\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financial frame and investor proposition\n\n- bp-operated reliability and availability 10% weighting\n- Convenience and EV gross margin growth 10% weighting\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- a Bioenergy includes customer-facing and midstream biofuels activities that form part of convenience and mobility.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDeliver value through a resilient hydrocarbon business\n\nAccelerate growth in convenience and mobility\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDemonstrate track record, scale and value in low carbon electricity and energy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Aim 1: Net zero cross our entire operations by 2050 15% weighting\n- ROACE\n\n20% weighting\n\n- EBIDA per share CAGR (adjusted)\n- 20% weighting\n- Relative total shareholder return (rTSR) 20% weighting\n- Strategic progress 25% weighting",

and 2020 annual reports.\n- b Share price for the CEO share plan vesting has been based on the average share price over the fourth quarter of 2022 of \u00a34.73.\n\nThis is our fourth year reporting the CEO pay ratio following the requirements introduced in 2018. As per the past three years, we have selected Option A as our reporting basis, being the most accurate approach available, and we confirm that no broadly applicable components of pay have been omitted. Where necessary, full-time equivalent pay has been calculated by simple engrossment of part-year values. Employee values relate to pay and benefits for the year ended 31 December 2022.\n\nChanges in pay ratio over time reflect the fact that CEO remuneration is more heavily weighted to variable pay, resulting in larger year-on-year swings than wider workforce pay. This is evidenced by the variability of the CEO pay ratio over the past four years. This volatility in the pay ratio reporting from year to year is expected, and illustrates one of the challenges in commenting on whether pay differentials are appropriate. In 2022 the 50th percentile pay ratio increased from 87:1 to 172:1. This was driven by higher variable pay outcomes for the CEO. Notably this was the first year in which the executive director incentive plan (EDIP) vested for the CEO, being three years since the first grant was made in 2020. It is the view of the committee that the remuneration frameworks we have in place for the executive directors and the wider workforce are fit-for-purpose and deliver pay outcomes appropriate to the circumstance of the year, with differentials that reflect the relative contributions made at different levels in our organization.\n\nThe committee is satisfied that the median pay ratio reported this year is consistent with bp's pay policies for employees and does not constitute a reason to modify our pay programmes.",

This began with a constructive listening session in November 2022 with our shareholders and representatives from the main proxy advisory firms. The exercise was important in shaping our 2023 remuneration policy. We identified the following themes from our engagement:\n\n- \u00b7 Alignment of remuneration policy and outcomes to the shareholder experience remains important.\n- \u00b7 There is increasing importance placed on the wider workforce context and how decisions and policy are aligned to this frame.\n- \u00b7 ESG performance measures continue to play an important role in executive remuneration in both short- and long-term incentives.\n- \u00b7 Continued application of discretion and restraint on executive remuneration outcomes and decisions will be important, as will the effective disclosure and rationale behind the decisions taken.\n\nThe engagement enabled us to identify a clear direction for our future policy. Input was also received from the company chairman and management while ensuring that conflicts of interest were suitably mitigated, the committee's appointed independent advisors also advised throughout the process. We have concluded that the current policy, adopted in 2020, can generally be retained as the basis for the 2023 policy. Stability in the policy has the advantage of being well understood and accepted by shareholders, our executives and wider workforce. We have proposed two modest changes for 2023 - a reduced deferral rate under the annual bonus from 50% to 33%, which will apply only once an executive director has met the 'minimum shareholding requirement' threshold and, raising the CEO and CFO's cash in lieu of retirement benefits to align with the majority of the UK workforce. We have engaged with shareholders extensively on these changes to ensure their views have been represented.\n\n## Changes to the 2023 remuneration policy\n\n## Annual bonus deferral\n\nUnder our 2020 policy, any annual bonus earned is paid 50% in cash, with 50% deferred into restricted share units subject to a three-year restricted period. Typically, these deferred shares are held until employment ceases and beyond, pursuant to our post-employment shareholding policy; executives must seek permission from the remuneration committee to dispose of shares after the three-year restricted period. This deferral has been a clear source of increasing the executives' personal shareholdings and rapidly bringing them to conformance with the minimum shareholding requirement (MSR). Under the 2023 remuneration policy, we are proposing that the bonus deferral be rebalanced from 50% to one third (33%) of any bonus received subject to the achievement of MSR conformance.\n\nIn our deliberations we recognized that the structure of bp's equity plans lead to the executive director shareholdings building quickly and, given that the committee does not expect the executive directors to sell shares while in office, they have a particular portfolio concentration exposure. For context, our previous CEO had over 15 times the MSR at his point of separation from bp. Since our control mechanism for ensuring alignment with shareholder interests is the MSR itself, we have concluded that once the MSR is met, the deferral rate should reduce. Thus, the 2023 policy has been updated to require a deferral rate of 33% once the MSR threshold has been met. The deferral rate would remain at 50% until the MSR is met.",

        "page_content": "We have considered key aspects of this change that arose in our deliberations with shareholders including portfolio balance, shareholder experience, risk management and adherence to shareholder (and where appropriate, proxy agency) guidelines.\n\nMalus and clawback provisions enable us to continue to manage and mitigate the risk associated with the incentive programmes. We note that all our share plans include provisions for malus and clawback, and we consider that bp's triggers are already stricter than the current market standard of misconduct and misstatement. We include 'material failure impacting safety or environmental sustainability' as well as 'such other exceptional circumstances that the committee consider to be similar in nature'. The headline remuneration policy on malus and clawback is supported with more detailed operational policies to ensure enforceability. Application of malus is also simplified by the synthetic nature of the share awards which are held as performance share units or restricted share units (RSUs).\n\nThe reduced bonus deferral rate means that at any given time the CEO will hold, at target payout, around 110% of salary in the form of vested shares, rather than 169% of base salary at target at the current deferral rate. However, in the event that the committee were to seek to apply a larger penalty, our operational policy also allows malus to be applied against unvested performance shares, which amount to up to 15x salary (three years of 5x salary awards). Thus we do not envisage a scenario in which the reduced deferral rate leaves us unable to operate malus to the appropriate extent.\n\nWe will maintain our current MSR policy, which requires the CEO to hold shares to a value of five times salary and other executive directors four and a half times salary. This policy also includes a three year post vesting holding period and post-employment shareholding requirement to maintain this minimum holding for two years following cessation of employment.\n\nWe have reviewed shareholder guidelines and have ensured that our new policy is aligned with the current guidelines.\n\nThe committee has concluded that our CEO's shareholding is 123% of his MSR (6.13x base salary) and our CFO's is 130% (5.86x base salary) of his MSR as at 17 February 2023. Subject to the 2023 policy being approved at the AGM, 2022 bonus would be subject to the 33% deferral rate at the point of payment after the AGM for both the CEO and CFO.\n\nExecutive director shareholding compared to minimum shareholding requirements as at 17 February 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| MSR                  | 500%   |      |\n|----------------------|--------|------|\n| Current shareholding |        | 613% |\n| MSR                  | 450%   |      |\n| Current shareholding |        | 586% |\n\n## Executive director cash in lieu of retirement benefits\n\nIn the 2021 directors' remuneration report we signalled an intention to review the cash pension allowance for the two executive directors within the context of the wider remuneration policy. In making this decision, the committee considered bp's global pension landscape and the history of bp's pension provision in the UK.\n\nbp operates over 100 pensions schemes across 60 countries including defined benefit (DB), defined contribution (DC) and cash balance schemes. This leads to a complex landscape of plans representing its global wider workforce. Ensuring benefits are competitive while managing and transitioning legacy programmes can often result in multiple pension schemes within the same country and can lead to market competitive but differentiated distribution of reward between different employee groups. For example, bp also operates a retail business in the UK with c.6,800 bp-contracted employees. Pension arrangements for this group continue to follow competitive market practice.\n\nIn the UK prior to 2021, bp operated both a DB pension plan (closed to most new entrants since April 2010) and a DC pension plan. Under the DC plan, participants were provided a flexible cash allowance equal to 15% of salary which could be invested in pensions, other benefits or taken as cash. This created a significant variance in the value provided to employees between the DB and DC plans. In 2021, as part of a holistic review and modernization of the UK reward package, the UK DB plan was closed, and the primary pension scheme became a DC pension plan. To manage a smooth transition the legacy DB plan participants received a cash allowance which stepped down in value from 35% in 2021 to 20% in April 2023. To drive fairness, legacy DC plan participants had their flexible cash allowance increased from 15% to 20%. Thus effective 1 April 2023 the majority of the UK workforce (62% of employees) are now aligned and receive a 20% flexible cash allowance. It is a cash allowance and an employee may elect how this is allocated, they may invest some or all of this in the DC pension scheme, choose from a range of benefits or take it all in cash. The new pension offer brought greater fairness and equity through the alignment of employees in similar roles. The only two employees who did not participate in this arrangement and who did not receive an increase in their pension allowance were the executive directors, Bernard Looney and Murray Auchincloss.\n\nBefore Bernard's appointment as CEO in 2020, he was a member of the legacy DB plan with an annual pension value in excess of 25% of base salary. On appointment, he ceased to be a participant in the DB plan and was aligned to the wider workforce at that point with a then 15% cash allowance under the DC plan. Before Murray's appointment as CFO, he was a member of both DB and DC arrangements as a US employee. The value of these two pension benefits were in excess of 33% of base salary. On appointment, he ceased to be a participant in the two legacy US DB and DC schemes and was aligned with Bernard and the wider workforce in the UK with a 15% cash allowance under the UK DC plan.\n\nOur 2020 policy stated that pension contribution rates for the executive directors were limited to no more than the median allowance offered to the wider workforce in the UK (as a percentage of salary). At the time of Bernard and Murray's appointments, as stated above, this was 15% of base salary. As explained, it is now the case that the majority of the UK workforce receive a 20% of base salary flexible cash allowance. The committee feels it is appropriate to increase the maximum cash allowance permitted under the policy to 20% of base salary for Bernard and Murray. In 2023 the committee has determined to retain Bernard's allowance at 15% of salary. The committee will bring the allowance into line with that of the wider workforce in 2024.\n\nOur approach remains fully aligned to commitments under the UK Corporate Governance Code.",

New components and key changes from the 2020 policy\n\nWhile the structure of the 2020 policy has been retained, the committee highlights the following modest changes:\n\n- \u00b7 Introducing a reduced deferral rate for bp shares from 50% to 33% once an executive has met the MSR threshold. This will be applicable to the 2022 annual bonus, subject to approval at the AGM in April 2023.\n- \u00b7 Lifting both the CEO and CFO's cash in lieu of retirement benefits from 15% to 20% of salary aligning them to a majority of the wider UK workforce.\n\n## 2. How is variable pay linked to performance?\n\n| Annual bonus      | Bonus aligned with company performance     | <100% MSR a : 50% paid in cash; 50% in bp shares deferred for 3 years  >100% MSR a : 67% paid in cash: 33% in bp shares deferred for 3 years   |\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Performance bonus | Share award for meeting three-year targets | 6 years; 3 year performance period + 3 year holding period                                                                                     |\n| Share ownership   | Long-term shareholding                     | Built up over 5 years and maintained for  a further two years post-employment                                                                  |\n\n- a MSR: group chief executive to build a shareholding of at least five times salary, and other executive directors four and a half times salary, within five years of appointment.\n\nThe three elements described above provide a balance between focus on short-term, medium-term and long-term performance, while encouraging behaviours which are in the long-term interests of shareholders. The operation of variable pay is supported by a focus on stewardship. There is a requirement that the chief executive officer will build up a holding of five times salary, and other executive directors a holding of four and a half times salary, over a period of five years following appointment and maintain that level during employment and for a further two years post employment.\n\n## 3. How are performance measures linked to strategy?\n\nVariable pay is linked to performance measures designed to deliver the bp strategy. At the start of each year, the remuneration committee reviews the measures, targets and weightings to ensure they remain consistent with the priorities in the annual plan and the group strategy. For the annual bonus and performance shares, the approach to performance measurement is intended to provide a balance of measures to assess performance reflecting the global scale of the business, the unique characteristics of the energy sector, and progress in transitioning to an integrated energy company.",

        "page_content": "## 4. Our use of flexibility, judgement and discretion\n\nThe committee reviews bp's performance against specific measures and targets, and in doing so may make both quantitative and qualitative assessments of performance in reaching its decisions. This involves the application of judgement and discretion, in which the committee also seeks relevant input from the board's audit, safety and sustainability committees. Accordingly, the committee may decide to adjust the formulaic outcome derived from the relevant scorecards, either upwards or downwards, to reflect broader considerations. The committee continues to consider that the powers of flexibility, judgement and discretion are critical to the successful execution of the policy.\n\nIn framing the policy, the committee has taken care to ensure that these important powers continue to be available:\n\n- \u00b7 Sufficient flexibility to take account of future changes in the industry environment and in remuneration practice generally. This allows the committee to respond to changes in circumstances, for example in applying particular performance measures and/or weightings within the plans, or in broadening the comparator group for the relative returns measure, in order to evolve with the company's strategy, without the need for specific shareholder approval.\n- \u00b7 Power to exercise judgement in making a qualitative assessment in certain circumstances. A number of measures are used for annual or long-term incentive awards, many of which are numerical in nature and require a quantitative assessment of performance. Others may require a qualitative assessment, such as the strategic progress measures in the performance share plan.\n- \u00b7 Scope for the committee to exercise discretion, mainly where it is desirable to vary a formulaic outcome that would otherwise arise from the policy's implementation. The committee considers that the ability to exercise discretion, upwards or downwards, is important to ensure that a particular outcome is fair in light of the director's own performance, the company's overall performance and positioning under particular performance measures and outcomes for shareholders.\n\nThe committee may make minor amendments to the remuneration policy to aid its operation or implementation without seeking shareholder approvals (e.g. for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take account of a change in legislation).\n\nThe committee intends to provide appropriate disclosure on the use of flexibility, judgement and discretion so that shareholders can understand the basis for its decisions.\n\n## 5.

        "page_content": "## Recruitment policy\n\nThe committee expects any new executive director to be engaged on terms that are consistent with the policy. However it recognizes that it cannot anticipate circumstances in which any new executive director may be recruited. The committee may determine that it is in the interests of the company and shareholders to secure the services of a particular individual which may require it to take account of the terms of that individual's existing employment and/or their personal circumstances.\n\nAccordingly, the committee will ensure that:\n\n- \u00b7 The salary level of any new director is appropriate to their role and the competitive environment at the time of appointment. Where appropriate it may appoint an individual on a lower salary (relative to any previous incumbent), then gradually increase salary levels as the individual gains experience in the role.\n- \u00b7 Variable remuneration will be awarded within the parameters of the policy for current executive directors.\n- \u00b7 The committee may tailor the vesting criteria for initial incentive awards depending on the specific circumstances.\n- \u00b7 Where an existing employee is promoted to the board, the company may honour all existing contractual commitments including any outstanding share awards.\n- \u00b7 The committee would expect any new director to participate in the company pension and benefit schemes that are open to other employees (where appropriate referencing the candidate's home country).\n- \u00b7 Where an individual is relocating in order to take up the role, the company may provide certain one-off benefits such as reasonable relocation expenses, accommodation for a period following appointment, assistance with visa applications or other immigration issues and ongoing arrangements such as tax filing assistance, annual flights home and a housing/utilities allowance.\n- \u00b7 Where an individual would be forfeiting remuneration or employment terms in order to join the company, the committee may award appropriate compensation. The committee would require reasonable evidence of the nature and value of any forfeited arrangements and would, to the extent practicable, ensure any compensation was of comparable commercial value and capped as appropriate, considering the terms of the previous arrangement being forfeited (for example the form and structure of award, timeframe, performance criteria and likelihood of vesting). Where appropriate, the committee prefers to deliver buy-outs in the form of restricted shares in the company.\n\nIn making any decision on the remuneration of a new director, the committee would balance shareholder expectations, current best practice and the circumstances of any new director. It would strive not to pay more than is necessary to recruit the right candidate and would give full details in the next remuneration report.\n\n## Service contract\n\nBernard Looney's and Murray Auchincloss' service contracts are with BP p.l.c.\n\nEach executive director is entitled to retirement benefits as outlined on page 134.\n\nEach executive director is also entitled to the following contractual benefits:\n\n- \u00b7 If appropriate for security reasons, a company car and driver is provided for business and private use, with the company bearing all normal employment, servicing, insurance and running costs. Alternatively, where not required for security reasons, a cash allowance may be paid instead.\n- \u00b7 Medical and dental benefits, sick pay during periods of absence and assistance with the preparation of tax returns.\n- \u00b7 Indemnification in accordance with applicable law.\n- \u00b7 Participation in bonus or incentive arrangements at the committee's sole discretion.\n\nEach executive director may terminate their employment by giving 12 months' written notice. In this event, for business reasons, the employer may not necessarily hold the executive director to their full notice period.\n\nThe employer may lawfully terminate the executive director's employment in the following ways:\n\n- \u00b7 By giving the director 12 months' written notice.\n- \u00b7 Without compensation, in circumstances where the employer is entitled to terminate for cause, as defined for the purposes of their service contract.\n\nThe company may lawfully terminate employment by making a lump sum payment in lieu of notice equal to 12 months' salary, or by monthly instalments rather than as a lump sum.\n\nThe lawful termination mechanisms described above are without prejudice to the employer's ability in appropriate circumstances to terminate in breach of the notice period referred to above, and thereby to be liable for damages to the executive director.\n\nIn the event of termination by the company, each executive director may have an entitlement to compensation in respect of their statutory rights under employment protection legislation in the UK and potentially elsewhere. Where appropriate the company may also meet a director's reasonable legal expenses in connection with either their appointment or termination of their appointment.\n\nCopies of the executive directors' service contracts, along with the non-executive director appointment letters, are available for inspection at the registered office of BP p.l.c.",

The committee would also consider all relevant circumstances, including whether a contractual provision in the director's arrangements complied with best practice at the time of termination and the date the provision was agreed, as well as the performance of the director in certain respects.\n\nWhere appropriate, the committee may consider providing certain benefits relating to termination including the provision of outplacement support or reasonable costs associated with relocation back to an individual's home country. Should it become necessary to terminate an executive director's employment, and therefore to determine a termination payment, the committee's policy is as follows:\n\n| Termination payments   | The director's primary entitlement would be a termination  payment in respect of their service agreement, as set out  above. However the committee will consider mitigation to  reduce the termination payment where appropriate to do so,  taking into account the circumstances for leaving and the  terms of the agreement. Mitigation would not be applicable where a contractual  payment in lieu of notice is made.   | If the departing director is eligible for an early retirement  pension, the committee would consider, if relevant under  the terms of the appropriate plan, the extent of any actuarial  reduction that should be applied. UK directors who leave  in circumstances approved by the committee may have a  favourable actuarial reduction applied to their pensions  (which to date has been 3%). Departing directors who leave in  other circumstances may be subject to a greater reduction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                        | The committee would consider whether the director should  be entitled to an annual bonus in respect of the financial year  in which the termination occurs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Annual bonus Normally, any such bonus would be restricted to the  director's actual period of service in that financial year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|                        | Share awards will be treated in accordance with the relevant  plan rules.

If awards are  preserved, the award would normally continue until the  In deciding whether to exercise discretion to preserve EDIP  awards, the committee would also consider the proximity  of the award to its maturity date. To the extent that any such share award vests, the release  of those shares to the former director will be made  approximately one year after their date of termination (even if  they would have been subject to a longer holding period had  the executive remained in employment with bp). |\n\n## Remuneration in the wider group\n\nThe committee considers employment conditions in the bp group when establishing and implementing policy for executive directors to ensure the alignment of and context for principles and approach. In particular, the committee reviews the policy and makes decisions for the most senior leaders (the bp leadership team that reports to the CEO). Decisions regarding remuneration for employees outside the most senior leaders are the responsibility of the chief executive officer. The committee does not consult directly with employees when formulating the policy. However, feedback from employee focus groups and employee surveys, that are regularly reported to the board, provide views on a wide range of employee matters including pay.\n\nThe wider employee group participates in performance-based incentives. Throughout the group, salary and benefit levels are set in accordance with the prevailing relevant market conditions and practice in the countries in which employees are based. Differences between executive director pay policy and that of other employees reflect the senior position of the individuals, prevailing market conditions and corporate governance practices in respect of executive director remuneration. The key difference in policy for executive directors is that a greater proportion of total remuneration is delivered as performance-based incentives.",

The chair is not eligible for committee chairship and membership fees.\n\nAt the time the board last approved changes to fee levels, it was decided to align the fee review cycle with the wider workforce salary review process. In practice and as provided for under the 2020 policy, fee levels are therefore reviewed annually alongside the wider workforce salaries and any changes that are agreed are put into effect from 1 April each year. Taking all factors into consideration, the board agreed to implement a 4% increase to the base fee for its NEDs and for the senior independent director, marginally lower than for the wider UK workforce (5.5%). Oversight and determination of the fees payable to the chair falls to the remuneration committee, which agreed to align the percentage increase of the chair's fee with the other non-executive board members.\n\nFollowing board and remuneration committee approval, the remuneration arrangements for the chair and NEDs will be adjusted with effect from 1 April 2023 as per the below table.\n\n|                                                                               |   2023/24 fees \u00a3  thousand per  annum c |   2022 fees \u00a3  thousand per  annum |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Chair                                                                         |                                     817 |                                785 |\n| Senior independent director a                                                 |                                     167 |                                160 |\n| Board member                                                                  |                                     120 |                                115 |\n| Audit, remuneration and safety and sustainability committees chairship fees b |                                      35 |                                 35 |\n| Committee membership fee                                                      |                                      20 |                                 20 |\n\n## 2022 remuneration (audited)\n\nThe table below shows the fees paid and applicable benefits for the year ended 31 December 2022.

Further detail on the activities of the committee in 2022 is set out in the remuneration committee report on page 112.\n\nDuring 2022 Ben Mathews, who was employed by the company and reported to the chair of the board, acted as secretary to the remuneration committee.\n\nThe committee also received advice on various matters relating the remuneration of executive directors and senior management from Kerry Dryburgh, EVP people and culture and Ashok Pillai, SVP reward and wellbeing.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) continued to provide independent advice to the committee in 2022. PwC advice included, for example, support with remuneration benchmarking and updates on market practice. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consulting Group and, as such, operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration in the UK. The committee is satisfied that the advice received is objective and independent. The committee is comfortable that the PwC engagement partner and team who provides remuneration advice to the committee do not have connections with the company or its directors that may impair their independence.\n\nTotal fees or other charges (based on an hourly rate) for the provision of remuneration advice to the committee in 2022 (save in respect of legal advice) were \u00a3122,013 to PwC. Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP (Freshfields) provided legal advice on specific compliance matters to the Committee. PwC and Freshfields provide other advice in their respective areas to the group.\n\n## Considerations related to the Corporate Governance Code\n\nWhen setting the 2023 policy, the committee concluded that a scorecard-based approach to setting targets and measuring outcomes helps it to engage transparently with shareholders and the wider workforce on remuneration. Thus, bp continues to operate a simple, clear structure of market-aligned salary with annual and three-year performance-based incentives. Risks are managed through careful setting of performance measures and targets and the committee retains the exercise of its discretion in assessing outcomes. These are complemented with robust malus and clawback measures. Remuneration outcomes are predictable, as shown in the scenario charts of the 2023 policy, and proportional by virtue of the challenging performance levels required to achieve target pay outcomes. Through material weighting in measures related to safety, sustainability and strategy, as shown on page 126 , remuneration aligns closely with bp's culture, as expressed through our purpose and ambition.",

Service agreements for each executive director are available for inspection at the company's registered office. Each executive director's service contract contains a 12-month notice period.

All directors are subject to annual re-election by shareholders at the annual general meeting. Normally, NEDs will be encouraged to serve for up to nine years from their appointment in line with the provisions of the 2018 Code, subject to annual re-election.\n\n## External appointments\n\nThe board supports executive directors taking up appointments outside the company to broaden their knowledge and experience. Each executive director is permitted to retain any fee from their external appointments. Such external appointments are subject to agreement by the chair and reported to the board. Any external appointment must not conflict with a director's duties and commitments to bp.

In accordance with the recommendations of the Code, NEDs would not be expected to serve beyond nine years unless there are exceptional circumstances.\n\nOf the 10 board meetings held in 2022, six were board meetings covering a full agenda across strategy, performance, people and governance. Three board meetings were focused on the quarterly results, with one meeting combining both a full agenda and the quarterly results.\n\nBernard was unable to attend one board meeting due to unforeseen personal circumstances and Amanda joined the board on 1 September 2022. Pam was unable to attend one audit committee meeting due to a preexisting external commitment.\n\n## Appointments and succession plans\n\nOn behalf of the board, the people and governance committee reviews the formal appointment process and succession plan. Appointments and succession plans are both based on merit and assessed against objective criteria with the promotion of diversity, equity and inclusion as central considerations. This includes diversity of gender, social and ethnic backgrounds as well as cognitive and personal strengths.\n\nIn reviewing appointments and succession plans, due consideration is given to ensure smooth transition of board members with specific responsibilities (e.g. committee chair roles) by allowing sufficient time for a detailed handover. This is balanced by the need to have new board members join at regular intervals such that over time there is a controlled approach to board members reaching the end of their tenure.\n\nFurther details on succession and tenure are set out in the people and governance committee report on pages 98-101.\n\n## Time commitments\n\nThe expectation regarding time commitment for board members to effectively discharge their duties is set out in the directors' letters of appointment. The time commitment varies with the demands of bp business and other events.\n\nThe NEDs' external time commitments whether through executive, non-executive, advisory or other roles - are regularly reviewed by the company secretary to ensure that they are able to allocate appropriate time to bp.\n\nThe review process takes into account outside appointments and other external commitments, factoring in the complexity of the company in question and the industry, in particular regulated and potentially competing sectors.\n\nNEDs are also required to consult with the company secretary and chair before accepting any other role that may impact their ability to commit appropriate time to bp. The process for the approval of any new external appointment for an existing director reviews the time commitment required for the new external appointment in order to ensure the director has sufficient capacity for their role with bp. As part of that same review process, a review of independence and potential conflicts of interest is undertaken.\n\nThe board has concluded that, notwithstanding the NEDs' other appointments, they are each able to dedicate sufficient time to fulfil their bp duties.\n\nAs recommended by the Code, neither of the executive directors hold more than one nonexecutive directorship in a FTSE 100 company or other significant appointments, as set out on page 80.\n\n## Independence and conflicts of interest\n\nAll directors have a statutory duty to exercise independent judgement. Independence of non-executive directors (NEDs) is a crucial in bringing constructive challenge to the CEO and the leadership team at board meetings, while providing support and guidance to promote meaningful discussion and, ultimately, informed and effective decision-making. In addition, each director has a statutory duty to disclose actual or potential conflicts of interest. In accordance with the criteria set out in the Code, the chair was considered independent at the time he was appointed. NEDs are required to provide sufficient information to allow the board to evaluate their independence prior to and following their appointment.\n\nFormal procedures are in place for new potential conflicts to be reported and recorded during the year. As a consequence of regular reviews in 2022, the board is satisfied that there were no matters giving rise to conflicts of interest which could not be authorized by the board. It has therefore concluded that all bp NEDs are independent.",

The directors are required by the UK Companies Act 2006 to prepare financial statements for each financial year that give a true and fair view of the financial position of the group and the parent company and the financial performance and cash flows of the group and parent company for that period. Under that law they are required to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the United Kingdom and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and United Kingdom accounting standards (United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice), including FRS 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework'. In preparing the consolidated financial statements the directors have also elected to comply with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and IFRS as adopted by the European Union (EU).\n\nIn preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:\n\n- \u00b7 Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently.\n- \u00b7 Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.\n- \u00b7 Present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information.\n- \u00b7 Provide additional disclosure when compliance with the specific requirements of IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the group's financial position and financial performance.\n- \u00b7 State that applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial statements.\n- \u00b7 Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will continue in business.\n\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and company and enable them to ensure that the consolidated financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and the parent company financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\n\nHaving made the requisite enquiries, so far as the directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined by Section 418(3) of the Companies Act 2006) of which the company's auditors are unaware, and the directors have taken all the steps they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the company's auditors are aware of that information.\n\nEach of the current directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 80 to 83, confirms that to the best of their knowledge:\n\n- \u00b7 The consolidated financial statements, prepared on the basis of IFRS as issued by the IASB, IFRS as adopted by the United Kingdom and EU and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under international accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the group.\n- \u00b7 The parent company financial statements, prepared in accordance with United Kingdom generally accepted accounting practice, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, performance and cash flows of the company.\n- \u00b7 The management report, which is incorporated in the strategic report and directors' report, includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the group, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\n\n## Helge Lund\n\nChair\n\n10 March 2023\n\n## UK Corporate Governance Code compliance\n\nThroughout 2022, bp applied the principles and provisions of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code (Code). It has complied with all provisions of the Code. The Code can be found on the Financial Reporting Council website: www.frc.org.uk .\n\n## Risk management and internal control\n\nUnder the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 (Code), the board is responsible for the company's risk management and internal control systems. In discharging this responsibility the board, through its governance principles, requires the chief executive officer to operate the company with a comprehensive system of controls and internal audit to identify and manage the risks including emerging risks that are material to bp. In turn, the board, through its monitoring processes, satisfies itself that these material risks are identified and understood by management and that systems of risk management and internal control are in place to mitigate them. These systems are reviewed periodically by the board, have been in place for the year under review and up to the date of this report and are consistent with the requirements of Principle O of the Code.\n\nThe board has processes in place to:\n\n- \u00b7 Assess the principal and emerging risks facing the company.\n- \u00b7 Monitor the company's system of internal control (which includes the ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the principal and emerging risks).\n- \u00b7 Review the effectiveness of that system annually.\n\nNon-operated joint ventures and associates have not been dealt with as part of this process.\n\nA description of the principal and emerging risks facing the company, including those that could potentially threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity, is set out in Risk factors on page 73 . During the year, the board undertook a robust assessment of the principal and emerging risks facing the company. The principal means by which these risks are managed or mitigated are set out on page 69 .",

        "page_content": "## Directors' statements continued\n\nIn assessing the risks faced by the company and monitoring the system of internal control, the board and the audit and safety and sustainability committees requested, received and reviewed reports from executive management, including management of the business segments, corporate activities and any functions, at their regular meetings. A report by each of these committees, including its activities during the year, is set out on pages 98-112.\n\nDuring the year, the committees, as relevant, also met with management, the SVP, internal audit and other monitoring and assurance functions (including group ethics and compliance, safety and operational risk, group control, group legal and group risk) and the external auditor. Responses by management to incidents that occurred were considered by the appropriate committee or the board.\n\nAt a meeting in March 2023, the audit committee considered reports from the group risk function on the system of internal control and the function's categorisation of significant failings or weaknesses. The audit committee also considered a report from internal audit on their assessment of bp's systems of internal control and risk management, based on audit work conducted during 2022. In considering these reports and assessments, the audit committee noted that bp's system of internal control and risk management is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.\n\nThe board then considered the review undertaken by the audit committee and the proposed disclosures outlining the company's risk management and internal control systems prior to publication of the annual report and accounts.\n\nA statement regarding the company's internal controls over financial reporting is set out on page 149 .\n\n## Longer-term viability\n\nIn accordance with provision 31 of the Code, the directors have assessed the prospects of the company over a period significantly longer than 12 months. The directors believe that a viability\n\nassessment period of three years remains appropriate. This assessment is based on management's reasonable expectations of the position and performance of the company over this period, it's internal detailed budgets and planning timeframes and the targets and aims that it has set out.\n\nOur risk management system, described in how we manage risk on page 69 , outlines our risk identification, assessment and management approach for all risks, including our principal risks, described on page 73.\n\nTaking into account the company's current position and its principal risks, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the next three years.\n\nThe directors' assessment included a review of the potential financial impact of, and the financial headroom that could be available in the event of, the most severe but plausible scenarios that could threaten the viability of the company. The assessment took into consideration the robust financial position of the group and the potential mitigations that management reasonably believes would be available to the company over this period. Mitigations considered include use of cash, access to debt facilities and credit lines, raising of capital, reductions in capital expenditure, divestments and dividend reductions.\n\nThe scenarios that have been modelled are based on the most severe but plausible outcomes and associated costs are based on actual experience where possible. The scenarios have been considered individually and as a cluster of events. They include:\n\n- \u00b7 A significant process safety incident when operating facilities, drilling wells or transporting hydrocarbons.\n- \u00b7 A sustained significant decline in oil prices over three years.\n- \u00b7 A significant cyber-security incident.\n- \u00b7 A loss of a significant market or producing asset for six months.\n\nThe directors also considered the impact on viability from an extended pandemic scenario, as well as the potential risks associated with\n\nclimate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy. They consider that the most likely impacts of these risks are broadly captured and modelled through the sustained low oil price and loss of a producing asset scenarios.\n\nIn assessing the prospects of the company, the directors noted that such assessment is subject to a degree of uncertainty that can be expected to increase looking out over time and, accordingly, that future outcomes cannot be guaranteed or predicted with certainty.\n\n## Fair, balanced and understandable\n\nThe board considers the annual report and financial statements, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company's position and performance, business model and strategy.\n\n## Going concern\n\nIn accordance with provision 30 of the Code, the directors consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.\n\nForecast liquidity has been assessed under a number of stressed scenarios to support this assertion. Reverse stress tests performed indicated that the group will continue to operate as a going concern for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements even if the Brent price fell to zero.

In the prior year we determined materiality using profit before tax (with no adjustments) and underlying replacement cost profit  before interest and tax. |\n| Scoping             | Our scope covered 204 consolidation units (cons units). Of these, 152 were full-scope audits and the remaining 52 were subject to  specific procedures on certain account balances by component audit teams or the group audit team. These covered 71% of group  revenue, 77% of PP&E and 71% of profit before tax. The remaining 717 cons units were subject to other procedures, including  performing analytical reviews, making inquiries and evaluating and testing management's group-wide controls.                                                                                                         |\n\n## 4. Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\n\nOur evaluation of the directors' assessment of the group's and parent company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- \u00b7 considering whether material uncertainties existed that could cast significant doubt on the entity's ability to continue as a going concern for at least 12 months after the date of approval of the financial statements\n- \u00b7 assessing the financing facilities including the nature of the facilities, repayment terms and covenants\n- \u00b7 assessing whether the impact of potential margin calls in respect of derivative exchange contracts used to risk manage the physical portfolio have been appropriately considered given price volatility\n- \u00b7 challenging the assumptions used in the forecast (in particular oil and gas prices, capital expenditure, production levels and debt repayments)\n- \u00b7 assessing management's identified potential mitigating actions and the appropriateness of the inclusion of these in the going concern assessment\n- \u00b7 testing the clerical accuracy and appropriateness of the model used to prepare the forecasts\n- \u00b7 assessing the historical accuracy of forecasts prepared by management\n- \u00b7 reperforming management's sensitivity analysis and\n- \u00b7 assessing the disclosures made within the financial statements.\n\nBased on our assessment, we concluded that the assumptions used by management were reasonable overall and the disclosures made within the financial statements were appropriate.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\n\nIn relation to the reporting on how the group has applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report.\n\n## 5. Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current year and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.\n\nThroughout the course of our audit, we identify risks of material misstatement ('risks'). We consider both the likelihood of a risk and the potential magnitude of a misstatement in making the assessment. Certain risks are classified as 'significant' or 'higher' depending on their severity. The category of the risk determines the level of evidence we seek in providing assurance that the associated financial statement item is not materially misstated.",

In addition, there is an exposure to decommissioning obligations that may revert back to bp in respect of assets  transferred to third parties through historical divestments. The risk of exposure is enhanced due to the impacts of  climate change which have heightened long term financial resilience concerns for many industry participants.

As a consequence, for certain assets and investments judgement is required in the determination of the  recoverable amount as to whether it should consider the estimated disposal proceeds from a third party, as a key  input. Management recorded $2.9 billion (2021 $1.1 billion) of pre-tax impairment charges in 2022 for such potential  disposals as described in Note 4. There is a risk that management judgements taken to determine whether impairment  charges are required based on bp's view of whether transactions are likely to proceed or not, and bp's strategic appetite  regarding the value of disposal consideration that would be accepted, are not reasonable. |",

        "page_content": "## How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matter\n\n## Financial statements\n\n- \u00b7 The total goodwill balance as at 31 December 2022 is $12.4 billion, of which $7.2 billion relates to upstream oil and gas assets. The carrying values of goodwill may no longer be recoverable as a consequence of climate change and therefore may need to be impaired. For oil production & operations (OP&O), goodwill is allocated to CGUs in aggregate at the segment level and for gas & low carbon energy (G&LCE) goodwill is allocated to the hydrocarbon CGUs within the segment. The most significant assumption in the goodwill impairment tests affected by climate change relates to future oil and gas prices (see 'Impairment of upstream oil and gas PP&E assets' below). Given the significant level of headroom in the goodwill impairment tests, management identified no other assumption that could lead to a material misstatement of goodwill due to the energy transition and other climate change factors. Disclosures in relation to sensitivities for goodwill are included within Note 14 on page 221. The C&P segment has a goodwill balance of $4.7 billion, of which the most significant element is $2.5 billion relating to the Lubricants business. Notwithstanding the expected global transition to electric vehicles which may reduce demand for Lubricants, due to the substantial headroom in the most recent impairment test (as described in Note 14), management has assessed as remote the likelihood that the recoverable amount of goodwill is less than its carrying value.\n- \u00b7 Climate change-related litigation brought against bp, as disclosed in Note 33 to the financial statements, may lead to an outflow of funds requiring provision.\n\nThe above considerations were a significant focus of management during the period which led to this being a matter that we communicated to the audit committee, and which had a significant effect on the overall audit strategy. We therefore identified this as a key audit matter.\n\n## Overall response\n\nWe held discussions with management, with our Climate Change specialists and within the group engagement team to identify the areas where we felt climate change could have a potential impact on the financial statements.\n\nWe also continued to utilise a climate change steering committee comprising a group of senior partners with specific climate change and technical audit and accounting expertise within Deloitte to provide an independent challenge to our key decisions and conclusions with respect to this area.\n\n## Audit procedures\n\nThe audit response related to two of the audit risks identified is set out under the key audit matters for 'Impairment of upstream oil and gas PP&E assets' on pages 157-159 and 'Decommissioning provisions' on pages 160-161. Other procedures are as follows:\n\nIn respect of the recoverability of E&A assets capitalised as at 31 December 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of the group's E&A write-off and impairment assessment processes and tested relevant internal controls, which specifically consider climate change related risks.\n- \u00b7 We challenged and evaluated management's key E&A judgements with regards to the impairment criteria of IFRS 6 and bp's accounting policy. We corroborated key judgements with internal and external evidence for assets that remained on the balance sheet. This included analysing evidence of future E&A plans, budgets and capital allocation decisions, assessing management's key accounting judgement papers, reading meeting minutes and reviewing licence documentation and evidence of active dialogue with partners and regulators including negotiations to renew licences or modify key terms.\n- \u00b7 We assessed whether the progression of any projects that remain on the balance sheet would be inconsistent with elements of bp's strategy and in particular its net zero carbon commitments and bp's intention to reduce its hydrocarbon production (by around 25% by 2030 relative to 2019 - see page 186).\n\nWe have considered the impact of potential changes in supply and demand on the group's refining portfolio and reviewed internal and external market studies of future supply and demand. In relation to the Gelsenkirchen refinery impairment test, we assessed the valuation methodology, tested the integrity and mechanical accuracy of the impairment model and assessed the appropriateness of key assumptions and inputs, notably forecast refining margins and energy input costs, challenging and evaluating management's assumptions by reference to third party data where available. We also evaluated management's ability to forecast future cash flows and margins by comparing actual results to historical forecasts and tested management's internal controls over the impairment test and related inputs.\n\nWe challenged management's analysis that identified the specific assets that are likely to be disposed of by  bp as part of its strategy. Where relevant, we challenged bp's asset impairment assessments based on their estimated disposal proceeds and whether transactions are judged likely to proceed or not. We obtained evidence of any negotiations with third parties, carefully considered bp's strategic intent in this context and challenged management's assessment of the recoverable amounts for material transactions. We also tested relevant controls which covered both the recoverable amounts determined and the likelihood of transaction completion.  .\n\nIn respect of the impairment tests performed on certain low carbon energy investments, we tested the result by:\n\n- \u00b7 Testing the relevant controls over low carbon energy impairment tests including controls over key assumptions and the discount rate\n- \u00b7 Assessing the low carbon energy discount rate with input from our valuation specialists",

In doing this, we obtained third party reports assessing future refined petroleum product demand for those countries which are included in our group full audit scope for the C&P segment. In particular, we considered the forecasts as set out in the IEA World Energy Outlook 2022 which shows that demand for refined petroleum products is expected to remain sufficient for at least the current remaining useful economic lives of the refineries such that current depreciation rates are appropriate, including under the Announced Pledges Scenario which is associated with a temperature rise of 1.7 \u00b0C in 2100 (with a 50% probability).\n\nWe performed procedures to satisfy ourselves that, other than future oil and gas price assumptions, there were no other assumptions in management's oil and gas goodwill impairment tests to which reasonably possible changes due to the energy transition and other climate change factors could cause goodwill to be materially misstated. We obtained evidence which supported management's conclusion that goodwill relating to the C&P segment activities is not impaired due to climate change or other factors.\n\nWith regard to climate change litigation, we designed procedures specifically to respond to the risks that provisions could be understated or that contingent liability disclosures may be omitted or be inaccurate including:\n\n- \u00b7 Holding discussions with the group general counsel and other senior bp lawyers regarding climate change matters\n- \u00b7 Conducting a search for climate change litigation and claims brought against the group\n- \u00b7 Making written inquiries of, and holding discussions with, external legal counsel advising bp in relation to climate change litigation and\n- \u00b7 Reviewing the contingent liability disclosures in the annual report on pages 257-259.\n\nWe read the other information included in the Annual Report and considered (a) whether there was any material inconsistency between the other information and the financial statements; or (b) whether there was any material inconsistency between the other information and our understanding of the business based on audit evidence obtained and conclusions reached in the audit.\n\nKey observations in relation to oil and gas price assumptions used in oil and gas PP&E asset impairment tests, and the impact of climate change on decommissioning provisions are set out in the relevant key audit matter below.\n\nWe concluded that the key E&A assessments had been appropriately determined and the judgements management had made were appropriately supported. We did not identify any additional impairments or write-offs from the work we performed. We also confirmed management's view that they did not consider that the progression of any of their E&A assets would be inconsistent with bp's current strategy and management's capital frame and capital allocation intentions in light of climate change and the energy transition.\n\n## We are satisfied:\n\n- \u00b7 with the results of our procedures relating to the carrying value of refining assets and that the impairments recorded are reasonable\n- \u00b7 that management's planned disposal related asset impairment assessments are reasonable and we did not identify any additional material impairments\n- \u00b7 with the results of the low carbon energy impairment tests, noting that the investment valuations remain sensitive in particular to capital and operating cost assumptions, the ability to secure project financing at the interest rates assumed, and for certain projects the pricing that can be secured under future power purchase contracts. The discount rate used by management was lower than we would have expected but this did not impact the outcome of the tests\n- \u00b7 with the results of our procedures relating to the assessment of the useful economic lives of refining assets and therefore depreciation charges, based on the market studies we read\n- \u00b7 with the sensitivity analysis disclosures around the energy transition and other climate change factors performed in respect of the goodwill balances; and that the group's goodwill balances are not materially misstated\n- \u00b7 with management's assertion that no provision should currently be made in respect of climate change litigation. Based on the audit evidence obtained both from internal and external legal counsel, we concluded that management's disclosure of the contingent liabilities in respect of these matters is appropriate and\n- \u00b7 that management's other disclosures in the Annual Report relating to climate change are consistent with the financial statements and our understanding of the business.\n\nWhilst many of bp's oil and gas properties and refining assets are long term in nature, by 2050, the remaining carrying value of assets currently being depreciated will be immaterial, this date being the target set by the majority of governments with 'net zero' emissions targets and also by bp, being Aim 1 of the 'Getting to net zero' strategy set out on page 45. At current rates of depreciation, depletion and amortisation (DD&A), the average remaining depreciable life of the upstream oil and gas PP&E (within the OP&O and G&LCE segments) is just six years and the refining assets (within the C&P segment) is thirteen years.",

Brent oil price assumptions were increased in the short and medium term, reflecting management's  expectation of supply constraints over the next decade due to restrictions on Russian exports, although there has been no  significant change to longer term Brent oil forecasts reflecting bp's unchanged view on the longer term speed of the low  carbon energy transition. Henry Hub gas price assumptions have increased until 2050, reflecting a view that US domestic  gas production will need to grow, in large part to offset the loss of Russian gas exports.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Management has also revised bp's 'best estimate' discount rate assumptions for value-in-use impairment tests in 2022, as  set out in Note 1 on page 192. bp's post-tax nominal weighted average cost of capital, being the starting point for setting  discount rates used for impairment testing for oil and gas assets, has increased to 7% (2021 6%), reflecting the impact of  observable increases in risk free rates on bp's weighted average cost of capital.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Given the significance of the price and discount rate assumption revisions during 2022, alongside certain CGU specific  new indicators, management has tested all oil and gas CGUs for impairment and/or impairment reversal during the year.  Management recorded $2.2 billion (2021 $4.8 billion) of pre-tax oil and gas CGU impairment reversals, principally due to  the oil and gas price upward revisions detailed above, and $5.2 billion of pre-tax oil and gas CGU impairment charges  (2021 $2.4 billion) due principally to increased expenditure forecasts and the increased discount rate. Further information  has been provided in Note 1 on page 192 and Note 4 on page 207.   We identified three key management estimates in management's determination of the level of impairment charge and/or  impairment reversal. These are:                                                                   |\n| production forecast, which is based on underlying reserves estimates and field specific development assumptions.  Certain CGU production forecasts include specific risk adjusted resource volumes, in addition to proven and/or  probable reserves estimates, that are inherently less certain than reserves; and assumptions related to these  volumes can be particularly judgemental. There is a risk that material misstatements could arise from unreasonable  production forecasts for individually material CGUs and/or from the aggregation of systematic flaws in bp's reserves  and resources estimation policies across the OP&O and G&LCE segments.  We identified certain individual CGUs with a total carrying value of $17 billion (2021 $33 billion) which we determined  would be most at risk of material impairment charges as a result of a reasonably possible  change in the oil and gas price |\n| We also identified CGUs with a further $13 billion (2021 $12 billion) of combined carrying value which were less sensitive.  We identified these as a higher audit risk as they would be potentially at risk, in aggregate, to a material impairment by a  reasonably possible change in some or all of the key assumptions. No impairment reversals are available for these CGUs.  Further information regarding these sensitivities is given in Note 1 on page 193.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |",

In addition, we conducted the following substantive procedures.\n\n## Oil and gas prices\n\n- \u00b7 We independently developed a reasonable range of forecasts based on external data obtained, against which we compared management's oil and gas price assumptions in order to challenge whether they are reasonable.\n- \u00b7 In developing this range, we obtained a variety of reputable and reliable third party forecasts, peer information and other relevant market data.\n- \u00b7 In challenging management's price assumptions, we considered the extent to which they and each of the forecast pricing scenarios obtained from third parties reflect the impact of lower oil and gas demand due to climate change and the energy transition.\n- \u00b7 The 2015 Conference of the Parties (CoP) 21 Paris Agreement goals of 'holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels' was reaffirmed at CoP 27 in Cairo during November 2022. We specifically analysed third party forecasts stated, or interpreted by us, as being consistent with scenarios achieving the Paris 'well below 2\u00b0C goal' and/or '1.5\u00b0C ambition' and evaluated whether they presented contradictory audit evidence.\n- \u00b7 We challenged management's judgement, described in Note 1 on page 185, that the potential impact of further emission costs being borne by producers including bp is not expected to have a material impact on bp's oil and gas CGU carrying values. We inquired of certain third party forecasters included in our reasonable range and read their forecast price reports, to understand whether their oil and gas prices are forecast on a 'net producer prices' basis, (i.e., net of potential future emissions costs that are assumed to be borne by oil and gas end users), consistent with the basis of bp's value-in-use price assumptions.\n- \u00b7 We assessed management's disclosures in Notes 1 and 4, including the sensitivity of forecast revenue cash inflows to lower oil and gas prices and how climate change and the energy transition, potential future emissions costs and/or reduced demand scenarios may impact bp to a greater extent than currently anticipated in bp's value-in-use estimates for oil and gas CGUs.\n\n## Discount rates\n\n- \u00b7 We independently evaluated bp's discount rates used in impairment tests with input from our valuation specialists, against relevant third party market and peer data.\n- \u00b7 We assessed whether specific country risks and tax adjustments were reasonably reflected in bp's discount rates.\n- \u00b7 We challenged and evaluated management's disclosures in Notes 1 and 4 including in relation to the sensitivity of discount rate assumptions.\n\n## Reserves and resources estimates\n\n- \u00b7 With the assistance of our oil and gas reserves specialists we: assessed bp's reserves and resources estimation methods and policies\n- \u00b7 assessed how these policies had been applied to a sample of bp's reserves and resources estimates which included those that we judged to represent the greatest risk of material misstatement\n- \u00b7 read a sample of reports provided by management's external reserves experts and assessed the scope of work and findings of these third parties\n- \u00b7 assessed the competence, capabilities and objectivity of bp's internal and external reserve experts, through understanding their relevant professional qualifications and experience\n- \u00b7 compared the production forecasts used in the impairment tests with management's approved reserves and resources estimates and\n- \u00b7 performed a retrospective assessment to check for indications of estimation bias over time.\n\n## Other procedures\n\n- \u00b7 We challenged and assessed management's CGU determinations, including the evaluation of contradictory evidence.\n- \u00b7 We assessed whether bp's impairment methodology was acceptable under IFRS and tested the integrity and mechanical accuracy of certain impairment models.\n- \u00b7 For certain CGUs we challenged and assessed specific valuation input assumptions, including but not limited to material cost and tax forecasts, by comparing forecasts to approved internal and third party budgets, development plans, independent expectations and historical actuals.\n- \u00b7 We assessed whether management's production forecasts are consistent overall with bp's strategy, including the group's expectation to reduce its hydrocarbon production (by around 25% by 2030 relative to 2019 - see page 186).\n- \u00b7 Where relevant, we assessed management's historical forecasting accuracy and whether the estimates had been determined and applied on a consistent basis across the group.\n\nThis page does not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.\n\nImpairment charge and/or impairment reversal assessments of upstream oil and gas PP&E assets remain a key audit matter because recoverable values are reliant on forecasts that are inherently judgemental and complex for management to estimate, and the magnitude of the potential misstatement risk is material to the group.",

        "page_content": "## Key observations\n\n## Oil and gas prices\n\nFor the purpose of PP&E impairment tests, management is required under IAS 36 to apply its current 'best estimate' of future oil and gas prices. We determined that bp's 'best estimate' assumptions are reasonable when compared against a range of third party forecasts and peer information that we identified as being appropriate for this purpose. In forming this view, we included each forecaster's 'base case', 'central case' or 'most likely' estimate.\n\nWe further observed that, as well as publishing a 'base case', 'central case' or 'most likely' estimate, certain third party price forecasters (including the IEA and the WBCSD Catalogue from April 2022) published other price forecasts including some that were stated as, or were interpreted by us as being, Paris 'well below 2\u00baC goal' or Paris '1.5\u00baC ambition' scenarios. We observed that none of those third party forecasters described their 'Paris consistent' scenarios as their 'base case', 'central case' or 'most likely' estimate.\n\nManagement notes on page 185 that they consider their 'best estimate' prices to be in line with a range of transition paths consistent with the Paris climate goal of limiting global warming to well below 2\u00baC as well as the ambition to limit global warming to no greater than 1.5\u00baC. We observed that for oil, whilst being within the lower half of our range of 'best estimate' forecasts described above, bp's Brent price assumptions were overall within the higher half of our range of Paris 'well below 2\u00baC goal' and '1.5\u00baC ambition' scenarios. This is consistent with bp's prior period positioning within our Brent oil range. For Henry Hub gas, management's decision to adopt higher gas price assumptions until 2050 has moved bp's best estimate into the top half of our 'best estimate' range in the short and medium term, before settling towards the middle of our range in the longer term. The gas price assumptions are close to the top of our range of Paris 'well below 2\u00baC goal' and '1.5\u00baC ambition' scenarios in the short and medium term and remain in the top half in the longer term. This reflects an increase compared to the prior period, when bp's gas price assumptions were in the lower half of our 'best estimate' range and towards the midpoint of our range of Paris 'well below 2\u00baC goal' and '1.5\u00baC ambition' scenarios. We also noted certain other reputable third party sources that set out or implied even higher prices under both Paris 'well below 2\u00baC goal' and '1.5\u00baC ambition' scenarios, highlighting the large inherent uncertainty regarding 'Paris consistent' pathways and the very wide range of potential price forecasts. Accordingly, we consider management's statement as set out above to be reasonable.\n\nBy inquiry and analysis, we confirmed that the third party oil and gas price forecasts used to develop our independent range are on a net producer price basis. Accordingly, we are satisfied management's judgement is reasonable that the potential impact of further emission costs being borne by bp is not expected to have a material impact on the group's oil and gas CGU carrying values.\n\nWe reviewed the disclosures included in Note 1 to the accounts in respect of oil and gas price assumptions, including the sensitivity analysis presented therein. We observed that management's downside sensitivity, in which oil and gas prices are lower than the 'best estimate' in all future periods, is broadly in the middle of our range of third party Paris 'well below 2\u00b0C goal' and Paris '1.5\u00b0C ambition' scenarios between 2025 and 2030 and thereafter close to the bottom of the range for both Brent oil and Henry Hub gas.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nbp's post-tax nominal 7% weighted average cost of capital, being the starting point for setting discount rates used for impairment testing for oil and gas assets, was within the independent range calculated by our valuation specialists.\n\nWe were also satisfied with the calculation of country risk premia. Accordingly, we are satisfied with the discount rates used in the impairment charge and impairment reversal testing.\n\n## Reserves and resources\n\nWe found that the production forecasts used in the oil and gas CGU valuations that we tested were reasonable and appropriately risked where applicable, for the purposes of management's impairment charge and impairment reversal tests.\n\n## Other procedures\n\nWe observed that management's production forecasts are not consistent in aggregate with bp's strategy because bp expects to dispose of certain non-core assets in future periods (see 'Potential impact of climate change and the energy transition' above and page 55 of Annual Report).\n\n## Financial statements",

The estimation of decommissioning provisions is a highly judgemental area as it involves a number of key  estimates related to the cost and timing of decommissioning, in particular inflation and discount rate assumptions. Given  management expects hydrocarbon production to be around 25% lower by 2030 relative to 2019 as stated on page 186,  consistency of that expectation with the timing of decommissioning expenditure and underlying cost assumptions  remains a key consideration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                | Due to sustained levels of high global inflation, particularly in key geographies such as the U.S. and U.K., where a majority  of bp's future decommissioning cost obligations are located, the impact of inflation on bp's decommissioning provision  represents an area of particular risk. Consistent with prior years, management estimates that the average rate of forecast  inflation applicable to the substantial majority of bp's decommissioning cost estimates is 1.5%, which is 0.5% lower than  its estimated long term general inflation rate of 2%. The extent to which average future decommissioning cost inflation will  differ from the general inflation rate depends on industry demand and supply of rigs and other relevant services at the  time future decommissioning occurs, which in turn will be influenced by future oil and gas demand, and increasingly by  structural changes in the industry supply chain driven by the energy transition, which are uncertain.

We challenged whether the impact of inflation experienced in 2022 was appropriately considered and reflected where relevant within bp's cost assumptions, and also assessed the reasonableness of key cost assumptions with reference to internal and appropriate third party data.\n- \u00b7 We assessed changes in assumptions for the estimated date of decommissioning and evaluated whether CoP dates used for decommissioning estimation are aligned with CoP assumptions in other areas, including PP&E impairment testing and oil and gas reserve estimation.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the accuracy of bp's additional disclosure of the estimated undiscounted cost of its obligations and the timing of future decommissioning payments.\n\n## Discount rates\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the control related to the determination of the discount rate assumption.\n- \u00b7 With the help of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the discount rate assumption used, comparing it against latest external market data.\n\n## Reversion risk\n\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of bp's decommissioning reversion risk assessment process and tested relevant internal controls including those controls over the completeness and accuracy of the previously divested asset data.\n- \u00b7 We challenged and evaluated management's key judgements related to the decommissioning reversion risk and conclusions as to whether any additional provision should be recognised, or specific contingent liability disclosure made. We assessed the relevant internal and external evidence used in forming this judgement, including the financial health of the counterparty or counterparties in the ownership chain for the divested assets and the existence of any other pertinent factors which could indicate a higher probability of decommissioning obligations reverting to bp.\n\n## Potential decommissioning of refinery assets\n\n- \u00b7 We challenged and evaluated management's analysis which supported the judgement that no decommissioning provisions should be recognised in respect of refineries where there is ongoing activity and management has no current intention to cease these activities.\n- \u00b7 We have reviewed analysis undertaken by management, as well as third party studies, of forecast demand for refined products in regions served by bp's refineries. Furthermore, we read external profitability benchmarking which supported a conclusion that the group's remaining refineries would likely remain operational for longer than many of their regional competitors, in the event of refining capacity reductions.\n- \u00b7 We also met with refinery management to understand the potential alternative use cases under consideration for refineries in the future and obtained evidence that management is developing plans for the existing refinery sites remaining in the portfolio which would be compatible with net zero emissions, for instance through the production of alternative low carbon and sustainable fuels.\n\nWe tested the decommissioning models, assessing the application of cost, timing, inflation and discount rate assumptions.\n\nWe concluded that the assumed inflation rate of 1.5% remains reasonable as a long-term inflation rate for decommissioning liabilities. We accept as reasonable that the high level of general inflation experienced in 2022 does not require a change to bp's long term average inflation assumption. With respect to the extent to which average future decommissioning cost inflation will differ from the general inflation rate, which is influenced by the demand and supply of rigs and other relevant services at the time future decommissioning occurs, we concluded that market forecasts support the assertion that demand for rigs will not increase in the long term as a result of the impact of the energy transition and therefore that inflation of rig costs will be limited.\n\nWe concluded that the cost and timing assumptions used in the decommissioning provision calculation were reasonable and the assumptions are appropriately supported by industry data. The disclosure included on page 199 with respect to the estimated undiscounted cost of bp's decommissioning obligations and the timing of future decommissioning payments are consistent with these conclusions.\n\nbp's increased 3.5% discount rate was within a reasonable range based on latest market data.\n\nNo material additional decommissioning provisions have been made in respect of historical divestments where bp are exposed to decommissioning reversion risk as a result of the potential future bankruptcy of the current asset owner. Based on our review and challenge of management's assessment, we consider this judgement to be reasonable. We also consider the contingent liability disclosure to be reasonable.\n\nIn respect of the group's refining assets, taking into consideration both the IEA 2022 demand forecasts and management's strategic plans for the group's refineries, including developing production of low carbon and sustainable fuels, we are satisfied that it is not currently possible for management to estimate reliably a settlement date for any decommissioning obligations prior to a decision being made to cease refining operations. Accordingly, we have not identified any triggers that would require a decommissioning provision to be recorded.",

In pursuit of achieving bp's 'net zero' ambition and to support the overall group strategy, T&S as a function is increasingly focused on securing long term renewable power offtake/supply contracts in existing and new markets whilst providing solutions to bp's customers through offering eco-friendly hydrocarbons. Given the nature of these transactions, we direct significant audit effort towards challenging management's adopted accounting treatment and/or valuation estimates.\n\nThroughout the year, we have kept our risk assessment updated by undertaking an iterative review of the underlying portfolio composition. This process facilitated a deeper understanding of the impact of commodity price volatility, demand destruction and the changing structure of the markets resulting from supply dislocations due to the Russian-Ukraine war allowing us to focus our audit effort to areas of highest risk.\n\n## Accounting for structured commodity transactions (SCTs) :\n\nT&S may also enter into a variety of transactions which we refer to as structured commodity transactions (SCTs). We generally refer to the following factors to identify a SCT:\n\n- \u00b7 two or more counterparties with non-standard contractual terms;\n- \u00b7 reference multiple commodity-based transactions; or\n- \u00b7 contractual arrangements entered into in contemplation of each other.\n\nSCTs are often long-dated, can have a significant multi-year financial impact, and may require the use of complex valuation models or unobservable inputs when determining their fair value, in which case they will be classified as level 3 financial instruments under IFRS 13, 'Fair Value Measurement'.\n\nAccounting for SCTs is typically complex and initially involves significant judgment, as a feature of these transactions is that they often include multiple elements that will have a material impact on the presentation and disclosure in the financial statements and on key performance measures, including in particular the classification of liabilities as finance debt. Accordingly, we have identified a significant audit risk around the accounting for SCTs that have a quantitative impact of $487 million or higher on balances that affect group KPIs.\n\nAlthough we have assessed new SCTs entered into during the year, we have not identified any new types of SCT transactions which we assess to be a significant risk.\n\n## Valuation of commodity derivatives:\n\nCommodity markets remained volatile during the year on the back of continuing demand uncertainty as a result of the global energy transition, macro-economic factors and disruptions in global supply due to the Russian-Ukraine war. In response to the volatility observed, we focused our audit efforts on the valuation of all commodity derivatives and designed procedures specifically to test for management bias.\n\nUnlike other financial instruments whose values or inputs are readily observable and therefore more easily independently corroborated, there are certain transactions for which the valuation is inherently more subjective due to the use of either complex valuation models and/or unobservable inputs. These instruments are classified as level 3 financial assets or liabilities. This degree of subjectivity also gives rise to a risk of potential fraud through management incorporating bias in determining fair values.

Our application of materiality\n\n## 6.1 Materiality\n\nWe define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:\n\nGroup financial statements\n\n## Parent company financial statements\n\n| Materiality Basis for determining  materiality   | We set materiality for both the group and parent company at $1,250 million. Group and parent company planning materiality  for the current year was set at $1,000 million and our audit scoping and all the audit testing performed by our component  teams was conducted using this planning materiality. In 2021, we used a materiality of $700 million and $1,000 million for the group financial statements and the parent company  financial statements respectively. The increase in materiality is due to the significant increase in the profitability of the group.  Consistent with the prior year we concluded that it is  appropriate to use profit before tax as a materiality   | We determined materiality for our audit of the standalone  parent using 1.1% (2021 1%) of net assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Rationale for the  benchmark applied             | We conducted an assessment of which line items are the  most important to investors and analysts by reading analyst  reports and bp's communications to shareholders and  lenders, as well as the communications of peer companies.  Profit before tax is the benchmark ordinarily considered by us  when auditing listed entities. It provides comparability  against companies across all sectors but has limitations  when auditing companies whose earnings are strongly                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | The materiality determined for the standalone parent  company is based on net assets as the company is non\u00ad trading and operates primarily as a holding company; we  believe the net asset position is the most appropriate  benchmark to use. Whilst, in accordance with our benchmarks we could have  set parent company materiality higher we decided to align it  with group materiality of $1,250 million. |",

We also report to the audit committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\n## 7. An overview of the scope of our audit\n\n## 7.1 Identification and scoping of components\n\nAs a result of the highly disaggregated nature of the group, with operations in over 60 countries through approximately 920 cons units, a significant portion of our audit planning effort was ensuring that the scope of our work is appropriate in addressing the identified risks of material misstatement.\n\nThe factors that we considered when assessing the scope of the bp audit, and the level of work to be performed at the cons units that are in scope for group reporting purposes, included the following:",

There are certain cons units which have fallen out of scope due to disposals, asset impairments and non-recurring one off transactions which were in scope in the prior year. Our fullscope audits are in the UK, US, Australia, Azerbaijan and Germany.\n\nIn addition, component teams performed audit procedures on specified account balances in 19 cons units (2021 32) also covering Angola, Trinidad & Tobago, Mauritania & Senegal Egypt, India, UAE and China. The group engagement team performed audit procedures on specified account balances to component materiality, with certain additional specific procedures performed by component teams, covering an additional 33 cons units (2021 20).\n\nThe remaining cons units are not significant individually and include many small, low risk components and balances. On average, they each represent 0.03% of group revenue (2021 0.04%), 0.03% of property, plant and equipment (2021 0.03%) and 0.04% of profit before tax (2021 0.03%).\n\nIn our assessment of the residual balances not covered by the above procedures, we have considered in particular the risk that there could be a material misstatement within the large number of geographically dispersed businesses, in particular within the C&P segment. This assessment included use of our analytic tools to interrogate data, preparation of trend analysis and comparison of business performance to market benchmark prices. We also tested management's group-wide controls across a range of locations and segments. We concluded that through this additional risk assessment, we have reduced the audit risk of such a misstatement arising to a sufficiently low level.\n\nOur audit coverage of 'Property, plant and equipment', 'Sales and other operating revenue' and 'Profit before tax' is materially the same as in the prior year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 7.2 Our consideration of the control environment\n\nOur audit approach was generally to place reliance on management's relevant controls over all business cycles affecting in scope financial statement line items. As part of our controls testing, we assessed the design and implementation of controls and tested a sample for operating effectiveness through a combination of tests of inquiry, observation, inspection and re-performance.\n\nIn limited situations where we were not able to take a controls reliance approach due to controls being deficient and there not being sufficient mitigating or alternative controls we could rely on instead, we adopted a non-controls reliance approach. All control deficiencies which we considered to be significant, were communicated to the audit committee. All other deficiencies were communicated to management. For all deficiencies identified we considered the impact and updated our audit plan accordingly.\n\nThe group's financial systems environment is complex, with 119 separate IT systems scoped as being relevant to the audit for the following key locations (UK, US, Germany, Angola, Azerbaijan and Australia) as well as other minor locations. These systems are all directly or indirectly relevant to the entity's financial reporting process.\n\nWe planned to rely on the General IT Controls (GITCs) associated with these systems, where the GITCs were appropriately designed and implemented, and these were operating effectively. To assess the operating effectiveness of GITCs we performed testing on access security, change management, data centre operations and network operations. We have included our observations on the IT controls in our key audit matter section, (see 'IT controls relating to financial systems' above).\n\nThis page does not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.",

We interacted regularly with the component Deloitte teams during each stage of the audit and reviewed key working papers. We maintained continuous and open dialogue with our component teams in addition to holding formal meetings quarterly to ensure that we were fully aware of their progress and results of their procedures.\n\nDue to relaxation in COVID-19 restrictions during the year, after a two year gap the senior statutory auditor and other group audit partners and staff conducted visits to meet with the component teams responsible for all of the full scope locations during the year as well as Egypt and Trinidad & Tobago. These visits included attending planning meetings, discussing the audit approach including the risk assessments and any issues arising from the component team's work, meetings with local management, and reviewing key audit working papers on higher and significant-risk areas to drive a consistent and high-quality audit. In addition, a global audit planning meeting was held in London for three days in July led by the senior statutory auditor and involving the group audit team, partners and staff from all full scope component teams, audit teams responsible for testing at key GBS locations, senior management from bp and the audit committee chair.\n\nFollowing the group's decision to exit Rosneft in February 2022, Rosneft is no longer classified as a reportable segment and the investment was fully impaired.  Accordingly, Rosneft was no longer a significant component in scope of the group audit and we therefore did not require reporting from Rosneft's auditor. The group audit team audited the impairment and other Rosneft related adjustments including the decision not to recognise dividends.\n\n## 8. Other information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nAs part of our work on other information and given the importance attached to the Underlying Replacement Cost Operating Profit metric in the annual report, we have considered the adjusting items set out on pages 353. In that context we assessed the Fair Value Accounting Effects (FVAE) adjustments, which are included within Adjusting items (as defined on page 393) which are treated as a reconciling adjustment to derive Underlying Replacement Cost Operating Profit and related underlying measures which are non-GAAP measures.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2022, the FVAE adjustment was a gain of $3,501 million in arriving at underlying replacement cost profit before tax (2021 $8,075 million gain); the cumulative unrealised gain recognised as at 31 December 2022 was $11,436 million (2021 $ 7,932 million). These amounts are analysed by segment on page 353; of the cumulative gain recognised, $9,960 million (2021 $8,149 million) relates to the gas & low carbon energy segment.\n\nAs noted on page 393, physical forward LNG contracts are not considered by bp to meet the definition of a derivative under IFRS and are therefore subject to accrual accounting meaning the fair value of forward sale and purchase contracts is not reflected in the IFRS reported results. Nevertheless, the financial contracts executed to manage price risk associated with the forward physical LNG volumes are accounted for as derivatives within the IFRS reported results, thereby creating an asymmetry.\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the amounts reported for LNG contracts within FVAE to assess consistency with the definition included within the annual report (on page 393) and with the internal policies of the group that govern the recognition and measurement of items reported within FVAE. This included understanding, and, where necessary, challenging management's application of judgement regarding the future realisation of LNG physical forward contracts.\n\n## 9. Responsibilities of directors\n\nAs explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group's and the parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## 10.Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the FRC's website at: frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\n\nThis page does not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.\n\nWe have nothing to report in respect of these matters.",

We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\n\n## 11.1 Identifying and assessing potential risks related to irregularities\n\nIn identifying and assessing risks of material misstatement in respect of irregularities, including fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations, we considered the following:\n\n- \u00b7 our meetings throughout the year with the Group Head of Ethics and Compliance and reviews of bp's internal ethics and compliance reporting summaries, including those concerning investigations\n- \u00b7 enquiries of management, internal audit, and the audit committee, including obtaining and reviewing supporting documentation, concerning the group's policies and procedures relating to:\n- -identifying, evaluating and complying with laws and regulations and whether they were aware of any instances of non-compliance\n- -detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud and\n- -the internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations.\n- \u00b7 review of the terms of reference of the Fraud Governance Board set up by management to support the creation and delivery of the Group Fraud Risk Strategy, periodically monitor the threat outlook and review the risk appetite.\n- \u00b7 review of the Fraud Governance Board's meeting minutes and its fraud risk assessment.\n- \u00b7 the group's remuneration policies, key drivers for remuneration and bonus levels and\n- \u00b7 discussions among the engagement team regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud. The engagement team includes audit partners and staff who have extensive experience of working with companies in the same sectors as bp operates, and this experience was relevant to the discussion about where fraud risks may arise. The discussions also involved fraud specialists who advised the engagement team of fraud schemes that had arisen in similar sectors and industries, and they participated in the initial fraud risk assessment discussions.\n\nIn common with all audits under ISAs (UK), we are also required to perform specific procedures to respond to the risk of management override.\n\nWe also obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that the group operates in, focusing on provisions of those laws and regulations that had a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The key laws and regulations we considered in this context included the UK Companies Act, UK Corporate Governance Code, United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards and IFRSs as issued by the IASB and as adopted by the EU, FRS 101, US Securities Exchange Act 1934 and relevant SEC regulations, as well as laws and regulations prevailing in each country in which we identified a full-scope component.\n\nIn addition, we considered provisions of other laws and regulations that do not have a direct effect on the financial statements but compliance with which may be fundamental to the group's ability to operate or to avoid a material penalty. These included the group's operating licences and environmental regulations.\n\n## 11.2 Audit response to risks identified\n\nAs a result of performing the above, we did not identify any key audit matters related to the potential risk of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We did identify two key audit matters relating to fraud risks, as described above, being the accounting for SCTs and Level 3 instruments within T&S, and management override of controls. The key audit matters section of our report explains the matters in more detail and also describes the specific procedures we performed in response to those key audit matters.\n\nIn addition to the above, procedures to respond to risks identified included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 reviewing the financial statement disclosures and testing to supporting documentation to assess compliance with provisions of relevant laws and regulations described as having a direct effect on the financial statements\n- \u00b7 enquiring of management, the audit committee and in-house legal counsel concerning actual and potential litigation and claims\n- \u00b7 obtaining confirmations from external legal counsel concerning open litigation and claims\n- \u00b7 performing analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships that may indicate risks of material misstatement due to fraud and\n- \u00b7 reading minutes of meetings of those charged with governance, reviewing internal audit reports and reviewing correspondence with HMRC and the IRS.\n\nWe also communicated relevant identified laws and regulations and potential fraud risks to all engagement team members including internal specialists and significant component audit teams and remained alert to any indications of fraud or non-compliance with laws and regulations throughout the audit.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the group as at  31 December 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended  31 December 2022, in accordance with United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and as adopted by the European Union (EU) .\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), bp's internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2022, based on criteria established in the UK Financial Reporting Council's Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business reporting relating to internal control over financial reporting and our report dated 10 March 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on bp's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of bp's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on bp's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to bp in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## 1.Impairment of upstream oil and gas property, plant and equipment (PP&E) assets - Notes 1, 4 and 12 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe group balance sheet as at 31 December 2022 includes PP&E of $106 billion, of which $76 billion is oil and gas properties within the OP&O ($48 billion) and G&LCE ($28 billion) segments.\n\nManagement's oil and gas price assumptions for value-in-use impairment tests were revised in 2022 as set out in Note 1 on page 192. Brent oil price assumptions were increased in the short and medium term,  reflecting management's expectation of supply constraints over the next decade due to restrictions on Russian exports, although there has been no significant change to longer term Brent oil forecasts reflecting bp's unchanged view on the longer term speed of the low carbon energy transition. Henry Hub gas price assumptions have increased until 2050, reflecting a view that US domestic gas production will need to grow, in large part to offset the loss of Russian gas exports.\n\nManagement has also revised bp's 'best estimate' discount rate assumptions for value-in-use impairment tests in 2022, as set out in Note 1 on page 192. bp's post-tax nominal weighted average cost of capital, being the starting point for setting discount rates used for impairment testing for oil and gas assets, has increased to 7%, reflecting the impact of observable increases in risk free rates on bp's weighted average cost of capital.\n\nGiven the significance of the price and discount rate assumption revisions during 2022, alongside certain CGU specific new indicators, management has tested all oil and gas CGUs for impairment and/or impairment reversal during the year. Management recorded $2.2 billion of pre-tax oil and gas CGU impairment reversals, principally due to the oil and gas price upward revisions detailed above, and $5.2 billion of pre-tax oil and gas CGU impairment charges due principally to increased expenditure forecasts and the increased discount rate. Further information has been provided in Note 1 on page 192 and Note 4 on page 207.\n\nWe identified three key management estimates in management's determination of the level of impairment charge and/or impairment reversal. These are:\n\nOil and gas prices -  bp's  oil  and  gas price assumptions have a significant impact on many CGU impairment assessments performed across the OP&O and G&LCE segments and are inherently uncertain. The estimation of future prices is subject to increased uncertainty given climate change, the  global  energy  transition,  macro-economic  factors  and  disruption  in  global  supply  due  to  the  Russian-Ukraine  war.  There  is  a  risk  that management do not forecast reasonable 'best estimate' oil and gas price forecasts when assessing CGUs for impairment charge and/or impairment reversal,  leading  to  material  misstatements.  These  price  assumptions  are  highly  judgmental  and  are  pervasive  inputs  to  bp's  oil  and  gas  CGU valuations, such that any misstatements would also aggregate. There is also a risk that management's oil and gas price related disclosures are not reasonable.\n\nAside from 2023 where oil and gas prices reflect near-term expected market conditions, bp's oil and gas price assumptions for value-in use impairment assessments are aligned with bp's investment appraisal assumptions, except that potential future emissions costs that could be borne by bp are included in investment appraisals as bp costs without assuming incremental revenue.",

        "page_content": "As described in Note 1 on page 185, emissions costs forecasts interrelate with bp's oil and gas prices, because bp's price assumptions for valuein-use estimates represent 'net producer prices', i.e., net of any further emissions costs that may be enacted in the future. Management's judgement is that the potential impact of such further emissions costs being borne by producers including bp is not expected to have a material impact on bp's oil and gas CGU carrying values as costs would effectively be borne by oil and gas end users via overall higher commodity prices. There is a risk that management's judgement is not reasonable.\n\nDiscount rates - Given the long timeframes involved, certain CGU impairment assessments are sensitive to the discount rate applied. Discount rates should reflect the return required by the market and the risks inherent in the cash flows being discounted. There is a risk that management does not assume reasonable discount rates, adjusted as applicable for country risks and relevant tax rates, leading to material misstatements. Determining a reasonable discount rate is highly judgmental and, consistent with price assumptions above, the discount rate assumption is also a pervasive input across bp's oil and gas CGU valuations, before adjustments for asset specific risks and tax rates, such that any misstatements would also aggregate.\n\nReserves and resources estimates - A key input to certain CGU impairment assessments is the oil and gas production forecast, which is based on underlying reserves estimates and field specific development assumptions. Certain CGU production forecasts include specific risk adjusted resource volumes, in addition to proven and/or probable reserves estimates, that are inherently less certain than reserves; and assumptions related to these volumes can be particularly judgemental. There is a risk that material misstatements could arise from unreasonable production forecasts for individually material CGUs and/or from the aggregation of systematic flaws in bp's reserves and resources estimation policies across the OP&O and G&LCE segments.\n\nWe identified certain individual CGUs which we determined would be most at risk of material impairment charges as a result of a reasonably possible change in the oil and gas price assumptions. This population includes previously impaired assets which are also at risk of material impairment reversal resulting from potential oil and gas price assumption changes. We identified that a subset of these CGUs were also individually materially sensitive to the discount rate assumption.\n\nWe also identified CGUs which were less sensitive as they would be potentially at risk, in aggregate, to a material impairment by a reasonably possible change in some or all of the key assumptions.  No impairment reversals are available for these CGUs. Further information regarding these sensitivities is given in Note 1 on page 193.\n\nImpairment charge and/or impairment reversal assessments of upstream oil and gas PP&E assets remain a critical audit matter because recoverable values are reliant on forecasts that are inherently judgemental and complex for management to estimate, and the magnitude of the potential misstatement risk is material to the group.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit\n\nWe tested relevant internal controls over the estimation of oil and gas prices, discount rates, and reserve and resources estimates, as well as key internal controls over the performance of the impairment charge and/or impairment reversal assessments where we identified audit risks. In addition, we conducted the following substantive procedures.\n\n## Oil and gas prices\n\n- \u00b7 We independently developed a reasonable range of forecasts based on external data obtained, against which we compared management's oil and gas price assumptions in order to challenge whether they are reasonable.\n- \u00b7 In developing this range, we obtained a variety of reputable and reliable third party forecasts, peer information and other relevant market data.\n- \u00b7 In challenging management's price assumptions, we considered the extent to which they and each of the forecast pricing scenarios obtained from third parties reflect the impact of lower oil and gas demand due to climate change and the energy transition.\n- \u00b7 The 2015 Conference of the Parties (CoP) 21 Paris Agreement goals of 'holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels' was reaffirmed at CoP 27 in Cairo during November 2022. We specifically analysed third party forecasts stated, or interpreted by us, as being consistent with scenarios achieving the Paris 'well below 2\u00b0C goal' and/or '1.5\u00b0C ambition' and evaluated whether they presented contradictory audit evidence.\n- \u00b7 We challenged management's judgement, described in Note 1 on page 185, that the potential impact of further emission costs being borne by producers including bp is not expected to have a material impact on bp's oil and gas CGU carrying values. We inquired of certain third party forecasters included in our reasonable range and read their forecast price reports, to understand whether their oil and gas prices are forecast on a 'net producer prices' basis, (i.e., net of potential future emissions costs that are assumed to be borne by oil and gas end users), consistent with the basis of bp's value-in-use price assumptions.\n- \u00b7 We assessed management's disclosures in Notes 1 and 4, including the sensitivity of forecast revenue cash inflows to lower oil and gas prices and how climate change and the energy transition, potential future emissions costs and/or reduced demand scenarios may impact bp to a greater extent than currently anticipated in bp's value-in-use estimates for oil and gas CGUs.\n\n## Discount rates\n\n- \u00b7 We independently evaluated bp's discount rates used in impairment tests with input from our valuation specialists, against relevant third party market and peer data.\n- \u00b7 We assessed whether specific country risks and tax adjustments were reasonably reflected in bp's discount rates.\n- \u00b7 We challenged and evaluated management's disclosures in Notes 1 and 4 including in relation to the sensitivity of discount rate assumptions.\n\n## Reserves and resources estimates\n\nWith the assistance of our oil and gas reserves specialists we:\n\n- \u00b7 assessed bp's reserves and resources estimation methods and policies;\n- \u00b7 assessed how these policies had been applied to a sample of bp's reserves and resources estimates;\n- \u00b7 read a sample of reports provided by management's external reserves experts and assessed the scope of work and findings of these third parties;\n- \u00b7 assessed the competence, capabilities and objectivity of bp's internal and external reserve experts, through understanding their relevant professional qualifications and experience;\n- \u00b7 compared the production forecasts used in the impairment tests with management's approved reserves and resources estimates; and",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 performed a retrospective assessment to check for indications of estimation bias over time.\n\n## Other procedures\n\n- \u00b7 We challenged and assessed management's CGU determinations including the evaluation of contradictory evidence.\n- \u00b7 We assessed whether bp's impairment methodology was acceptable under IFRS and tested the integrity and mechanical accuracy of certain impairment models.\n- \u00b7 For certain CGUs we challenged and assessed specific valuation input assumptions, including but not limited to material cost and tax forecasts, by comparing forecasts to approved internal and third party budgets, development plans, independent expectations and historical actuals.\n- \u00b7 We assessed whether management's production forecasts are consistent overall with bp's strategy, including the group's expectation to reduce its hydrocarbon production (by around 25% by 2030 relative to 2019 - see page 186).\n- \u00b7 Where relevant, we assessed management's historical forecasting accuracy and whether the estimates had been determined and applied on a consistent basis across the group.\n\n## 2.Decommissioning provisions - Notes 1 and 23\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nA decommissioning provision of $12.3 billion is recorded in the financial statements as at 31 December 2022. The estimation of decommissioning provisions is a highly judgemental area as it involves a number of key estimates related to the cost and timing of decommissioning, in particular inflation and discount rate assumptions. Given management expects hydrocarbon production to be around 25% lower by 2030 relative to 2019 as stated on page 186, consistency of that expectation with the timing of decommissioning expenditure and underlying cost assumptions remains a key consideration.\n\nDue to sustained levels of high global inflation, particularly in key geographies such as the U.S. and U.K., where a majority of bp's future decommissioning cost obligations are located, the impact of inflation on bp's decommissioning provision represents an area of particular risk. Consistent with prior years, management estimates that the average rate of forecast inflation applicable to the substantial majority of bp's decommissioning cost estimates is 1.5%, which is 0.5% lower than its estimated long term general inflation rate of 2%. As a result, the decommissioning inflation rate assumption is particularly judgmental.\n\nThe estimated undiscounted cost of its obligations and the timing of future payment are set out in Note 1 on page 199. Economic factors, future activities and the legislative environments that bp operates in are used to inform cost estimates, whereas the timing of decommissioning activities is dependent on cessation of production (CoP) dates, which are sensitive to changes in bp's price forecasts as price estimates determine economic cut off of oil and gas reserve estimates.\n\nbp increased its discount rate used in calculating its decommissioning provisions from 2.0% as at 31 December 2021 to 3.5% as at 31 December 2022. The increase was primarily driven by the increased US treasury bond rates.\n\nAdditionally, bp is exposed to decommissioning obligations that could revert back to bp in respect of historical divestments to third parties. Judgement is required to assess the potential risk of reversion and if applicable, the estimated exposure, for each historically divested asset. The risk of reversion could be elevated by the potential impact of the energy transition in particular the potential for lower oil and gas prices in the longer term which could result in financial resilience concerns for some industry participants. The risk further increased following a US legal judgement in 2020 which required a specific provision and increased the likelihood of decommissioning liabilities reverting to former owners as part of a bankruptcy proceeding.\n\nProvisions for decommissioning refining assets, not generally recognised on the basis that the potential obligations cannot be measured given their indeterminate settlement dates, might need to be recognised if reductions in demand due to climate change curtail their operational lives. As disclosed in Note 1 on page 199 management concluded that, although obligations may arise if refineries cease manufacturing operations, they would only be recognised at the point when sufficient information became available to determine potential settlement dates. Accordingly, other than where a decision has been made to cease refining operations, no triggers for assessing the need to record a decommissioning provision have been identified.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the group's decommissioning estimate and provisioning process and evaluated the effectiveness of the relevant controls.\n\n## Long term Inflation rate\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the control related to the determination of the decommissioning specific inflation rate assumption.\n- \u00b7 We tested how management derived the decommissioning specific inflation rate assumption of 1.5%, and the evidence on which it is based, by gaining an understanding of the process used by management, testing management's calculations of the assumption, and evaluating the evidence relevant to management's assumption, both supporting and contradictory.\n- \u00b7 As the 1.5% decommissioning specific inflation rate assumption is determined by making an adjustment to management's 2.0% general long term inflation rate assumption, we evaluated, with the help of our valuation specialists, the general long term inflation rate assumption used of 2.0%, comparing it against latest external market data.\n- \u00b7 We made inquiries with, and evaluated the competence, capabilities and objectivity, of management's decommissioning experts who derived the decommissioning specific inflation rate.\n- \u00b7 We inspected analyst forecasts and reports in respect of the future decommissioning market and related costs for evidence of supporting and contradictory evidence, with particular focus on the future rig market.\n- \u00b7 We particularly considered the expectation that demand for oil and gas products and related activities will decrease, primarily in response to climate change and energy transition effects pivoting future energy industry investment and development activity towards renewable sources. We challenged management's assessment of the impact this will have on the decommissioning market and related inflation assumption.\n- \u00b7 We analysed historical trends of rig market rates against oil prices and historical inflation to challenge management's assumption that the decommissioning inflation assumption does not inflate at the same rate as general inflation.\n\n## Financial statements",

We challenged whether the impact of inflation experienced in 2022 was appropriately considered and reflected where relevant within bp's cost assumptions, and also assessed the reasonableness of key cost assumptions with reference to internal and appropriate third party data.\n- \u00b7 We assessed changes in assumptions for the estimated date of decommissioning and evaluated whether CoP dates used for decommissioning estimation are aligned with CoP assumptions in other areas, including PP&E impairment testing and oil and gas reserve estimation.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the accuracy of bp's additional disclosure of the estimated undiscounted cost of its obligations and the timing of future decommissioning payments.\n\n## Discount rates\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the control related to the determination of the discount rate assumption.\n- \u00b7 With the help of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the discount rate assumption used, comparing it against latest external market data.\n\n## Reversion risk\n\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of bp's decommissioning reversion risk assessment process and tested relevant internal controls including those controls over the completeness and accuracy of the previously divested asset data.\n- \u00b7 We challenged and evaluated management's key judgements related to the decommissioning reversion risk and conclusions as to whether any additional provision should be recognised, or specific contingent liability disclosure made. We assessed the relevant internal and external evidence used in forming this judgement, including the financial health of the counterparty or counterparties in the ownership chain for the divested assets and the existence of any other pertinent factors which could indicate a higher probability of decommissioning obligations reverting to bp.\n\n## Potential decommissioning of refinery assets\n\n- \u00b7 We challenged and evaluated management's analysis which supported the judgement that no decommissioning provisions should be recognised in respect of refineries where there is ongoing activity and management has no current intention to cease these activities.\n- \u00b7 We have reviewed analysis undertaken by management, as well as third party studies, of forecast demand for refined products in regions served by bp's refineries. Furthermore, we read external profitability benchmarking which supported a conclusion that the group's remaining refineries would likely remain operational for longer than many of their regional competitors, in the event of refining capacity reductions.\n- \u00b7 We also met with refinery management to understand the potential alternative use cases under consideration for refineries in the future and obtained evidence that management is developing plans for the existing refinery sites remaining in the portfolio which would be compatible with net zero emissions, for instance through the production of alternative low carbon and sustainable fuels.\n\nWe tested the decommissioning models, assessing the application of cost, timing, inflation and discount rate assumptions.\n\n- 3. Accounting for complex transactions executed by the trading and shipping (T&S) function to deliver against the wider group strategy and valuation of commodity financial derivatives, where fraud risks may arise in revenue recognition (potentially impacting all financial statement accounts, in particular finance debt) - Notes 1, 20, 22, 29 and 30 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nIn the normal course of business, T&S enters into a variety of transactions for delivering value across the group's supply chain. Given the nature of these transactions, we direct significant audit effort towards challenging management's adopted accounting treatment and/or valuation estimates.\n\nThroughout the year, we have kept our risk assessment updated by undertaking an iterative review of the underlying portfolio composition. This process facilitated a deeper understanding of the impact of commodity price volatility, demand destruction and the changing structure of the markets resulting from supply dislocations due to the Russian-Ukraine war allowing us to focus our audit effort to areas of highest risk.\n\n## Accounting for structured commodity transactions (SCTs):\n\nT&S may also enter into a variety of transactions which we refer to as structured commodity transactions (SCTs). We generally refer to the following factors to identify a SCT:\n\n- \u00b7 two or more counterparties with non-standard contractual terms\n- \u00b7 reference multiple commodity-based transactions or\n- \u00b7 contractual arrangements entered into in contemplation of each other.\n\nSCTs are often long-dated, can have a significant multi-year financial impact, and may require the use of complex valuation models or unobservable inputs when determining their fair value, in which case they will be classified as level 3 financial instruments under IFRS 13, 'Fair Value Measurement'.\n\nAccounting for SCTs is typically complex and initially involves significant judgment, as a feature of these transactions is that they often include multiple elements that will have a material impact on the presentation and disclosure in the financial statements, including in particular the classification of liabilities as finance debt.\n\n## Valuation of commodity derivatives:\n\nCommodity markets remained volatile during the year on the back of continuing demand uncertainty as a result of the global energy transition, macroeconomic factors and disruptions in global supply due to the Russian-Ukraine war. In response to the volatility observed, we focused our audit efforts on the valuation of all commodity derivatives and designed procedures specifically to test for management bias.",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements\n\nUnlike other financial instruments whose values or inputs are readily observable and therefore more easily independently corroborated, there are certain transactions for which the valuation is inherently more subjective due to the use of either complex valuation models and/or unobservable inputs. These instruments are classified as level 3 financial assets or liabilities. This degree of subjectivity also gives rise to a risk of potential fraud through management incorporating bias in determining fair values.\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, bp's total derivative financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value were $24.4 billion and $26.2 billion, of which level 3 derivative financial assets were $8.8 billion and level 3 derivative financial liabilities were $7.0 billion.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter was addressed in the Audit\n\n## Accounting for structured commodity transactions:\n\nFor structured commodity transactions, we:\n\n- \u00b7 Tested controls related to the accounting for complex transactions.\n- \u00b7 Developed an understanding of the commercial rationale of the transactions through discussions with management and reading transaction documents and executed agreements.\n- \u00b7 Performed a detailed accounting analysis for a sample of SCTs involving significant offtake arrangements and/or significant contractual commitments.\n- \u00b7 Selected a sample of existing working capital arrangements and financing structures to assess whether associated trading activity was in compliance with pre-determined boundary conditions and whether the conclusions reached remained in compliance with relevant accounting standards.\n- \u00b7 For SCTs which were identified during the prior years and that continue through 2022, we have refreshed our assessment in 2022 taking account of any amendments to the contracts. We assessed whether the conclusions reached previously remain appropriate and in accordance with relevant accounting standards.\n\nTo assess the appropriateness of the accounting treatment of SCTs, we embedded technical accounting specialists within the audit team.\n\n.\n\n## Valuation of commodity derivatives:\n\nIn response to the continuing high volatility observed in the market and to test for management bias, we altered the extent and timing of our procedures by performing an independent valuation of a sample of derivatives at 30 June and of distinct samples of both Level 2 and Level 3 derivatives at 30 September and 31 December. In addition, we focused our testing on price inputs where bp has substantial exposure to illiquid (Level 3) or long dated (Level 2) curves.\n\nTo address the complexities associated with auditing the value of level 3 financial instruments, the engagement team included valuation specialists having significant quantitative and modelling expertise to assist in performing our audit procedures. Our valuation audit included the following control and substantive procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the group's valuation controls including the:\n- -model certification control, which is designed to review a model's theoretical soundness and the appropriateness of its valuation methodology and\n- -independent price verification control, which is designed to review the appropriateness of valuation inputs that are not observable and are significant to the financial instrument's valuation.\n- \u00b7 We performed substantive valuation testing procedures at interim and year-end balance sheet dates, including:\n- -comparing management's input assumptions against the expected assumptions of other market participants and observable market data;\n- -evaluating management's valuation methodologies against standard valuation practice and analysing whether a consistent framework is applied across the business period over period; and\n- -engaging our valuation specialists to challenge models, develop fair value estimates and evaluate consistency in management's modelling and input assumptions throughout the year. Our independent estimates were established using independently sourced inputs (where available). We evaluated whether the differences between our independent estimates and management's estimates were within a reasonable range. In situations where we utilised management's inputs, these were compared to external data sources to determine whether they were reasonable.\n\n## 4. Impairment of E&A assets, investments in joint ventures and refinery PP&E as a consequence, inter alia, of climate change and the energy transition - Notes 1, 4, 15 and 16\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nIntangible Assets\n\nThe recoverability of certain of the group's $4.2 billion total exploration and appraisal (E&A) assets capitalised as at 31 December 2022 are potentially exposed to climate change and the global energy transition risk factors (see Note 15). This is because a greater number of E&A projects may not proceed as a consequence of the energy transition leading to lower forecast future oil and gas prices and bp's intention to reduce its hydrocarbon production (by around 25% by 2030 relative to 2019 - see page 186). The determination of whether and when E&A costs should be written off, impaired, or retained on the balance sheet as E&A assets, remains complex and continues to require significant management judgement.\n\n## PP&E and Investment in joint ventures\n\nThe carrying value of bp's refining assets within PP&E may no longer be recoverable, due to changes in supply and demand which arise as a consequence of climate change and the energy transition. Management identified impairment indicators in respect of certain refineries during the year. As a result, impairment tests were performed to assess the recoverability of the refineries' carrying values. As disclosed in Note 4 to the accounts on page 208, management has recorded an impairment charge of $1,366 million in respect of the Gelsenkirchen refinery in Germany, driven by changes in economic assumptions.",

        "page_content": "bp's intention to reduce its hydrocarbon production (by around 25% by 2030 relative to 2019 - see page 186) and the group's wider strategy includes potentially disposing of certain higher emissions intensity upstream oil assets and others. As a consequence, for certain assets and investments judgement is required in the determination of the recoverable amount as to whether it should consider the estimated disposal proceeds from a third party as a key input. Management recorded $2.9 billion of pre-tax impairment charges in 2022 for such potential disposals as described in Note 4. There is a risk that management judgements taken to determine whether impairment charges are required based on bp's view of whether transactions are likely to proceed or not, and bp's strategic appetite regarding the value of disposal consideration that would be accepted, are not reasonable.\n\nThe carrying value of the group's investments in low carbon energy assets may no longer be recoverable due to an increase in the low carbon energy discount rate, project development costs increasing as a result of higher inflation and the impact that the increased activity within the sector, as a result of the energy transition, has had on the demand for low carbon energy supply chain goods and services.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nWe utilised a climate change steering committee comprising a group of senior partners with specific climate change and technical audit and accounting expertise within Deloitte to provide an independent challenge to our key decisions and conclusions with respect to this area.\n\n## Intangible Assets\n\nIn respect of the recoverability of E&A assets capitalised as at 31 December 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of the group's E&A write-off and impairment assessment processes and tested relevant internal controls, which specifically consider climate change related risks.\n- \u00b7 We challenged and evaluated management's key E&A judgements, with regards to the impairment criteria of IFRS 6 and bp's accounting policy. We corroborated key judgements with internal and external evidence for assets that remained on the balance sheet. This included analysing evidence of future E&A plans, budgets and capital allocation decisions, assessing management's key accounting judgement papers, reading meeting minutes and reviewing licence documentation and evidence of active dialogue with partners and regulators including negotiations to renew licences or modify key terms.\n- \u00b7 We assessed whether the progression of any projects that remain on the balance sheet would be inconsistent with elements of bp's strategy and in particular its net zero carbon commitments and bp's intention to reduce its hydrocarbon production (by around 25% by 2030 relative to 2019 - see page 186).\n\n## PP&E and Investment in joint ventures\n\nWe have considered the impact of potential changes in supply and demand on the group's refining portfolio and reviewed internal and external market studies of future supply and demand. In relation to the Gelsenkirchen refinery impairment test, we assessed the valuation methodology, tested the integrity and mechanical accuracy of the impairment model and assessed the appropriateness of key assumptions and inputs, notably forecast refining margins and energy input costs, challenging and evaluating management's assumptions by reference to third party data where available. We also evaluated management's ability to forecast future cash flows and margins by comparing actual results to historical forecasts and tested management's internal controls over the impairment test and related inputs.\n\nWe challenged management's analysis, that identified the specific assets that are likely to be disposed of by bp as part of its strategy. Where relevant, we challenged bp's asset impairment assessments based on their estimated disposal proceeds and whether transactions are judged likely to proceed or not. We obtained evidence of any negotiations with third parties, carefully considered bp's strategic intent in this context and challenged management's assessment of the recoverable amounts for material transactions. We also tested related relevant controls which covered both the recoverable amounts determined and the likelihood of transaction completion.\n\nIn respect of the impairment tests performed on certain low carbon energy investments, we tested the result by:\n\n- \u00b7 Testing the relevant controls over low carbon energy impairment tests including controls over key assumptions and the discount rate\n- \u00b7 Assessing the low carbon energy discount rate with input from our valuation specialists\n- \u00b7 Challenging and evaluating the key assumptions within the impairment tests, which included capital and operating cost assumptions, forecast yield and power price assumptions, debt and interest assumptions, and the applicability of the Inflation Reduction Act legislation on investment credit assumptions and\n- \u00b7 Testing the mechanical accuracy of the impairment models.\n\n/s/ Deloitte LLP\n\nLondon United Kingdom 10 March 2023\n\nWe have served as the bp's auditor since 2018.",

In our opinion, the group maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of  31 December 2022, based on the criteria established in the UK FRC Guidance.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2022, of the group and our report dated 10 March 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n\nAs described in Management's report on internal control over financial reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at 'Archaea Energy' and 'EDF Energy Services', which were acquired on 28 December 2022 and 30 November 2022 respectively. Archaea Energy's financial statements constitute 5.6% and 2.1% of net and total assets, respectively, Nil % of 'Sales and other operating revenues', and 2.2% of 'profit (loss) for the year' of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended 31 December 2022. EDF Energy Services financial statements constitute 0.7% and 1.0% of net and total assets, respectively, Nil % of 'Sales and other operating revenues', and 1.3% of 'profit (loss) for the year' of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended 31 December 2022. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at Archaea Energy and EDF Energy Services.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nThe group's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the group's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the group in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance  about  whether  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in  all  material  respects.  Our  audit  included  obtaining  an understanding  of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting,  assessing  the  risk  that  a  material  weakness  exists,  testing  and  evaluating  the  design  and operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control  based  on  the  assessed  risk,  and  performing  such  other  procedures  as  we  considered  necessary  in  the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for  external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A  company's  internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly  reflect  the  transactions  and  dispositions  of  the  assets  of  the  company;  (2)  provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorizations  of  management  and  directors  of  the  company;  and  (3)  provide  reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness  to  future  periods  are  subject  to  the  risk  that  controls  may  become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in  conditions,  or  that  the  degree  of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n/s/ Deloitte LLP London, United Kingdom\n\n10\u00a0March 2023\n\n- 1.

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\nAuthorization of financial statements and statement of compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of BP p.l.c and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as bp or the group) for the year ended 31 December 2022 were approved and signed by the chief executive officer and chairman on 10 March 2023 having been duly authorized to do so by the board of directors. BP p.l.c. is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom adopted international accounting standards and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and as adopted by the European Union (EU) and in accordance with the provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006 as applicable to companies reporting under international accounting standards. IFRS as adopted by the UK does not differ from IFRS as adopted by the EU. IFRS as adopted by the UK and EU differs in certain respects from IFRS as issued by the IASB. The differences have no impact on the group's consolidated financial statements for the years presented. The significant accounting policies and accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions of the group are set out below.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with IFRS and IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations issued and effective for the year ended 31 December 2022. The accounting policies that follow have been consistently applied to all years presented, except where otherwise indicated.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest million dollars ($ million), except where otherwise indicated.\n\n## Significant accounting policies: use of judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\nInherent in the application of many of the accounting policies used in preparing the consolidated financial statements is the need for bp management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual outcomes could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. The accounting judgements and estimates that have a significant impact on the results of the group are set out in boxed text below, and should be read in conjunction with the information provided in the Notes on financial statements.\n\nThe areas requiring the most significant judgement and estimation in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are: accounting for the investments in Rosneft and Aker BP; the formation of Azule Energy, exploration and appraisal intangible assets; the recoverability of asset carrying values, including the estimation of reserves; supplier financing arrangements; derivative financial instruments; provisions and contingencies; pensions and other post-retirement benefits; and taxation. Judgements and estimates, not all of which are significant, made in assessing the impact of the current economic and geopolitical environment, and climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy on the consolidated financial statements are also set out in boxed text below. Where an estimate has a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year this is specifically noted within the boxed text.\n\n## Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy\n\nClimate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy were considered in preparing the consolidated financial statements. These may have significant impacts on the currently reported amounts of the group's assets and liabilities discussed below and on similar assets and liabilities that may be recognized in the future. The group's assumptions for investment appraisal (see page 28) form part of an investment decision-making framework for currently unsanctioned future capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment, and intangibles including exploration and appraisal assets, that is designed to support the effective and resilient implementation of bp's strategy. The price assumptions used for investment appraisal include oil and gas price assumptions, which are producer prices and are therefore net of any future carbon prices that the purchaser may be required to pay, and an assumption of a single carbon emissions cost imposed on the producer in respect of operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (carbon dioxide and methane) in order to incentivize engineering solutions to mitigate GHG emissions on projects. The group's oil and gas price assumptions for value-in-use impairment testing are aligned with those investment appraisal assumptions, except for 2023 oil and gas prices which reflect near-term market conditions. The assumptions for future carbon emissions costs in value-in-use impairment testing differ from the investment appraisal assumptions and are described below.\n\n## Impairment of property, plant and equipment and goodwill\n\nThe energy transition is likely to impact the future prices of commodities such as oil and natural gas which in turn may affect the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and goodwill in the oil and gas industry. Management's best estimate of oil and natural gas price assumptions for value-inuse impairment testing were revised during 2022. Prices are disclosed in real 2021 terms. The Brent oil assumption from 2024 up to 2030 was increased to $70 per barrel to reflect near-term supply constraints before steadily declining to $45 per barrel by 2050 continuing to reflect the assumption that as the energy system decarbonizes, falling oil demand will cause oil prices to decline. The price assumptions for Henry Hub gas up to 2035 and up to 2050 were increased to $4.00 per mmBtu and $3.50 per mmBtu respectively, reflecting increased demand for US gas production to offset reduced Russian gas flows. The revised assumptions sit within the range of external scenarios considered by management and are in line with a range of transition paths consistent with the temperature goal of the Paris climate change agreement, of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nAs noted above, the group's investment appraisal process includes a single carbon emissions price assumption for the investment economics which is applied to bp's anticipated share of bp's forecast of the investments assets' scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions where they exceed defined thresholds, and is assumed to be payable by bp as the producer or as a non-operator. However, for value-in-use impairment testing on bp's existing cash generating units (CGUs), consistent with all other relevant cash flows estimated, bp is required to reflect management's best estimate of any expected applicable carbon emission costs payable by bp, including where bp is not the operator, in the future for each jurisdiction in which the group has interests. This requires management's best estimate of how future changes to relevant carbon emission cost policies and/or legislation are likely to affect the future cash flows of the group's applicable CGUs, whether currently enacted or not. Future potential carbon pricing and/or costs of carbon emissions allowances are included in the value-in-use calculations to the extent management has sufficient information to make such an estimate. Currently this results in limited application of carbon price assumptions in value-in-use impairment tests given that carbon pricing legislation in most impacted jurisdictions where the group has interests is not in place and there is not sufficient information available as to the relevant policy makers' future intentions regarding carbon pricing to support an estimate.",

        "page_content": "## 1 . Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nWhere we consider that the outcome of a value-in-use impairment test could be significantly affected by a carbon price in place in any jurisdiction, this is incorporated into the value-in use impairment testing cash flows. The most significant instances where a carbon price has been incorporated in this way are for the UK North Sea and Gelsenkirchen refinery, where assumptions of approximately \u00a3100/tCO2e and an average of approximately \u20ac70/tCO2e were applied in the 2022 value-in-use impairment tests respectively.\n\nHowever, as bp's forecast future prices are producer prices, the group considers it reasonable to assume that if, in addition to the costs already in place, further scope 1 and 2 emission costs were partially to be borne directly by oil and gas producers including bp in future and the prevalence of such costs were to become widespread, the gross oil and gas prices realised by producers would be correspondingly higher over the long term, resulting in no expected overall materially negative impacts on the group's net cash flows. See significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values for further information including sensitivity analysis in relation to reasonably possible changes in the price assumptions and carbon costs.\n\nProduction assumptions within upstream property, plant and equipment and goodwill value-in-use impairment tests reflect management's current best estimate of future production of the existing upstream portfolio. The group sees the expected reduction in upstream hydrocarbon production by around 25% by 2030 from its 2019 baseline (see page 11) being achieved through future active management, including divestments, and high-grading of the portfolio. Changes in upstream production since 2019 will be included in the best estimate to the extent the divestments have been announced or completed however, as the specific future changes to the remainder of the portfolio are not yet known, the current best estimate used for accounting purposes does not include the full extent of the expected upstream production reduction. See significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values and Note 14 for sensitivity analyses in relation to reasonably possible changes in production for upstream oil and gas properties and goodwill respectively.\n\nImpairment reversals were recognized on certain upstream oil and gas properties partly as a result of the higher near-term assumptions. See Note 4 for further information.\n\nFor the customers & products segment, though the energy transition may impact demand for certain refined products in the future, management anticipates sufficiently robust demand for the remainder of each refinery's useful life.\n\nManagement will continue to review price assumptions as the energy transition progresses and this may result in impairment charges or reversals in the future.\n\n## Exploration and appraisal intangible assets\n\nThe energy transition may affect the future development or viability of exploration prospects. A significant proportion of the group's exploration and appraisal intangible assets were written off in 2020 and the recoverability of the remaining intangibles was considered during 2022. No significant writeoffs were identified. These assets will continue to be assessed as the energy transition progresses. See significant judgement: exploration and appraisal intangible assets and Note 8 for further information.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment - depreciation and expected useful lives\n\nThe energy transition may curtail the expected useful lives of oil and gas industry assets thereby accelerating depreciation charges. However, a significant majority of bp's existing upstream oil and natural gas properties are likely to be fully depreciated within the next 10 years and, as outlined in bp's strategy, oil and natural gas production will remain an important part of bp's business activities over that period. The significant majority of refining assets, recognized on the group's balance sheet at 31 December 2022 that are subject to depreciation, will be depreciated within the next 12 years; demand for refined products is expected to remain sufficient to support the remaining useful lives of existing assets. Therefore, management does not expect the useful lives of bp's reported property, plant and equipment to change and do not consider this to be a significant accounting judgement or estimate. Significant capital expenditure is still required for ongoing projects as well as renewal and/or replacement of aged assets and therefore the useful lives of future capital expenditure may be different. See significant accounting policy: property, plant and equipment for more information.\n\n## Provisions: decommissioning\n\nThe energy transition may bring forward the decommissioning of oil and gas industry assets thereby increasing the present value of associated decommissioning provisions. The majority of bp's existing upstream oil and gas properties are expected to start decommissioning within the next two decades. The group's expectation to reduce its upstream hydrocarbon production by around 25% by 2030 from its 2019 baseline (see page 11) is expected to be achieved through future active management, including divestments, and high-grading of the portfolio. Any resulting increases or decreases to the weighted average timing of decommissioning will be driven by the profile of assets held in the revised portfolio. Currently, the expected timing of decommissioning expenditures for the upstream oil and gas assets in the group's portfolio has not materially been brought forward. Management does not expect a reasonably possible change of two years in the expected timing of all decommissioning to have a material effect on the upstream decommissioning provisions, assuming cash flows remain unchanged.\n\nDecommissioning cost estimates are based on the known regulatory and external environment. These cost estimates may change in the future, including as a result of the transition to a lower carbon economy. For refineries, decommissioning provisions are generally not recognized as the associated obligations have indeterminate settlement dates, typically driven by the cessation of manufacturing. Management will continue to review facts and circumstances to assess if decommissioning provisions need to be recognized. Decommissioning provisions relating to refineries at 31 December 2022 are not material. See significant judgements and estimates: provisions for further information.",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements\n\n## 1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nJudgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of the geopolitical and economic environment\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the following areas involving judgement and estimates were identified as most relevant with regards to the impact of the current geopolitical and economic environment.\n\n## Oil and gas price assumptions\n\nThe near-term oil and gas price assumptions applied in value-in-use impairment testing have been increased to reflect current supply constraints and increased demand for gas to replace Russian supply. See significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values for further information.\n\n## Discount rate assumptions\n\nThe discount rates used for impairment testing and provisions were reassessed during the year in light of changing economic and geopolitical outlooks. The nominal discount rate applied to provisions was increased twice during the year to reflect rising US Treasury yields. The principal impact of these rate increases was a $3.2 billion decrease in the decommissioning provision with an associated decrease in the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment of $2.5 billion and a pre-tax credit to the income statement of $0.7 billion. Impairment discount rates were also increased from those reported in 2021. See significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values and provisions for further information.\n\n## Pensions and other post-retirement benefits\n\nThe volatility in the financial markets during 2022 impacted the assumptions used for determining the fair value of plan assets and the present value of defined benefit obligations in the group's defined benefit pension plans. See significant estimate: pensions and other post-retirement benefits and Note 24 for further information.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of BP p.l.c. and its subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December each year. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the group obtains control, including when control is obtained via potential voting rights, and continue to be consolidated until the date that control ceases.\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies. Intra-group balances and transactions, including unrealized profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated. Unrealized losses are eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity in subsidiaries that is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to bp shareholders. Included within noncontrolling interests are perpetual subordinated hybrid securities issued by subsidiaries and for which the group has the unconditional right to avoid transferring cash or another financial asset to the holders. Profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders is adjusted to reflect the coupon/interest related to these hybrid securities whether or not such distribution has been deferred.\n\n## Interests in other entities\n\nBusiness combinations and goodwill\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their fair values at the acquisition date.\n\nGoodwill is initially measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount recognized for any non-controlling interest and the acquisition-date fair values of any previously held interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The amount recognized for any non-controlling interest is measured at the present ownership's proportionate share in the recognized amounts of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. At the acquisition date, any goodwill acquired is allocated to each of the cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, expected to benefit from the combination's synergies. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill arising on business combinations prior to 1 January 2003 is stated at the previous carrying amount under UK generally accepted accounting practice, less subsequent impairments.\n\nGoodwill may arise upon investments in joint ventures and associates, being the surplus of the cost of investment over the group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities. Any such goodwill is recorded within the corresponding investment in joint ventures and associates.\n\nGoodwill may also arise upon acquisition of interests in joint operations that meet the definition of a business. The amount of goodwill separately recognized is the excess of the consideration transferred over the group's share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities.\n\n## Interests in joint arrangements\n\nThe results, assets and liabilities of joint ventures are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting as described below.\n\nCertain of the group's activities, particularly in the oil production & operations and gas & low carbon energy segments, are conducted through joint operations. bp recognizes, on a line-by-line basis in the consolidated financial statements, its share of the assets, liabilities and expenses of these joint operations incurred jointly with the other partners, along with the group's income from the sale of its share of the output and any liabilities and expenses that the group has incurred in relation to the joint operation.\n\nFor joint arrangements in a separate entity, judgement may be required as to whether the arrangement should be classified as a joint venture or if the legal form, contractual arrangements or other facts and circumstances indicate that the group has rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities of the arrangement, rather than rights to the net assets, and therefore should be classified as a joint operation. No such judgement made by the group is considered significant.\n\n## Interests in associates\n\nThe results, assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting as described below.",

        "page_content": "## 1 . Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nSignificant judgement: investment in Aker BP\n\nJudgement is required in assessing the level of control or influence over another entity in which the group holds an interest. For bp, the judgement that the group continues to have significant influence over Aker BP, a Norwegian oil and gas company, following completion of Aker BP's acquisition of Lundin Energy's oil and gas business, is significant.\n\nAs a consequence of this judgement, bp uses the equity method of accounting for its investment and bp's share of Aker BP's oil and natural gas reserves is included in the group's estimated net proved reserves of equity-accounted entities. If significant influence was not present, the investment would be accounted for as an investment in an equity instrument measured at fair value as described under 'Financial assets' below and no share of Aker BP's oil and natural gas reserves would be reported.\n\nSignificant influence is defined in IFRS as the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control of those decisions. Significant influence is presumed when an entity owns 20% or more of the voting power of the investee. Significant influence is presumed not to be present when an entity owns less than 20% of the voting power of the investee. IFRS identifies several indicators that may provide evidence of significant influence, including representation on the board of directors of the investee and participation in policy-making processes.\n\nbp owned 27.85% of the voting shares of Aker BP at 31 December 2021 and significant influence was presumed. On completion of Aker BP's acquisition of Lundin Energy's oil and gas business on 30 June 2022 , bp's interest was diluted to 15.9% of the voting shares of Aker BP as a result of new Aker BP shares being issued as partial consideration to Lundin Energy shareholders. bp owned 15.9% of the voting shares at 31 December 2022.\n\nbp's group chief financial officer, Murray Auchincloss, has been a member of the Aker BP board since 2017. bp's other nominated director, Kate Thomson has been a member of the Aker BP board since formation of that company in 2016. She is also a member of the Aker BP board's Audit and Risk Committee. bp also holds the voting rights at general meetings of shareholders conferred by its stake in Aker BP. bp's management considers, therefore, that the group retained significant influence, as defined by IFRS, over Aker BP following the acquisition of Lundin Energy's oil and gas business and continues to have significant influence at 31 December 2022.\n\n## Significant judgements and estimate: investment in Rosneft\n\nOn 27 February 2022, bp announced it will exit its shareholding in Rosneft and bp's two nominated Rosneft directors both stepped down from Rosneft's board. As a result, the significant judgement on significant influence over Rosneft was reassessed and a new significant estimate was identified for the fair value of bp's equity investment in Rosneft. From that date, bp accounts for its interest in Rosneft as a financial asset measured at fair value within 'Other investments'. Russia has implemented a number of counter-sanctions including restrictions on the divestment of Russian assets by foreign investors. Further, bp is not able to sell its Rosneft shares on the Moscow Stock Exchange and is unable to ascribe probabilities to possible outcomes of any exit process. As a result, it is considered that any measure of fair value, other than $nil, would be subject to such high measurement uncertainty that no estimate would provide useful information even if it were accompanied by a description of the estimate made in producing it and an explanation of the uncertainties that affect the estimate. Accordingly, it is not currently possible to estimate any carrying value other than $nil when determining the measurement of the interest in Rosneft as at 31 December 2022. Events or outcomes within the next financial year, that are different to those outlined above, could materially change the fair value of the investment.\n\nDuring 2022, Rosneft has held shareholder meetings to approve resolutions to pay dividends. bp did not participate in those meetings. In line with the resolutions, bp would be entitled to dividend income.  Russia has imposed restrictions on the payments of dividends to certain foreign shareholders, including those based in the UK, requiring such dividends to be paid in roubles into restricted bank accounts and a requirement for approval of the Russian government for transfers from any such bank accounts out of Russia. Given the restrictions applicable to such accounts, management has made the significant judgement that the criteria for recognizing any dividend income from Rosneft for the year to 31 December 2022 have not been met.\n\nSince the first quarter 2022, bp has also determined that its other businesses with Rosneft within Russia, which are included in the oil production & operations segment also have a fair value of $nil and are subject to similar sanctions and restrictions with respect to the receipt of dividends as described above. Management considers that the criteria for recognizing dividend income from other businesses with Rosneft within Russia that declared a dividend during 2022 have not been met.\n\nThe total pre-tax charge during the year-ended 31 December 2022 relating to bp's investment in Rosneft and other businesses with Rosneft in Russia is $25,520 million.\n\n## Significant judgement: formation of Azule Energy\n\nOn 1 August 2022, Azule Energy, an independent incorporated 50:50 joint venture, between bp and Eni, was formed through the combination of the two companies' Angolan businesses. As part of the consideration for contributing its assets, bp received 500,000 shares in Azule Energy. The group determined that the fair value of these shares at the date of the transaction was $6.9 billion and the transaction resulted in a gain on disposal of $3.9 billion, of which 50% has been deferred against the investment on the balance sheet and will be amortised over time, consistent with bp's accounting policy for unrealized gains on transactions between the group and equity-accounted entities. The fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis with judgments over the assumptions including capital expenditure, costs, production and commodity price forecasts, and a post-tax discount rate that would be applied by a market participant.\n\n## The equity method of accounting\n\nUnder the equity method, an investment is carried on the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the group's share of net assets of the entity, less distributions received and less any impairment in value of the investment. Loans advanced to equity-accounted entities that have the characteristics of equity financing are also included in the investment on the group balance sheet. The group income statement reflects the group's share of the results after tax of the equity-accounted entity, adjusted to account for depreciation, amortization and any impairment of the equity-accounted entity's assets based on their fair values at the date of acquisition. The group statement of comprehensive income includes the group's share of the equityaccounted entity's other comprehensive income. The group's share of amounts recognized directly in equity by an equity-accounted entity is recognized in the group's statement of changes in equity.\n\nFinancial statements of equity-accounted entities are typically prepared for the same reporting year as the group. Where material differences arise in the accounting policies used by the equity-accounted entity and those used by bp, adjustments are made to those financial statements to bring the accounting policies used into line with those of the group. Unrealized gains on transactions, apart from those that meet the definition of a derivative, between the group and its equity-accounted entities are eliminated to the extent of the group's interest in the equity-accounted entity. This includes unrealized gains arising on contribution of a business on formation of an equity-accounted entity.",

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Segmental reporting\n\nThe group's operating segments are established on the basis of those components of the group that are evaluated regularly by the chief executive officer, bp's chief operating decision maker, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.\n\nThe accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the group's accounting policies described in this note, except that IFRS requires that the measure of profit or loss disclosed for each operating segment is the measure that is provided regularly to the chief operating decision maker. For bp, this measure of profit or loss is replacement cost profit before interest and tax which reflects the replacement cost of inventories sold in the period and is arrived at by excluding inventory holding gains and losses from profit before interest and tax. Replacement cost profit for the group is not a recognized measure under IFRS. bp changed its segmental reporting during 2022, see 'Changes in segmentation' below.\n\nFor further information see Note 5.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nIn individual subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency of those entities at the spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Any resulting exchange differences are included in the income statement, unless hedge accounting is applied. Non-monetary items, other than those measured at fair value, are not retranslated subsequent to initial recognition.\n\nIn the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of non-US dollar functional currency subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates, and related goodwill, are translated into US dollars at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. The results and cash flows of non-US dollar functional currency subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into US dollars using average rates of exchange. In the consolidated financial statements, exchange adjustments arising when the opening net assets and the profits for the year retained by non-US dollar functional currency subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into US dollars are recognized in a separate component of equity and reported in other comprehensive income. Exchange gains and losses arising on long-term intra-group foreign currency borrowings used to finance the group's non-US dollar investments are also reported in other comprehensive income if the borrowings form part of the net investment in the subsidiary, joint venture or associate. On disposal or for certain partial disposals of a non-US dollar functional currency subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the related accumulated exchange gains and losses recognized in equity are reclassified from equity to the income statement.\n\n## Non-current assets held for sale\n\nNon-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\n\nSignificant non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification as held for sale, and actions required to complete the plan of sale should indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or amortized, and equity accounting of associates and joint ventures is ceased once classified as held for sale.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets, other than goodwill, include expenditure on the exploration for and evaluation of oil and natural gas resources, biogas rights agreements, digital assets, patents, licences and trademarks and are stated at the amount initially recognized, less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses.\n\nIntangible assets are carried initially at cost unless acquired as part of a business combination. Any such asset is measured at fair value at the date of the business combination and is recognized separately from goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights.\n\nIntangible assets with a finite life, other than capitalized exploration and appraisal costs as described below, are amortized on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives. For patents, licences and trademarks, expected useful life is the shorter of the duration of the legal agreement and economic useful life, and can range from three to fifteen years.  The expected useful life of biogas rights agreements is the shorter of the duration of the legal agreement and economic useful life and can be up to 50 years. Digital asset costs generally have a useful life of three to five years.\n\nThe expected useful lives of assets and the amortization method are reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful lives or the amortization method are accounted for prospectively.\n\n- Oil and natural gas exploration and appraisal expenditure\n\nOil and natural gas exploration and appraisal expenditure is accounted for using the principles of the successful efforts method of accounting as described below.\n\n## Licence and property acquisition costs\n\nExploration licence and leasehold property acquisition costs are capitalized within intangible assets and are reviewed at each reporting date to confirm that there is no indication that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. This review includes confirming that exploration drilling is still under way or planned or that it has been determined, or work is under way to determine, that the discovery is economically viable based on a range of technical and commercial considerations, and sufficient progress is being made on establishing development plans and timing. If no future activity is planned, the remaining balance of the licence and property acquisition costs is written off. Lower value licences are pooled and amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of exploration. Upon internal approval for development and recognition of proved or sanctioned probable reserves of oil and natural gas, the relevant expenditure is transferred to property, plant and equipment.\n\n## Exploration and appraisal expenditure\n\nGeological and geophysical exploration costs are recognized as an expense as incurred. Costs directly associated with an exploration well are initially capitalized as an intangible asset until the drilling of the well is complete and the results have been evaluated. These costs include employee remuneration, materials and fuel used, rig costs and payments made to contractors. If potentially commercial quantities of hydrocarbons are not found, the exploration well costs are written off. If hydrocarbons are found and, subject to further appraisal activity, are likely to be capable of commercial development, the costs continue to be carried as an asset. If it is determined that development will not occur, that is, the efforts are not successful, then the costs are expensed.",

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nCosts directly associated with appraisal activity undertaken to determine the size, characteristics and commercial potential of a reservoir following the initial discovery of hydrocarbons, including the costs of appraisal wells where hydrocarbons were not found, are initially capitalized as an intangible asset. Upon internal approval for development and recognition of proved or sanctioned probable reserves, the relevant expenditure is transferred to property, plant and equipment. If development is not approved and no further activity is expected to occur, then the costs are expensed.\n\nThe determination of whether potentially economic oil and natural gas reserves have been discovered by an exploration well is usually made within one year of well completion, but can take longer, depending on the complexity of the geological structure. Exploration wells that discover potentially economic quantities of oil and natural gas and are in areas where major capital expenditure (e.g. an offshore platform or a pipeline) would be required before production could begin, and where the economic viability of that major capital expenditure depends on the successful completion of further exploration or appraisal work in the area, remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as such work is under way or firmly planned.\n\n## Significant judgement: exploration and appraisal intangible assets\n\nJudgement is required to determine whether it is appropriate to continue to carry costs associated with exploration wells and exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells on the balance sheet. This includes costs relating to exploration licences or leasehold property acquisitions. It is not unusual to have such costs remaining suspended on the balance sheet for several years while additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and natural gas field is performed or while the optimum development plans and timing are established. The costs are carried based on the current regulatory and political environment or any known changes to that environment. All such carried costs are subject to regular technical, commercial and management review on at least an annual basis to confirm the continued intent to develop, or otherwise extract value from, the discovery. Where this is no longer the case, the costs are immediately expensed.\n\nThe carrying amount of capitalized costs are included in Note 8.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment owned by the group is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, the initial estimate of any decommissioning obligation, if applicable, and, for assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, directly attributable general or specific finance costs. The purchase price or construction cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset.\n\nExpenditure on major maintenance refits or repairs comprises the cost of replacement assets or parts of assets, inspection costs and overhaul costs. Where an asset or part of an asset that was separately depreciated is replaced and it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the group, the expenditure is capitalized and the carrying amount of the replaced asset is derecognized. Inspection costs associated with major maintenance programmes are capitalized and amortized over the period to the next inspection. Overhaul costs for major maintenance programmes, and all other maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nExpenditure on the construction, installation and completion of infrastructure facilities such as platforms, pipelines and the drilling of development wells, including service and unsuccessful development or delineation wells, is capitalized within property, plant and equipment and is depreciated from the commencement of production.\n\nOil and natural gas properties, including certain related pipelines, are depreciated using a unit-of-production method. The cost of producing wells is amortized over proved developed reserves. Licence acquisition, common facilities and future decommissioning costs are amortized over total proved reserves. The unit-of-production rate for the depreciation of common facilities takes into account expenditures incurred to date, together with estimated future capital expenditure expected to be incurred relating to as yet undeveloped reserves expected to be processed through these common facilities. Information on the carrying amounts of the group's oil and natural gas properties, together with the amounts recognized in the income statement as depreciation, depletion and amortization is contained in Note 12 and Note 5 respectively.\n\nEstimates of oil and natural gas reserves determined in accordance with US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulations, including the application of prices using 12-month historical price data in assessing the commerciality of technical volumes, are typically used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization charges for the group's oil and gas properties. Therefore, where this approach is adopted, charges are not dependent on management forecasts of future oil and gas prices.\n\nHowever, for certain oil and natural gas assets, the use of reserves determined in accordance with SEC regulations would result in a charge that is not reflective of the pattern in which the future economic benefits are expected to be consumed. In these limited instances other approaches are applied to determine the reserves base used to calculate depreciation, depletion and amortization, including the use of management's best estimate of price assumptions as disclosed in Significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values, to determine the commerciality of technical proved reserves.\n\nThe impact of changes in estimated proved reserves is dealt with prospectively by amortizing the remaining carrying value of the asset over the expected future production.\n\nThe estimation of oil and natural gas reserves and bp's process to manage reserves bookings is described in Supplementary information on oil and natural gas on page 263, which is unaudited. Details on bp's proved reserves and production compliance and governance processes are provided on page 361. The 2022 movements in proved reserves are reflected in the tables showing movements in oil and natural gas reserves by region in Supplementary information on oil and natural gas (unaudited) on page 263.",

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nOther property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life. The typical useful lives of the group's other property, plant and equipment on initial recognition are as follows:\n\nLand improvements\n\n15\u00a0to\u00a025\u00a0years\n\nBuildings\n\n20\u00a0to\u00a050\u00a0years\n\nRefineries\n\n20\u00a0to\u00a030 years\n\nPipelines\n\n10 to 50 years\n\nService stations\n\n15 years\n\nOffice equipment\n\n3 to 10 years\n\nFixtures and fittings\n\n5 to 15 years\n\nThe expected useful lives and depreciation method of property, plant and equipment are reviewed on an annual basis and, if necessary, changes in useful lives or the depreciation method are accounted for prospectively. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item) is included in the income statement in the period in which the item is derecognized.\n\n## Impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill, and equity-accounted entities\n\nThe group assesses assets or groups of assets, called cash-generating units (CGUs), for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or CGU may not be recoverable; for example, changes in the group's business plans, plans to dispose rather than retain assets, changes in the group's assumptions about commodity prices, low plant utilization, evidence of physical damage or, for oil and gas assets, significant downward revisions of estimated reserves or increases in estimated future development expenditure or decommissioning costs. If any such indication of impairment exists, the group makes an estimate of the asset's or CGU's recoverable amount. Individual assets are grouped into CGUs for impairment assessment purposes at the lowest level at which there are identifiable cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other groups of assets. A CGU's recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use. If it is probable that the value of the CGU will be primarily recovered through a disposal transaction, the expected disposal proceeds are considered in determining the recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of a CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the CGU is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.\n\nThe business segment plans, which are approved on an annual basis by senior management, are the primary source of information for the determination of value in use. They contain forecasts for oil and natural gas production, power generation, refinery throughputs, sales volumes for various types of refined products (e.g. gasoline and lubricants), revenues, costs and capital expenditure. Carbon taxes and costs of emissions allowances are included in estimates of future cash flows, where applicable, based on the regulatory environment in each jurisdiction in which the group operates. As an initial step in the preparation of these plans, various assumptions regarding market conditions, such as oil prices, natural gas prices, power prices, refining margins, refined product margins and cost inflation rates are set by senior management. These assumptions take account of existing prices, global supply-demand equilibrium for oil and natural gas, other macroeconomic factors and historical trends and variability. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are adjusted for the risks specific to the asset group to the extent that they are not already reflected in the discount rate and are discounted to their present value typically using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money.\n\nFair value less costs of disposal is the price that would be received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction between market participants and does not reflect the effects of factors that may be specific to the group and not applicable to entities in general. Fair value may be determined by reference to agreed or expected sales proceeds, recent market transactions for similar assets or using discounted cash flow analyses. Where discounted cash flow analyses are used to calculate fair value less costs of disposal, estimates are made about the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset, CGU or group of CGUs containing goodwill and the test is performed on a post-tax basis.\n\nAn assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. A previously recognized impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset's or CGU's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognized. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to the lower of its recoverable amount and the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset or CGU in prior years. Impairment reversals are recognized in profit or loss. After a reversal, the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset's or CGU's revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.\n\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the recoverable amount of the group of CGUs to which the goodwill relates should be assessed. In assessing whether goodwill has been impaired, the carrying amount of the group of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is compared with its recoverable amount. Where the recoverable amount of the group of CGUs is less than the carrying amount (including goodwill), an impairment loss is recognized. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.\n\nThe group assesses investments in equity-accounted entities for impairment whenever there is objective evidence that the investment is impaired, after recognizing its share of any losses of the equity-accounted entity itself. If any such objective evidence of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is compared with its recoverable amount, being the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. If the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the investment is written down to its recoverable amount.",

        "page_content": "## 1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nSignificant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values\n\nDetermination as to whether, and by how much, an asset, CGU, or group of CGUs containing goodwill is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters such as the effects of inflation and deflation on operating expenses, discount rates, capital expenditure, carbon pricing (where applicable), production profiles, reserves and resources, and future commodity prices, including the outlook for global or regional market supply-anddemand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, power and refined products. Judgement is required when determining the appropriate grouping of assets into a CGU or the appropriate grouping of CGUs for impairment testing purposes. For example, individual oil and gas properties may form separate CGUs whilst certain oil and gas properties with shared infrastructure may be grouped together to form a single CGU. Alternative groupings of assets or CGUs may result in a different outcome from impairment testing. See Note 14 for details on how these groupings have been determined in relation to the impairment testing of goodwill.\n\nAs described above, the recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. Fair value less costs of disposal may be determined based on expected sales proceeds or similar recent market transaction data.\n\nDetails of impairment charges and reversals recognized in the income statement are provided in Note 4 and details on the carrying amounts of assets are shown in Note 12, Note 14 and Note 15.\n\nThe estimates for assumptions made in impairment tests in 2022 relating to discount rates and oil and gas properties are discussed below. Changes in the economic environment including as a result of the energy transition or other facts and circumstances may necessitate revisions to these assumptions and could result in a material change to the carrying values of the group's assets within the next financial year.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nFor discounted cash flow calculations, future cash flows are adjusted for risks specific to the CGU. Value-in-use calculations are typically discounted using a pre-tax discount rate based upon the cost of funding the group derived from an established model, adjusted to a pre-tax basis and incorporating a market participant capital structure and country risk premiums. Fair value less costs of disposal discounted cash flow calculations use a post-tax discount rate.\n\nThe discount rates applied in impairment tests are reassessed each year and, in 2022, the post-tax discount rate was 7% (2021 6%) other than for low carbon energy assets. Where the CGU is located in a country that was judged to be higher risk an additional premium of 1% to 2% was reflected in the post-tax discount rate (2021 1% to 3%). The judgement of classifying a country as higher risk and the applicable premium takes into account various economic and geopolitical factors. The pre-tax discount rate, other than for low carbon energy assets, typically ranged from 7% to 18% (2021 7% to 15%) depending on the risk premium and applicable tax rate in the geographic location of the CGU. For low carbon energy assets where the risk profile of expected cash flows supports a lower rate, the post-tax discount rate for fair value less costs of disposal impairment tests was 6%.\n\n## Oil and natural gas properties\n\nFor oil and natural gas properties in the oil production & operations and gas & low carbon energy segments, expected future cash flows are estimated using management's best estimate of future oil and natural gas prices, production and reserves and certain resources volumes. Forecast cash flows include the impact of all approved emission reduction projects. The estimated future level of production in all impairment tests is based on assumptions about future commodity prices, production and development costs, field decline rates, current fiscal regimes and other factors.\n\nIn 2022, the group identified oil and gas properties in these segments with carrying amounts totalling $11,652 million (2021 $26,341 million) where the headroom, based on the most recent impairment test performed in the year on those assets, was less than or equal to 20% of the carrying value. A change in the discount rate, reserves, resources or the oil and gas price assumptions in the next financial year may result in a recoverable amount of one or more of these assets above or below the current carrying amount and therefore there is a risk of impairment reversals or charges in that period. Management considers that reasonably possible changes in the discount rate or forecast revenue, arising from a change in oil and natural gas prices and/or production could result in a material change in their carrying amounts within the next financial year, see Sensitivity analyses, below.\n\nThe recoverability of intangible exploration and appraisal expenditure is covered under Oil and natural gas exploration, appraisal and development expenditure above.\n\n## Oil and natural gas prices\n\nThe price assumptions used for value-in-use impairment testing are based on those used for investment appraisal. bp's carbon emissions cost assumptions and their interrelationship with oil and gas prices are described in 'Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy' on page 185. The investment appraisal price assumptions are recommended by the senior vice president economic & energy insights after considering a range of external price sets, and supply and demand profiles associated with various energy transition scenarios. They are reviewed and approved by management. As a result of the current uncertainty over the pace of transition to lower-carbon supply and demand and the social, political and environmental actions that will be taken to meet the goals of the Paris climate change agreement, the scenarios considered include those where those goals are met as well as those where they are not met.\n\nDuring the year, bp's price assumptions applied in value-in-use impairment testing (in real 2021 terms) for Brent oil from 2024 up to 2030 was increased to $70 per barrel to reflect near term supply constraints before steadily declining to $45 per barrel by 2050 continuing to reflect the assumption that as the energy system decarbonises, falling oil demand will cause oil prices to decline. The price assumptions for Henry Hub gas up to 2035 and up to 2050 were increased to $4.00 per mmBtu and $3.50 per mmBtu respectively to reflect the increased demand for US gas production to offset reduced Russian gas flows. These price assumptions are derived from the central case investment appraisal assumptions, adjusted where applicable to reflect short-term market conditions (see page 28). A summary of the group's revised price assumptions for Brent oil and Henry Hub gas, applied in 2022 and 2021, in real 2021 terms, is provided below. The assumptions represent management's best estimate of future prices at the balance sheet date, which sit within the range of external scenarios considered as appropriate for the purpose. They are considered by bp to be in line with a range of transition paths consistent with the temperature goal of the Paris climate change agreement, of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above preindustrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. However, they do not correspond to any specific Paris-consistent scenario. An inflation rate of 2% (2021 2%) is applied to determine the price assumptions in nominal terms.\n\nThe majority of bp's reserves and resources that support the carrying value of the group's existing oil and gas properties are expected to be produced over the next 10 years.\n\nThe recoverability of deferred tax assets is also affected by the group's oil and natural gas price assumptions as these could impact the estimate of future taxable profits.

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n| 2022 price assumptions   |    2023 |    2025 |    2030 |    2040 |   2050 |\n|--------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|\n| Brent oil ($/bbl)        |   77    |   70    |   70    |   58    |   45   |\n| Henry Hub gas ($/mmBtu)  |    4    |    4    |    4    |    3.5  |    3.5 |\n| 2021 price assumptions   | 2022    | 2025    | 2030    | 2040    | 2050   |\n| Brent oil ($/bbl)        |   71    |   61    |   61    |   56    |   46   |\n| Henry Hub gas ($/mmBtu)  |    4.08 |    3.06 |    3.06 |    3.06 |    2.8 |\n\nGlobal oil production increased by 4.9% in 2022. Despite western sanctions on Russian oil exports, Russian export volumes remain at 97% of pre-invasion levels, as oil shipments to the EU and OECD Asian countries are redirected to China, India, and T\u00fcrkiye. Global oil demand continued its post-COVID-19 recovery, increasing by 2.3% in 2022. Europe's energy crisis, a strong US dollar, and persistent COVID-19 lockdowns in China all contributed to slower energy demand growth and weaker oil demand growth. Brent increased by $30 per barrel in 2022 as a result of the rebound in oil demand and the oil risk premium associated with the Russia-Ukraine war. bp's long-term assumption for oil prices is lower than the 2022 price average, based on the judgement that, in the long term, oil demand is likely to fall so that the price levels needed to encourage sufficient investment to meet declining global oil demand is also lower.\n\nUS gas prices increased around two-thirds to $6.4 per mmBtu in 2022. The higher prices reflect much tighter demand supply balance for most of 2022. Through April, lower production particularly in Appalachia, depleted gas stocks to 90% of the five-year average, increasing prices. Thereafter, while production recovered, a record warm summer and lower coal stocks at power plants increased the call on gas fired generation, keeping demand strong and preventing gas stocks from rebuilding, This, was despite an outage at the Freeport LNG terminal since June reducing the demand for LNG exports. Further, industrial demand was further boosted by geopolitical disruptions that increased global product prices, favouring US firms due to relatively lower feedstock costs. Prices only moderated in the fourth quarter when growth in production and moderate weather allowed gas inventories to be replenished. The level of US gas prices in 2022 is above bp's long term price assumption based on the judgement of the price level required to incentivize new production.\n\n## Oil and natural gas reserves\n\nIn addition to oil and natural gas prices, significant technical and commercial assessments are required to determine the group's estimated oil and natural gas reserves. Reserves estimates are regularly reviewed and updated. Factors such as the availability of geological and engineering data, reservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity and drilling of new wells all impact on the determination of the group's estimates of its oil and natural gas reserves. bp bases its reserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and commercial assessments based on conventional industry practice and regulatory requirements.\n\nReserves assumptions for value-in-use tests reflect the reserves and resources that management currently intend to develop. The recoverable amount of oil and gas properties is determined using a combination of inputs including reserves, resources and production volumes. Risk factors may be applied to reserves and resources which do not meet the criteria to be treated as proved or probable.\n\n## Sensitivity analyses\n\nManagement considers discount rates, oil and natural gas prices and production to be the key sources of estimation uncertainty in determining the recoverable amount of upstream oil and gas assets. The sensitivity analyses below, in addition to covering the key sources of estimation uncertainty, also indicate how the energy transition, potential future carbon emissions costs for operational GHG emissions and/or reduced demand for oil and gas may further impact forecast revenue cash inflows to a greater extent than currently anticipated in the group's value-in-use estimates for oil and gas CGUs, if carbon emissions costs were to be implemented as a deduction against revenue cash flows. The analyses therefore represent a net revenue sensitivity.\n\nA change in net revenue from upstream oil and gas properties can arise either due to changes in oil and natural gas prices, carbon emissions costs/ carbon prices, changes in oil and natural gas production, or a combination of these.\n\nManagement tested the impact of changes in net revenue cash flows in value-in-use impairment testing under the following sensitivity analyses: an increase in net revenues of 10% in all years up to 2030, 25% in all subsequent years to 2040 and 40% in all remaining years to 2050; and a decrease in net revenues of 25% in all years up to 2030, 50% in all subsequent years to 2040 and 60% in all remaining years to 2050.\n\nNet revenue reductions of this magnitude in isolation could indicatively lead to a reduction in the carrying amount of bp's currently held upstream oil and gas properties in the range of $15-16 billion, which is approximately 14-15% of the net book value of property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2022. If this net revenue reduction was due to reductions in prices in isolation, it reflects an indicative decrease in the carrying amount of using price assumptions for Brent oil trending broadly towards the bottom of the range of prices associated with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) 'family' of scenarios considered to be consistent with limiting global average temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. This 'family' of scenarios is also used in bp's TCFD scenario analysis (see page 50).\n\nNet revenue increases of this magnitude in isolation could indicatively lead to an increase in the carrying amount of bp's currently held upstream oil and gas properties in the range of $1-2 billion, which is approximately 1-2% of the net book value of property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2022. This potential increase in the carrying amount would arise due to reversals of previously recognized impairments and represents approximately half of the total impairment reversal capacity available at 31 December 2022. If this net revenue increase was due to increases in prices in isolation, it reflects an indicative increase in the carrying amount of using price assumptions for Brent oil trending broadly towards the top end until 2040, and then towards the mean average at 2050, of the range of prices associated with the WBCSD 'family' of scenarios considered to be consistent with limiting global average temperature to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. This 'family' of scenarios is also used in bp's TCFD scenario analysis.",

        "page_content": "## 1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nThese sensitivity analyses do not, however, represent management's best estimate of any impairment charges or reversals that might be recognized as they do not fully incorporate consequential changes that may arise, such as changes in costs and business plans and phasing of development. For example, costs across the industry are more likely to decrease as oil and natural gas prices fall. The analyses also assume the impact of increases in carbon price on operational GHG emissions are fully absorbed as a decrease in net revenue (and vice versa) rather than reflecting how carbon prices or other carbon emissions costs may ultimately be incorporated by the market. The above sensitivity analyses therefore do not reflect a linear relationship between net revenue and value that can be extrapolated. The interdependency of these inputs and factors plus the diverse characteristics of the group's upstream oil and gas properties limits the practicability of estimating the probability or extent to which the overall recoverable amount is impacted by changes to the price assumptions or production volumes.\n\nManagement also tested the impact of a one percentage point change in the discount rate used for value-in-use impairment testing of upstream oil and gas properties. This level of change reflects past experience of a reasonable change in rate that could arise within the next financial year. If the discount rate was one percentage point higher across all tests performed, the net impairment reversal recognized in 2022 would have been approximately $0.5 billion lower. If the discount rate was one percentage point lower, the net impairment reversal recognized would have been approximately $0.5 billion higher.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nIrrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, bp is required to test annually for impairment of goodwill acquired in business combinations. The group carries goodwill of $12.0 billion on its balance sheet (2021 $12.4 billion), principally relating to the Atlantic Richfield, Burmah Castrol, Devon Energy and Reliance transactions. Of this, $7.2 billion relates to goodwill in the oil production & operations and gas & low carbon energy segments (2021 $7.6 billion), for which oil and gas price and production assumptions are key sources of estimation uncertainty. Sensitivities and additional information relating to impairment testing of goodwill in these segments are provided in Note 14.\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories, other than inventories held for short-term trading purposes, are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is typically determined by the first-in first-out method and comprises direct purchase costs, cost of production, transportation and manufacturing expenses. Net realizable value is determined by reference to prices existing at the balance sheet date, adjusted where the sale of inventories after the reporting period gives evidence about their net realizable value at the end of the period.\n\nInventories held for short-term trading purposes are stated at fair value less costs to sell and any changes in fair value are recognized in the income statement.\n\nSupplies are valued at the lower of cost on a weighted-average basis and net realizable value.\n\n## Leases\n\nAgreements that convey the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration are accounted for as leases. The right to control is conveyed if bp has both the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from, and the right to direct the use of, the identified asset throughout the period of use. An asset is identified if it is explicitly or implicitly specified by the agreement and any substitution rights held by the lessor over the asset are not considered substantive.\n\nAgreements that convey the right to control the use of an intangible asset including rights to explore for or use hydrocarbons are not accounted for as leases. See significant accounting policy: intangible assets.\n\nA lease liability is recognized on the balance sheet on the lease commencement date at the present value of future lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate applied is the rate implicit in the lease if readily determinable, otherwise an incremental borrowing rate is used. For the majority of the leases in the group, there is not sufficient information available to readily determine the rate implicit in the lease, and therefore the incremental borrowing rate is used . The incremental borrowing rate is determined based on factors such as the group's cost of borrowing, lessee legal entity credit risk, currency and lease term. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of a lease together with any periods covered by an extension option that bp is reasonably certain to exercise, or periods covered by a termination option that bp is reasonably certain not to exercise. The future lease payments included in the present value calculation are any fixed payments, payments that vary depending on an index or rate, payments due for the reasonably certain exercise of options and expected residual value guarantee payments. Repayments of principal are presented as financing cash flows and payments of interest are presented as operating cash flows.\n\nPayments that vary based on factors other than an index or a rate such as usage, sales volumes or revenues are not included in the present value calculation and are recognized in the income statement and presented as operating cash flows. The lease liability is recognized on an amortized cost basis with interest expense recognized in the income statement over the lease term, except for where capitalized as exploration, appraisal or development expenditure.\n\nThe right-of-use asset is recognized on the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment at a value equivalent to the initial measurement of the lease liability adjusted for lease prepayments, lease incentives, initial direct costs and any restoration obligations. The right-of-use asset is depreciated typically on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The depreciation charge is recognized in the income statement except for where capitalized as exploration, appraisal or development expenditure. Right-of-use assets are assessed for impairment in line with the accounting policy for impairment of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill.\n\nAgreements may include both lease and non-lease components. Payments for lease and non-lease components are allocated on a relative stand-alone selling price basis except for leases of retail service stations where the group has elected not to separate non-lease payments from the calculation of the lease liability and right-of-use asset.\n\nIf the lease term at commencement of the agreement is less than 12 months, a lease liability and right-of-use asset are not recognized, and a lease expense is recognized in the income statement on a straight-line basis.",

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nIf a significant event or change in circumstances, within the control of bp, arises that affects the reasonably certain lease term or there are changes to the lease payments, the present value of the lease liability is remeasured using the revised term and payments, with the right-of-use asset adjusted by an equivalent amount.\n\nModifications to a lease agreement beyond the original terms and conditions are accounted for as a re-measurement of the lease liability with a corresponding adjustment to the right-of-use asset. Any gain or loss on modification is recognized in the income statement. Modifications that increase the scope of the lease at a price commensurate with the stand-alone selling price are accounted for as a separate new lease.\n\nThe group recognizes the full lease liability, rather than its working interest share, for leases entered into on behalf of a joint operation if the group has the primary responsibility for making the lease payments. This may be the case if for example bp, as operator of the joint operation, is the sole signatory to the lease agreement. In such cases, bp's working interest share of the right-of-use asset is recognized if it is jointly controlled by the group and the other joint operators, and a receivable is recognized for the share of the asset transferred to the other joint operators. If bp is a non-operator, a payable to the operator is recognized if they have the primary responsibility for making the lease payments and bp has joint control over the right-of-use asset, otherwise no balances are recognized.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are recognized initially at fair value, normally being the transaction price. In the case of financial assets not measured at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs are also included. The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification, as set out below. The group derecognizes financial assets when the contractual rights to the cash flows expire or the rights to receive cash flows have been transferred to a third party and either substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset have been transferred, or substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset have neither been retained nor transferred but control of the asset has been transferred. This includes the derecognition of receivables for which discounting arrangements are entered into.\n\nThe group classifies its financial asset debt instruments as measured at amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income or fair value through profit or loss. The classification depends on the business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.\n\n## Financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\nFinancial assets are classified as measured at amortized cost when they are held in a business model the objective of which is to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. Such assets are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the assets are derecognized or impaired and when interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. This category of financial assets includes trade and other receivables.\n\n## Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nFinancial assets are classified as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income when they are held in a business model the objective of which is both to collect contractual cash flows and sell the financial assets, and the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest.\n\n## Financial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial assets are classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss when the asset does not meet the criteria to be measured at amortized cost or fair value through other comprehensive income. Such assets are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognized in the income statement. Derivatives, other than those designated as effective hedging instruments, are included in this category.\n\n## Investments in equity instruments\n\nInvestments in equity instruments are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss unless an election is made on an instrument-byinstrument basis to recognize fair value gains and losses in other comprehensive income.\n\n## Derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge\n\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluation is described below in the accounting policy for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.\n\n## Cash equivalents\n\nCash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and generally have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition. Cash equivalents are classified as financial assets measured at amortized cost or, in the case of certain money market funds, fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\nThe group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with financial assets measured at amortized cost at each balance sheet date. Expected credit losses are measured based on the maximum contractual period over which the group is exposed to credit risk. As lifetime expected credit losses are recognized for trade receivables and the tenor of substantially all other in-scope financial assets is less than 12 months there is no significant difference between the measurement of 12-month and lifetime expected credit losses for the group. The measurement of expected credit losses is a function of the probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. The expected credit loss is estimated as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of the future cash flows the group expects to receive discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is adjusted, with the amount of the impairment gain or loss recognized in the income statement.\n\nA financial asset or group of financial assets classified as measured at amortized cost is considered to be credit-impaired if there is reasonable and supportable evidence that one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset (or group of financial assets) have occurred. Financial assets are written off where the group has no reasonable expectation of recovering amounts due.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nInstruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements. Instruments that cannot be settled in the group's own equity instruments and that include no contractual obligation to deliver cash or another financial asset or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity that are potentially unfavourable are classified as equity. Equity instruments issued by the group are recognized at the proceeds received, net of directly attributable issue costs.",

        "page_content": "## 1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are recognized when the group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. The group derecognizes financial liabilities when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired. The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as follows:\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial liabilities that meet the definition of held for trading are classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss. Such liabilities are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognized in the income statement. Derivatives, other than those designated as effective hedging instruments, are included in this category.\n\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge\n\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge are carried on the balance sheet at fair value. The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluation is described below in the accounting policy for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost\n\nAll other financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. For interest-bearing loans and borrowings this is typically equivalent to the fair value of the proceeds received, net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.\n\nAfter initial recognition, other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are recognized in interest and other income and finance costs respectively.\n\nThis category of financial liabilities includes trade and other payables and finance debt.\n\n## Significant judgement: supplier financing arrangements\n\nThe group's trade payables include some supplier arrangements that utilize letter of credit facilities. Judgement is required to assess the payables subject to these arrangements to determine whether they should continue to be classified as trade payables and give rise to operating cash flows or finance debt and financing cash flows. The criteria used in making this assessment include the payment terms for the amount due relative to terms commonly seen in the markets in which bp operates and whether the arrangements significantly change the nature of the liability. Liabilities subject to these arrangements with payment terms of up to approximately 60 days are generally considered to be trade payables and give rise to operating cash flows. At 31 December 2022, trade payables subject to these arrangements and this significant judgement included $9.5 billion (2021 $9.2 billion) payable to the providers of the letters of credit. See Note 29 - Liquidity risk for further information.\n\n## Financial guarantees\n\nThe group issues financial guarantee contracts to make specified payments to reimburse holders for losses incurred if certain associates, joint ventures or third-party entities fail to make payments when due in accordance with the original or modified terms of a debt instrument such as a loan. The liability for a financial guarantee contract is initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at the higher of the contract's estimated expected credit loss and the amount initially recognized less, where appropriate, cumulative amortization.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities\n\nThe group uses derivative financial instruments to manage certain exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, as well as for trading purposes. These derivative financial instruments are recognized initially at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.\n\nContracts to buy or sell a non-financial item (for example, oil, oil products, gas or power) that can be settled net in cash, with the exception of contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with the group's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements, are accounted for as financial instruments. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as effective hedging instruments are recognized in the income statement.\n\nIf, at inception of a contract, the valuation cannot be supported by observable market data, any gain or loss determined by the valuation methodology is not recognized in the income statement but is deferred on the balance sheet and is commonly known as a 'day-one gain or loss'. This deferred gain or loss is recognized in the income statement over the life of the contract until substantially all the remaining contractual cash flows can be valued using observable market data at which point any remaining deferred gain or loss is recognized in the income statement. Changes in valuation subsequent to the initial valuation at inception of a contract are recognized immediately in the income statement.\n\nFor the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:\n\n- \u00b7 Fair value hedges when hedging exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability.\n- \u00b7 Cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to either a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.\n\nHedge relationships are formally designated and documented at inception, together with the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, the existence at inception of an economic relationship and subsequent measurement of the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, the hedge ratio and sources of hedge ineffectiveness. Hedges meeting the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nThe change in fair value of a hedging derivative is recognized in profit or loss. The change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item and is also recognized in profit or loss, where it offsets. The group applies fair value hedge accounting when hedging interest rate risk and certain currency risks on fixed rate finance debt.\n\nFair value hedge accounting is discontinued only when the hedging relationship or a part thereof ceases to meet the qualifying criteria. This includes when the risk management objective changes or when the hedging instrument is sold, terminated or exercised. The accumulated adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item at such time is then amortized prospectively to profit or loss as finance interest expense over the hedged item's remaining period to maturity.",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements\n\n## 1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThe effective portion of the gain or loss on a cash flow hedging instrument is reported in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognized in profit or loss. Amounts reported in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.\n\nWhere the hedged item is a highly probably forecast transaction that results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, such as a forecast foreign currency transaction for the purchase of property, plant and equipment, the amounts recognized within other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. Where the hedged item is an equity investment, the amounts recognized in other comprehensive income remain in the separate component of equity until the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss or when accounting under the equity method is discontinued. Where the hedged item is recognized directly in profit or loss, the amounts recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to production and manufacturing expenses or sales and other operating revenues as appropriate.\n\nCash flow hedge accounting is discontinued only when the hedging relationship or a part thereof ceases to meet the qualifying criteria. This includes when the designated hedged forecast transaction or part thereof is no longer considered to be highly probable to occur, or when the hedging instrument is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover. When cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued amounts previously recognized within other comprehensive income remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are reclassified to profit or loss or transferred to the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset or liability as above. If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognized within other comprehensive income will be immediately reclassified to profit or loss.\n\n## Costs of hedging\n\nThe foreign currency basis spread of cross-currency interest rate swaps are excluded from hedge designations and accounted for as costs of hedging. Changes in fair value of the foreign currency basis spread are recognized in other comprehensive income to the extent that they relate to the hedged item.\n\nFor time-period related hedged items, the amount recognized in other comprehensive income is amortized to profit or loss on a straight line basis over the term of the hedging relationship.\n\n## Fair value measurement\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The group categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three levels depending on the ability to observe inputs employed in their measurement. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, other than quoted prices included within level 1 for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant modifications to observable related market data or bp's assumptions about pricing by market participants.\n\n## Significant estimate and judgement: derivative financial instruments\n\nIn some cases the fair values of derivatives are estimated using internal models due to the absence of quoted prices or other observable, marketcorroborated data. This primarily applies to the group's longer-term derivative contracts. The majority of these contracts are valued using models with inputs that include price curves for each of the different products that are built up from available active market pricing data (including volatility and correlation) and modelled using the maximum available external information. Additionally, where limited data exists for certain products, prices are determined using historical and long-term pricing relationships. The use of alternative assumptions or valuation methodologies may result in significantly different values for these derivatives. A reasonably possible change in the price assumptions used in the models relating to index price would not have a material impact on net assets and the Group income statement primarily as a result of offsetting movements between derivative assets and liabilities.\n\nIn some cases, judgement is required to determine whether contracts to buy or sell commodities meet the definition of a derivative or to determine appropriate presentation and classification of transactions in certain cases. In particular, contracts to buy and sell LNG are not considered to meet the definition as they are not considered capable of being net settled due to a lack of liquidity in the LNG market and the inability or lack of history of net settlement and are accounted for on an accruals basis, rather than as a derivative. Under IFRS, bp fair values the derivative financial instruments used to risk-manage the LNG contracts themselves, resulting in a measurement mismatch.\n\nFor more information, including the carrying amounts of level 3 derivatives, see Note 30.\n\n## Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are presented gross in the balance sheet unless both of the following criteria are met: the group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized amounts; and the group intends to either settle on a net basis or realize the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. A right of set off is the group's legal right to settle an amount payable to a creditor by applying against it an amount receivable from the same counterparty. The relevant legal jurisdiction and laws applicable to the relationships between the parties are considered when assessing whether a current legally enforceable right to set off exists.\n\n## Provisions and contingencies\n\nProvisions are recognized when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Where appropriate, the future cash flow estimates are adjusted to reflect risks specific to the liability.\n\nIf the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax risk-free rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognized within finance costs. Provisions are discounted using a nominal discount rate of 3.5% (2021 2.0%).\n\nProvisions are split between amounts expected to be settled within 12 months of the balance sheet date (current) and amounts expected to be settled later (non-current).\n\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will only be confirmed by future events not wholly within the control of the group, or present obligations where it is not probable that an outflow of resources will be required or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. Contingent liabilities are not recognized in the consolidated financial statements but are disclosed, if material, unless the possibility of an outflow of economic resources is considered remote.",

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Decommissioning\n\nLiabilities for decommissioning costs are recognized when the group has an obligation to plug and abandon a well, dismantle and remove a facility or an item of plant and to restore the site on which it is located, and when a reliable estimate of that liability can be made. Where an obligation exists for a new facility or item of plant, such as oil and natural gas production or transportation facilities, this liability will be recognized on construction or installation. Similarly, where an obligation exists for a well, this liability is recognized when it is drilled. An obligation for decommissioning may also crystallize during the period of operation of a well, facility or item of plant through a change in legislation or through a decision to terminate operations; an obligation may also arise in cases where an asset has been sold but the subsequent owner is no longer able to fulfil its decommissioning obligations, for example due to bankruptcy. The amount recognized is the present value of the estimated future expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements. The provision for the costs of decommissioning wells, production facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic lives is estimated using existing technology, at future prices, depending on the expected timing of the activity, and discounted using a nominal discount rate.\n\nAn amount equivalent to the decommissioning provision is recognized as part of the corresponding intangible asset (in the case of an exploration or appraisal well) or property, plant and equipment. The decommissioning portion of the property, plant and equipment is subsequently depreciated at the same rate as the rest of the asset. Other than the unwinding of discount on or utilization of the provision, any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure is reflected as an adjustment to the provision and the corresponding asset where that asset is generating or is expected to generate future economic benefits.\n\n## Environmental expenditures and liabilities\n\nEnvironmental expenditures that are required in order for the group to obtain future economic benefits from its assets are capitalized as part of those assets. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations that do not contribute to future earnings are expensed.\n\nLiabilities for environmental costs are recognized when a clean-up is probable and the associated costs can be reliably estimated. Generally, the timing of recognition of these provisions coincides with the commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or on closure of inactive sites.\n\nThe amount recognized is the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation. Provisions for environmental liabilities have been estimated using existing technology, at future prices and discounted using a nominal discount rate.\n\n## Emissions\n\nLiabilities for emissions are recognized when the cumulative volumes of gases emitted by the group at the end of the reporting period exceed the allowances granted free of charge held for own use or a set baseline for emissions. The provision is measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. It is based on the excess of actual emissions over the free allowances held or set baseline in tonnes (or other appropriate quantity) and is valued at the actual cost of any allowances that have been purchased and held for own use on a first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis, and, if insufficient allowances are held, for the remaining requirement on the basis of the spot market price of allowances at the balance sheet date. The majority of these provisions are typically settled within 12 months of the balance sheet date however certain schemes may have longer compliance periods. The cost of allowances purchased to cover a shortfall is recognized separately on the balance sheet as an intangible asset unless the emission allowances acquired or generated by the group are risk-managed by the shipping & trading function, then they are recognized on the balance sheet as inventory.\n\n## Restructuring provisions\n\nRestructuring provisions are recognized where a detailed formal plan exists, and a valid expectation of risk of redundancy has been made to those affected but where the specific outcomes remain uncertain. Where formal redundancy offers have been made, the obligations for those amounts are reported as payables and, if not, as provisions if unpaid at the year-end.",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements\n\n## 1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nSignificant judgements and estimates: provisions\n\nThe group holds provisions for the future decommissioning of oil and natural gas production facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic lives. The largest decommissioning obligations facing bp relate to the plugging and abandonment of wells and the removal and disposal of oil and natural gas platforms and pipelines around the world. Most of these decommissioning events are many years in the future and the precise requirements that will have to be met when the removal event occurs are uncertain. Decommissioning technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are political, environmental, safety and public expectations. The timing and amounts of future cash flows are subject to significant uncertainty and estimation is required in determining the amounts of provisions to be recognized. Any changes in the expected future costs are reflected in both the provision and, where still recognized, the asset.\n\nIf oil and natural gas production facilities and pipelines are sold to third parties, judgement is required to assess whether the new owner will be unable to meet their decommissioning obligations, whether bp would then be responsible for decommissioning, and if so the extent of that responsibility. This typically requires assessment of the local legal requirements and the financial standing of the owner. If the standing deteriorates significantly, for example, bankruptcy of the owner, a provision may be required. The group has assessed that $0.8 billion of decommissioning provisions should be recognized as at 31 December 2022 (2021 $0.5 billion) for assets previously sold to third parties where the sale transferred the decommissioning obligation to the new owner. See Note 33 for further information.\n\nDecommissioning provisions associated with downstream refineries are generally not recognized, as the potential obligations cannot be measured, given their indeterminate settlement dates. Obligations may arise if refineries cease manufacturing operations and any such obligations would be recognized in the period when sufficient information becomes available to determine potential settlement dates. See Note 33 for further information.\n\nThe group performs periodic reviews of its downstream refineries for any changes in facts and circumstances including those relating to the energy transition, that might require the recognition of a decommissioning provision. Portfolio strength and flexibility are such that the point of cessation of manufacturing at the group's operating refineries cannot yet be reliably determined for the purposes of determining a decommissioning provision.\n\nThe provision for environmental liabilities is estimated based on current legal and constructive requirements, technology, price levels and expected plans for remediation. Actual costs and cash outflows can differ from current estimates because of changes in laws and regulations, public expectations, prices, discovery and analysis of site conditions and changes in clean-up technology.\n\nThe timing and amount of future expenditures relating to decommissioning and environmental liabilities are reviewed annually. The interest rate used in discounting the cash flows is reviewed quarterly. The nominal interest rate used to determine the balance sheet obligations at the end of 2022 was 3.5% (2021 2.0%), which was based on long-dated US government bonds. The weighted average period over which decommissioning and environmental costs are generally expected to be incurred is estimated to be approximately 17 years (2021 17 years) and 6 years (2021 6 years) respectively. Costs at future prices are typically determined by applying an inflation rate of 1.5% (2021 1.5%) to decommissioning costs and 2% (2021 2%) for all other provisions. A lower rate is typically applied to decommissioning as certain costs are expected to remain fixed at current or past prices.\n\nThe estimated phasing of undiscounted cash flows in real terms for upstream decommissioning is approximately $5.6 billion (2021 $5.3 billion) within the next 10 years, $5.3 billion (2021 $6.9 billion) in 10 to 20 years and the remainder of approximately $6.0 billion (2021 $6.0 billion) after 20 years. The timing and amount of decommissioning cash flows are inherently uncertain and therefore the phasing is management's current best estimate but may not be what will ultimately occur.\n\nFurther information about the group's provisions is provided in Note 23. Changes in assumptions in relation to the group's provisions could result in a material change in their carrying amounts within the next financial year. A 1.0 percentage point increase in the nominal discount rate applied could decrease the group's provision balances by approximately $1.8 billion (2021 $2.6 billion). The pre-tax impact on the group income statement would be a credit of approximately $0.5 billion (2021 $0.7 billion). This level of change reflects past experience of a reasonable change in rate that could arise within the next financial year.\n\nThe discounting impact on the group's decommissioning provisions for oil and gas properties in the oil productions & operations and gas & low carbon energy segments of a two-year change in the timing of expected future decommissioning expenditures is approximately $0.5 billion (2021 $0.2 billion). Management currently does not consider a change of greater than two years to be reasonably possible in the next financial year and therefore the timing of upstream decommissioning expenditure is not a key source of estimation uncertainty.\n\nIf all expected future decommissioning expenditures were 10% higher, then these decommissioning provisions would increase by approximately $1.2 billion (2021 $1.6 billion) and a pre-tax charge of approximately $0.3 billion (2021 $0.4 billion) would be recognized. A one percentage point increase in the inflation rate applied to upstream decommissioning costs to determine the nominal cash flows could increase the decommissioning provision by approximately $2.0 billion (2021 $2.9 billion) with a pre-tax charge of approximately $0.5 billion (2021 $0.7 billion).\n\nAs described in Note 33, the group is subject to claims and actions for which no provisions have been recognized. The facts and circumstances relating to particular cases are evaluated regularly in determining whether a provision relating to a specific litigation should be recognized or revised. Accordingly, significant management judgement relating to provisions and contingent liabilities is required, since the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nWages, salaries, bonuses, social security contributions, paid annual leave and sick leave are accrued in the period in which the associated services are rendered by employees of the group. Deferred bonus arrangements that have a vesting date more than 12 months after the balance sheet date are valued on an actuarial basis using the projected unit credit method and amortized on a straight-line basis over the service period until the award vests. The accounting policies for share-based payments and for pensions and other post-retirement benefits are described below.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\n## Equity-settled transactions\n\nThe cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments on the date on which they are granted and is recognized as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the employees become fully entitled to the award. A corresponding credit is recognized within equity. Fair value is determined by using an appropriate, widely used valuation model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the company (market conditions). Non-vesting conditions, such as the condition that employees contribute to a savings-related plan, are taken into account in the grant-date fair value, and failure to meet a non-vesting condition, where this is within the control of the employee is treated as a cancellation and any remaining unrecognized cost is expensed.",

        "page_content": "## 1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nFor other equity-settled share-based payment transactions, the goods or services received and the corresponding increase in equity are measured at the fair value of the goods or services received unless their fair value cannot be reliably estimated. If the fair value of the goods and services received cannot be reliably estimated, the transaction is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.\n\n## Cash-settled transactions\n\nThe cost of cash-settled transactions is recognized as an expense over the vesting period, measured by reference to the fair value of the corresponding liability which is recognized on the balance sheet. The liability is remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date until settlement, with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement.\n\n## Pensions and other post-retirement benefits\n\nThe cost of providing benefits under the group's defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation. Past service costs, resulting from either a plan amendment or a curtailment (a reduction in future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the plan membership), are recognized immediately when the company becomes committed to a change.\n\nNet interest expense relating to pensions and other post-retirement benefits, which is recognized in the income statement, represents the net change in present value of plan obligations and the value of plan assets resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the present value of the benefit obligation at the start of the year, and to the fair value of plan assets at the start of the year, taking into account expected changes in the obligation or plan assets during the year.\n\nRemeasurements of the defined benefit liability and asset, comprising actuarial gains and losses, and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest described above) are recognized within other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur and are not subsequently reclassified to profit and loss.\n\nThe defined benefit pension plan surplus or deficit recognized on the balance sheet for each plan comprises the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligation (using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds) and the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. Fair value is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price. Defined benefit pension plan surpluses are only recognized to the extent they are recoverable, either by way of a refund from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\nContributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they become payable.\n\n## Significant estimate: pensions and other post-retirement benefits\n\nAccounting for defined benefit pensions and other post-retirement benefits involves making significant estimates when measuring the group's pension plan surpluses and deficits. These estimates require assumptions to be made about many uncertainties.\n\nPensions and other post-retirement benefit assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year. These assumptions are used to determine the projected benefit obligation at the year end and hence the surpluses and deficits recorded on the group's balance sheet and pension and other post-retirement benefit expense for the following year.\n\nThe assumptions that are the most significant to the amounts reported are the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality levels. Assumptions about these variables are based on the environment in each country. The assumptions used vary from year to year, with resultant effects on future net income and net assets. Changes to some of these assumptions, in particular the discount rate and inflation rate, could result in material changes to the carrying amounts of the group's pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations within the next financial year, in particular for the UK, US and Eurozone plans. Any differences between these assumptions and the actual outcome will also affect future net income and net assets.\n\nThe values ascribed to these assumptions and a sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in the assumptions on the benefit expense and obligation used are provided in Note 24.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.\n\nIncome tax is recognized in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the related tax is recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\n\nCurrent tax is based on the taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it is determined in accordance with the rules established by the applicable taxation authorities. It therefore excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods as well as items that are never taxable or deductible. The group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for all taxable temporary differences except:\n\n- \u00b7 Where the deferred tax liability arises on the initial recognition of goodwill.\n- \u00b7 Where the deferred tax liability arises on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and, at the time of the transaction, does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences.\n- \u00b7 In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint arrangements, where the group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.",

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry-forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized, except where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss and, at the time of the transaction, does not give rise to equal taxable and deductive temporary differences.\n\nIn respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates and interests in joint arrangements, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable or increased to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilized.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n\nWhere tax treatments are uncertain, if it is considered probable that a taxation authority will accept the group's proposed tax treatment, income taxes are recognized consistent with the group's income tax filings. If it is not considered probable, the uncertainty is reflected within the carrying amount of the applicable tax asset or liability using either the most likely amount or an expected value, depending on which method better predicts the resolution of the uncertainty.\n\nThe computation of the group's income tax expense and liability involves the interpretation of applicable tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions throughout the world. The resolution of tax positions taken by the group, through negotiations with relevant tax authorities or through litigation, can take several years to complete and in some cases it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome. Therefore, judgement is required to determine whether provisions for income taxes are required and, if so, estimation is required of the amounts that could be payable.\n\nIn addition, the group has carry-forward tax losses and tax credits in certain taxing jurisdictions that are available to offset against future taxable profit. However, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses or tax credits can be utilized. Management judgement is exercised in assessing whether this is the case and estimates are required to be made of the amount of future taxable profits that will be available. Such judgements are inherently impacted by estimates affecting future taxable profits such as oil and natural gas prices and decommissioning expenditure, see significant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values and provisions.\n\n## Significant judgement and estimate: taxation\n\nThe value of deferred tax assets and liabilities is an area involving inherent uncertainty and estimation and balances are therefore subject to risk of material change as a result of underlying assumptions and judgements used, in particular the forecast of future profitability used to determine the recoverability of deferred tax, for example future oil and gas prices, see 'Significant judgement and estimates - Recoverability of asset carrying values'. It is impracticable to disclose the extent of the possible effects of profitability assumptions on the group's deferred tax assets. It is reasonably possible that to the extent that actual outcomes differ from management's estimates, material income tax charges or credits, and material changes in current and deferred tax assets or liabilities, may arise within the next financial year and in future periods.\n\nJudgement is required when determining whether a particular tax is an income tax or another type of tax (for example, a production tax). The attributes of the tax, including whether it is calculated on profits or another measure such as production or revenues, the extent of deductibility of costs and the interaction with existing income taxes, are considered in determining the classification of the tax. Accounting for deferred tax is applied to income taxes as described above but is not applied to other types of taxes; rather such taxes are recognized in the income statement in accordance with the applicable accounting policy such as Provisions and contingencies.\n\nThis judgement is considered significant only in relation to the group's taxes payable under the fiscal terms of bp's onshore concession in Abu Dhabi. These are principally reported as income taxes rather than as production taxes.\n\nFor more information see Note 9 and Note 33.\n\n## Customs duties and sales taxes\n\nCustoms duties and sales taxes that are passed on or charged to customers are excluded from revenues and expenses. Assets and liabilities are recognized net of the amount of customs duties or sales tax except:\n\n- \u00b7 Customs duties or sales taxes incurred on the purchase of goods and services which are not recoverable from the taxation authority are recognized as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset.\n- \u00b7 Receivables and payables are stated with the amount of customs duty or sales tax included.\n\nThe net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included within receivables or payables in the balance sheet.",

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\n## Own equity instruments - treasury shares\n\nThe group's holdings in its own equity instruments are shown as deductions from shareholders' equity. Treasury shares represent bp shares repurchased and available for specific and limited purposes. For accounting purposes, shares held in Employee Share Ownership Plans (ESOPs) to meet the future requirements of the employee share-based payment plans are treated in the same manner as treasury shares and are, therefore, included in the consolidated financial statements as treasury shares. The cost of treasury shares subsequently sold or reissued is calculated on a weighted-average basis. Consideration, if any, received for the sale of such shares is also recognized in equity. No gain or loss is recognized in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares. Shares repurchased under the share buy-back programme which are immediately cancelled are not shown as treasury shares, but are shown as a deduction from the profit and loss account reserve in the group statement of changes in equity.\n\n## Revenue and other income\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognized when or as the group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a promised good or service to a customer. The transfer of control of oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, LNG, petroleum and chemical products, and other items usually coincides with title passing to the customer and the customer taking physical possession. The group principally satisfies its performance obligations at a point in time; the amounts of revenue recognized relating to performance obligations satisfied over time are not significant.\n\nWhen, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied, the group recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to that performance obligation. The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the group expects to be entitled. The transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations in the contract based on standalone selling prices of the goods or services promised.\n\nContracts for the sale of commodities are typically priced by reference to quoted prices. Revenue from term commodity contracts is recognized based on the contractual pricing provisions for each delivery. Certain of these contracts have pricing terms based on prices at a point in time after delivery has been made. Revenue from such contracts is initially recognized based on relevant prices at the time of delivery and subsequently adjusted as appropriate. All revenue from these contracts, both that recognized at the time of delivery and that from post-delivery price adjustments, is disclosed as revenue from contracts with customers.\n\nSales and purchase of commodities accounted for under IFRS 15 are presented on a gross basis in Revenue from contracts with customers and Purchases respectively. Physically settled derivatives which represent trading or optimization activities are presented net alongside financially settled derivative contracts in Other operating revenues within Sales and other operating income. Certain physically settled sale and purchase derivative contracts which are not part of trading and optimization activities are presented gross within Other operating revenues and Purchases respectively. Changes in the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities prior to physical delivery are also classified as other operating revenues.\n\nPhysical exchanges with counterparties in the same line of business in order to facilitate sales to customers are reported net, as are sales and purchases made with a common counterparty, as part of an arrangement similar to a physical exchange.\n\nWhere the group acts as agent on behalf of a third party to procure or market energy commodities, any associated fee income is recognized but no purchase or sale is recorded.\n\nInterest income is recognized as the interest accrues (using the effective interest rate, that is, the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset).\n\nDividend income from investments is recognized when the shareholders' right to receive the payment is established.\n\nContract asset and contract liability balances are included within amounts presented for trade receivables and other payables respectively.\n\n## Finance costs\n\nFinance costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use. All other finance costs are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.\n\n## Updates to significant accounting policies\n\nImpact of new International Financial Reporting Standards\n\nThere are no new or amended standards or interpretations adopted during the year that have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Impact of new International Financial Reporting Standards - Not yet adopted\n\nThe following pronouncements from the IASB have not been adopted by the group in these financial statements as they will only become effective for future financial reporting periods. There are no other standards, amendments or interpretations in issue but not yet adopted that the directors anticipate will have a material effect on the reported income or net assets of the group.\n\n## IFRS 17 ' Insurance Contracts'\n\nIFRS 17 'Insurance Contracts' provides a new general model for accounting for contracts where the issuer accepts significant insurance risk from another party and agrees to compensate that party if a future uncertain event adversely affects them. IFRS 17 replaces IFRS 4 'Insurance Contracts' and will be effective for bp for the financial reporting period commencing 1 January 2023. The standard has been endorsed by the UK and the EU. The new standard is not expected to have a material effect on bp's net assets as at 1 January 2023 or 1 January 2022.\n\n## Other changes to significant accounting policies\n\nChange in segmentation\n\nAs a result of bp's decision to exit its shareholding in Rosneft on 27 February 2022, the group has ceased to report Rosneft as a separate segment in its financial reporting for 2022. Rosneft results up to 27 February 2022 are included within other businesses & corporate (OB&C), and 2021 and 2020 comparatives have been restated to include the Rosneft segment as per the table below:",

Non-current assets held for sale\n\nThe carrying amount of assets classified as held for sale at 31 December 2022 is $1,242 million (2021 $1,652 million), with associated liabilities of $321 million (2021 $359 million).\n\n## gas & low carbon energy\n\nOn 7 September 2022, bp announced that it had agreed to sell its upstream business in Algeria to Eni. The sale completed on 28 February 2023. Assets of $511 million and associated liabilities of $48 million were classified as held for sale in the group balance sheet at 31 December 2022.\n\n## customers & products\n\nOn 8 August 2022, bp announced an agreement to sell its 50% interest in the bp-Husky Toledo refinery in Ohio US, to Cenovus Energy, its partner in the facility. Following a fire at the refinery, it has been shut down since 20 September 2022. Assets of $731 million and associated liabilities of $273 million were classified as held for sale in the group balance sheet at 31 December 2022. The sale completed on 28 February 2023.\n\nTransactions that have been classified as held for sale during 2022, but were completed by 31 December 2022, are described below.\n\n## oil production & operations\n\nOn 12 June 2022, bp entered into an agreement to sell its 50% interest in the Sunrise oil sands project in Canada to Cenovus Energy Inc. for C$600 million (Canadian dollars) cash (subject to customary closing adjustments), up to C$600 million of contingent consideration expiring after two years and Cenovus's 35% position in the undeveloped Bay du Nord project offshore Canada. The transaction closed on 31 August 2022.\n\nOn 11 March 2022, bp and Eni signed an agreement to form Azule Energy, an independent incorporated 50:50 joint venture, through the combination of the two companies' Angolan businesses. The transaction closed on 1 August 2022 and, from that date, bp reported an equity accounted investment in Azule Energy. This investment was initially recognized at a fair value of $4,922 million (net of deferred gain) and the transaction resulted in a non-taxable accounting gain of $1,932 million and a deferred gain of the same amount that will be recognized over time as the Azule Energy assets are depreciated.\n\nThe assets held for sale balance at 31 December 2021 consisted of assets of $1,009 million and associated liabilities of $333 million relating to the agreement to establish Basra Energy Company (BECL) between bp and PetroChina, an incorporated entity, to own and manage the companies' interests in the Rumaila field in Iraq. The transaction closed on 1 June 2022 and bp now reports an equity accounted investment in BECL.\n\nIn addition, at 31 December 2021, $595 million of bp's investment in Aker BP was classified as held for sale in the group's balance sheet as a result of Aker BP's proposed acquisition of Lundin Energy for consideration in cash and new Aker BP shares which resulted in bp's 27.9% interest in Aker BP being diluted to a 15.9% interest in the combined company following the completion of the acquisition. The transaction completed on 30 June 2022 and a gain of $904 million was recognized.\n\nThe total assets and liabilities held for sale at 31 December 2022 and 2021, which are all in the gas & low carbon energy, oil production and operations and customers & products segments, are set out in the table below.\n\n|                                                                         | $ million   | $ million   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                                                         | 2022        | 2021        |\n| Property, plant and equipment                                           | 693         | 35          |\n| Goodwill                                                                | 58          | 137         |\n| Investments in associates                                               | -           | 632         |\n| Inventories                                                             | 255         | 152         |\n| Cash                                                                    | 35          | -           |\n| Trade and other receivables                                             | 201         | 696         |\n| Assets classified as held for sale                                      | 1,242       | 1,652       |\n| Trade and other payables                                                | (256)       | (238)       |\n| Lease liabilities                                                       | (14)        | (74)        |\n| Provisions                                                              | (36)        | (47)        |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                                                | (15)        | -           |\n| Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale | (321)       | (359)       |",

Total consideration paid in cash amounted to $3,671 million, offset by cash acquired of $141 million.\n\n## Archaea Energy\n\nOn 28 December 2022, bp acquired 100% of the issued common stock of Archaea Energy Inc. a leading producer of renewable natural gas (RNG) in the US, that was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThe acquisition expands bp's presence in the US biogas industry, enhancing its ability to support customers' decarbonization goals and progressing its aim to reduce the average lifecycle carbon intensity of the energy products it sells.\n\nThe total cash consideration for the transaction, all paid at completion, was $3,137 million.\n\nThe transaction has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method. The provisional fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, as at the date of acquisition, are shown in the table below. The intangible assets recognized are primarily the biogas rights agreements Archaea Energy has with landfill owners. The goodwill recognized reflects the part of the project development pipeline that did not qualify for separate recognition at the acquisition date and goodwill arising from recognition of deferred tax liabilities on fair value uplifts. The goodwill balance is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\n\nThe transaction included a step acquisition of the Mavrix LLC joint venture, which bp and Archaea Energy each held a 50% interest in prior to this transaction. The fair value of bp's interest in Mavrix LLC immediately before the acquisition date was $373 million and the gain recognized in 'Interest and other income' as a result of remeasuring this interest to fair value was $267 million.\n\n|                                                      | $ million 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Assets                                               |                  |\n| Property plant and equipment                         | 885              |\n| Goodwill                                             | 409              |\n| Intangible assets                                    | 3,475            |\n| Investments in equity-accounted entities             | 917              |\n| Inventory                                            | 42               |\n| Trade and other receivables                          | 67               |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                            | 107              |\n| Liabilities                                          |                  |\n| Trade and other payables                             | (1,032)          |\n| Finance debt                                         | (1,044)          |\n| Deferred tax liabilities                             | (293)            |\n| Provisions                                           | (16)             |\n| Non-controlling interest                             | (7)              |\n| Total consideration                                  | 3,510            |\n| Of which:                                            |                  |\n| Cash                                                 | 3,137            |\n| Fair value of previously held interest in Mavrix LLC | 373              |\n\nAs the transaction completed shortly prior to the end of the reporting period, the acquisition-date fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired are provisional.

If the business combination had taken place on 1 January 2022, it is estimated that the acquired activities would have generated revenues of $370 million and losses before tax of $169 million.\n\n## Other acquisitions\n\nThe fair value of the net assets (including goodwill) recognized from other business combinations in the full year was $611 million. This principally related to the acquisitions of the Flat Ridge 2 onshore wind farm and EDF Energy Services in North America.",

At 31 December 2022, deferred consideration relating to disposals amounted to $191 million receivable within one year (2021 $205 million and 2020 $1,291 million) and $194 million receivable after one year (2021 $823 million and 2020 $2,402 million). The amounts of deferred consideration are reported within Trade and other receivables in Receivables related to disposals in the group balance sheet - see Note 20 for further information. In addition, contingent consideration receivable relating to disposals amounted to $1,896 million at 31 December 2022 (2021 $1,917 million and 2020 $1,999 million). The contingent consideration at 31 December 2022 relates to the prior period disposals of our Alaskan business and certain assets in the North Sea and the disposal of our 50% interest in the Sunrise oil sands project in Canada. These amounts of contingent consideration are reported within Other investments on the group balance sheet - see Note 18 for further information.\n\n## Gains and losses on sale of businesses and fixed assets, and closures\n\ngas & low carbon energy\n\nIn 2021 gains on disposal of businesses and fixed assets were principally related to a $1,031 million gain on disposal of a 20% participating interest in Block 61 in Oman.",

Segmental analysis\n\nThe group's organizational structure reflects the various activities in which bp is engaged as well as how performance and resource allocation is evaluated by the chief operating decision maker. At 31 December 2022, bp has three reportable segments: Gas & low carbon energy, Oil production & operations, and Customers & products. Each are managed separately, with decisions taken for the segment as a whole, and represent a single operating segment that does not result from aggregating two or more segments.\n\nGas & low carbon energy comprises regions with upstream businesses that predominantly produce natural gas, gas marketing and trading activities and the group's solar, wind and hydrogen businesses.\n\nOil production & operations comprises regions with upstream activities that predominantly produce crude oil.\n\nCustomers & products comprises the group's customer-focused businesses, which includes convenience and retail fuels, EV charging, as well as Castrol, aviation and B2B and midstream. It also includes our products businesses, refining & oil trading, as well as our bioenergy businesses.\n\nThe group ceased to report Rosneft as a separate segment in the group's financial reporting for 2022 and its results are included in other businesses and corporate. See Note 1 Investment in Rosneft. Comparative information for 2021 and 2020 has been restated to reflect the change in reportable segments.\n\nOther businesses and corporate also comprises the group's shipping and treasury functions, and corporate activities worldwide.\n\nThe accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the group's accounting policies described in Note 1. However, IFRS requires that the measure of profit or loss disclosed for each operating segment is the measure that is provided regularly to the chief operating decision maker for the purposes of performance assessment and resource allocation. For bp, this measure of profit or loss is replacement cost profit or loss before interest and tax which reflects the replacement cost of supplies by excluding from profit or loss before interest and tax inventory holding gains and losses a . Replacement cost profit or loss before interest and tax for the group is not a recognized measure under IFRS.\n\nSales between segments are made at prices that approximate market prices, taking into account the volumes involved. Segment revenues and segment results include transactions between business segments. These transactions and any unrealized profits and losses are eliminated on consolidation, unless unrealized losses provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Sales to external customers by region are based on the location of the group subsidiary which made the sale. The UK region includes the UK-based international activities of customers & products.\n\nAll surpluses and deficits recognized on the group balance sheet in respect of pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are allocated to Other businesses and corporate. However, the periodic expense relating to these plans is allocated to the operating segments based upon the business in which the employees work.\n\nCertain financial information is provided separately for the US as this is an individually material country for bp, and for the UK as this is bp's country of domicile.",

If the inclusion of potentially issuable shares would decrease loss per share, the potentially issuable shares are excluded from the weighted average number of shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per share.\n\n|                                                                                                                       | $ million   | $ million   | $ million            |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|----------------------|\n|                                                                                                                       | 2022        | 2021        | 2020                 |\n| Profit (loss) attributable to bp shareholders                                                                         | (2,487)     | 7,565       | (20,305)             |\n| Less: dividend requirements on preference shares                                                                      | 1           | 2           | 1                    |\n| Profit (loss) for the year attributable to bp ordinary shareholders                                                   | (2,488)     | 7,563       | (20,306)             |\n|                                                                                                                       | 2022        | 2021        | Shares thousand 2020 |\n| Basic weighted average number of ordinary shares a                                                                    | 18,987,936  | 20,128,862  | 20,221,514           |\n| Potential dilutive effect of ordinary shares issuable under employee share-based payment plans                        | -           | 131,526     | -                    |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding used to calculate diluted earnings per  share                  | 18,987,936  | 20,260,388  | 20,221,514           |\n|                                                                                                                       |             |             | Shares thousand      |\n|                                                                                                                       | 2022        | 2021        | 2020                 |\n| Basic weighted average number of ordinary shares - ADS equivalent                                                     | 3,164,656   | 3,354,810   | 3,370,252            |\n| Potential dilutive effect of ordinary shares (ADS equivalent) issuable under employee share-based  payment plans      | -           | 21,921      | -                    |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares (ADS equivalent) outstanding used to calculate  diluted earnings per share | 3,164,656   | 3,376,731   | 3,370,252            |",

Earnings per share - continued\n\nThe number of ordinary shares outstanding at 31 December 2022, excluding treasury shares, and including certain shares that will be issuable in the future under employee share-based payment plans was 17,974,112,648 (2021 19,642,221,041). Between 31 December 2022 and 17 February 2023, the latest practicable date before the completion of these financial statements, there was a net increase of 6,834,739 of ordinary shares primarily as a result of share issues in relation to employee share-based payment plans partially offset by share buy backs. For additional information on share buy backs see Note 31.\n\n## Employee share-based payment plans\n\nThe group operates share and share option plans for directors and certain employees to obtain ordinary shares and ADSs in the company. Information on these plans for directors is shown in the Directors remuneration report on pages 112-147.\n\nThe following table shows the number of shares potentially issuable under equity-settled employee share option plans, including the number of options outstanding, the number of options exercisable at the end of each year, and the corresponding weighted average exercise prices. The dilutive effect of these plans at 31 December is also shown.\n\n| Share options   | 2022                           | 2022                               | 2022                           | 2021                               |\n|-----------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                 | Number of options a b thousand | Weighted average  exercise price $ | Number of options a b thousand | Weighted average  exercise price $ |\n| Outstanding     | 564,079                        | 4.00                               | 590,961                        | 4.26                               |\n| Exercisable     | 342                            | 4.99                               | 1,080                          | 4.73                               |\n| Dilutive effect | 83,204                         | n/a                                | 3,588                          | n/a                                |\n\nIn addition, the group operates a number of equity-settled employee share plans under which share units are granted to the group's senior leaders and certain other employees. These plans typically have a three-year performance or restricted period during which the units accrue net notional dividends which are treated as having been reinvested. Leaving employment will normally preclude the conversion of units into shares, but special arrangements apply for participants that leave for qualifying reasons. The number of shares that are expected to vest each year under employee share plans are shown in the table below. The dilutive effect of the employee share plans at 31 December is also shown.\n\n| Share plans Vesting   | 2022 Number of shares a thousand   | 2021 Number of shares a thousand   |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Within one year       | 167,672                            | 92,210                             |\n| 1 to 2 years          | 192,734                            | 149,077                            |\n| 2 to 3 years          | 226,027                            | 179,449                            |\n| 3 to 4 years          | 2,595                              | 109,265                            |\n| Over 4 years          | 173                                | 928                                |\n|                       | 589,201                            | 530,929                            |\n| Dilutive effect       | 244,886                            | 152,899                            |",

        "page_content": "## 14. Goodwill and impairment review of goodwill - continued\n\nThe value in use for relevant CGUs in both gas & low carbon energy and oil production & operations is based on the cash flows expected to be generated by the projected production profiles up to the expected dates of cessation of production of each field, based on appropriately risked estimates of reserves and resources. Midstream and supply and trading activities and equity-accounted entities are generally not included in the impairment reviews of goodwill, as they do not represent part of the grouping of CGUs to which the goodwill balances relate and which are used to monitor the goodwill balances for internal management purposes. Where such activities form part of wider CGUs to which goodwill relates they are reflected in the test. As the production profile and related cash flows can be estimated from bp's past experience, management believes that the cash flows generated over the estimated life of field is the appropriate basis upon which to assess goodwill and individual assets for impairment in both gas & low carbon energy and oil & production operations. The estimated date of cessation of production depends on the interaction of a number of variables, such as the recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons, the production profile of the hydrocarbons, the cost of the development of the infrastructure necessary to recover the hydrocarbons, production costs, the contractual duration of the production concession and the selling price of the hydrocarbons produced. As each field has specific reservoir characteristics and economic circumstances, the cash flows of each field are computed using appropriate individual economic models and key assumptions agreed by bp management.\n\nEstimated production volumes and cash flows up to the date of cessation of production on a field-by-field basis, including operating and capital expenditure, are derived from the business segment plans. The production profiles used are consistent with the reserve and resource volumes approved as part of bp's centrally controlled process for the estimation of proved and probable reserves and total resources.\n\nThe average production for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing in the gas & low carbon energy segment over the next 15 years is 191 mmboe per year (2021 261 mmboe per year) and in the oil production and operations segment is 346 mmboe per year (2021 604 mmboe per year). Production assumptions used for the goodwill impairment tests in both gas & low carbon energy and oil production & operations reflect management's best estimate of future production of the existing portfolio at the time of the calculation. The group's expectation to reduce upstream hydrocarbon production by around 25% by 2030 from its 2019 baseline is expected to be achieved through future active management, including divestments, and high-grading of the portfolio. Changes in upstream production since 2019 will be included in the best estimates however as the specific future changes to the portfolio are not yet known, these best estimates do not include the full extent of the expected upstream production reductions.\n\nThe weighted average pre-tax discount rate used in the review for the oil production & operations segment is 16%, and 10% for the gas & low carbon energy segment (2021 11% for both segments).\n\nThe most recent reviews for impairment for the oil production & operations and gas & low carbon energy segments were carried out in the fourth quarter. The key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculations are oil and natural gas prices, production volumes and the discount rate. The value-in-use calculations have been prepared for the purposes of determining whether the goodwill balances were impaired. Estimated future cash flows were prepared on the basis of certain assumptions prevailing at the time of the tests. The actual outcomes may differ from the assumptions made. For example, reserves and resources estimates and production forecasts are subject to revision as further technical information becomes available and economic conditions change. Due to economic developments, regulatory change and emissions reduction activity arising from climate concern and other factors, future commodity prices and other assumptions may differ from the forecasts used in the calculations.\n\nSensitivities to different variables have been estimated using certain simplifying assumptions. For example, lower oil and gas price or production sensitivities do not fully reflect the specific impacts for each contractual arrangement and will not capture all favourable impacts that may arise from cost deflation or savings. A detailed calculation in either segment at any given price or production profile may, therefore, produce a different result.\n\nIt is estimated that a 27% (2021 33%) reduction in revenue throughout each year of the remaining life of those assets, either as a result of adverse price or production conditions or a combination of each, would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net noncurrent assets of the oil production and operations segment. For gas & low carbon energy an 18% (2021 20%) reduction would have the same result.\n\nIt is estimated that no reasonably possible change in the discount rate would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net non-current assets of either segment.\n\n## customers & products\n\n|          | $ million   | $ million   | $ million       | $ million   | $ million   | $ million   | $ million   | $ million       | $ million   | $ million   |\n|----------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|\n|          | Castrol     | US Fuels    | European  Fuels | Other       | Total       | Castrol     | US Fuels    | European  Fuels | Other       | Total       |\n| Goodwill | 2,524       | 606         | 815             | 795         | 4,740       | 2,837       | 606         | 862             | 392         | 4,697       |\n\nCash flows for each CGU are derived from the business segment plans, which cover a period of up to five years. To determine the value in use for each of the cash-generating units, cash flows for a period of 10 years are discounted and aggregated with a terminal value. It is estimated that no reasonably possible change in the key assumptions used in the US Fuels and European Fuels goodwill impairment assessments would cause the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net non-current assets.\n\n## Castrol\n\nThe key assumptions to which the calculation of value in use for the Castrol unit is most sensitive are operating unit margins, sales volumes, and discount rate. Operating margin and sales volumes assumptions used in the detailed impairment review of goodwill calculation are consistent with the assumptions used in the Castrol unit's business plan. A pre-tax discount rate of 8% (2021 9%) is applied in the test. No reasonably possible change in any of these key assumptions would cause the unit's recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying amount of goodwill and related net non-current assets. Cash flows beyond the plan period are extrapolated using a nominal 3.4% (2021 2.8%) growth rate.",

At 31 December 2021 and 2020 bp classified its investment in Rosneft as an associate because, in management's judgement, bp had significant influence over Rosneft. On 27 February 2022, bp announced it would exit its shareholding in Rosneft and bp's two nominated Rosneft directors both stepped down from Rosneft's board. As a result, the significant judgement on significant influence over Rosneft was reassessed and a new significant estimate was identified for the fair value of bp's equity investment in Rosneft. From that date, bp accounts for its interest in Rosneft as a financial asset measured at fair value within 'Other investments'. The total pre-tax charge during the year-ended 31 December 2022 relating to bp's investment in Rosneft is $24,561 million consisting of $11,082 million included in losses on disposal, primarily relating to the recycling to the income statement of accumulated exchange losses, and a $13,479 million impairment charge including $528 million which relates to estimated earnings in the first two months of the year prior to the loss of significant influence. For further information see Note 1 Investment in Rosneft and Note 4 Disposals and impairment. As a result of bp's decision to exit its other businesses with Rosneft in Russia, which were primarily accounted for as investments in associates, an additional impairment charge of $1,043 million including $35 million which relates to estimated earnings in the first two months of the year and accumulated exchange losses of $479 million previously charged to equity have been taken to the income statement. The total pre-tax charge in 2022 relating to bp's investment in Rosneft and other businesses with Rosneft in Russia is $25,520 million.\n\n|                  | Income statement Earnings from associates   | Income statement Earnings from associates   | Income statement Earnings from associates   | $ million Balance sheet Investments in  associates   | $ million Balance sheet Investments in  associates   |\n|------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n|                  | 2022                                        | 2021                                        | 2020                                        | 2022                                                 | 2021                                                 |\n| Rosneft a        | 528                                         | 2,694                                       | (229)                                       | -                                                    | 14,354                                               |\n| Other associates | 874                                         | 762                                         | 128                                         | 8,201                                                | 6,647                                                |\n|                  | 1,402                                       | 3,456                                       | (101)                                       | 8,201                                                | 21,001                                               |\n\nThe group recognized dividends, net of withholding tax, of $nil from Rosneft in 2022 (2021 $640 million and 2020 $480 million).",

The fair value is determined using an estimate of discounted future cash flows that are expected to be received and is considered a level 3 valuation under the fair value hierarchy. Future cash flows are estimated based on inputs including oil and natural gas prices, production volumes and operating costs related to the disposed operations. The discount rate used is based on a risk-free rate adjusted for asset-specific risks. The contingent consideration principally relates to the disposal of our Alaskan business.\n\n## 19.

        "page_content": "## 24. Pensions and other post-retirement benefits\n\nMost group companies have pension plans, the forms and benefits of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned. Pension benefits may be provided through defined contribution plans (money purchase schemes) or defined benefit plans (final salary and other types of schemes with committed pension benefit payments). For defined contribution plans, retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee. For defined benefit plans, retirement benefits are based on such factors as an employee's pensionable salary and length of service. Defined benefit plans may be funded or unfunded. The assets of funded plans are generally held in separately administered trusts.\n\nFor information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to accounting for these plans see Pensions and other post-retirement benefits in Note 1.\n\nThe pension obligation in the UK consists primarily of a funded final salary pension plan under which retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity. This pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is composed of four member-nominated directors, four companynominated directors, one independent director and one independent chair nominated by the company. The trustee board is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment policies of the plan. This plan was closed to new joiners in 2010 and was closed to future accrual on 30 June 2021.\n\nEmployees in the UK are eligible for membership of a defined contribution plan.\n\nIn the US, all pension benefits now accrue under a cash balance formula. Benefits previously accrued under final salary formulas are legally protected. Retiring US employees typically take their pension benefit in the form of a lump sum payment upon retirement. The plan is funded and its assets are overseen by a fiduciary Investment Committee. During 2022 the committee was composed of seven bp employees appointed by the president of bp Corporation North America Inc. (the appointing officer). The Investment Committee is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as the investment policies of the plan. US employees are also eligible to participate in a defined contribution (401k) plan in which employee contributions are matched with company contributions.\n\nIn the US, group companies also provide post-retirement healthcare to eligible retired employees and their dependants (and, in certain legacy cases, life insurance coverage); the entitlement to these benefits is based on the date of hire, the employee remaining in service until a specified age and completion of a minimum period of service.\n\nIn the Eurozone, there are defined benefit pension plans in Germany, France, the Netherlands and other countries. In Germany and France, the majority of the pensions are unfunded. In Germany, the group's largest Eurozone plan, employees receive a pension and also have a choice to supplement their core pension through salary sacrifice. For employees who joined since 2002, the core pension benefit is a career average plan with retirement benefits based on such factors as an employee's pensionable salary and length of service. The returns on the notional contributions made by both the company and employees are based on the interest rate which is set out in German tax law. Retired German employees take their pension benefit typically in the form of an annuity. The German plans are governed by legal agreements between bp and the works council or between bp and the trade union.\n\nThe level of contributions to funded defined benefit plans is the amount needed to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due. During 2022 the aggregate level of contributions was $74 million (2021 $274 million and 2020 $325 million). The aggregate level of contributions in 2023 is expected to be approximately $150 million and includes contributions in all countries that we expect to be required to make contributions by law or under contractual agreements, as well as an allowance for discretionary funding.\n\nFor the primary UK plan there is a funding agreement between the group and the trustee. On a three year cycle a schedule of contributions is agreed covering the next five years. The schedule of contributions is next scheduled to be updated after the 31 December 2023 formal actuarial valuation. No contractually committed funding was due at 31 December 2022. The closure of the defined benefit plan to future accrual eliminated the need for funding in 2022 and reduces the plan's expected future funding volatility.\n\nThe surplus relating to the primary UK pension plan is recognized on the balance sheet on the basis that the company is entitled to a refund of any remaining assets once all members have left the plan.\n\nMinimum pension funding in the US is determined by legislation and is supplemented by discretionary contributions. No contributions were made into the US pension plan in 2022 and no statutory funding requirement is expected in the next 12 months.\n\nThe surplus relating to the US pension fund is recognized on the balance sheet on the basis that economic benefit can be gained from the surplus through a reduction in future contributions.\n\nThere was no minimum funding requirement for the US plan, and no significant minimum funding requirements in other countries at 31 December 2022.\n\nThe obligation and cost of providing pensions and other post-retirement benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method. The date of the most recent actuarial review was 31 December 2022. The UK plans are subject to a formal actuarial valuation every three years; valuations are required more frequently in many other countries. The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the UK pension plans was as at 31 December 2020. A valuation of the US plan and largest Eurozone plans are carried out annually.",

The inflation rate assumptions for our UK and US plans are based on the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds. In other countries, including the Eurozone, we use this approach, or advice from the local actuary depending on the information available. The inflation assumptions are used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions where there is such an increase.\n\nIn addition to the financial assumptions, we regularly review the demographic and mortality assumptions. The mortality assumptions reflect best practice in the countries in which we provide pensions and have been chosen with regard to applicable published tables adjusted where appropriate to reflect the experience of the group and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future. bp's most substantial pension liabilities are in the UK, the US and the Eurozone where our mortality assumptions are as follows:\n\n| Mortality assumptions                                     | Years   | Years   | UK   | Years   | Years   | Years   | Years   | Years   | Eurozone   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|------------|\n|                                                           |         |         |      | US      | US      | US      | US      |         |            |\n|                                                           | 2022    | 2021    | 2020 | 2022    | 2021    | 2020    | 2022    | 2021    | 2020       |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently  aged 60   | 26.9    | 26.9    | 26.9 | 25.0    | 24.9    | 24.7    | 26.0    | 25.8    | 25.7       |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently  aged 40   | 28.5    | 28.4    | 28.4 | 26.6    | 26.6    | 26.4    | 28.5    | 28.3    | 28.2       |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently  aged 60 | 28.8    | 28.9    | 28.8 | 28.0    | 27.9    | 27.7    | 29.3    | 29.1    | 29.0       |\n| Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently  aged 40 | 30.6    | 30.5    | 30.4 | 29.5    | 29.4    | 29.2    | 31.4    | 31.2    | 31.2       |\n\nPension plan assets are generally held in trusts, the primary objective of which is to accumulate assets sufficient to meet the obligations of the plans. The assets of the trusts are invested in a manner consistent with fiduciary obligations and principles that reflect current practices in portfolio management.\n\nA significant proportion of the assets are held in equities, which are expected to generate a higher level of return over the long term, with an acceptable level of risk. In order to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security has an unwarranted impact on the total portfolio, the investment portfolios are highly diversified.\n\nThe trustee's long-term investment objective for the primary UK plan as it matures is to invest in assets whose value changes in the same way as the plan liabilities, in order to reduce the level of funding risk. To move towards this objective, the UK plan uses a liability driven investment (LDI) approach for part of the portfolio, investing primarily in government bonds to achieve this matching effect for the most significant plan liability assumptions of interest rate and inflation rate. This is partly funded by short-term sale and repurchase agreements, whereby the plan borrows money using existing bonds as security and which will be bought back at a specified price at an agreed future date. The funds raised are used to invest in further bonds to increase the proportion of assets which match the plan liabilities. The borrowings are shown separately in the analysis of pension plan assets in the table below.\n\nFor the primary UK pension plan there is an agreement with the trustee to increase the proportion of assets with liability matching characteristics over time primarily by reducing the proportion of plan assets held as equities and increasing the proportion held as bonds. This agreement is not impacted by the closure of the plan to future accrual. There is a similar agreement in place for the primary US plan. During 2022, the asset allocation policies of the UK and the US plans switched 2% and 3% of plan assets respectively from equities to bonds (2021 5% and 13% respectively).\n\nThe current asset allocation policy for the major plans at 31 December 2022 was as follows:\n\n|                                         | UK   | US   |\n|-----------------------------------------|------|------|\n| Asset category                          | %    | %    |\n| Total equity (including private equity) | 10   | 24   |\n| Bonds/cash (including LDI)              | 83   | 76   |\n| Property/real estate                    | 7    | -    |",

A one-percentage point change, in isolation, in certain assumptions as at 31 December 2022 for the group's pensions and other post-retirement benefit expense would have had the effects shown in the tables below. The effects shown for the expense in 2023 comprise the total of current service cost and net finance income or expense.\n\n|                                          | $ million   | $ million        | $ million   | $ million   | $ million                     | $ million                     |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                          | UK          | UK               | US          | US          | One percentage point Eurozone | One percentage point Eurozone |\n|                                          | Increase    | Decrease         | Increase    | Decrease    | Increase                      | Decrease                      |\n| Discount rate a                          |             |                  |             |             |                               |                               |\n| Effect on expense in 2023                | (200)       | 179              | (42)        | 48          | (9)                           | 5                             |\n| Effect on obligation at 31 December 2022 | (2,043)     | 2,552            | (480)       | 686         | (512)                         | 616                           |\n| Inflation rate b                         |             |                  |             |             |                               |                               |\n| Effect on expense in 2023                | 82          | (77)             | 7           | (6)         | 31                            | (28)                          |\n| Effect on obligation at 31 December 2022 |             | 1,646    (1,531) | 39          | (34)        | 506                           | (441)                         |\n\n- b The amounts presented reflect the total impact of an inflation rate change on the assumptions for rate of increase in salaries, pensions in payment and deferred pensions.\n\n|                                          | $ million One year increase   | $ million One year increase   | $ million One year increase   |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                          | UK                            | US                            | Eurozone                      |\n| Longevity                                |                               |                               |                               |\n| Effect on expense in 2023                | 25                            | 4                             | 9                             |\n| Effect on obligation at 31 December 2022 | 504                           | 68                            | 182                           |\n\n## Estimated future benefit payments and the weighted average duration of defined benefit obligations\n\nThe expected benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, but exclude plan expenses, and the weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2022 are as follows:\n\n| Estimated future benefit payments   | UK    | US    | Eurozone   |   Other | $ million Total   |\n|-------------------------------------|-------|-------|------------|---------|-------------------|\n| 2023                                | 985   | 497   | 307        |    95   | 1,884             |\n| 2024                                | 1,016 | 473   | 301        |    90   | 1,880             |\n| 2025                                | 1,022 | 477   | 307        |    90   | 1,896             |\n| 2026                                | 1,035 | 468   | 297        |    90   | 1,890             |\n| 2027                                | 1,048 | 470   | 293        |    90   | 1,901             |\n| 2028-2032                           | 5,371 | 2,283 | 1,376      |   459   | 9,489             |\n| Weighted average duration           | 13.0  | 9.8   | 12.0       |    10.8 | Years             |",

Finance debt does not include accrued interest of $409 million (2021 $484 million), which is reported within other payables. As part of actively managing its debt portfolio, during the year the group bought back $7.4 billion (2021 $11.0 billion equivalent) of finance debt consisting entirely of US dollar bonds. Derivatives associated with non-US dollar debt bought back in 2021 were also terminated. These transactions have no significant impact on net debt or gearing.\n\nThe following table shows the weighted-average interest rates achieved through a combination of borrowings and derivative financial instruments entered into to manage interest rate and currency exposures.\n\n|                  | Fixed rate debt                  | Fixed rate debt                                     | Fixed rate debt   | Floating rate debt Total         | Floating rate debt Total   | Floating rate debt Total   |\n|------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n|                  | Weighted average interest rate % | Weighted average time for which rate is fixed Years | Amount $ million  | Weighted average interest rate % | Amount $ million           | Amount $ million           |\n|                  |                                  |                                                     |                   |                                  |                            | 2022                       |\n| US dollar        | 3                                | 14                                                  | 28,651            | 6                                | 18,105                     | 46,756                     |\n| Other currencies | 6                                | 8                                                   | 188               | -                                | -                          | 188                        |\n|                  |                                  |                                                     | 28,839            |                                  | 18,105                     | 46,944                     |\n|                  |                                  |                                                     |                   |                                  |                            | 2021                       |\n| US dollar        | 3                                | 12                                                  | 35,891            | 2                                | 25,074                     | 60,965                     |\n| Other currencies | 6                                | 9                                                   | 188               | 1                                | 23                         | 211                        |\n|                  |                                  |                                                     | 36,079            |                                  | 25,097                     | 61,176                     |\n\n## Fair values\n\nThe estimated fair value of finance debt is shown in the table below together with the carrying amount as reflected in the balance sheet.\n\nLong-term borrowings in the table below include the portion of debt that matures in the 12 months from 31 December 2022, whereas in the group balance sheet the amount is reported within current finance debt.\n\nThe carrying amount of the group's short-term borrowings, comprising mainly of commercial paper, approximates their fair value. The fair values of the significant majority of the group's long-term borrowings are determined using quoted prices in active markets, and so fall within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Where quoted prices are not available, quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets are used and such measurements are therefore categorized in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\n|                       | $ million   | $ million            | $ million   | $ million            |\n|-----------------------|-------------|----------------------|-------------|----------------------|\n|                       | Fair value  | 2022 Carrying amount | Fair value  | 2021 Carrying amount |\n| Short-term borrowings | 901         | 901                  | 2,191       | 2,191                |\n| Long-term borrowings  | 41,689      | 46,043               | 60,755      | 58,985               |\n| Total finance debt    | 42,590      | 46,944               | 62,946      | 61,176               |",

Our financial framework seeks to support the pursuit of value growth for shareholders while maintaining a secure financial base.\n\nThe group monitors capital on the basis of gearing, that is, the ratio of net debt to the total of net debt plus total equity. Net debt is calculated as finance debt, as shown in the balance sheet, plus the fair value of associated derivative financial instruments that are used to hedge foreign exchange and interest rate risks relating to finance debt for which hedge accounting is applied, less cash and cash equivalents. Net debt and gearing are non-GAAP measures. bp believes these measures provide useful information to investors. Net debt enables investors to see the economic effect of finance debt, related hedges and cash and cash equivalents in total. Gearing enables investors to see how significant net debt is relative to total equity. The derivatives are reported on the balance sheet within the headings 'Derivative financial instruments'. All components of equity are included in the denominator of the calculation.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, gearing was 20.5% (2021 25.3%).\n\n| At 31 December                                                         | 2022    | $ million 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|------------------|\n| Finance debt                                                           | 46,944  | 61,176           |\n| Less: fair value asset (liability) of hedges related to finance debt a | (3,673) | (118)            |\n|                                                                        | 50,617  | 61,294           |\n| Less: cash and cash equivalents                                        | 29,195  | 30,681           |\n| Net debt                                                               | 21,422  | 30,613           |\n| Total equity                                                           | 82,990  | 90,439           |\n| Gearing                                                                | 20.5 %  | 25.3 %           |\n\nAn analysis of changes in liabilities arising from financing activities is provided below.\n\n|                                                     | $ million    | $ million         | $ million         | $ million                                                                     | $ million                                              |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                     | Finance debt | Currency  swaps a | Lease liabilities | Net partner  payable for  leases entered  into on behalf of  joint operations | Total liabilities  arising from  financing  activities |\n| At 1 January 2022                                   | 61,176       | 481               | 8,611             | 250                                                                           | 70,518                                                 |\n| Exchange adjustments                                | (164)        | -

This primarily includes drilling rigs in the oil production & operations and gas & low carbon energy segments and retail service stations, oil depots and storage tanks in the customer & products segment as well as office accommodation and vessel charters across the group. The weighted-average remaining lease term for the total lease portfolio is around 7 years (2021 8 years). Some leases have payments that vary with market interest or inflation rates. Certain leases contain residual value guarantees, which may be triggered in certain circumstances such as if market values have significantly declined at the conclusion of the lease.\n\nThe table below shows the timing of the undiscounted cash outflows for the lease liabilities included on the balance sheet.\n\n|                                              | $ million   | $ million   |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|\n|                                              | 2022        | 2021        |\n| Undiscounted lease liability cash flows due: |             |             |\n| Within 1 year                                | 2,348       | 1,949       |\n| 1 to 2 years                                 | 1,728       | 1,631       |\n| 2 to 3 years                                 | 1,232       | 1,207       |\n| 3 to 4 years                                 | 740         | 1,005       |\n| 4 to 5 years                                 | 632         | 682         |\n| 5 to 10 years                                | 1,909       | 2,089       |\n| Over 10 years                                | 1,275       | 1,462       |\n|                                              | (1,315)     | (1,414)     |\n| Impact of discounting                        |             |             |\n| Lease liabilities at 31 December             | 8,549       | 8,611       |\n| Of which - current                           | 2,102       | 1,747       |\n| - non-current                                | 6,447       | 6,864       |\n\nThe group may enter into lease arrangements a number of years before taking control of the underlying asset due to construction lead times or to secure future operational requirements.

Fair value gains and losses related to other assets and liabilities classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss totalled a net loss of $238 million (2021 net gain of $627 million). Dividend income of $14 million (2021 $11 million) from investments in equity instruments classified as measured at fair value through profit or loss is presented within other income.\n\nInterest income and expenses arising on financial instruments are disclosed in Note 7.\n\n## Financial risk factors\n\nThe group is exposed to a number of different financial risks arising from ordinary business exposures as well as its use of financial instruments including market risks relating to commodity prices; foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates; credit risk; and liquidity risk.\n\nThe group financial risk committee (GFRC) advises the chief financial officer (CFO) who oversees the management of these risks. The GFRC is chaired by the CFO and consists of a group of senior managers including the EVP trading and shipping and SVPs treasury, tax, accounting reporting control and planning & performance management. The purpose of the committee is to advise on financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the group. The committee provides assurance to the CFO and the chief executive officer (CEO), and via the CEO to the board, that the group's financial risk-taking activity is governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with group policies and group risk appetite.\n\nThe group's trading activities in the oil, natural gas, LNG and power markets are managed within the trading and shipping business. Treasury holds foreign exchange and interest-rate products in the financial markets to hedge group exposures related to debt and hybrid bond issuance; the compliance, control and risk management processes for these activities are managed within the treasury business. All other foreign exchange and interest rate activities within financial markets are performed within the trading and shipping business and are also underpinned by the compliance, control and risk management infrastructure common to the activities of bp's trading and shipping business. All derivative activity is carried out by specialist teams that have the appropriate skills, experience and supervision. These teams are subject to close financial and management control.\n\nThe trading and shipping business maintains formal governance processes that provide oversight of market risk, credit risk and operational risk associated with trading activity. A policy and risk committee approves value-at-risk delegations, reviews incidents and validates risk-related policies, methodologies and procedures. A commitments committee approves the trading of new products, instruments and strategies and material commitments.\n\nIn addition, the trading and shipping business undertakes derivative activity for risk management purposes under a control framework as described more fully below.\n\n## (a) Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk or uncertainty arising from possible market price movements and their impact on the future performance of a business. The primary commodity price risks that the group is exposed to include oil, natural gas and power prices that could adversely affect the value of the group's financial assets, liabilities or expected future cash flows. The group has developed a control framework aimed at managing the volatility inherent in certain of its ordinary business exposures. In accordance with the control framework the group enters into various transactions using derivatives for risk management purposes.\n\nThe major components of market risk are commodity price risk, foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk, each of which is discussed below.\n\n## (i) Commodity price risk\n\nThe group's trading and shipping business is responsible for delivering value across the overall crude, oil products, gas, LNG and power supply chains. As such, it routinely enters into spot and term physical commodity contracts in addition to optimising physical storage, pipeline and transportation capacity. These activities expose the group to commodity price risk which is managed by entering into oil, natural gas and power swaps, options and futures.\n\nThe group measures market risk exposure arising from its trading positions in liquid periods using value-at-risk techniques based on Monte Carlo simulation models. These techniques make a statistical assessment of the market risk arising from possible future changes in market prices over a oneday holding period within a 95% confidence level. Trading activity occurring in liquid periods is subject to value-at-risk and other limits for each trading activity and the aggregate of all trading activity. The calculation of potential changes in value within the liquid period considers positions, historical price movements and the correlation of these price movements. Models are regularly reviewed against actual fair value movements to ensure integrity is",

The value-at-risk measure is supplemented by stress testing and scenario analysis through simulating the financial impact of certain physical, economic and geo-political scenarios. The value-at-risk measure in respect of the aggregated trading positions in liquid periods at 31 December 2022 was $63 million (2021 $100 million) whereas the average value-at-risk measure for the period was $89 million (2021 $64 million). This measure incorporates the effect of diversification reflecting the offsetting risks across the trading portfolio. Alternative measures are used to monitor exposures which are outside of liquid periods and for which value-at-risk techniques are not appropriate.\n\n## (ii) Foreign currency exchange risk\n\nSince bp has global operations, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on the group's reported results and future expenditure commitments. The effects of most exchange rate fluctuations are absorbed in business operating results through changing cost competitiveness, lags in market adjustment to movements in rates and translation differences accounted for on specific transactions. For this reason, the total effect of exchange rate fluctuations is not identifiable separately in the group's reported results. The main underlying economic currency of the group's cash flows is the US dollar. This is because bp's major product, oil, is priced internationally in US dollars. bp's foreign currency exchange management policy is to limit economic and material transactional exposures arising from currency movements against the US dollar. The group coordinates the handling of foreign currency exchange risks centrally, by netting off naturally-occurring opposite exposures wherever possible and then managing any material residual foreign currency exchange risks.\n\nMost of the group's borrowings are in US dollars or are hedged with respect to the US dollar. At 31 December 2022, the total foreign currency borrowings not swapped into US dollars amounted to $188 million (2021 $211 million). The group also has in issue perpetual subordinated hybrid bonds in euro, sterling and US dollars. Whilst the contractual terms of these instruments allow the group to defer coupon payments and the repayment of principal indefinitely, the group has chosen to manage the foreign currency exposure relating to the non-US dollar hybrid bonds to their respective first call periods.\n\nThe group manages the net residual foreign currency exposures by constantly reviewing the foreign currency economic value at risk and aims to manage such risk to keep the 12-month foreign currency value at risk below $400 million. At no point over the past three years did the value at risk exceed the maximum risk limit. A continuous assessment is made in respect of the group's foreign currency exposures to capture hedging requirements.\n\nDuring the year, hedge accounting was applied to foreign currency exposure to highly probable forecast capital expenditure commitments. The group fixes the US dollar cost of non-US dollar supplies by using currency forwards for the highly probable forecast capital expenditure. At 31 December 2022 the most significant open contracts in place were for $5 million sterling (2021 $55 million sterling).\n\nWhere the group enters into foreign currency exchange contracts for entrepreneurial trading purposes the activity is controlled using trading value-at-risk techniques as explained in (i) commodity price risk above.\n\n## (iii) Interest rate risk\n\nbp is also exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of its financial instruments, principally finance debt. While the group issues debt and hybrid bonds in a variety of currencies based on market opportunities, it uses derivatives to swap the economic exposure to a floating rate basis, mainly to US dollar floating, but in certain defined circumstances maintains a US dollar fixed rate exposure for a proportion of debt. The proportion of floating rate debt net of interest rate swaps at 31 December 2022 was 39% of total finance debt outstanding (2021 41%). The weighted average interest rate on finance debt at 31 December 2022 was 4% (2021 3%) and the weighted average maturity of fixed rate debt was fourteen years (2021 twelve years).\n\nThe group's earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on the element of the group's finance debt that is contractually floating rate or has been swapped to floating rates. If the interest rates applicable to these floating rate instruments were to have changed by one percentage point on 1 January 2023, it is estimated that the group's finance costs for 2023 would change by approximately $181 million (2021 $251 million).\n\nbp is exposed to benchmark interest rate components; primarily 3 month USD LIBOR. From 31 December 2021 some USD LIBOR tenors, and all EUR, GBP and CHF LIBOR tenors ceased to be published. The remaining USD LIBOR tenors, including 3 month USD LIBOR, will continue to be published until June 2023 .\n\nIn October 2020 the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) published its fallback protocol containing clauses to amend derivative contracts on the cessation of LIBOR should an entity and its counterparties adhere to the protocol. The protocol's pricing mechanism is at fair market value and bp has signed up to the protocol as this removes transition uncertainty for any interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swap contracts of the group. Market participants have mostly switched to the new risk free rates increasing market activity and liquidity as they move away from LIBOR. bp continues to monitor regulatory and market developments over the course of the transition.\n\nDuring 2022, bp's internal working group for IBOR reform continued to monitor market developments and manage the transition to alternative benchmark rates. The working group has identified financial instruments that are linked to existing interest rate benchmarks, primarily borrowings and derivative contracts. As at 31 December 2022 finance debt with a carrying value of $1,873 million (2021 $2,062 million) and derivatives with a nominal value of $24,088 million (2021 $24,088 million) are exposed to USD LIBOR and are expected to transition to alternative benchmark rates. The derivatives comprise relevant derivative contracts hedging finance debt and hybrid bonds all of which are covered by the ISDA fallback protocol. For finance debt, negotiations with relevant counterparties are ongoing and transition is expected before the end of June 2023. Any derivatives not actively transitioned before the end of June 2023 will be transitioned through the ISDA protocol. New contracts are being executed based on the new risk free rates. The working group continues to implement the relevant IT and operational requirements needed. bp continues to participate in external committees and task forces dedicated to interest rate benchmark reform.\n\n## (b) Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to perform or fail to pay amounts due causing financial loss to the group and arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with financial institutions and principally from credit exposures to customers relating to outstanding receivables. Credit exposure also exists in relation to guarantees issued by group companies under which the outstanding exposure incremental to that recognized on the balance sheet at 31 December 2022 was $1,704 million (2021 $1,407 million) in respect of liabilities of joint ventures and associates and $680 million (2021 $694 million) in respect of liabilities of other third parties. An amount of $267 million (2021 $337 million) is recorded as a liability at 31 December 2022 in relation to these guarantees. For all guarantees, maturity dates vary, and the guarantees will terminate on payment and/or cancellation of the obligation. In general, a payment under the guarantee contract would be triggered by failure of the guaranteed party to fulfil its obligation covered by the guarantee.",

        "page_content": "## 29. Financial instruments and financial risk factors - continued\n\nThe group has a credit policy, approved by the CFO that is designed to ensure that consistent processes are in place throughout the group to measure and control credit risk. Credit risk is considered as part of the risk-reward balance of doing business. On entering into any business contract the extent to which the arrangement exposes the group to credit risk is considered. Key requirements of the policy include segregation of credit approval authorities from any sales, marketing or trading teams authorized to incur credit risk; the establishment of credit systems and processes to ensure that all counterparty exposure is rated and that all counterparty exposure and limits can be monitored and reported; and the timely identification and reporting of any nonapproved credit exposures and credit losses. While each segment is responsible for its own credit risk management and reporting consistent with group policy, treasury holds group-wide credit risk authority and oversight responsibility for exposure to banks and financial institutions.\n\nFor the purposes of financial reporting the group calculates expected loss allowances based on the maximum contractual period over which the group is exposed to credit risk. Lifetime expected credit losses are recognized for trade receivables and the credit risk associated with the significant majority of financial assets measured at amortized cost is considered to be low. Since the tenor of substantially all of the group's in-scope financial assets is less than 12 months there is no significant difference between the measurement of 12-month and lifetime expected credit losses. Expected loss allowances for financial guarantee contracts are typically lower than their initial fair value less, where appropriate, amortization. Financial assets are considered to be credit-impaired when there is reasonable and supportable evidence that one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred. This includes observable data concerning significant financial difficulty of the counterparty; a breach of contract; concession being granted to the counterparty for economic or contractual reasons relating to the counterparty's financial difficulty, that would not otherwise be considered; it becoming probable that the counterparty will enter bankruptcy or other financial re-organization or an active market for the financial asset disappearing because of financial difficulties. The group also applies a rebuttable presumption that an asset is credit-impaired when contractual payments are more than 30 days past due. Where the group has no reasonable expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof, for example where all legal avenues for collection of amounts due have been exhausted, the financial asset (or relevant portion) is written off.\n\nThe measurement of expected credit losses is a function of the probability of default, loss given default (i.e. the magnitude of the loss after recovery if there is a default) and the exposure at default (i.e. the asset's carrying amount). The group allocates a credit risk rating to exposures based on data that is determined to be predictive of the risk of loss, including but not limited to external ratings. Probabilities of default derived from historical, current and future-looking market data are assigned by credit risk rating with a loss given default based on historical experience and relevant market and academic research applied by exposure type. Experienced credit judgement is applied to ensure probabilities of default are reflective of the credit risk associated with the group's exposures. Credit enhancements that would reduce the group's credit losses in the event of default are reflected in the calculation when they are considered integral to the related asset.\n\nThe maximum credit exposure associated with financial assets is equal to the carrying amount. The group does not aim to remove credit risk entirely but expects to experience a certain level of credit losses. As at 31 December 2022, the group had in place credit enhancements designed to mitigate approximately $12.6 billion (2021 $9.5 billion) of credit risk of which approximately $10.3 billion (2021 $7.5 billion) related to assets in the scope of IFRS 9's impairment requirements. Credit enhancements include standby and documentary letters of credit, bank guarantees, insurance and liens which are typically taken out with financial institutions who have investment grade credit ratings, or are liens over assets held by the counterparty of the related receivables. Reports are regularly prepared and presented to the GFRC that cover the group's overall credit exposure and expected loss trends, exposure by segment, and overall quality of the portfolio.\n\nManagement information used to monitor credit risk, which reflects the impact of credit enhancements, indicates that the risk profile of financial assets which are subject to review for impairment under IFRS 9 is as set out below.\n\n| As at 31 December   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|\n| AAA to AA-          | 9 %    | 14 %   |\n| A+ to A-            | 49 %   | 46 %   |\n| BBB+ to BBB-        | 15 %   | 14 %   |\n| BB+ to BB-          | 11 %   | 8 %    |\n| B+ to B-            | 12 %   | 16 %   |\n| CCC+ and below      | 4 %    | 2 %    |\n\nMovements in the impairment provision for trade and other receivables are shown in Note 21.",

The group's liquidity is managed centrally with operating units forecasting their cash and currency requirements to the central treasury function. Unless restricted by local regulations, generally subsidiaries pool their cash surpluses to the treasury function, which will then arrange to fund other subsidiaries' requirements, or invest any net surplus in the market or arrange for necessary external borrowings, while managing the group's overall net currency positions. While there is the potential for concerns about the energy transition to impact banks' or debt investors' appetite to finance hydrocarbon activity, we do not anticipate any material change to the group's funding or liquidity in the short to medium term as a result of such concerns.\n\nThe group benefits from open credit provided by suppliers who generally sell on five to 60-day payment terms in accordance with industry norms. bp utilizes various arrangements in order to manage its working capital and reduce volatility in cash flow. This includes discounting of receivables and, in the supply and trading businesses, managing inventory, collateral and supplier payment terms within a maximum of 60 days.\n\nIt is normal practice in the oil and gas supply and trading business for customers and suppliers to utilize letter of credit (LC) facilities to mitigate credit and non-performance risk. Consequently, LCs facilitate active trading in a global market where credit and performance risk can be significant. In common with the industry, bp routinely provides LCs to some of its suppliers.\n\nThe group has committed LC facilities totalling $12,730 million (2021 $12,575 million), allowing LCs to be issued for a maximum 24-month duration. There were also uncommitted secured LC facilities in place at 31 December 2022 for $3,800 million (2021 $4,290 million), which are secured against inventories or receivables when utilized. The facilities are held with over 28 international banks. The uncommitted LC facilities can only be terminated by either party giving a stipulated termination notice to the other.\n\nIn certain circumstances, the supplier has the option to request accelerated payment from the LC provider in order to further reduce their exposure. bp's payments are made to the provider of the LC rather than the supplier according to the original contractual payment terms. At 31 December 2022, $9,520 million (2021 $9,154 million) of the group's trade payables subject to these arrangements were payable to LC providers, with no material exposure to any individual provider. If these facilities were not available, this could result in renegotiation of payment terms with suppliers such that settlement periods were shorter.\n\nStandard & Poor's Ratings long-term credit rating for bp is A- (positive) and Moody's Investors Service rating is A2 (positive) and the Fitch Ratings' longterm credit rating is A (positive).\n\nDuring 2022, a $2 billion (2021 $6 billion) long-term taxable bond was issued with a maturity term of 10 years. In addition the group drew down on perpetual hybrid capital instruments with a US dollar equivalent value of $0.4 billion (2021 $0.9 billion) . Commercial paper is issued at competitive rates to meet short-term borrowing requirements as and when needed.\n\nAs a further liquidity measure, the group continues to maintain suitable levels of cash and cash equivalents, amounting to $29.2 billion at 31 December 2022 (2021 $30.7 billion), primarily invested with highly rated banks or money market funds and readily accessible at immediate and short notice. At 31 December 2022, the group had substantial amounts of undrawn borrowing facilities available, consisting of an undrawn committed $8.0 billion (2021 $8.0 billion) credit facility and $4.0 billion (2021 $4.0 billion) of standby facilities. As at 31 December 2022 the credit facility and standby facilities were available for two and four years respectively. The facilities are with 27 international banks and borrowings under them would be at pre-agreed rates. In February 2023 $11.7 billion of these facilities were extended for a further year.\n\nFor further information on the group's sources and uses of cash see Liquidity and capital resources on page 356.\n\nThe group manages liquidity risk associated with derivative contracts, other than derivative hedging instruments, based on the expected maturities of both derivative assets and liabilities as indicated in Note 30. Management does not currently anticipate any cash flows, other than noted below, that could be of a significantly different amount or could occur earlier than the expected maturity analysis provided.",

As part of actively managing the group's debt portfolio it is possible that cash flows in relation to associated derivatives could be accelerated from the profile provided. The amounts reflect the gross settlement amount where the pay leg of a derivative will be settled separately from the receive leg, as in the case of cross-currency swaps hedging non-US dollar finance debt or hybrid bonds. The swaps are with high investment-grade counterparties and therefore the settlement-day risk exposure is considered to be negligible. Not shown in the table are the gross settlement amounts (inflows) for the receive leg of derivatives that are settled separately from the pay leg, which amount to $23,970 million at 31 December 2022 (2021 $27,048 million) to be received on the same day as the related cash outflows.\n\n| Cash outflows for derivative financial instruments at 31 December   | 2022   | $ million 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|------------------|\n| Within one year                                                     | 1,492  | 1,497            |\n| 1 to 2 years                                                        | 2,531  | 1,492            |\n| 2 to 3 years                                                        | 2,053  | 2,531            |\n| 3 to 4 years                                                        | 5,575  | 2,053            |\n| 4 to 5 years                                                        | 3,584  | 5,575            |\n| 5 to 10 years                                                       | 7,627  | 8,618            |\n| Over 10 years                                                       | 2,772  | 5,365            |\n|                                                                     | 25,634 | 27,131           |\n\nFor further information on our derivative financial instruments, see Note 30.\n\n## 30. Derivative financial instruments\n\nIn the normal course of business the group enters into derivative financial instruments (derivatives) to manage its normal business exposures in relation to commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including management of the balance between floating rate and fixed rate debt, consistent with risk management policies and objectives. An outline of the group's financial risks and the objectives and policies pursued in relation to those risks is set out in Note 29. Additionally, the group has a well-established entrepreneurial trading operation that is undertaken in conjunction with these activities using a similar range of contracts.\n\nFor information on significant estimates and judgements made in relation to the valuation of derivatives see Derivative financial instruments within Note 1.\n\nThe fair values of derivative financial instruments at 31 December are set out below.\n\nExchange traded derivatives are valued using closing prices provided by the exchange as at the balance sheet date. These derivatives are categorized within level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Exchange traded derivatives are typically considered settled through the (normally daily) payment or receipt of variation margin.\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) financial swaps, forwards and physical commodity sale and purchase contracts are generally valued using readily available information in the public markets and quotations provided by brokers and price index developers. These quotes are corroborated with market data and are categorized within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nIn certain less liquid markets, or for longer-term contracts, forward prices are not as readily available. In these circumstances, OTC financial swaps and physical commodity sale and purchase contracts are valued using internally developed methodologies that consider historical relationships between various commodities, and that result in management's best estimate of fair value. These contracts are categorized within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.",

Derivative financial instruments - continued\n\nFinancial OTC and physical commodity options are valued using industry standard models that consider various assumptions, including quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, volatility factors, and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic factors.

The contracts may be entered into for risk management purposes, to satisfy supply requirements or for entrepreneurial trading. Certain contracts are classified as held for trading, regardless of their original business objective, and are recognized at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement. Trading activities are undertaken by using a range of contract types in combination to create incremental gains by arbitraging prices between markets, locations and time periods. The net of these exposures is monitored using market value-at-risk techniques as described in Note 29.\n\nThe following tables show further information on the fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments held for trading purposes.\n\nDerivative assets held for trading have the following fair values and maturities.\n\nLess than\n\n1 year\n\n1-2 years\n\n2-3 years\n\n3-4 years\n\n4-5 years\n\n536\n\n14\n\n10\n\n10\n\n9\n\n55\n\n634\n\n1,971\n\n445\n\n150\n\n63\n\n35\n\n89\n\n2,753\n\n7,157\n\n3,740\n\n749\n\n442\n\n316\n\n3,033\n\n15,437\n\n1,848\n\n1,317\n\n623\n\n376\n\n291\n\n1,072\n\n5,527\n\n42\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n2\n\n44\n\n11,554\n\n5,516\n\n1,532\n\n891\n\n651\n\n4,251\n\n24,395\n\n|                               | $ million        | $ million   | $ million   | $ million   | $ million   | $ million    | $ million   |\n|-------------------------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|\n|                               | Less than 1 year | 1-2 years   | 2-3 years   | 3-4 years   | 4-5 years   | Over 5 years | Total       |\n| Currency derivatives          | 168              | 52          | 1           | 1           | -           | 50           | 272         |\n| Oil price derivatives         | 1,544            | 429         | 167         | 47          | 4           | 1            | 2,192       |\n| Natural gas price derivatives | 2,678            | 847         | 547         | 456         | 368         | 1,927        | 6,823       |\n| Power price derivatives       | 1,322            | 553         | 285         | 174         | 124         | 647          | 3,105       |\n| Other derivatives             | -                | 7           | -           | -           | -           | 3            | 10          |\n|                               | 5,712            | 1,888       | 1,000       | 678         | 496         | 2,628        | 12,402      |\n\nOver\n\n5 years\n\nTotal\n\n$ million\n\n2022",

Gains or losses arise on contracts entered into for risk management purposes, optimization activity and entrepreneurial trading. They also arise on certain contracts that are for normal procurement or sales activity for the group but that are required to be fair valued under accounting standards. These gains and losses are included within sales and other operating revenues in the income statement. Also included within this line item are gains and losses on inventory held for trading purposes. The total amount relating to all these items was a net gain of $7,829 million (2021 $4,466 million net gain). This number does not include gains and losses on the change in value of contracts which are not recognized under IFRS such as transportation and storage contracts, but does include the associated financially settled contracts. The net amounts for actual gains and losses relating to these derivative contracts and all related items therefore differ significantly from the amounts disclosed above.\n\nAs outlined in Note 1- Significant estimate and judgement: derivative financial instruments, LNG contracts are only recognised in the financial statements when associated cargoes are lifted. The embedded value in these contracts is not recognised and is subject to underlying commodity price volatility, as observed during 2021 and 2022. bp expects material profits may be realised in the future as LNG cargoes are delivered. bp generally price risk manages the exposure to LNG cargoes due for delivery in the near term where there is a liquid market. It does so on a portfolio basis using derivative instruments amongst other price risk management strategies. Under IFRS, these derivative instruments, which are subject to similar price volatility, are recorded at fair value through profit and loss at each reporting period, which creates an accounting mismatch in the financial statements between the accounting for LNG contracts and the derivatives used for risk management. For the year ended 31 December 2021, LNG prices rose significantly and material losses on LNG related derivative positions were recorded. For the year ended 31 December 2022  due to active risk management and the movement in the underlying commodity prices, there were no material gains or losses recorded on the associated derivative positions. For additional information, details of management's internal measure of performance are given in the Group Performance Report on page 32 and on page 354.\n\nThe group also enters into derivative contracts relating to foreign currency risk management activities including contracts that the group has entered into to manage the foreign currency exposure relating to the non-US dollar hybrid bonds to their respective first call periods. The change in the unrealized value of these contracts was a net loss of $1,280 million (2021 $775 million net loss and 2020 $829 million net gain). Where the derivative is economically hedging finance debt, gains and losses on such derivative contracts are included within finance costs. Where the derivative is managing non-US hybrid bond exposure gains and loss are included within production and manufacturing expenses. Where these gains and losses arise on derivatives hedging finance debt they are largely offset by opposing net foreign exchange differences on retranslation of the associated non-US dollar debt. The net amounts for actual gains and losses relating to these derivative contracts and all related items therefore differ significantly from the amounts disclosed above.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\n(i) Foreign currency risk of highly probable forecast capital expenditure\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the group held currency forwards designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge relationships of highly probable forecast non-US dollar capital expenditure. Note 29 outlines the group's approach to foreign currency exchange risk management. When the highly probable forecast capital expenditure designated as a hedged item occurs, a non-financial asset is recognized and is presented within the fixed asset section of the balance sheet.\n\nThe group claims hedge accounting only for the spot value of the currency exposure in line with the strategy to fix the volatility in the spot exchange rate element.

Derivative financial instruments - continued\n\nThe group applies hedge accounting where there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument. The existence of an economic relationship is determined at inception and prospectively by comparing the critical terms of the hedging instrument and those of the hedged item. The group enters into hedging derivatives that match the currency and notional of the hedged items on a 1:1 hedge ratio basis. The hedge ratio is determined by comparing the notional amount of the derivative with the notional designated on the forecast transaction. The group determines the extent to which it hedges highly probable forecast capital expenditures on a project by project basis.\n\nThe group has identified the following sources of ineffectiveness, which are not expected to be material:\n\n- \u00b7 counterparty's credit risk, the group mitigates counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative transactions with high credit quality counterparties; and\n- \u00b7 differences in settlement timing between the derivative and hedged items. The latter impacts the discount factor used in the calculation of the hedge ineffectiveness. The group mitigates differences in timing between the derivatives and hedged items by applying a rolling strategy and by hedging currency pairs from stable economies. The group's cash flow hedge designations are highly effective as the sources of ineffectiveness identified are expected to result in minimal hedge ineffectiveness.\n\nThe group has not designated any net positions as hedged items in cash flow hedges of foreign currency risk.\n\n- (ii) Commodity price risk of highly probable forecast sales\n\nDuring the period the group held Henry Hub NYMEX futures designated as hedging instruments in cash flow hedge relationships of certain highly probable forecast future sales. Henry Hub NYMEX futures are subject to daily settlement, where their fair value at the end of each day is required to be cash settled, such that the carrying amount of these hedging instruments within continuing hedge relationships is always zero at the end of each day.\n\nThe group is exposed to the variability in the gas price, but only applied hedge accounting to the risk of Henry Hub price movements for a percentage of future gas sales from its BPX Energy business.\n\nThe group applied hedge accounting in relation to these highly probable future sales where there was an economic relationship between the hedged item and hedging instrument. The existence of an economic relationship was determined at inception and prospectively by comparing the critical terms of the hedging instrument and those of the hedged item. The group entered into hedging derivatives that matched the notional amounts of the hedged items on a 1:1 hedge ratio basis. The hedge ratio was determined by comparing the notional amount of the derivative with the notional amount designated on the forecast transaction.\n\nThe hedge was highly effective due to the price index of the hedging instruments matching the price index of the hedged item. The group did not designate any net positions as hedged items in cash flow hedges of commodity price risk.\n\nThe tables below summarize the change in the fair value of hedging instruments and the hedged item used to calculate ineffectiveness in the period.\n\n|                                              | Change in fair  value of hedging  instrument used  to calculate  ineffectiveness   | Change in fair  value of hedged  item used to  calculate  ineffectiveness   | Hedge  ineffectiveness  recognized in  profit or (loss)   |\n|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| At 31 December 2022                          |                                                                                    |                                                                             |                                                           |\n| Cash flow hedges                             |                                                                                    |                                                                             |                                                           |\n| Foreign exchange risk                        |                                                                                    |                                                                             |                                                           |\n| Highly probable forecast capital expenditure | -                                                                                  | -                                                                           | -                                                         |\n| Commodity price risk                         |                                                                                    |                                                                             |                                                           |\n| Highly probable forecast sales               | (825)                                                                              | 825                                                                         | -                                                         |\n| At 31 December 2021                          |                                                                                    |                                                                             |                                                           |\n| Cash flow hedges                             |                                                                                    |                                                                             |                                                           |\n| Foreign exchange risk                        |                                                                                    |                                                                             |                                                           |\n| Highly probable forecast capital expenditure | (1)                                                                                | 1                                                                           | -                                                         |\n| Commodity price risk                         |                                                                                    |                                                                             |                                                           |\n| Highly probable forecast sales               | (430)                                                                              | 430                                                                         | -                                                         |",

Note 29 outlines the group's approach to interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk management. The interest rate swaps are used to convert US dollar denominated fixed rate borrowings into floating rate debt. The cross-currency interest rate swaps are used to convert sterling, euro, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar and Norwegian krone denominated fixed rate borrowings into US dollar floating rate debt. The group manages all risks derived from debt issuance, such as credit risk, however, the group applies hedge accounting only to certain components of interest rate and foreign currency risk in order to minimize hedge ineffectiveness. The interest rate and foreign currency exposures are identified and hedged on an instrument-by-instrument basis. For interest rate exposures, the group designates as a fair value hedge the benchmark interest rate component only. This is an observable and reliably measurable component of interest rate risk.\n\nAll of the fair value hedge accounting relationships currently in place are directly affected by interest rate benchmark reform. The group's swaps which reference interest rates are primarily exposed to 3 month USD LIBOR. For all of the swaps that reference Inter-Bank Offered Rates (IBORs), ISDA fallback clauses to amend derivatives on the cessation of LIBOR are already available as bp and its counterparties have adhered to the protocol. The nominal amounts of the applicable hedging instruments represent the extent of the risk exposure bp manages for financial derivatives designated in fair value hedge relationships that is directly affected by the interest rate benchmark reform. These are disclosed in the table below. The interest rate benchmark reform does not change the risk management strategy for fair value hedges.\n\nUncertainty around the method and timing of transition from IBORs to alternative risk-free rates (RfRs) may impact the assessment of whether hedge accounting can be applied to certain hedging relationships. However, the temporary reliefs provided by IFRS 9 allow bp to assume that in the event that significant uncertainty around the reform arises:\n\n- \u00b7 the interest rate benchmark component of fair value hedges only needs to be assessed as separately identifiable at initial designation; and\n- \u00b7 the interest rate benchmark is not altered for the purposes of assessing the economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument for fair value hedges.\n\nThe reliefs above will continue to apply until the uncertainty arising from the interest benchmark reform with respect to the timing and amount of the underlying cash flows to which the group is exposed ends. The group expects this uncertainty to continue until either the ISDA fallback clauses are activated in June 2023 or the contracts that reference IBORs are modified replacing the IBOR benchmark rate with a risk free rate. The group's assumption is that any modifications to swaps will meet the 'economically equivalent' criteria with contractual changes restricted to only those changes necessary to replace the benchmark rate with a risk free rate.\n\nAt 31 December 2022 the reliefs apply and bp continues to monitor regulatory and market developments as it manages the contractual transition.\n\nFor foreign currency exposures, the group excludes from the designation the foreign currency basis spread component implicit in the cross-currency interest rate swaps. This is separately calculated at hedge designation, is recognized in other comprehensive income over the life of the hedge and amortized to the income statement on a straight-line basis, in accordance with the group's policy on costs of hedging.",

        "page_content": "## 30. Derivative financial instruments - continued\n\nThe group applies hedge accounting where there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument. The existence of an economic relationship is determined initially by comparing the critical terms of the hedging instrument and those of the hedged item and it is prospectively assessed using linear regression analysis. The group issues fixed rate debt and enters into interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps with critical terms that match those of the debt and on a 1:1 hedge ratio basis. The hedge ratio is determined by comparing the notional amount of the derivative with the notional amount of the debt. The hedge relationship is designated for the full term and notional value of the debt. Both the hedging instrument and the hedged item are expected to be held to maturity.\n\nThe group has identified the following sources of ineffectiveness, which are not expected to be material:\n\n- \u00b7 derivative counterparty's credit risk which is not offset by the hedged item. This risk is mitigated by entering into derivative transactions only with high credit quality counterparties; and\n- \u00b7 sensitivity to interest rate between the hedged item and the derivatives. This is driven by differences in payment frequencies between the instrument and the bond.\n\nThe tables below summarize the change in the fair value of hedging instruments and the hedged item used to calculate ineffectiveness in the period.

On a poll, shareholders present in person or by proxy have two votes for every \u00a35 in nominal amount of the first and second preference shares held and one vote for every ordinary share held. On a show-of-hands vote on other resolutions (procedural matters) at a general meeting, shareholders present in person or by proxy have one vote each.\n\nIn the event of the winding up of the company, preference shareholders would be entitled to a sum equal to the capital paid up on the preference shares, plus an amount in respect of accrued and unpaid dividends and a premium equal to the higher of (i) 10% of the capital paid up on the preference shares and (ii) the excess of the average market price of such shares on the London Stock Exchange during the previous six months over par value.\n\nDuring 2022 the company repurchased 1,900 million ordinary shares for a total consideration of $9,996 million, including transaction costs of $54 million. All shares purchased were for cancellation. The repurchased shares represented 10.0% of ordinary share capital. A further 107 million ordinary shares were repurchased between the end of the reporting period and 17 February 2023, the latest practicable date before the completion of these financial statements, for a total cost of $653 million of which $497 million has been accrued at 31 December 2022. The number of shares in issue is reduced when shares are repurchased.\n\n165 million new ordinary shares were issued in April 2022 as non-cash consideration for the acquisition of the public units of BP Midstream Partners LP.\n\n## Treasury shares a\n\n|                                                            | 2022            | 2022                    |                 |                         | 2020            | 2020                    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|\n|                                                            | Shares thousand | Nominal value $ million | Shares thousand | Nominal value $ million | Shares thousand | Nominal value $ million |\n| At 1 January                                               | 1,137,457       | 283                     | 1,187,650       | 296                     | 1,296,856       | 323                     |\n| Purchases for settlement of employee share plans           | 14,150          | 4                       | 1,432           | -                       | -               | -                       |\n| Issue of new shares for employee share-based payment plans | 55,000          | 14                      | 35,096          | 9                       | 34,116          | 9                       |\n| Shares re-issued for employee share-based payment plans    | (81,680)        | (20)                    | (86,721)        | (22)                    | (143,322)       | (36)                    |\n| At 31 December                                             | 1,124,927       | 281                     | 1,137,457       | 283                     | 1,187,650       | 296                     |\n| Of which - shares held in treasury by bp                   | 940,571         | 235                     | 1,037,201       | 259                     | 1,105,157       | 275                     |\n| - shares held in ESOP trusts                               | 184,356         | 46                      | 100,256         | 24                      | 82,491          | 21                      |\n| - shares held by bp's US share plan administrator b        | -               | -                       | -               | -                       | 2               | -                       |\n\nFor each year presented, the balance of shares held in treasury by bp at 1 January represents 5.0% (2021 5.2% and 2020 5.4%) of the called-up ordinary share capital of the company.\n\nDuring 2022, the movement in shares held in treasury by bp represented less than 0.5% (2021 less than 0.3% and 2020 less than 0.3%) of the ordinary share capital of the company.",

Capital and reserves - continued\n\n## Share capital\n\nThe balance on the share capital account represents the aggregate nominal value of all ordinary and preference shares in issue, including treasury shares.\n\n## Share premium account\n\nThe balance on the share premium account represents the amounts received in excess of the nominal value of the ordinary and preference shares.\n\n## Capital redemption reserve\n\nThe balance on the capital redemption reserve represents the aggregate nominal value of all the ordinary shares repurchased and cancelled.\n\n## Merger reserve\n\nThe balance on the merger reserve represents the fair value of the consideration given in excess of the nominal value of the ordinary shares issued in an acquisition made by the issue of shares.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares represent bp shares repurchased and available for specific and limited purposes. For accounting purposes shares held in Employee Share Ownership Plans (ESOPs) and bp's US share plan administrator to meet the future requirements of the employee share-based payment plans are treated in the same manner as treasury shares and are, therefore, included in the financial statements as treasury shares. The ESOPs are funded by the group and have waived their rights to dividends in respect of such shares held for future awards. Until such time as the shares held by the ESOPs vest unconditionally to employees, the amount paid for those shares is shown as a reduction in shareholders' equity. Assets and liabilities of the ESOPs are recognized as assets and liabilities of the group.\n\n## Foreign currency translation reserve\n\nThe foreign currency translation reserve records exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations. Upon disposal of foreign operations, the related accumulated exchange differences are reclassified to the income statement. Following, bp's decision to exit its shareholding in Rosneft on 27 February 2022 $10,372 million was reclassified to the income statement. See Note 1 - Investment in Rosneft.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThis reserve records the portion of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge that is determined to be an effective hedge. At 31 December 2021 and 2020 it included $651 million relating to the acquisition of an 18.5% interest in Rosneft in 2013. Following bp's decision to exit its shareholding in Rosneft on 27 February 2022 the full amount was reclassified to the income statement. See Note 1 - Investment in Rosneft. For further information on the accounting for cash flow hedges see Note 1 - Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.\n\n## Costs of hedging\n\nThis reserve records the change in fair value of the foreign currency basis spread of financial instruments to which cost of hedge accounting has been applied. The accumulated amount relates to time-period related hedged items and is amortized to profit or loss over the term of the hedging relationship. For further information on the accounting for costs of hedging see Note 1 - Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.\n\n## Profit and loss account\n\nThe balance held on this reserve is the accumulated retained profits of the group.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity in subsidiaries that is not attributable, directly or indirectly, to bp shareholders. Included within noncontrolling interests are perpetual subordinated hybrid bonds issued by BP Capital Markets PLC, a group subsidiary, on 17 June 2020 in euro, sterling and US dollars for a US dollar equivalent amount of $11.9 billion. The hybrid bonds include redemption options exercisable at the group's discretion from June 2025 to March 2030 (the first 'call date'), on specified dates thereafter, or in the event of specific circumstances (such as a change in IFRS or tax regime) as set out in the individual terms of each issue. Coupons are fixed for an initial period up to dates from September 2025 to June 2030 at rates of 3.25% to 4.875% and reset to rates determined by the contractual terms of each instrument on certain dates thereafter. The contractual terms of the hybrid bonds allow the group to defer coupon payments and the repayment of principal indefinitely, however their terms and conditions stipulate that any deferred payments must be made in the event of an announcement of an ordinary share or parity equity dividend distribution or certain share repurchases or redemptions. Payments made to and profit attributed to these hybrid bond holders in the year totalled $468 million (2021 $499 million and 2020 $89 million) and $468 million (2021 $497 million and 2020 $89 million) respectively. The accumulated non-controlling interest at the end of the year was $12,066 million (2021 $12,081 million).\n\nNon-controlling interests also includes perpetual subordinated hybrid securities issued during 2022 and 2021 by a group subsidiary, of $1,324 million. The proceeds from these issuances were specifically earmarked to fund the forward purchase and leaseback of an under-construction floating, production, storage, and offloading vessel (FPSO) to be used on one of the group's major projects. The contractual terms of these instruments allow the group to defer interest payments and repayment of principal indefinitely however their terms and conditions stipulate that the group must purchase them on the occurrence of certain events, all within the group's control, including the declaration or payment of a BP p.l.c. distribution after mid-May 2026. Payments made to and profit attributed to these hybrid security holders in the year totalled $61 million (2021 $nil ) and $51 million (2021 $10 million) respectively. The accumulated non-controlling interest at the end of the year was $1,324 million (2021 $960 million).\n\nAs the group has the unconditional right to avoid transferring cash or another financial asset in relation to these hybrid bonds and securities, they are classified as equity instruments and reported within non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements.",

Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nThere were contingent liabilities at 31 December 2022 in respect of guarantees and indemnities entered into as part of the ordinary course of the group's business. No material losses are likely to arise from such contingent liabilities. Further information on financial guarantees is included in Note 29.\n\nIn the normal course of the group's business, bp group entities are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings arising out of current and past operations, including matters related to commercial disputes, product liability, antitrust, commodities trading, premises-liability claims, consumer protection, general health, safety, climate change and environmental claims and allegations of exposures of third parties to toxic substances, such as lead pigment in paint, asbestos and other chemicals. The amounts claimed could be significant and could be material to the group's results of operations, financial position or liquidity. While it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome in some cases, bp expects that the impact of current legal and regulatory proceedings on the group's results of operations, liquidity or financial position will not be material.\n\nThe group files tax returns in many jurisdictions across the world. Various tax authorities are currently examining these returns, which contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations. The resolution of tax positions through negotiations with relevant tax authorities, or through litigation, can take several years to complete and the amounts could be significant and could, in aggregate, be material to the group's results of operations, financial position or liquidity. While it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome in some cases, bp does not expect there to be any material impact upon the group's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.",

Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings - continued\n\nThe group is subject to numerous national and local health, safety and environmental laws and regulations concerning its products, operations and other activities. These laws and regulations may require the group to take future action to remediate the effects on the environment of prior disposal or release of chemicals or petroleum substances by the group or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various sites including refineries, chemical plants, oil fields, commodities extraction sites, service stations, terminals and waste disposal sites. In addition, the group may have obligations relating to prior asset sales or closed facilities. The ultimate requirement for remediation and its costs are inherently difficult to estimate. However, the estimated cost of environmental obligations has been provided in these accounts in accordance with the group's accounting policies. While the amounts of future possible costs that are not provided for could be significant and material to the group's results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, it is not possible to estimate the amounts involved. bp does not expect these costs to have a material impact on the group's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\n\nIf production and manufacturing facilities and pipelines are sold to third parties and the subsequent owner is unable to meet their decommissioning obligations it is possible that, in certain circumstances, bp could be partially or wholly responsible for decommissioning. The group estimates that for production facilities, approximately $16 billion (2021 $13 billion) of associated decommissioning obligations were previously transferred to third parties. While the amounts associated with decommissioning provisions reverting to the group could be material, bp is not currently aware of any such material cases that have a greater than remote chance of reverting to the group. Furthermore, as described in Provisions and contingencies within Note 1, decommissioning provisions associated with customers & products facilities are not generally recognized as the potential obligations cannot be measured given their indeterminate settlement dates.\n\nBy their nature, it is not practicable to estimate the potential financial impact or possible timing of the above contingencies as there are significant uncertainties that are dependent on various factors that are not within the group's control.\n\n## Contingent liabilities related to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill\n\nFor information on legal proceedings relating to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, see Legal proceedings below. Any outstanding Deepwater Horizon related claims are not expected to have a material impact on the group's financial performance.\n\n## Legal proceedings\n\nProceedings relating to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill\n\n## Introduction\n\nBP Exploration & Production Inc. (BPXP) was lease operator of Mississippi Canyon, Block 252 in the Gulf of Mexico, where the semi-submersible rig Deepwater Horizon was deployed at the time of the 20 April 2010 explosion and fire and resulting oil spill (the Incident). Lawsuits and claims arising from the Incident were brought principally in US federal and state courts. The remaining proceedings arising from the Incident are discussed below.\n\n## Medical Benefits Class Action Settlement\n\nIn 2012 the Medical Benefits Class Action Settlement (Medical Settlement) was entered into with the plaintiffs steering committee. It involves payments to qualifying class members based on a matrix for certain Specified Physical Conditions (SPCs), as well as a 21-year Periodic Medical Consultation Program (PMCP) for qualifying class members. All SPC claims have been determined by the medical claims administrator. In total, 27,603 claims (comprising 22,833 SPC claims and 4,770 PMCP claims) have been approved for compensation totalling approximately $67 million and 9,624 claims have been denied.\n\nThe Medical Settlement also includes an exclusive remedy provision regarding class members pursuing exposure-based personal injury claims for latermanifested physical conditions (LMPCs). In order to seek compensation from bp for an LMPC, class members must file a notice with the medical claims administrator within four years after the date of first diagnosis of the LMPC. As of 31 December 2022, there were 105 pending lawsuits brought by class members claiming LMPCs.\n\nOther civil complaints - economic loss\n\nAll of the remaining economic loss and property damage claims from individuals and businesses have been settled or dismissed.\n\n## Other civil complaints - personal injury\n\nThe vast majority of post-explosion clean-up, medical monitoring and personal injury claims from individuals that either opted out of the Medical Settlement and/or were excluded from that settlement have been dismissed (including more than 300 cases in which the courts granted BPXP's motions for summary judgment). As of 31 December 2022, 414 cases remained pending.\n\n## Non-US government lawsuits\n\nOn 18 October 2012, a group of Mexican fishermen filed a class action complaint in a Mexican Federal District Court located in Mexico City against BP America Production Company (BPAPC) and other bp subsidiaries, seeking to recover for alleged environmental and economic harm in Mexico as a result of the Incident. On 27 June 2018, bp answered the complaint by seeking dismissal on various grounds including that no oil reached Mexican waters or land and there was no economic or environmental harm in Mexico. There has been no subsequent material development in these proceedings.\n\nOn 3 December 2015 and 29 March 2016, Acciones Colectivas de Sinaloa (ACS) filed two class actions (which have since been consolidated) in a Mexican Federal District Court on behalf of any person or entity harmed by the Incident, including several coastal Mexican states and municipalities against BPXP, BPAPC, and other entities which they claim are bp subsidiaries. In these class actions, plaintiffs seek an order requiring the bp defendants to repair the damage to the Gulf of Mexico, to pay penalties, and to compensate plaintiffs for damage to property, to health and for economic loss. BPXP and BPAPC opposed class certification and sought dismissal, principally on the basis that no oil reached Mexican waters or land and there was no economic or environmental harm in Mexico. Following the district court's certification of the class of 25 September 2019, various challenges and appeals have been made by both bp and ACS in relation to that decision and the class notification procedures, including the validity of signatures and supporting papers of purported class members. Final decisions on outstanding motions in these matters are pending.\n\nThese legal actions remain at a relatively early stage and while it is not possible to predict the outcome, bp believes that it has valid defences, and it intends to defend such actions vigorously.",

        "page_content": "## 33 . Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings - continued\n\n## Other legal proceedings FERC and CFTC matters\n\nFollowing an investigation by the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) of several bp entities, the Administrative Law Judge of the FERC ruled on 13 August 2015 that bp manipulated the market by selling next-day, fixed price natural gas at Houston Ship Channel in 2008 in order to suppress the Gas Daily index and benefit its financial position. In 2016, the FERC issued an Order affirming the initial decision and directing bp to pay a civil penalty of $20.16 million and to disgorge $207,169 in unjust profits. bp complied with the Order under protest and appealed the FERC's decision to the US Court of Appeals. On 20 October 2022, the Fifth Circuit issued an opinion upholding the FERC's finding that bp had engaged in market manipulation. The Fifth Circuit also found that the FERC did not have jurisdiction over most of the transactions identified as being violations. The matter has been remanded back to the FERC for further proceedings and reassessment of the penalty.\n\n## Lead paint matters\n\nSince 1987, Atlantic Richfield Company (Atlantic Richfield), a subsidiary of bp, has been named as a co-defendant in numerous lawsuits brought in the US alleging injury to persons and property caused by lead pigment in paint. The majority of the lawsuits have been abandoned or dismissed against Atlantic Richfield. Atlantic Richfield is named in these lawsuits as alleged successor to International Smelting and Refining and another company that manufactured lead pigment during the period 1920-1946. The plaintiffs include individuals and governmental entities. Several of the lawsuits purport to be class actions. The lawsuits seek various remedies including compensation to lead-poisoned children, cost to find and remove lead paint from buildings, medical monitoring and screening programmes, public warning and education of lead hazards, reimbursement of government healthcare costs and special education for lead-poisoned citizens and punitive damages. No lawsuit against Atlantic Richfield has been settled nor has Atlantic Richfield been subject to a final adverse judgment in any proceeding. The amounts claimed and, if such suits were successful, the costs of implementing the remedies sought in the various cases could be substantial. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal actions, Atlantic Richfield believes that it has valid defences. It intends to defend such actions vigorously and believes that the incurrence of liability is remote. Consequently, bp believes that the impact of these lawsuits on the group's results, financial position or liquidity will not be material and in future reports will not report on lead paint litigation absent any material developments.\n\n## Climate change\n\nBP p.l.c., BP America Inc. and BP Products North America Inc. are co-defendants with other oil and gas companies in multiple lawsuits brought in various state and federal courts on behalf of various governmental and private parties. The lawsuits generally assert claims under a variety of legal theories seeking to hold the defendant companies responsible for impacts allegedly caused by and/or relating to climate change. Underlying many of the legal theories are allegations regarding deceptive communication and disinformation to the public. The lawsuits seek remedies including payment of money and other forms of equitable relief. If such suits were successful, the cost of the remedies sought in the various cases could be substantial. All of these lawsuits remain at relatively early stages and while it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal actions, bp believes that it has valid defences, and it intends to defend such actions vigorously.\n\n## Louisiana Coastal restoration\n\nSix coastal parishes and the State of Louisiana have filed over 40 separate lawsuits in state courts in Louisiana against various oil and gas companies seeking damages for coastal erosion. bp entities are defendants in 17 of these cases. The lawsuits allege that the defendants' historical operations in oil fields within the Louisiana onshore coastal zone failed to comply with state permits and/or were conducted without the required coastal use permits. The plaintiffs seek unspecified statutory penalties and damages, including the costs of restoring coastal wetlands allegedly impacted by oil field operations.\n\nDefendants removed all of these lawsuits to federal court and the removals were contested by plaintiffs, eventually resulting in a decision from the US Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals rejecting defendants' 'federal officer' jurisdiction removal grounds in one of the two lead cases - Plaquemines Parish v. Riverwood, et al. Defendants' petition for writ of certiorari to the US Supreme Court seeking review of the US Fifth Circuit's Riverwood decision was denied in early 2023.  On remand from the US District Court, the state court in the other lead case of Cameron Parish v. Auster et al. has preliminarily established a November, 2023 trial date. bp is the lead defendant in Auster but is not named in the Riverwood case.\n\nIn addition, four private landowners have filed separate claims in the state courts in Jefferson and Plaquemines Parishes of Louisiana for restoration damages related to alleged impacts to their marshlands associated with historic oil field operations. bp entities are defendants in two of these private landowner cases.\n\nAll of these lawsuits remain at relatively early stages and while it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal actions, bp believes that it has valid defences, and it intends to defend such actions vigorously.",

The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.\n\n- (i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes:\n- (A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any; and\n- (B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.\n- (ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.\n- (iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty.\n- (iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when:\n- (A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favourable than in the reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed programme in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or programme was based; and\n- (B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental entities.\n- (v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon future conditions.\n\n## Undeveloped oil and gas reserves\n\nUndeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\n- (i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.\n- (ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer time.\n- (iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.\n\n## Developed oil and gas reserves\n\nDeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered:\n\n- (i) Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and\n- (ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well.\n\nFor details on bp's proved reserves and production compliance and governance processes, see pages 361-366.\n\n- a See Note 1 - Investment in Rosneft.",

This information is prepared in compliance with FASB Oil and Gas Disclosures requirements.\n\nFuture net cash flows have been prepared on the basis of certain assumptions which may or may not be realized. These include the timing of future production, the estimation of crude oil and natural gas reserves and the application of average crude oil and natural gas prices and exchange rates from the previous 12 months. Furthermore, both proved reserves estimates and production forecasts are subject to revision as further technical information becomes available and economic conditions change. bp cautions against relying on the information presented because of the highly arbitrary nature of the assumptions on which it is based and its lack of comparability with the historical cost information presented in the financial statements.\n\n|                                                             | Europe   | Europe         | North  America   | North  America        | South  America       | Africa Asia   | Africa Asia   | 2022 Australasia Total          |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------------|------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------------------------|\n|                                                             | UK       | Rest of Europe | US               | Rest of North America |                      | Russia        | Rest of Asia  |                                 |\n| At 31 December                                              |          |                |                  |                       |                      |               |               |                                 |\n| Subsidiaries                                                |          |                |                  |                       |                      |               |               |                                 |\n| Future cash inflows a                                       | 34,900   |                | -

A 'gross' well or acre is one in which a whole or fractional working interest is owned, while the number of 'net' wells or acres is the sum of the whole or fractional working interests in gross wells or acres. Productive wells are producing wells and wells capable of production. Developed acreage is the acreage within the boundary of a field, on which development wells have been drilled, which could produce the reserves; while undeveloped acres are those on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities, whether or not such acres contain proved reserves.\n\n|                                                 |                                                 | Europe   | Europe         | North  America   | North  America        | South  America   | Africa   | Asia   | Australasia        | Total a   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------|----------------|------------------|-----------------------|------------------|----------|--------|--------------------|-----------|\n|                                                 |                                                 | UK       | Rest of Europe | US               | Rest of North America |                  |          |        |                    |           |\n| Number of productive wells at 31 December 2022  | Number of productive wells at 31 December 2022  |          |                |                  |                       |                  |          |        |                    |           |\n| Oil wells b                                     | - gross                                         | 108      | 122            | 1,248            | 7                     | 5,231            | 839      | 2,580  | -                  | 10,135    |\n|                                                 | - net                                           | 60       | 19             | 702              | 2                     | 2,579            | 77       | 566    | -                  | 4,005     |\n| Gas wells c                                     | - gross                                         | 35       | 9              | 4,559            | -                     | 1,163            | 206      | 153    | 89                 | 6,214     |\n|                                                 | - net                                           | 6        | 1              | 2,507            | -                     | 417              | 88       | 58     | 18                 | 3,096     |\n| Oil and natural gas acreage at 31 December 2022 | Oil and natural gas acreage at 31 December 2022 |          |                |                  |                       |                  |          |        | thousands of acres |           |\n| Developed                                       | - gross                                         | 69       | 98             | 1,811            | 8                     | 1,298            | 1,374    | 1,315  | 840                | 6,813     |\n|                                                 | - net                                           | 40       | 16             | 1,039            | 1                     | 367              | 389      | 271    | 148                | 2,270     |\n| Undeveloped d                                   | - gross                                         | 666      | 172            | 3,876            | 9,339                 | 12,302           | 22,107   | 5,925  | 10,260             | 64,647    |\n|                                                 | - net                                           | 492      | 27             | 3,260            | 5,971                 | 5,595            | 9,189    | 1,863  | 7,121              | 33,518    |\n\n- a Because of rounding, some totals may not exactly agree with the sum of their component parts.\n- b Includes approximately 159 gross (28 net) multiple completion wells (more than one formation producing into the same well bore).\n- c Includes approximately 125 gross (93 net) multiple completion wells.

Productive wells include wells in which hydrocarbons were encountered and the drilling or completion of which, in the case of exploratory wells, has been suspended pending further drilling or evaluation. A dry well is one found to be incapable of producing hydrocarbons in sufficient quantities to justify completion.\n\n|             | Europe   | Europe         | North  America   | North  America        | South  America   | Africa   | Asia   | Asia         | Australasia   | Total a   |\n|-------------|----------|----------------|------------------|-----------------------|------------------|----------|--------|--------------|---------------|-----------|\n|             | UK       | Rest of Europe | US               | Rest of North America |                  |          | Russia | Rest of Asia |               |           |\n| 2022        |          |                |                  |                       |                  |          |        |              |               |           |\n| Exploratory |          |                |                  |                       |                  |          |        |              |               |           |\n| Productive  | -        | -              | 0.5              | 1.0                   | 1.0              | 0.6      | -      | 0.5          | 0.3           | 4.0       |\n| Dry         | -        | -              | -                | 1.2                   | 0.3              | 0.1      | -      | 0.8          | -             | 2.3       |\n| Development |          |                |                  |                       |                  |          |        |              |               |           |\n| Productive  | 0.9      | 1.5            | 137.2            | 0.3                   | 71.4             | 2.8      | -      | 39.0         | 1.4           | 254.5     |\n| Dry         | -        | -              | 1.1              | -                     | 0.5              | 0.1      | -      | 1.1          | -             | 2.8       |\n| 2021        |          |                |                  |                       |                  |          |        |              |               |           |\n| Exploratory |          |                |                  |                       |                  |          |        |              |               |           |\n| Productive  | -        | -              | 0.2              | -                     | 1.1              | 1.4      | 16.3   | 1.2          | -             | 20.2      |\n| Dry         | -        | -              | 0.6              | -                     | -                | 1.4      | -      | 0.3          | 0.4           | 2.7       |\n| Development |          |                |                  |                       |                  |          |        |              |               |           |\n| Productive  | 2.4      | 0.6            | 107.2            | 0.8                   | 69.4             | 2.5      | 285.2  | 27.3         | 1.3           | 496.6     |\n| Dry         | -        | 0.1            | 7.3              | -                     | 0.7              | -        | -      | 0.1          | -             | 8.2       |\n| 2020        |          |                |                  |                       |                  |          |        |              |               |           |\n| Exploratory |          |                |                  |                       |                  |          |        |              |               |           |\n| Productive  | -        | -              | 1.1              | 0.8                   | -                | 0.6      | 14.3   | 0.4          | -             | 17.2      |\n| Dry         | -        | -              | 1.8              | -                     | -                | -        | -      | 0.2          | -             | 2.0       |\n| Development |          |                |                  |                       |                  |          |        |              |               |           |\n| Productive  | 5.3      | 3.1            | 114.6            | 0.4                   | 61.7             | 4.4      | 199.1  | 40.3         | 2.0           | 430.9     |\n| Dry         | -        | -              | 3.0              | -                     | 1.0              | -        | -      | 0.6          | -             | 4.6       |\n\n- a Because of rounding, some totals may not exactly agree with the sum of their component parts.",

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\nAuthorization of financial statements and statement of compliance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework' (FRS 101)\n\nThe financial statements of BP p.l.c. for the year ended 31 December 2022 were approved and signed by the chief executive officer on 10 March 2023 having been duly authorized to do so by the board of directors. The company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard 100 'Application of Financial Reporting Requirements' (FRS 100) issued by the Financial Reporting Council. Accordingly, these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 and in accordance with the provisions of the UK Companies Act 2006.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable UK accounting standards.\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.\n\nAs permitted by FRS 101, the company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available in relation to:\n\n- (a) the requirements of paragraphs 10(d), 10(f), 16, 38A, 38B, 38C, 38D, 40A, 40B, 40C, 40D, 111 and 134 to 136 of IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements';\n- (b) the requirements in paragraph 38 of IAS 1 'Presentation of Financial Statements' to present comparative information in respect of paragraph 79(a)(iv) of IAS 1.\n- (c) the requirements of IAS 7 'Statement of Cash Flows';\n- (d) the requirements of paragraphs 30 and 31 of IAS 8 'Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors' in relation to standards not yet effective;\n- (e) the requirements of paragraphs 17 and 18A of IAS 24 'Related Party Disclosures';\n- (f) the requirements of IAS 24 'Related Party Disclosures' to disclose related party transactions entered into between two or more members of a group, provided that any subsidiary which is a party to the transaction is wholly owned by such a member;\n- (g)    the requirements of paragraphs 130(f)(ii), 130(f)(iii), 134(d) to 134(f) and 135(c)-135(e) of IAS 36, Impairment of Assets;\n- (h)    the requirements of paragraphs 45(b) and 46 to 52 of IFRS 2 'Share-based Payment';\n- (i) the requirements of IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures'; and\n- (j) the requirement of the second sentence of paragraph 110 and paragraphs 113(a), 114,115, 118, 119(a) to (c), 120 to 127 and 129 of IFRS 15 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers'.\n\nWhere required, equivalent disclosures are given in the consolidated financial statements of BP p.l.c.\n\nThe financial statements are presented in US dollars and all values are rounded to the nearest million dollars ($ million), except where otherwise indicated.\n\n## Significant accounting policies: use of judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\nInherent in the application of many of the accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements is the need for bp management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual outcomes could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. The accounting judgements and estimates that have a significant impact on the results of the group are set out in boxed text below, and should be read in conjunction with the information provided in the Notes on financial statements.\n\nThe areas requiring the most significant judgement and estimation in the preparation of the financial statements are the recoverability of investment carrying values and pensions. Judgements and estimates, not all of which are significant, made in assessing the impact of the current economic and geopolitical environment, and climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy on the financial statements are also set out in boxed text below. Where an estimate has a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year this is specifically noted within the boxed text.",

Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nJudgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy\n\nClimate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy were considered in preparing the financial statements. These may have significant impacts on the currently reported amounts of the company''s assets and liabilities discussed below .\n\n## Impairment of investments\n\nThe recoverable amounts of the company's investments in subsidiaries are closely linked to the carrying value of property, plant and equipment and goodwill in the individual subsidiaries. The energy transition is likely to impact the future prices of commodities such as oil and natural gas which in turn may affect the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and goodwill in the oil and gas industry. Management's best estimate of oil and natural gas price assumptions for value-in-use impairment testing for all subsidiaries were revised during 2022. Prices disclosed are in real 2021 terms. The Brent oil assumption from 2024 up to 2030 was increased to $70 per barrel to reflect near-term supply constraints before steadily declining to $45 per barrel by 2050 continuing to reflect the assumption that as the energy system decarbonizes, falling oil demand will cause oil prices to decline. The price assumptions for Henry Hub gas up to 2035 and up to 2050 were increased to $4.00 per mmBtu and $3.50 per mmBtu respectively, reflecting increased demand for US gas production to offset reduced Russian gas flows. The revised assumptions sit within the range of external scenarios considered by management and are in line with a range of transition paths consistent with the temperature goal of the Paris climate change agreement, of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\n\nJudgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of the geopolitical and economic environment\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the following areas involving judgement and estimates were identified as most relevant with regards to the impact of the current geopolitical and economic environment.\n\n## Going concern\n\nLiquidity and financing is managed within bp under pooled group-wide arrangements which include the company. As part of assuring the going concern basis of preparation for the company, the ability and intent of the bp group to support the company has been taken into consideration. The most recent bp group financial statements (see pages 151 to 262) continue to be prepared on a going concern basis. Forecast liquidity has been assessed under a number of stressed scenarios, including a significant decline in oil prices over the 12-month period. Reverse stress tests performed indicated that the group will continue to operate as a going concern for at least 12 months from the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements even if the Brent price fell to zero. In addition, group management of bp have confirmed that the existing intra-group funding and liquidity arrangements as currently constituted are expected to continue for the foreseeable future, being no less than twelve months from the approval of these financial statements. No material uncertainties over going concern or significant judgements or estimates in the assessment were identified. Accordingly, the company will be able to draw on support from the bp group for the foreseeable future and these financial statements have therefore been prepared on the going concern basis.\n\n## Pensions\n\nThe volatility in the financial markets during 2022 impacted the assumptions used for determining the fair value of plan assets and the present value of defined benefit obligations in the company's defined benefit pension plans. See significant estimate: pensions and Note 4 for further information.\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are recorded at cost. The company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If any such indication of impairment exists, the company makes an estimate of its recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, the investment is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. Where these circumstances have reversed, the impairment previously made is reversed to the extent of the original cost of the investment.",

        "page_content": "## 1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nSignificant judgements and estimates: recoverability of asset carrying values\n\nDetermination as to whether, and by how much, an investment holding company chain (defined as each direct subsidiary and its own investments), is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters such as the effects of inflation and deflation on operating expenses, discount rates, capital expenditure, carbon pricing (where applicable), production profiles, reserves and resources, and future commodity prices, including the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas and refined products. Determination as to whether, and by how much, an asset or CGU is impaired involves similar estimates.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal. Fair value less costs of disposal may be determined based on expected sales proceeds or similar recent market transaction data. Details of impairment charges recognized in the profit and loss account and the carrying amounts of investments are shown in Note 2. The estimates for assumptions made in impairment tests in 2022 relating to discount rates and oil and gas properties are discussed below. It is impracticable to reliably determine the extent of any impacts of changes in the assumptions used to determine the recoverable amounts of the company's investments given the diverse characteristics of the underlying assets and the interdependency of the various inputs. Changes in the economic environment including as a result of the energy transition or other facts and circumstances may necessitate revisions to these assumptions and could result in a material change to the carrying values of the group's assets within the next financial year.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nFor discounted cash flow calculations, future cash flows are adjusted for risks specific to the CGU. Value-in-use calculations are typically discounted using a pre-tax discount rate based upon the cost of funding the group derived from an established model, adjusted to a pre-tax basis and incorporating a market participant capital structure and country risk premiums. Fair value less costs of disposal discounted cash flow calculations use a post-tax discount rate. The discount rates applied in impairment tests are reassessed each year and in 2022 the pre-tax discount rate typically ranged from 7% to 18% (2021 7% to 15%) depending on the risk premium and applicable tax rate in the geographic location of the CGU.\n\n## Oil and natural gas properties\n\nFor upstream oil and natural gas properties in subsidiaries, expected future cash flows are estimated using management's best estimate of future oil and natural gas prices, and production and reserves and certain resources volumes. The estimated future level of production in all impairment tests is based on assumptions about future commodity prices, production and development costs, field decline rates, current fiscal regimes and other factors. A change in the discount rate, reserves, resources or the oil and gas price assumptions in the next financial year may result in a recoverable amount of one or more of these assets above or below the current carrying amount and therefore there is a risk of impairment reversals or charges in that period. Management consider that reasonably possible changes in the discount rate or forecast revenue, arising from a change in oil and natural gas prices and/ or production could result in a material change in their carrying amounts within the next financial year.\n\n## Oil and natural gas prices\n\nThe price assumptions used for value in use impairment testing are based on those used for investment appraisal. bp's carbon emissions cost assumptions and their interrelationship with oil and gas prices are described in 'Judgements and estimates made in assessing the impact of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy' on page 185. The investment appraisal price assumptions are recommended by the senior vice president economic & energy insights after considering a range of external price sets and supply and demand profiles associated with various energy transition scenarios. They are reviewed and approved by management. As a result of the current uncertainty over the pace of transition to lower-carbon supply and demand and the social, political and environmental actions that will be taken to meet the goals of the Paris climate change agreement, the scenarios considered include those where those goals are met as well as those where they are not met.\n\nDuring the year, bp's price assumptions applied in value-in-use impairment testing (in real 2021 terms) for Brent oil assumption from 2024 up to 2030 was increased to $70 per barrel to reflect near term supply constraints before steadily declining to $45 per barrel by 2050 continuing to reflect the assumption that as the energy system decarbonises, falling oil demand will cause oil prices to decline. The price assumptions for Henry Hub gas up to 2035 and up to 2050 were increased to $4 per mmBtu and $3.50 per mmBtu respectively to reflect the increased demand for US gas production to offset reduced Russian gas flows. These price assumptions are derived from the central case investment appraisal assumptions, adjusted where applicable to reflect short-term market conditions (see page 28). A summary of the group's revised price assumptions for Brent oil and Henry Hub gas, applied in 2022 and 2021, in real 2021 terms, is provided below. The assumptions represent management's best estimate of future prices at the balance sheet date, which sit within the range of external scenarios considered as appropriate for the purpose. They are considered by bp to be in line with a range of transition paths consistent with the temperature goal of the Paris climate change agreement, of holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. However, they do not correspond to any specific Paris-consistent scenario. An inflation rate of 2% (2021 2%) is applied to determine the price assumptions in nominal terms.\n\n| 2022 price assumptions   |    2023 |    2025 |    2030 |    2040 |   2050 |\n|--------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------|\n| Brent oil ($/bbl)        |   77    |   70    |   70    |   58    |   45   |\n| Henry Hub gas ($/mmBtu)  |    4    |    4    |    4    |    3.5  |    3.5 |\n| 2021 price assumptions   | 2022    | 2025    | 2030    | 2040    | 2050   |\n| Brent oil ($/bbl)        |   71    |   61    |   61    |   56    |   46   |\n| Henry Hub gas ($/mmBtu)  |    4.08 |    3.06 |    3.06 |    3.06 |    2.8 |\n\nThe parent company financial statements of BP p.l.c. on pages 291-349 do not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.",

Factors such as the availability of geological and engineering data, reservoir performance data, acquisition and divestment activity and drilling of new wells all impact on the determination of estimates of oil and natural gas reserves. bp bases its reserves estimates on the requirement of reasonable certainty with rigorous technical and commercial assessments based on conventional industry practice and regulatory requirements.\n\nReserves assumptions used for value-in-use tests in the company's subsidiaries reflect the reserves and resources that management currently intend to develop. The recoverable amount of oil and gas properties is determined using a combination of inputs including reserves, resources and production volumes. Risk factors may be applied to reserves and resources which do not meet the criteria to be treated as proved or probable.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nThe functional and presentation currency of the financial statements is US dollars. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Any resulting exchange differences are included in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities, other than those measured at fair value, are not retranslated subsequent to initial recognition.\n\nExchange adjustments arising when the opening net assets and the profits for the year retained by a non-US dollar functional currency branch are translated into US dollars are recognized in a separate component of equity and reported in other comprehensive income. Income statement transactions are translated into US dollars using the average exchange rate for the reporting period.\n\n## Financial guarantees\n\nThe company enters into financial guarantee contracts with its subsidiaries. At the inception of a financial guarantee contract, a liability is recognized initially at fair value and then subsequently measured at the higher of the contract's estimated expected credit loss and the amount initially recognized less, where appropriate, cumulative amortization.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\n## Equity-settled transactions\n\nThe cost of equity-settled transactions with employees of the company and other members of the group is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments on the date on which they are granted. The cost relating to employees of the company is recognized as an expense and the cost relating to other members of the group is recognized as a cost of investment in subsidiaries over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the employees become fully entitled to the award. A corresponding credit is recognized within equity. Fair value is determined by using an appropriate, widely used valuation model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the company (market conditions). Non-vesting conditions, such as the condition that employees contribute to a savings-related plan, are taken into account in the grant-date fair value, and failure to meet a non-vesting condition, where this is within the control of the employee is treated as a cancellation and any remaining unrecognized cost is expensed.\n\nFor other equity-settled share-based payment transactions, the goods or services received and the corresponding increase in equity are measured at the fair value of the goods or services received unless their fair value cannot be reliably estimated. If the fair value of the goods and services received cannot be reliably estimated, the transaction is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.\n\n## Cash-settled transactions\n\nThe cost of cash-settled transactions is recognized as an expense over the vesting period, measured by reference to the fair value of the corresponding liability which is recognized on the balance sheet. The liability is remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date until settlement, with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement.\n\n## Pensions\n\nThe defined benefit pension plans are plans that share risks between entities under common control. In each instance BP p.l.c. is the principal employer and carries the whole plan surplus or deficit on its balance sheet. The cost of providing benefits under the group's defined benefit plans is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benefits to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation. Past service costs, resulting from either a plan amendment or a curtailment (a reduction in future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the plan membership), are recognized immediately when the company becomes committed to a change.\n\nNet interest expense relating to pensions and other post-retirement benefits, which is recognized in the income statement, represents the net change in present value of plan obligations and the value of plan assets resulting from the passage of time, and is determined by applying the discount rate to the present value of the benefit obligation at the start of the year, and to the fair value of plan assets at the start of the year, taking into account expected changes in the obligation or plan assets during the year.\n\nRemeasurements of the defined benefit liability and asset, comprising actuarial gains and losses, and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest described above) are recognized within other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur and are not subsequently reclassified to profit and loss.\n\nThe defined benefit pension plan surplus or deficit recognized on the balance sheet for each plan comprises the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligation (using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds) and the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. Fair value is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price. Defined benefit pension plan surpluses are only recognized to the extent they are recoverable, either by way of a refund from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.\n\nContributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they become payable.\n\nThe parent company financial statements of BP p.l.c. on pages 291-349 do not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.",

        "page_content": "## 1. Significant accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions - continued\n\nSignificant estimate: pensions\n\nAccounting for defined benefit pensions involves making significant estimates when measuring the company's pension plan surpluses and deficits. These estimates require assumptions to be made about many uncertainties.\n\nPension assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year. These assumptions are used to determine the projected benefit obligation at the year end and hence the surpluses and deficits recorded on the company's balance sheet, and pension expense for the following year. The assumptions used are provided in Note 4.\n\nThe assumptions that are the most significant to the amounts reported are the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality levels. Assumptions about these variables are based on the environment in each country. The assumptions used vary from year to year, with resultant effects on future net income and net assets. Changes to some of these assumptions, in particular the discount rate and inflation rate, could result in material changes to the carrying amounts of the company's pension obligations within the next financial year for the UK plan. Any differences between these assumptions and the actual outcome will also affect future net income and net assets.\n\nThe values ascribed to these assumptions and a sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in the assumptions on the benefit expense and obligation used are provided in Note 4.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nIncome tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.\n\nIncome tax is recognized in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case the related tax is recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\n\nCurrent tax is based on the taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it is determined in accordance with the rules established by the applicable taxation authorities. It therefore excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods as well as items that are never taxable or deductible. The company's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences.\n\nDeferred tax assets are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that they will be realized in the future.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. See Note 6 for further details.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are recognized initially at fair value, normally being the transaction price. In the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs are also included. The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification, as set out below. The company derecognizes financial assets when the contractual rights to the cash flows expire or the rights to receive cash flows have been transferred to a third party along with substantially all of the risks and rewards or control of the asset. This includes the derecognition of receivables for which discounting arrangements are entered into.\n\n## Financial assets measured at amortized cost\n\nFinancial assets are classified as measured at amortized cost when they are held in a business model the objective of which is to collect contractual cash flows and the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest. Such assets are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognized in profit or loss when the assets are derecognized or impaired and when interest income is recognized using the effective interest method. This category of financial assets includes trade and other receivables.\n\n## Cash equivalents\n\nCash equivalents are short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and generally have a maturity of three months or less from the date of acquisition. Cash equivalents are classified as financial assets measured at amortized cost.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nAll financial liabilities held by the company are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities include other payables, accruals, and finance debt. The company determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost\n\nAll financial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. For interest-bearing loans and borrowings this is typically equivalent to the fair value of the proceeds received, net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.\n\nAfter initial recognition, financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are recognized in interest and other income and finance costs respectively.",

As a result, management performed an impairment test of the company's major investments in line with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. Taking into account improvements in performance of the investments and the increase in headroom in impairment tests performed by the company's subsidiaries, which is largely attributable to the upward revision of short-term oil and natural gas prices, management concluded that there were no impairments in terms of a deterioration of value in use or fair value less costs to sell. It was also deemed appropriate based on the analysis to reverse previously recognized impairment provisions in respect of the company's investments in subsidiaries.\n\nOn 27 February 2022, bp announced it will exit its shareholding in Rosneft Oil Company (Rosneft) and bp's two nominated Rosneft directors both stepped down from Rosneft's board. While the decision to exit the shareholding in Rosneft and its other businesses with Rosneft within Russia, combined with the market impact on Russian assets that has arisen following the military action in Ukraine has led to an impairment in the group consolidated financial statements (for additional information see page 188), the impairment tests outlined above do not indicate any impairment is required in respect of the BP International Limited holding chain (which owns the investment BP Russian Investments Limited which is the company that holds the investment in Rosneft) in the BP p.l.c. company financial statements.\n\nThe more important subsidiaries of the company at 31 December 2022 and the percentage holding of ordinary share capital (to the nearest whole number) are set out below.

These balances form a key part of the bp group's liquidity and funding arrangements under its centralised treasury funding model. Whilst IFA credit balances are legally repayable on demand, in practice they have no termination date. IFA debit balances can also be accessed by BP International Limited at short notice.\n\n## 4 . Pensions\n\nThe pension obligation consists primarily of a funded final salary pension plan in the UK under which retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity. This pension plan is governed by a corporate trustee whose board is composed of four member-nominated directors, four companynominated directors, an independent director, and an independent chair nominated by the company. The trustee board is required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants and is responsible for setting certain policies, such as investment policies of the plan. The plan was closed to new joiners in 2010 and was closed to future accrual on 30 June 2021. Employees in the UK are eligible for membership of a defined contribution plan.\n\nThe level of contributions to funded defined benefit plans is the amount needed to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due.\n\nFor the primary UK plan there is a funding agreement between the company and the trustee. On a three year cycle a schedule of contributions is agreed covering the next five years. The schedule of contributions is next scheduled to be updated after the 31 December 2023 formal actuarial valuation. No contractually committed funding was due at 31 December 2022. The closure of the defined benefit plan to future accrual eliminated the need for funding in 2022, and reduces the plan's expected future funding volatility.\n\nThe surplus relating to the primary UK pension plan is recognized on the balance sheet on the basis that the company is entitled to a refund of any remaining assets once all members have left the plan.\n\nThe obligation and cost of providing the pension benefits is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method. The date of the most recent actuarial review was 31 December 2022. The principal plans are subject to a formal actuarial valuation every 3 years in the UK. The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the main pension plan was as at 31 December 2020.\n\nThe material financial assumptions used for estimating the benefit obligations of the plans are set out below. The assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year and are used to evaluate the accrued benefit obligation at 31 December and pension expense for the following year.\n\n| Financial assumptions used to determine benefit obligation  a   | %    | %    |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|------|------|\n|                                                                 | 2022 | 2021 |\n| Discount rate for plan liabilities                              | 5.0  | 1.8  |\n| Rate of increase for pensions in payment                        | 2.9  | 3.2  |\n| Rate of increase in deferred pensions                           | 2.9  | 3.2  |\n| Inflation for plan liabilities                                  | 3.1  | 3.3  |\n| Financial assumptions used to determine benefit expense         |      | %    |\n|                                                                 | 2022 | 2021 |\n| Discount rate for plan service cost b                           | N/A  | 1.5  |\n| Discount rate for plan other finance expense c                  | 1.8  | 1.7  |\n| Inflation for plan service cost b                               | N/A  | 2.8  |\n\nThe discount rate assumption is based on third-party AA corporate bond indices and we use yields that reflect the maturity profile of the expected benefit payments. The inflation rate assumption is based on the difference between the yields on index-linked and fixed-interest long-term government bonds. The inflation assumption is used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions where there is such an increase.\n\nIn addition to the financial assumptions, we regularly review the demographic and mortality assumptions. The mortality assumptions reflect best practice in the UK and have been chosen with regard to the latest available published tables adjusted to reflect the experience of the plans and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future. For the main pension plan the mortality assumptions are as follows:\n\nThe parent company financial statements of BP p.l.c. on pages 291-349 do not form part of bp's Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.",

The assets of the trusts are invested in a manner consistent with fiduciary obligations and principles that reflect current practices in portfolio management.\n\nA significant proportion of the assets are held in equities, which are expected to generate a higher level of return over the long term with an acceptable level of risk. In order to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security has an unwarranted impact on the total portfolio, the investment portfolios are highly diversified.\n\nThe trustee's long-term investment objective for the primary UK plan as it matures is to invest in assets whose value changes in the same way as the plan liabilities, in order to reduce the level of funding risk. To move towards this objective, the UK plan uses a liability driven investment (LDI) approach for part of the portfolio, investing primarily in government bonds to achieve this matching effect for the most significant plan liability assumptions of interest rate and inflation rate. This is partly funded by short-term sale and repurchase agreements, whereby the plan borrows money using existing bonds as security and which will be bought back at a specified price at an agreed future date. The funds raised are used to invest in further bonds to increase the proportion of assets which match the plan liabilities. The borrowings are shown separately in the analysis of pension plan assets in the table below.\n\nFor the primary UK pension plan there is an agreement with the trustee to increase the proportion of assets with liability matching characteristics over time primarily by reducing the proportion of plan assets held as equities and increasing the proportion held as bonds. This agreement is not impacted by the closure of the plan to future accrual. During 2022, the asset allocation policy switched 2% of plan assets from equities to bonds (2021 5%).\n\nThe company's asset allocation policy for the primary plan is as follows:\n\n| Asset category                          |   % |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----|\n| Total equity (including private equity) |  10 |\n| Bonds/cash (including LDI)              |  83 |\n| Property/real estate                    |   7 |\n\nThe amounts invested under the LDI programme by the primary UK pension plan as at 31 December 2022 were $3,981 million (2021 $7,399 million) of government-issued nominal bonds and $11,945 million (2021 $24,516 million) of index-linked bonds.\n\nThe primary plan does not invest directly in either securities or property/real estate of the company or of any subsidiary.\n\nThe fair values of the various categories of assets held by the defined benefit plans at 31 December are presented in the table below, including the effects of derivative financial instruments. Movements in the fair value of plan assets during the year are shown in detail in the table on page 303.\n\n|                                                                        |                                                                        | $ million 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Fair value of pension plan assets                                      | Fair value of pension plan assets                                      |                  |\n| Listed equities                                                        | - developed markets                                                    | 2,964            |\n|                                                                        | - emerging markets                                                     | 252              |\n| Private equity a 2,715                                                 | Private equity a 2,715                                                 | 3,233            |\n| Government issued nominal bonds b                                      | Government issued nominal bonds b                                      | 7,491            |\n| Government issued index-linked bonds b                                 | Government issued index-linked bonds b                                 | 24,516           |\n| Corporate bonds b                                                      | Corporate bonds b                                                      | 10,128           |\n| Property c 2,297                                                       | Property c 2,297                                                       | 2,714            |\n| Cash                                                                   | Cash                                                                   | 1,136            |\n| Other                                                                  | Other                                                                  | 1,133            |\n| Debt (repurchase agreements) used to fund liability driven investments | Debt (repurchase agreements) used to fund liability driven investments | (10,723)         |\n|                                                                        |                                                                        | 42,844           |",

Though due in 2030, the loan is repayable to BP Finance p.l.c. at one business day's notice. It is disclosed as a non-current receivable in the financial statements of BP Finance p.l.c., given the counterparty has no intent to call the loan at short notice.\n\nThe company also has current payables of $83 million on IFAs payable to BP International Limited (2021 $4,023 million) (see also Note 3 - Receivables).\n\nNon-current amounts payable to subsidiaries includes an interest-bearing payable of $52,585 million with BP International Limited issued in December 2021 (2021 $52,585 million), with interest being charged based on a 3-month USD LIBOR rate plus 75 basis points and a maturity date of December 2028. This $60,000 million long-term loan facility replaces term loans with BP International Limited of $4,236 million that matured in December 2021 and $27,100 million with a maturity date of May 2023, providing additional long-term funding to the company. The loan includes a prepayment clause for BP p.l.c. to repay part or all of the loan before maturity whilst the lender has no right to call the loan other than in the event of the company being in default. As such it is disclosed as non-current in both the company and BP International Limited's financial statements.\n\nThe maturity profile of the non-current financial liabilities included in the balance sheet at 31 December is shown in the table below.

On a poll, shareholders present in person or by proxy have two votes for every \u00a35 in nominal amount of the first and second preference shares held and one vote for every ordinary share held. On a show-of-hands vote on other resolutions (procedural matters) at a general meeting, shareholders present in person or by proxy have one vote each.\n\nIn the event of the winding up of the company, preference shareholders would be entitled to a sum equal to the capital paid up on the preference shares, plus an amount in respect of accrued and unpaid dividends and a premium equal to the higher of (i) 10% of the capital paid up on the preference shares and (ii) the excess of the average market price of such shares on the London Stock Exchange during the previous six months over par value.\n\nDuring 2022 the company repurchased 1,900 million ordinary shares for a total consideration of $9,996 million, including transaction costs of $54 million, as part of the share repurchase programme announced on 27 April 2021. All shares purchased were for cancellation. The repurchased shares represented 10.0% of ordinary share capital. A further 107 million ordinary shares were repurchased between the end of the reporting period and 17 February 2023, the latest practicable date before the completion of these financial statements, for a total cost of $653 million of which $497 million has been accrued at 31 December 2022. The number of shares in issue is reduced when shares are repurchased.\n\n165 million new ordinary shares were issued in April 2022 as non-cash consideration for the acquisition of the public units of BP Midstream Partners LP.",

Capital and reserves\n\nSee statement of changes in equity for details of all reserves balances.\n\n## Share capital\n\nThe balance on the share capital account represents the aggregate nominal value of all ordinary and preference shares in issue, including treasury shares.\n\n## Share premium account\n\nThe balance on the share premium account represents the amounts received in excess of the nominal value of the ordinary and preference shares.\n\n## Capital redemption reserve\n\nThe balance on the capital redemption reserve represents the aggregate nominal value of all the ordinary shares repurchased and cancelled.\n\n## Merger reserve\n\nThe balance on the merger reserve represents the fair value of the consideration given in excess of the nominal value of the ordinary shares issued in an acquisition made by the issue of shares.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares represent bp shares repurchased and available for specific and limited purposes. For accounting purposes, shares held in Employee Share Ownership Plans (ESOPs) and by bp's US share plan administrator to meet the future requirements of the employee share-based payment plans are treated in the same manner as treasury shares and are, therefore, included in the financial statements as treasury shares. The ESOPs are funded by the company and have waived their rights to dividends in respect of such shares held for future awards. Until such time as the shares held by the ESOPs vest unconditionally to employees, the amount paid for those shares is shown as a reduction in shareholders' equity. Assets and liabilities of the ESOPs are recognized as assets and liabilities of the company.\n\n## Foreign currency translation reserve\n\nThe foreign currency translation reserve records exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial information of the foreign currency branch. Upon disposal of foreign operations, the related accumulated exchange differences are recycled to the income statement.\n\n## Profit and loss account\n\nThe balance held on this reserve is the accumulated retained profits of the company.\n\nThe profit and loss account reserve includes $23,610 million (2021 $24,107 million), the distribution of which is limited by statutory or other restrictions.\n\nThe financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022 do not reflect the dividend announced on 7 February 2023 which will be paid in March 2023; this will be treated as an appropriation of profit in the year ended 31 December 2023.",

Financial guarantees and other contingencies\n\nThe company has issued guarantees to third parties and other bp subsidiaries in case of the failure, on the part of certain bp subsidiaries, to pay current liabilities and obligations pertaining to business operations. The amounts guaranteed by the company, at 31 December 2022, for these arrangements is $107 million (2021 a $32 million). The company guarantees finance debt and lease obligations of certain bp group subsidiaries.  Maturity dates vary and guarantees will terminate on full payment and/or cancellation of the obligation. As of 31 December 2022, maximum guaranteed amounts pertaining to debt and lease arrangements were $57,265 million (2021 a $58,322 million). These maximum amounts are more than the actual guaranteed exposure due at the balance sheet date as well as more than remaining obligations under the guaranteed contracts.\n\nPerformance under all the above guarantees would be triggered by a financial default of the guaranteed entity and, as such, are currently not expected to have any material effect.\n\nAs part of normal ongoing business operations and consistent with generally accepted industry practices, the company also executes contracts involving standard indemnities and guarantees for the respective businesses in which bp operates as well as indemnities specific to transactions, including the sale of businesses.  This includes a guarantee of subsidiaries' liabilities under the Consent Decree between the United States, the Gulf states and bp and under the settlement agreement with the Gulf states in relation to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. The company has also issued uncapped guarantees for certain subsidiaries' liabilities under the Plaintiffs' Steering Committee agreement relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. See  Note 33 in the consolidated group financial statements of BP p.l.c. for further information. The company regularly evaluates the probability of having to incur costs associated with these indemnities and does not believe such matters will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and cash flow.\n\nIn addition, BP plc guarantees $11.9 billion of perpetual subordinated hybrid bonds issued by a subsidiary.\n\nThe company believes that guarantees and other off-balance sheet commitments do not currently, nor could reasonably have in the future, a material effect on its financial position, income and expenses, liquidity, investments or financial resources.\n\n## 10.

In 2020 these amounts, which were not material, were presented within production and manufacturing expenses and as an 'other' adjusting item in the other business & corporate segment.\n\n- l Includes the unwinding of discounting effects relating to Gulf of Mexico oil spill payables and the income statement impact associated with the buyback of finance debt (see Financial statements - Note 26 for further information).\n- m Includes certain foreign exchange effects on tax as adjusting items. These amounts represent the impact of: (i) foreign exchange on deferred tax balances arising from the conversion of local currency tax base amounts into functional currency; and (ii) taxable gains and losses from the retranslation of US dollar-denominated intra-group loans to local currency.\n- n 2022 includes the deferred tax impact of the UK Energy Profits Levy (EPL) on existing temporary differences unwinding over the period 1 January 2023 to 31 March 2028. The revised EPL substantively enacted in the fourth quarter 2022 increases the headline rate of tax to 75% and applies to taxable profits from bp's North Sea business made from 1 January 2023 until 31 March 2028. The original UK EPL enacted in the third quarter increased the headline rate of tax to 65% on taxable profits between 26 May 2022 and 31 December 2025. The revised EPL supersedes the original EPL from 1 January 2023.\n- o 2022 includes a $505-million charge in respect of the EU Solidarity Contribution.\n\n## Non-GAAP information on fair value accounting effects\n\nThe impacts of fair value accounting effects, relative to management's internal measure of performance, are set out below.

        "page_content": "## Liquidity and capital resources\n\n## Financial framework\n\nbp has a resilient financial framework that, taken together with our strategy, creates a compelling investor proposition offering committed distributions, profitable growth and sustainable value. The framework comprises a coherent approach to capital allocation, a resilient balance sheet, a disciplined approach to investment allocation and a relentless focus on executing bp's business plan.\n\nbp's approach to capital allocation leads to a clear set of priorities funding our resilient dividend as the first priority, maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating, disciplined investment in our transition growth \u00ab engines to advance our energy transition strategy and investment in oil, gas, refining and other businesses, and then returning surplus cash \u00ab as share buybacks. In a period of low prices, the group has the flexibility to reduce cash costs and to reduce or defer capital investment, as appropriate.\n\nOur shareholder distribution policy reflects these priorities for the uses of cash alongside an ongoing consideration of factors, including changes in the environment, the underlying performance of the business, the outlook for the group financial framework, and other market factors which may vary quarter to quarter.\n\nNet debt \u00ab at 31 December 2022 was $21.4 billion and is expected to reduce in line with the growth in operating cash flow \u00ab . As at 31 December 2022 our target of $25 billion of divestment and other proceeds between the second half of 2020 and 2025 was underpinned by agreed or completed transactions of around $18.6 billion with $15.9 billion of proceeds received.\n\nWe expect operating cash flow to cover capital expenditure \u00ab and the dividend. Capital expenditure in 2022 was $16.3 billion, including $3.9 billion of inorganic capital expenditure \u00ab . bp expects capital expenditure of $16-18 billion in 2023 and expects a range of $14-18 billion per annum through 2030 including inorganic expenditure. bp's cash balancing point is expected to average around $40 per barrel Brent (assuming an average refining marker margin of around $11 per barrel and Henry Hub gas price at $3 per mmBtu) in 2021 real terms.\n\nIn 2022, the return on average capital employed \u00ab was 30.5% a at an average of $101 per barrel. The return on average capital employed is targeted to be over 18% by 2025 at $70 per barrel in 2021 real terms, and assuming bp planning assumptions, as we continue to execute our strategy. This is supported by an expected growth on adjusted EBIDA per share compound annual growth rate \u00ab from the second half 2019/first half 2020 b to 2025 and subject to the same price and planning assumptions.\n\n- a Nearest equivalent GAAP measures: Profit/(loss) for the period attributable to bp shareholders divided by total equity (3.0)%.\n- b Adjusted to exclude Rosneft.\n\n## Dividends and other distributions to shareholders\n\nThe dividend is determined in US dollars, the economic currency of bp, and the dividend level is reviewed by the board each quarter. The quarterly dividend was increased from 5.460 to 6.006 cents per ordinary share per quarter in the second quarter of 2022 and to 6.610 cents per ordinary share per quarter in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nThe total dividend distributed to bp shareholders in 2022 was $4.4 billion (2021 $4.3 billion). This dividend was all paid in cash as shareholders no longer have the option to receive a scrip dividend in place of receiving cash.\n\nIncluded in the distribution policy is a commitment that, subject to maintaining a strong investment grade credit rating, at least 60% of surplus cash will be distributed to shareholders through share buybacks. In 2022 bp executed $10.0 billion of share buybacks (2021 $3.2 billion), including fees and stamp duty. Since 1 January 2023 an additional $0.7 billion shares have been repurchased up to 17 February 2023, including fees and stamp duty. Based on bp's current forecasts, at around $60 per barrel Brent and subject to the board's discretion each quarter, bp expects to be able to deliver share buybacks of around $4.0 billion per annum, at the lower end of its capital expenditure range, and have capacity for an annual increase in the dividend per ordinary share of around 4%. In setting the dividend and share buybacks each quarter, the board will continue to take into account factors including the cumulative level of and outlook for surplus cash flow,\n\nthe cash balance point \u00ab and the maintenance of a strong investment grade credit rating.\n\n## Financing the group's activities\n\nThe group's principal commodities, oil and gas, are priced internationally in US dollars. Group policy has generally been to minimize economic exposure to currency movements by financing operations with US dollar debt. Where debt and hybrid bonds are issued in other currencies, they are generally swapped back to US dollars using derivative contracts, or else hedged by maintaining offsetting cash positions in the same currency. Cash balances of the group are mainly held in US dollars or swapped to US dollars and holdings are well diversified to reduce concentration risk. The group is not, therefore, exposed to significant currency risk regarding its cash or borrowings. Also see Risk factors on page 73 for further information on risks associated with prices and markets and Financial statements - Note 29.\n\nThe group's finance debt at 31 December 2022 amounted to $46.9 billion (2021 $61.2 billion). Of the total finance debt, $3.2 billion is classified as short term at the end of 2022 (2021 $5.6 billion). See Financial statements - Note 26 for more information on the short-term balance. Net debt \u00ab was $21.4 billion at the end of 2022, a decrease of $9.2 billion from the 2021 year-end position of $30.6 billion. BP p.l.c. fully and unconditionally guarantees securities issued by BP Capital Markets p.l.c. and BP Capital Markets America Inc., which are 100%-owned finance subsidiaries of BP p.l.c.\n\nAt 31 December 2022 the group held a balance of $13.4 billion (2021 $13.0 billion) issued perpetual subordinated hybrid bonds, of which $1.3 billion (2021 $1.0 billion) were issued to fund one of the group's major projects. As the group has the unconditional right to avoid transfer of cash or another financial asset in relation to these hybrid bonds, which were issued by group subsidiaries, they are classified as equity instruments and reported within non-controlling interest.\n\nThe ratio of finance debt to finance debt plus total equity at 31 December 2022 was 36.1% (2021 40.3%). Gearing was 20.5% at the end of 2022 (2021 25.3%). See Financial statements - Note 27 for finance debt, which is the nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis, and for further information on net debt.\n\nCash and cash equivalents of $29.2 billion at 31 December 2022 (2021 $30.7 billion) are included in net debt. We manage our cash position so that the group has adequate cover to respond to potential short-term market liquidity, short-term price environment volatility and expect to maintain a robust cash position.\n\nThe group also has an undrawn committed $8 billion credit facility and undrawn committed bank facilities of $4 billion (see Financial statements Note 29 for more information).\n\nWe believe that the group's resilient balance sheet and strong investment grade credit rating will allow the group to meet its known contractual and other obligations in both the short and long term with the group having sufficient working capital, taking into account the amounts of undrawn borrowings facilities, access to capital markets, levels of cash and cash equivalents and its ongoing ability to generate cash through operations. This belief is subject to a degree of uncertainty that can be expected to increase looking out over time and, accordingly, that future outcomes cannot be guaranteed or predicted with certainty.\n\nbp utilizes various arrangements in order to manage its working capital including discounting of receivables and, in the supply and trading business, the active management of supplier payment terms, inventory and collateral.\n\nStandard & Poor's Ratings' long-term credit rating for BP p.l.c. is A(positive), the Moody's Investors Service rating is A2 (positive) and the Fitch Ratings' long-term credit rating is A (positive).\n\nThe group's sources of funding, its access to capital markets and maintaining a strong cash position are described in Financial statements Note 25 and Note 29. Further information on the management of liquidity risk and credit risk, and the maturity profile and fixed/floating rate characteristics of the group's debt are also provided in Financial statements - Note 26 and Note 29.\n\nThe information above contains forward-looking statements, which by their nature involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will or may occur in the future and are outside the control of bp.",

The decrease is primarily due to bp no longer accounting for its interest in Rosneft as an equity-accounted entity (see Financial statements - Note 1). These amounts are not reflected in the group's debt on the balance sheet. The group has issued third-party guarantees under which amounts outstanding, incremental to amounts recognized on the balance sheet, at 31 December 2022 were $1,704 million (2021 $1,407 million) in respect of liabilities of joint ventures \u00ab and associates \u00ab and $680 million (2021 $694 million) in respect of liabilities of other third parties. Of these amounts, $1,701 million (2021 $1,407 million) of the joint ventures and associates guarantees relate to borrowings and, for other third-party guarantees, $557 million (2021 $594 million) relate to guarantees of borrowings.\n\n## Contractual obligations\n\nThe following table summarizes the group's capital expenditure commitments for property, plant and equipment at 31 December 2022 and the proportion of that expenditure for which contracts have been placed.\n\n|                        | $ million Payments due by period   | $ million Payments due by period   | $ million Payments due by period   |\n|------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Capital expenditure    | Less than 1  year                  | More than 1  year                  | Total                              |\n| Committed              | 11,395                             | 7,893                              | 19,288                             |\n| of which is contracted | 6,024                              | 3,364                              | 9,388                              |\n\nCapital expenditure is considered to be committed when the project has received the appropriate level of internal management approval. For joint operations \u00ab , the net bp share is included in the amounts above.\n\nIn addition, at 31 December 2022, the group had committed to capital expenditure relating to investments in equity-accounted entities amounting to $3,535 million.

        "page_content": "## Oil and gas disclosures for the group\n\n## Analysis by region\n\nOur oil and gas operations are set out below by geographical area, with associated significant events for 2022. bp's percentage working interest in oil and gas assets is shown in brackets. Working interest is the cost-bearing ownership share of an oil or gas lease. Consequently, the percentages disclosed for certain agreements do not necessarily reflect the percentage interests in proved reserves, production or revenue.\n\nIn addition to exploration, development and production activities, our oil production & operations (OP&O) and gas businesses also include certain midstream and liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply activities. Midstream activities involve the management of crude oil and natural gas pipelines, processing facilities and export terminals, LNG processing facilities and transportation, and our natural gas liquids (NGLs) processing business.\n\nOur upstream LNG activities are located in Abu Dhabi, Angola, Australia, Indonesia, Mauritania, Senegal and Trinidad. In 2022 our production was 9 million tonnes of LNG from these assets, of which 2 million tonnes were marketed through trading & shipping, which supplements equity production with merchant third party volumes to build a global trading portfolio. The LNG is marketed through contractual rights to access import terminal capacity into the liquid gas markets of Europe, UK and US, and relationships to market directly to end user customers or trading entities. LNG is supplied to all major LNG demand centres, including Argentina, Brazil, Caribbean, China, Croatia, Mediterranean, Iberian Peninsula and North West Europe, India, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Lithuania, Mexico, Poland, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, T\u00fcrkiye and the UK.\n\n## Europe\n\nbp is active in the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea. In 2022 bp's production came from three key areas: the Shetland area comprising the Clair and Schiehallion fields; the central area comprising the Andrew area, Culzean, Vorlich and ETAP fields; and Norway, through our equity accounted 15.9% interest in Aker BP.\n\n- \u00b7 Following completion of the acquisition of RockRose Energy's 28% interest in East Foinaven and the removal of the Foinaven FPSO in the third quarter of 2022, bp continues to evaluate options for the Foinaven field.\n- \u00b7 On 30 June Aker BP completed the acquisition of Lundin Energy's exploration and production business announced in December 2021. The combined entity, in which bp now owns a 15.9% stake, is the secondlargest operating company on the Norwegian continental shelf.\n\n## North America\n\nOur oil and gas activities in North America are located in four areas: deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Lower 48 states, Canada and Mexico.\n\nbp has around 260 lease blocks in the Gulf of Mexico and operates four production hubs.\n\n- \u00b7 During the year, the hook-up and commissioning of the Mad Dog 2 (bp 60.5% and operator) Argos platform continued. As a result of an issue that was found with the subsea production flexible joints start-up was delayed. bp now expects Mad Dog 2 to commence production in the second quarter of 2023.\n- \u00b7 Following the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, 45 of the 46 leases on which bp was the apparent high bidder in the Gulf of Mexico Lease Sale 257 that took place in November 2021 were awarded to bp.\n\nSee also Financial Statements - Note 1 for further information on exploration leases.\n\nbpx energy, bp's onshore oil and gas business in the Lower 48 states, has significant operated and non-operated activities across Louisiana and Texas producing natural gas, oil, NGLs and condensate, with primary focus on developing unconventional resources. It had a 1.6 billion boe proved reserve base at 31 December 2022, predominantly in unconventional reservoirs (tight gas \u00ab , shale gas and shale oil). bpx energy's core assets span 0.9 million net developed acres with nearly 2000 operated gross wells at 31 December 2022. Daily net production averaged 325mboe/d in 2022.\n\nbpx energy continues to operate as a separate business while remaining part of the OP&O segment. With its own governance, systems and\n\nprocesses, it is structured to increase competitive performance through swift decision making and innovation, while maintaining bp's commitment to safe, reliable and compliant operations.\n\nbp's onshore US crude oil and product pipelines and related transportation assets were included in the customers & products segment in 2022.\n\n- \u00b7 In December bpx energy executed an acreage trade in the Permian Basin with Oxy and ConocoPhillips covering approximately 8,000 acres. The trade will facilitate a material increase in long lateral wells and their associated lower development and operating costs.\n\nIn Canada bp is focused on pursuing offshore exploration opportunities. We hold offshore exploration licences and significant discovery licences offshore Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\n- \u00b7 In 2022, bp sold its interest in the Pike oil sands leases, Kirby and Leismer leases and the Sunrise oil sands project in Alberta. bp also acquired Cenovus's 35% interest in the Bay du Nord assets in offshore Newfoundland Labrador.\n- \u00b7 The order issued by the government of Canada in 2019 prohibiting any work or activity authorized under the Canada Oil and Gas Operations Act on frontier lands that are situated in Canadian Arctic offshore waters has been extended until 31 December 2023.\n\nIn Mexico, bp held interests in two exploration blocks in the Salina Basin with Equinor and Total, Block 1 (bp 33%) and Block 3 (bp 33%), and one exploration block in the Sureste Basin, Block 34 (bp 42.5% and operator), with Total, QPI Mexico and Hokchi Energy. The blocks are either expired or in process of relinquishment. Hokchi Energy is a subsidiary of Pan American Energy Group (PAEG, see below) in which bp owns 50%. Separate to the above holdings in Mexico, Hokchi Energy also holds an interest in two other blocks.\n\n- \u00b7 In Block 3, Equinor's relinquishment filed in 2021 on behalf of the JV is still pending regulatory approval.\n\n## South America\n\nbp has oil and gas activities in Argentina, Brazil and Trinidad & Tobago and, through PAEG, in Argentina and Bolivia.\n\nIn Argentina bp and Total are partners on a 50/50 basis in two offshore exploration concessions. Total is the operator.\n\nIn Brazil bp has interests in 10 exploration concessions across three basins.\n\n- \u00b7 In October 2020 bp as the operator of BM-C-35 block issued a relinquishment notice to the regulator, which was approved in January 2022.\n- \u00b7 In June 2021, Petrobras as the operator of BM-POT-16 issued a relinquishment notice to the regulatory authorities, which is still pending approval.\n- \u00b7 In April, the discovery of a new oil accumulation in the Alto de Cabo Frio central block, in the southern portion of the Campos Basin (bp 50%) was announced. In July, bp's partner Petrobras announced a successful drill stem test confirming good productivity from the well.\n- \u00b7 During the year, after completion of seismic studies bp as operator took the decision to relinquish blocks C-M-755, C-M-793 and S-M-1500.\n- \u00b7 In Brazil's first Permanent Production Sharing Offer bid round in December, bp successfully bid on the Bumerangue block, an area of 1,118km 2 located in the Santos Pr\u00e9 Salt Basin. bp will hold 100% interest in the block when the contract is executed in 2023.\n\nPAEG, a joint venture that is owned by bp (50%) and BC E&P Uruguay S.A. (50%), has activities mainly in Argentina and as noted above Mexico, and is also present in Bolivia. During the year bp recognised an impairment charge of $2.9 billion in relation to PAEG as a result of expected portfolio changes.\n\nIn Trinidad & Tobago bp holds interests in exploration and production licences and production-sharing contracts (PSCs) \u00ab covering 1.6 million acres offshore of the east and north-east coast. Facilities include 16 offshore platforms and two onshore processing facilities. Production comprises gas and associated liquids.\n\nbp also holds interests in the Atlantic LNG facility. The total gross capacity of the four LNG trains making up the facility is approximately 15 million tonnes per annum. bp's shareholding averages 40% across the three companies which own the LNG trains comprising the LNG facility.

Agung I covers over 6,000km 2 off the coast of Bali and East Java and Agung II spans almost 8,000km 2 offshore South Sulawesi, West Nusa Tenggara and East Java.\n\nIn Iraq bp held a 47.6% participating interest and was the lead contractor in the technical service contract for the Rumaila oil field in southern Iraq until June 2022.\n\n- \u00b7 During 2021, bp and PetroChina (PC) established Basra Energy Company Limited (BECL) and agreed to contribute their respective interests in the Rumaila technical service contract to BECL. BECL is an incorporated joint venture (IJV) company owned by bp (49%) and PC (51%). Following approval by the Government of Iraq, the transaction completed in June 2022. At completion, BECL was appointed as the new Rumaila lead contractor.\n\n## Russia\n\nOn 27 February 2022, bp announced that it would exit its shareholding in Rosneft and its other businesses with Rosneft within Russia. Those other businesses included its 20% interest in Taas-Yuryakh Neftegazodobycha, its 49% interest in Kharampurneftegaz LLC and its 49% interest in Yermak Neftegaz LLC. See also Financial Statements - Note 1 for further information.\n\n## Australasia\n\nbp has activities in Australia and Eastern Indonesia.\n\nIn Australia bp is one of seven participants in the North West Shelf (NWS) venture, which has been producing LNG, pipeline gas, condensate, LPG and oil since the 1980s. Six partners (including bp) hold an equal 16.67% interest in the gas infrastructure and an equal 15.78% interest in the gas and condensate reserves, with a seventh partner owning the remaining 5.32% of these reserves. bp also had a 16.67% interest in some of the NWS oil reserves and related infrastructure. The NWS venture is one of the largest LNG export projects in the region, with five LNG trains in operation, and supplies domestic gas into the Western Australia market. bp's net share of the capacity of NWS LNG trains 1-5 is 2.8 million tonnes of LNG per year. From March 2022, NWS has enhanced its facilities to allow the import of third party gas into the onshore plant for processing into LNG.\n\nbp is also one of five participants in the Browse LNG venture (operated by Woodside) and holds a 17.33% interest.\n\nbp also has a 50% interest in the WA-541 exploration title in Western Australia's offshore Northern Carnarvon basin. the JV, operated by Santos, is working towards the drilling of two commitment wells.\n\n- \u00b7 In November bp divested its 16.67% interest in the NWS oil reserves and associated infrastructure.\n- \u00b7 The Browse joint venture participants continue to progress the development of Browse by connecting it via a 900km pipeline to the NWS Venture's Karratha Gas Plant. The final investment decision is expected in 2025.\n- \u00b7 In September, a Woodside led joint venture that includes bp (20%) was awarded greenhouse gas permit G-10-AP in the northern Carnarvon basin offshore Western Australia as they pursue a potential CCS project. The permit covers an area of 1,775km 2 including the depleted Angel gas field.\n\nIn Papua Barat, Eastern Indonesia, bp operates the Tangguh LNG plant (bp 40.22%). The asset currently comprises 18 producing wells, two offshore platforms, two pipelines and an LNG plant with two production trains. It has a total capacity of 7.6 million tonnes of LNG per annum. Tangguh supplies LNG to customers in Indonesia, Mexico, China, South Korea, and Japan through a combination of long, medium and short-term contracts.\n\nThe Tangguh expansion project comprises a third LNG processing train, two offshore platforms, 10 new production wells, an expanded LNG loading facility, and supporting infrastructure. The project will add 3.8 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of production capacity to the existing facility, bringing total plant capacity to 11.4mtpa. First LNG production from the project is expected in late 2023.\n\nThe government of Indonesia has recently granted a 20-year extension of the Tangguh PSC. The current contract was due to expire in 2035 and will now last until 2055.",

        "page_content": "## Oil and natural gas\n\n## Resource progression\n\nbp manages its hydrocarbon resources in three major categories: prospect inventory, contingent resources and reserves. When a discovery is made, volumes usually transfer from the prospect inventory to the contingent resources category. The contingent resources move through various subcategories as their technical and commercial maturity increases through appraisal activity.\n\nAt the point of final investment decision, most proved reserves will be categorized as proved undeveloped (PUD). Volumes will subsequently be recategorized from PUD to proved developed (PD) as a consequence of development activity. When part of a well's proved reserves depends on a later phase of activity, only that portion of proved reserves associated with existing, available facilities and infrastructure moves to PD. The first PD bookings will typically occur at the point of first oil or gas production. Major development projects typically take one to five years from the time of initial booking of PUD to the start of production. Changes to proved reserves bookings may be made due to analysis of new or existing data concerning production, reservoir performance, commercial factors and additional reservoir development activity.\n\nVolumes can also be added or removed from our portfolio through acquisition or divestment of properties and projects. When we dispose of an interest in a property or project, the volumes associated with our adopted plan of development for which we have a final investment decision will be removed from our proved reserves upon completion of the transaction. When we acquire an interest in a property or project, the volumes associated with the existing development and any committed projects will be added to our proved reserves if bp has made a final investment decision and they satisfy the SEC's criteria for attribution of proved status. Following the acquisition, additional volumes may be progressed to proved reserves from non-proved reserves or contingent resources.\n\nNon-proved reserves and contingent resources in a field will only be recategorized as proved reserves when all the criteria for attribution of proved status have been met and the volumes are included in the business plan and scheduled for development, typically within five years. bp will only book proved reserves where development is scheduled to commence after more than five years, if these proved reserves satisfy the SEC's criteria for attribution of proved status and bp management has reasonable certainty that these proved reserves will be produced.\n\nAt the end of 2022 bp had material volumes of proved undeveloped reserves held for more than five years in the Gulf of Mexico, Azerbaijan, the North Sea and PAEG. These are part of ongoing infrastructure-led development activities for which bp has a historical track record of completing comparable projects in these countries. We have no proved undeveloped reserves held for more than five years in our onshore US developments.\n\nIn each case the volumes are being progressed as part of an adopted development plan where there are physical limits to the development timing such as infrastructure limitations, contractual limits including gas delivery commitments and the complex nature of working in remote locations, or where there are significant commitments on delivery to the relevant authority.\n\nOver the past five years, bp has annually progressed a weighted average 18% (16% for 2021 five-year average) of our group proved undeveloped reserves (including the impact of disposals and price acceleration effects in PSAs) to proved developed reserves. This equates to a turnover time of five and a half years.\n\nProved reserves as estimated at the end of 2022 meet bp's criteria for project sanctioning and SEC tests for proved reserves. We have not halted or changed our commitment to proceed with any material project to which proved undeveloped reserves have been attributed.\n\nIn 2022 we progressed 554mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves (497mmboe for our subsidiaries \u00ab alone) to proved developed reserves through ongoing investment in our subsidiaries' and equity-accounted entities' development activities. Total development expenditure, excluding midstream activities, was $9,744 million in 2022 ($7,750 million for subsidiaries and $1,994 million for equity-accounted entities). Of the $7,750\n\n## Additional disclosures\n\nmillion of total development expenditure for our subsidiaries, approximately $2,300 million was used for development activity to progress proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed. Of the $1,994 million development expenditure for our equity-accounted entities, approximately $738 million was used for development activity to progress proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed. The major areas with progressed volumes in 2022 were the US, Asia Pacific, Trinidad & Tobago and the Middle East.\n\nRevisions of previous estimates for proved undeveloped reserves are due to changes relating to field performance, well results, revisions to future activity plans (including alignment to our investment criteria and changes to the macro-economic climate) or changes in commercial conditions including price impacts. The net revisions to previous estimates across both our subsidiaries and our equity-accounted entities include net positive revisions driven by field performance and revisions to activity plans, and net negative revisions driven by price and well results. The net revisions to previous estimates across only our subsidiaries include net positive revisions driven by field performance and net negative revisions driven by price, well results and revisions to activity plans. In each case, none of these factors resulted in revisions that were material to the group as a whole. The following tables describe the changes to our proved undeveloped reserves position through the year for our subsidiaries and equity-accounted entities and for our subsidiaries alone.\n\n|

In certain cases bp uses numerical simulation as part of a holistic assessment of recovery factor for its fields, where these simulations have been field tested and have been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. In certain deepwater fields bp has booked proved reserves before production flow tests are conducted, in part because of the significant safety, cost and environmental implications of conducting these tests. The industry has made substantial technological improvements in understanding, measuring and delineating reservoir properties without the need for flow tests. To determine reasonable certainty of commercial recovery, bp employs a general method of reserves assessment that relies on the integration of three types of data:\n\n- \u00b7 well data used to assess the local characteristics and conditions of reservoirs and fluids\n- \u00b7 field scale seismic data to allow the interpolation and extrapolation of these characteristics outside the immediate area of the local well control\n- \u00b7 data from relevant analogous fields.\n\nWell data includes appraisal wells or sidetrack holes, full logging suites, core data and fluid samples. bp considers the integration of this data in certain cases to be superior to a flow test in providing understanding of overall reservoir performance. The collection of data from logs, cores, wireline formation testers, pressures and fluid samples calibrated to each other and to the seismic data can allow reservoir properties to be determined over a greater volume than the localized volume of investigation associated with a short-term flow test. There is a strong track record of proved reserves recorded using these methods, validated by actual production levels.\n\n## Governance\n\nbp's centrally controlled process for proved reserves estimation approval forms part of a holistic and integrated system of internal control. It consists of the following elements:\n\n- \u00b7 Accountabilities of certain officers of the group to ensure that there is review and approval of proved reserves bookings independent of the operating business and that there are effective controls in the approval process and verification that the proved reserves estimates and the related financial impacts are reported in a timely manner.\n- \u00b7 Capital allocation processes, whereby delegated authority is exercised to commit to capital projects that are consistent with the delivery of the group's business plan. A formal review process exists to ensure that both technical and commercial criteria are met prior to the commitment of capital to projects.\n- \u00b7 Internal audit, whose role is to consider whether the group's system of internal control is adequately designed and operating effectively to respond appropriately to the risks that are significant to bp.\n- \u00b7 Approval hierarchy, whereby proved reserves changes above certain threshold volumes require immediate review and all proved reserves require annual central authorization and have scheduled periodic reviews. The frequency of periodic review ensures that 100% of the bp proved reserves base undergoes central review every three years.\n\nbp's vice president of reserves is the individual primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserves estimate. He has more than 29 years of diversified industry experience in reserves estimation with the past four years managing the governance and compliance. He is a past Chairman of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (Russia & Caspian) and a member of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe Expert Group on Resource Management.\n\nNo specific portion of compensation bonuses for senior management is directly related to proved reserves targets. Additions to proved reserves is one of several indicators by which the performance of the gas & low carbon and oil production & operations segments is assessed by the remuneration committee for the purposes of determining compensation bonuses for the executive directors. Other indicators include a number of financial and operational measures.\n\nbp's variable pay programme for the other senior managers in the gas & low carbon and oil production & operations segments is based on individual\n\nperformance contracts. Individual performance contracts are based on agreed items from the business performance plan, one of which, if chosen, could relate to proved reserves.\n\n## Compliance\n\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) do not provide specific guidance on reserves disclosures. bp estimates proved reserves in accordance with SEC Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X and relevant Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations (C&DI) and Staff Accounting Bulletins as issued by the SEC staff.\n\nBy their nature, there is always risk involved in the ultimate development and production of proved reserves including, but not limited to: final regulatory approval; the installation of new or additional infrastructure, as well as changes in oil and gas prices; changes in operating and development costs; and the continued availability of additional development capital. All the group's proved reserves held in subsidiaries and equity-accounted entities are estimated by the group's petroleum engineers or by independent petroleum engineering consulting firms and then assured by the group's petroleum engineers.\n\nNetherland, Sewell & Associates (NSAI), an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm, has estimated the net proved crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas reserves, as of 31 December 2022, of certain properties owned by bp in the US Lower 48. The properties evaluated by NSAI account for 100% of bp's net proved reserves in the US Lower 48 as of 31 December 2022. The net proved reserves estimates prepared by NSAI were prepared in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rule 4-10(a)(1)-(32) of Regulation S-X. All reserves estimates involve some degree of uncertainty. bp has filed NSAI's independent report on its reserves estimates as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC.\n\nOur proved reserves are associated with both concessions (tax and royalty arrangements) and agreements where the group is exposed to the upstream risks and rewards of ownership, but where our entitlement to the hydrocarbons is calculated using a more complex formula, such as with PSAs. In a concession, the consortium of which we are a part is entitled to the proved reserves that can be produced over the licence period, which may be the life of the field. In a PSA, we are entitled to recover volumes that equate to costs incurred to develop and produce the proved reserves and an agreed share of the remaining volumes or the economic equivalent. As part of our entitlement is driven by the monetary amount of costs to be recovered, price fluctuations will have an impact on both production volumes and reserves.\n\nWe disclose our share of proved reserves held in equity-accounted entities (joint ventures \u00ab and associates \u00ab ), although we do not control these entities or the assets held by such entities. The 2022 disclosures do not include bp's share of proved reserves held by Rosneft and bp's Russia joint ventures. bp announced on 27 February 2022 that it intends to exit its shareholding in Rosneft and its other businesses with Rosneft within Russia including these Russian joint ventures.",

Natural gas decreased by 53% (13% decrease for subsidiaries and 89% decrease for equity-accounted entities). This includes a 9,013mmboe reduction in our equity-accounted entities resulting from our decision to exit our Russia joint ventures and our shareholding in Rosneft.\n\nExcluding the impact of our exit from Russia, there was a net decrease from acquisitions and disposals of 84mmboe (decrease of 434mmboe within our subsidiaries and increase of 350mmboe within our equityaccounted entities). Acquisition and divestment activity occurred in our equity-accounted entities in the Southern Cone and the North Sea, and divestment activity in our subsidiaries in Canada, the US and the North Sea. The creation of Azule Energy in Angola resulted in divestment of subsidiary entities and purchase of equity-accounted entities.\n\nThe proved reserves replacement ratio \u00ab is the extent to which production is replaced by proved reserves additions. This ratio is expressed in oil equivalent terms and includes changes resulting from revisions to previous estimates, improved recovery, and extensions and discoveries. For 2022, the proved reserves replacement ratio excluding acquisitions and disposals was 20% (50% in 2021 and 78% in 2020) for subsidiaries and equityaccounted entities, 13% for subsidiaries alone and 52% for equityaccounted entities alone. There was a net decrease (196mmboe) of reserves due to higher gas and oil prices impacting some of our PSAs in Azerbaijan and the Middle East, partially offset by increases in the US and the North Sea.\n\nIn 2022 net additions to the group's proved reserves (excluding production, sales and purchases of reserves-in-place) amounted to 180mmboe (94mmboe for subsidiaries and 86mmboe for equity-accounted entities), through revisions to previous estimates including price, improved recovery from, and extensions to, existing fields and discoveries of new fields. The majority of subsidiary additions were through improved recovery from, and extensions to, existing fields and discoveries of new fields where they represented a mixture of proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves. The principal proved reserves additions in our subsidiaries by region were in the US, North Africa and the Middle East. The principal reserves additions in our equity-accounted entities were in Angola and PAEG.\n\n26% of our proved reserves are associated with PSAs. The countries in which we produced under PSAs in 2022 were Algeria, Angola, Azerbaijan, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico and Oman. In addition, the technical service contract (TSC) \u00ab governing our investment in the Rumaila field in Iraq functions as a PSA.\n\nThe group holds no licences in our PSAs or TSCs due to expire within the next three years that would have a significant impact on bp's reserves or production, including undeveloped acreage.\n\nFor further information on our reserves see page 270.",

Instead, it forms part of a larger transaction that includes, for example, normal operations and maintenance expenditure. The figures for environmental operating and capital expenditure in the table are therefore estimates, based on the definitions and guidelines of the American Petroleum Institute.\n\nEnvironmental operating expenditure of $416 million in 2022 (2021 $362 million) showed an overall increase of 15%, largely due to increased expenditure in BP Products North America and BP Rotterdam.\n\nEnvironmental capital expenditure of $224 million in 2022 was broadly the same prior year (2021 $222 million) with increased expenditure for BP Products North America and decreased expenditure for BP Energia Espana who had two projects completing in early 2022.\n\nClean-up costs were $16 million in 2022 (2021 $17 million), representing oil spill clean-up costs and other associated remediation and disposal costs.\n\nIn addition to operating and capital expenditure, we also establish provisions for future environmental remediation work. Expenditure against such provisions normally occurs in subsequent periods and is not included in environmental operating expenditure reported for such periods.\n\nProvisions for environmental remediation are made when a clean-up is probable and the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated. Generally, this coincides with the commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or on closure of inactive sites.\n\nThe extent and cost of future environmental restoration, remediation and abatement programmes are inherently difficult to estimate. They often depend on the extent of contamination, and the associated impact and timing of the corrective actions required, technological feasibility and bp's share of liability. Though the costs of future programmes could be significant and may be material to the results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, it is not expected that such costs will be material to the group's overall results of operations or financial position.\n\nAdditions to our environmental remediation provision reflect new liabilities and scope/cost reassessments of the remediation plans of a number of our sites in the US and Europe. The charge for environmental remediation provisions in 2022 arising from new sites was $67 million  (2021 $33 million and 2020 $8 million).\n\nIn addition, we make provisions on installation of our oil and gas producing assets and related pipelines to meet the cost of eventual decommissioning. On installation of an oil or natural gas production facility, a provision is established that represents the discounted value of the expected future cost of decommissioning the asset.\n\nIn 2022, the net increase in the decommissioning provision was primarily due to recognition of additional provisions and changes in cost estimate assumptions.\n\nWe undertake periodic reviews of existing provisions. These reviews take account of revised cost assumptions, changes in decommissioning requirements and any technological developments.\n\nProvisions for environmental remediation and decommissioning are usually established on a discounted basis, as required by IAS 37 'Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets'.\n\nFurther details of decommissioning and environmental provisions appear in Financial statements - Note 23.\n\n## Regulation of the group's business\n\nOur businesses and operations are subject to the laws and regulations applicable in each country, state or other regional or local area in which they occur. These cover virtually all aspects of bp's activities and include matters such as the acquisition of rights to develop and operate projects, production rates, royalties, environmental, health and safety protection, fuel specifications and transportation, trading, pricing, anti-trust, export, taxes, and foreign exchange.\n\n## Oil and gas contractual and regulatory framework\n\nThe terms and conditions of the leases, licences and contracts under which our upstream oil and gas interests are held vary from country to country. These leases, licences and contracts are generally granted by or entered into with a government entity or state-owned or controlled company and are sometimes entered into with private property owners. Arrangements with governmental or state entities usually take the form of licences or production-sharing agreements \u00ab (PSAs), although arrangements with private entities and the US government entities are usually by lease.\n\nLicences (or concessions) give the holder the right to explore for, develop and produce a commercial discovery. Under a licence, the holder bears the risk of exploration, development and production activities and provides the financing for these operations. In principle, the licence holder is entitled to all production, minus any royalties that are payable in kind. A licence holder is generally required to pay production taxes or royalties, which may be in cash or in kind.\n\nIn certain countries, separate licences are required for exploration and production activities, and in some cases production licences are limited to only a portion of the area covered by the original exploration licence.\n\nPSAs entered into with a government entity or state-owned or -controlled company generally require bp (alone or with other contracting companies) to provide all the financing and bear the risk of exploration and production activities in exchange for a share of the production remaining after royalties, if any. Less typically, bp may explore for, develop and produce hydrocarbons under a service agreement with the host entity in exchange for reimbursement of costs and/or a fee paid in cash rather than production.\n\nbp frequently conducts its exploration and production activities in joint arrangements or co-ownership arrangements with other international oil companies, state-owned or -controlled companies and/or private companies. Conventionally, all costs, benefits, rights, obligations, liabilities and risks incurred in carrying out joint arrangement or co-ownership operations under a lease, licence or PSA are shared among the joint arrangement or co-owning parties according to agreed ownership interests which are set out in a joint operating agreement. To the extent that any liabilities arise, whether to governments or third parties, or as between the joint arrangement parties or co-owners themselves, each joint arrangement party or co-owner will generally be liable under the terms of a joint operating agreement to meet these in proportion to its ownership interest. Any agreed allocation of liability amongst the joint arrangement parties is, however, often different to the position under the relevant licence, lease or PSA which may provide for joint and several liability of the joint arrangement parties including for decommissioning obligations. In many upstream operations, a party (known as the operator) will be appointed (pursuant to a joint operating agreement) to carry out day to-day operations on behalf of the joint arrangement or co-ownership. The operator is typically one of the joint arrangement parties or a co-owner and will carry out its duties either through its own staff, or by contracting out various elements to third-party contractors or service providers. bp acts as operator on behalf of joint arrangements and co-ownerships in a number of countries.\n\nFrequently, work (including drilling and related activities) will be contracted out to third-party service providers. The relevant contract will specify the work, the remuneration, and typically the risk allocation between the parties. Depending on the service to be provided, the contract may also contain provisions allocating risks and liabilities associated with pollution and environmental damage, damage to a well or hydrocarbon reservoirs and for",

        "page_content": "claims from third parties or other losses. The allocation of those risks varies among contracts and is determined through negotiation between the parties.\n\nIn general, bp incurs income tax on income generated from production activities (whether under a licence or PSA). In addition, depending on the area, bp's production activities may be subject to a range of other taxes, levies and assessments, including special petroleum taxes and revenue taxes. The taxes imposed on oil and gas production profits and activities may be substantially higher than those imposed on other activities, for example in Abu Dhabi, Angola, Egypt, Norway, the UK, the US and Trinidad & Tobago.\n\nIn May 2022 the UK Government introduced a new temporary 25% levy on profits from oil and gas extraction in the North Sea. In November 2022 the UK Government announced that the energy profits levy would increase to 35% with effect from 1 January 2023 and remain in place until 31 March 2028.\n\nbp is closely studying the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's two pillar solution to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy. The Pillar Two model rules were published on 20 December 2021. Draft UK legislation to implement the model rules was published in July 2022 and final legislation is expected to be substantively enacted during 2023. The tax accounting impact will be considered when the relevant legislation is in place.\n\n## Low carbon energy - renewables contractual and regulatory framework\n\nThe majority of our renewable assets are held indirectly through interests in incorporated joint ventures or special purpose entities (in either case, a Project Company). The renewables contractual and regulatory framework and the rights granted in relation to a renewable asset significantly vary from country to country. In some countries, the regulatory framework is still under development or subject to significant change as the renewables industry evolves.\n\nIn general terms the rights to a renewable asset are usually held by a Project Company through a package of assets that together form the renewable project owned by such Project Company, including:\n\n- \u00b7 one or more leases, easements, or licences over land or seabed granted by a public or private individual or entity that grant the Project Company rights to develop, build and operate the renewable asset in such areas of land or seabed;\n- \u00b7 one or more generation licences that grant the Project Company the right to produce and sell the electricity to the market;\n- \u00b7 an interconnection agreement that grants the Project Company the right to connect the power project into the grid;\n- \u00b7 an offtake agreement which, depending on the country's electricity market, is entered into with a utility company, a corporate buyer or a public entity; and\n- \u00b7 potentially, a subsidy mechanism in the form of a feed in tariff, contract for difference, hedging mechanism or renewable energy certificate to support the development of the project.\n\nThe risk allocation between the developer/generator and the host government or private entity has not been standardized in the industry. However, in general terms the Project Company bears the risk of the development, construction and operation of the renewable energy project and secures the financing for these operations and receives any profit from the revenue generated through the offtake agreement and/or subsidy mechanism (if available).\n\n## US Inflation Reduction Act\n\nThe US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was signed into law in August 2022, includes a significant package of largely supply-side measures supporting low carbon energy sources and decarbonization technologies in the US. The impact of the IRA both on bp's businesses and more widely on the US economy is likely to depend on various factors which are currently uncertain, including the implementation of the incentives by the US authorities as well as regulatory reform at a state and federal level .\n\n## Greenhouse gas regulation\n\nIn December 2015, nearly 200 nations at the United Nations climate change conference in Paris (COP21) agreed to the Paris Agreement which aims to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Signatories aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as soon as possible and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter, so as to achieve a balance between human caused emissions and removals by sinks of GHGs in the second half of this century. The Paris Agreement commits all signatories to submit Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) (i.e. pledges or plans of climate action) and pursue domestic measures aimed at achieving the objectives of their NDCs. Signatories are required to submit revised NDCs every five years, and the revised NDCs are expected to be more ambitious with each revision. Global assessments of progress will occur every five years, starting in 2023.\n\nAgreement of rules which could enable international carbon trading to assist in meeting NDCs was adopted at the UNFCCC COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland in November 2021.\n\nMore stringent national and regional measures relating to the transition to a lower carbon economy, such as the UK's 2050 net zero carbon emissions commitment, can be expected in the future. These measures could increase bp's production costs for certain products, increase compliance and litigation costs, increase demand for competing energy alternatives or products with lower-carbon intensity, and affect the sales and specifications of many of bp's products. Further, such measures could lead to constraints on production and supply and access to new reserves, particularly due to the long-term nature of many of bp's projects.\n\nCertain current and announced GHG measures and developments potentially affecting bp's businesses in various markets in which bp operates are summarized below. For information on steps that bp is taking in relation to climate change issues and for details of bp's GHG reporting, see Sustainability - Net zero aims on page 45.\n\n## United States\n\nIn the US, bp's operations are affected by GHG regulation in a number of ways.\n\nThe federal Clean Air Act (CAA) regulates air emissions, permitting, fuel specifications and other aspects of our production, refining, distribution and marketing activities.\n\nUnder the current administration of US President Joseph Biden, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued proposed 'Standards of Performance for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources and Emissions Guidelines for Existing Sources: Oil and Natural Gas Sector Climate Review' which were open to public comment until early 2023. If finalized in form substantially similar to the proposal, these regulations would require significant reductions in methane emissions from oil and gas production at new and existing facilities.\n\nOther EPA GHG and environmental regulations affect electricity generation practices and prices and have an impact on the market for fuels used to generate electricity and on renewable energy installations. These regulations are in flux due to changes in approach between presidential administrations, as well as lawsuits challenging those regulations.\n\nIn June 2022, the Supreme Court decision in West Virginia v. EPA limited EPA's regulatory authority to require electricity 'generation shifting' (e.g., from coal to natural gas or renewable sources).\n\nThe Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 impose the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), requiring transportation fuel sold in the United States to contain a minimum volume of renewable fuels. In July 2022, EPA issued a final rule in which it modified certain volume targets and requirements, established the 2020, 2021, and 2022 renewable fuel percentage standards for all biofuels, and made other RFS program changes.  In December 2022, EPA announced a proposed rule to establish required RFS volumes and percentage standards for 2023, 2024, and 2025, as well as to make modifications designed to enhance the RFS program. EPA took public comments on this proposed rule until 10 February 2023. In addition, certain state initiatives impose carbon-intensity",

        "page_content": "reduction requirements on transportation fuels sold in those states (e.g., in California, Oregon and Washington).\n\nThe federal GHG Mandatory Reporting Rule requires operators of certain facilities and producers and importers/exporters of petroleum products to file annual GHG emissions reports with EPA quantifying direct emissions from affected facilities, as well as volumes of petroleum products, certain natural gas liquids and GHG products and notional GHG emissions as if these products were fully combusted.\n\nA number of states, municipalities and regional organizations continue to advance climate initiatives that affect our US operations. For example, California extended its Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) to 2030 with a 20% reduction in carbon intensity required by that time. The State of Washington enacted state-wide carbon cap and invest legislation and a Clean Fuel Program (similar t o California's LCFS) in 2021. In 2022, the State of Washington finalized rules implementing both of those programs.\n\nIn November 2022, the Department of Defense, General Services Administration, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration in their capacity as the Federal Acquisition Regulation Council proposed a new rule that would require major contractors (those with contractual obligations to the federal government of more than $50 millionillion) to disclose scopes 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions and climate-related financial risks and set sciencebased emissions reduction targets. The details of any final rule are not certain but could potentially impact bp as T&S does hold and enter into contracts with the US federal government.\n\nOur US businesses are subject to increased GHG and other environmental requirements and regulatory uncertainty, including that the current or any future US administration could revise or revoke current or prior administration programs, as well as the possibility of increased expenditures in having to comply with numerous diverse and non-uniform regulatory initiatives at the state and local level.\n\nUS fuel markets are affected by EPA regulation of light, medium and heavyduty vehicle emissions (both fuel economy and tailpipe standards) as well as for non-road engines and vehicles and certain large GHG stationary emission sources. California also imposes Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) and Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) standards on vehicle manufacturers, and a number of other states, as allowed by CAA authority, have adopted California's standards. These regulations may impact bp's product mix and demand for particular products in those states. In August 2020, California also entered into agreements with several carmakers to meet more demanding emissions standards in California.\n\nIn December 2021, the Biden administration revised the fuel economy and tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions standards for passenger cars and light trucks covering model years (MY) 2023 through 2026. The revised standards are more stringent through MY 2026 than the August 2020 agreements California reached with several carmakers. EPA has also restored California's Clean Air Act waiver allowing it to set its own GHG automotive tailpipe standards and for other states to adopt those standards.\n\nIn December 2022, EPA promulgated regulations establishing new emission standards for oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and other pollutants for highway heavy-duty engines. California has also adopted a 'Heavy-Duty Low NOx Omnibus Regulation' which will require manufacturers to comply with stricter emissions standards and a number of other states have opted or are planning to opt into those California standards. The rule is being phased in, with the first phase effective in 2024. bp continues to monitor these rules for implications for fuels. These and other EPA initiatives to reduce GHG emissions may have a significant effect on the production, sale and profitability of many of bp's products in the US .\n\n## European Union\n\n- \u00b7 The EU and its member states have adopted various targets and measures seeking to reduce GHG emissions and promote renewables. These include the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS); the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) - including an obligation on transport fuel suppliers to increase the share of renewables of their fuel supply; and CO2 targets for the sales of new vehicles which are expected to accelerate the decarbonisation of the transport sector and impact fuel demand.\n\n\u00ab\n\n## Additional disclosures\n\n- \u00b7 The EU has adopted a goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2050 as part of the European Green Deal and, subsequently, a 55% GHG reduction target by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. To achieve this target, the European Commission proposed a set of measures in 2021 as part of the so-called 'Fit for 55' and 'gas decarbonisation' packages. Once fully adopted and implemented, this would lead to increased ambition levels across various EU legislative instruments and initiatives, including higher shares of renewables across all sectors, a reduced number of GHG emission allowances under the EU ETS, and a target of zero gramme of CO2 per km for new passenger cars by 2035. New measures would be expected to increase the supply and demand of renewable fuel and energy, extend emissions trading to the maritime sector and emissions from road transport and heating fuels. The European Commission also proposed measures to reduce methane emissions.\n- \u00b7 Detailed implementation rules set at EU level, such as Delegated Acts, are currently being adopted or revised. Whilst detailed in nature, such rules can often influence the commercial prospects of existing and future projects either to help meet bp's own compliance obligations (e.g. supply of renewable fuels under RED) or supplying renewable and low carbon products that help others meet their compliance obligation. Such rules relate, for example, to defining when hydrogen is deemed 'renewable' or which biofuel feedstocks are eligible to meet RED targets.\n- \u00b7 Some EU member states have adopted national targets above and beyond current EU climate goals, such as Germany, with a climate neutrality target by 2045 and a national emissions trading system for transport and heating fuels .\n\n## United Kingdom\n\n- \u00b7 In April 2021, the UK Government announced a target of a 78% reduction in emissions by 2035 compared to 1990 levels.\n- \u00b7 The UK Emissions Trading System (UK ETS) launched on 1 January 2021 following the end of the Brexit transition period and the UK's participation in the EU ETS. It seeks to provide a carbon pricing mechanism as a tool for helping achieve the UK's net zero target and covers the same GHGs and sectors as the EU ETS. bp's North Sea operations are subject to the UK ETS.\n- \u00b7 From March to June 2022 the UK Government held a consultation on proposed changes to the rules for sectors currently covered by the UK ETS, such as upstream oil and gas, to ensure more GHG emissions are covered, and expansion of the UK ETS to cover new sectors such as the domestic maritime sector and energy-from-waste. The UK Government has not yet published a full response to the consultation .\n\n## Other countries and regions\n\n- \u00b7 China is operating emission trading pilot programmes in a number of cities and provinces. One of bp's subsidiaries in China is participating in these programmes. In February 2021 China introduced a national emissions trading market (National ETS). The National ETS is intended to be an essential tool for China to fulfil its commitment to reach peak emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. For now, the National ETS participants are limited to the key emission entities identified by each provincial-level government authority and approved by Ministry for Ecology and Environment of China. bp is not participating in the National ETS.\n- \u00b7 In October 2021, as part of its '1+N' climate policy framework, China issued working guidance setting out specific targets and measures for achieving peak carbon emissions and carbon neutrality, and an action plan which sets out the main objectives for the next decade to achieve peak carbon emissions by 2030. The working guidance is the '1' (i.e. a long-term approach to combating climate change), while 'N' are various policies starting with the action plan. In June 2022, 17 government authorities jointly released the National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy 2035 making overall plans to prepare the country to adapt to climate change from the present to 2035.\n\n## Other environmental regulation\n\nIn addition to GHG regulations referred to above, climate change programmes and regulation of unconventional oil and gas extraction under a number of environmental laws may have a significant effect on the production, sale and profitability of many of bp's products.",

        "page_content": "Environmental laws also require bp to remediate and restore areas affected by the release of hazardous substances or hydrocarbons associated with our operations or properties. These laws may apply to sites that bp currently owns or operates, sites that it previously owned or operated, or sites used for the disposal of its and other parties' waste. See Financial Statements - Note 23 for information on provisions for environmental restoration and remediation.\n\nA number of pending or anticipated governmental proceedings against certain bp group companies under environmental laws could result in monetary or other sanctions. Group companies are also subject to environmental claims for personal injury and property damage alleging the release of, or exposure to, hazardous substances. The costs associated with future environmental remediation obligations, governmental proceedings and claims could be significant and may be material to the results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. We cannot accurately predict the effects of future developments, such as stricter environmental laws and regulations or enforcement policies, or future events at our facilities on the group, and there can be no assurance that material liabilities and costs will not be incurred in the future. For a discussion of the group's environmental expenditure, see page 369 and for a discussion of legal proceedings, see page 257.\n\nSignificant health, safety and environmental legislation and regulation affecting our businesses and profitability, in addition to those referred to above, include the following:\n\n## United States\n\n- \u00b7 The Clean Water Act regulates wastewater and other effluent discharges from bp's facilities, and bp is required to obtain discharge permits, install control equipment and implement operational controls and preventative measures.\n- \u00b7 The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act regulates the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of wastes associated with our operations and can require corrective action at locations where such wastes have been disposed of or released. bp has incurred, or is likely to incur, liability under RCRA or similar state laws in connection with sites bp operates or previously operated.\n- \u00b7 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) can, in certain circumstances, impose the entire cost of investigation and remediation on a party who owned or operated a site contaminated with a hazardous substance, or who arranged for disposal of a hazardous substance at a site. bp has incurred, or is likely to incur, liability under CERCLA or similar state laws, including costs attributed to insolvent or unidentified parties. bp is also subject to claims for remediation costs and natural resource damages under CERCLA and other federal and state laws.\n- \u00b7 The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act requires reporting on the storage, use and releases of certain quantities of listed hazardous substances to designated government agencies.\n- \u00b7 The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) regulates bp's manufacture, import, export, sale and use of chemical substances and products. In addition, EPA has revised processes and procedures for prioritisation of existing chemicals for risk evaluation, assessment and management. Agency actions and announcements are monitored regularly to identify developments with potential impacts on chemical substances important to bp products and operations.\n- \u00b7 The Occupational Safety and Health Act imposes workplace safety and health requirements on bp operations along with significant process safety management obligations, requiring continuous evaluation and improvement of operational practices to enhance safety and reduce workplace emissions at gas processing, refining and other regulated facilities.\n- \u00b7 The Oil Pollution Act 1990 (OPA) imposes operational requirements, liability standards and other obligations governing the transportation of petroleum products in US waters. States may impose additional obligations. Alaska and the West Coast states have more demanding state requirements.\n- \u00b7 The Outer Continental Shelf Land Act, the Mineral Leasing Act and other statutes give the Department of Interior (DOI) and the BLM authority to regulate operations and air emissions, including equipment and testing,\n\n- on offshore and onshore operations on federal lands subject to DOI authority.\n- \u00b7 The Endangered Species Act (ESA) and Marine Mammal Protection Act protect certain species' habitats from adverse human impacts by restricting operations or development at certain times and in certain places. In 2020, the US Fish and Wildlife Service published regulatory definitions impacting habitat designations under the ESA, but in June 2022, the Biden administration rescinded those definitions.  The Biden administration rescission of those definitions could expand the geographic areas subject to habitat protections .\n\n## European Union\n\n- \u00b7 The Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) 2010 provides the framework for granting permits for major industrial sites. It lays down rules on integrated prevention and control of air, water and soil pollution arising from industrial activities. As part of the IED framework, additional emission limit values are informed by sector specific and cross-sector Best Available Technique (BAT) Reference Documents and BAT Conclusions. These include the BAT Conclusions for the refining sector, for large combustion plants as well as common wastewater and waste gas treatment and management systems in the chemical sector. In addition, a revision of the IED was proposed by the European Commission in 2022. Once adopted and implemented, this could potentially expand the scope of the IED to activities and substances that are currently not regulated by the IED, set more stringent permitting requirements, and lead to a further tightening of emission limit values. As a result, permits issued by Competent Authorities under the current and future IED framework might require bp to further reduce its emissions, particularly its air and water emissions, as well as to review and update its permits with the competent authorities.\n- \u00b7 The EU Registration, Evaluation Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation 2006 requires registration of chemical substances manufactured in or imported into the EU, together with the submission of relevant hazard and risk data. REACH affects our manufacturing or trading/import operations in the EU. bp maintains compliance by checking whether imports are covered by the registrations of non-EU suppliers' representatives, preparing and submitting registration dossiers to cover new manufactured and imported substances, and updating previously submitted registrations as required. Some substances registered previously, including substances supplied to us by third parties for our use, are now subject to evaluation and review for potential authorization or restriction procedures, and possible banning, by the European Chemicals Agency and EU member state authorities. In addition, bp's facilities and operations in several EU countries continue to undergo REACH compliance inspections by the competent authority for the respective EU member state. An amendment to the Annex of the Regulation on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixture (CLP Regulation) requires harmonized notification of information on hazardous materials (certain lubricant and fuel formations) to EU member state poison centres. The uniform notification rules applied as of January 2020 for consumer products, from 2021 for professional and will apply from 2024 for industrial uses.\n- \u00b7 The EU Offshore Safety Directive was adopted in 2013. Its purpose is to introduce a harmonized regime aimed at reducing the potential environmental, health and safety impacts of the offshore oil and gas industry throughout EU waters.\n- \u00b7 The Water Framework Directive (WFD) published in 2000 aims to protect the quantity and quality of ground and surface waters of the EU member states. The implementation in the EU member states is still ongoing, planned to be finalised by 2027. Future proceedings on the determination of pollutants/priority substances as well as environmental quality standards in line with the WFD may require additional compliance efforts and increased costs for managing freshwater withdrawals and discharges from bp's EU operations .\n- \u00b7 The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) entered into force on 5 January 2023 introducing new requirements for companies with securities listed on an EU regulated market or which exceed a threshold for turnover derived in the EU, to include disclosures related to climate, the environment and wider sustainability issues. The CSRD also expands to in-scope entities the requirements introduced by the EU Taxonomy Regulation, to identify environmentally sustainable activities and then disclose metrics related to capital and operating expenditure",

UK REACH contains equivalent requirements to EU REACH, although future developments and potential divergences are uncertain.\n- \u00b7 The Environment Act 2021 comprises various key parts including governance, waste and resource efficiency, air quality and environmental recall, water, nature and biodiversity and conservation covenants. The governance parts include a comprehensive framework for legally-binding environmental improvement targets; establish a framework for future policy statements on environmental principles to protect the environment by making environmental considerations a key part of policy development process across government; and establish the Office for Environmental Protection, an independent public body to have oversight of environmental matters.  The UK Government's  first suite of environmental targets became law in January 2023 but these are not expected to have a material impact on bp.\n- \u00b7 In September 2022 the UK Government introduced draft legislation which would make significant changes to the status and operation of retained EU law (the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill). A wide range of legislation could potentially be affected, including legislation relating to environmental matters. Government departments are currently conducting legislative reviews, with a view to determining which particular retained EU laws should be preserved or amended.  The legislative reviews are due to be completed by 31 December 2023 .\n\n## Other countries and regions\n\nRegulations governing the discharge of treated water have also been developed in countries outside of the US and EU. This includes regulations in Trinidad and Angola which impacts bp's production operations in those countries. In Trinidad, bp commissioned a new wastewater treatment plant in 2020 to meet consent levels agreed with the regulators to apply water discharge rules arising from the Certificate of Environmental Clearance (CEC) Regulations 2001 and associated Water Pollution Rules 2007. In Angola, bp has upgraded produced water treatment systems to meet revised oil in water limits for produced water discharge under Executive Decree ED 97-14 .\n\nThe Abidjan Convention, along with the Additional Protocol published in 2012, sets environmental quality standards for the discharge of chemicals to the marine environment. Mauritania and Senegal are both signatories to the Abidjan Convention. bp is currently constructing the offshore facilities to include produced water management systems to meet the environmental quality standards for our future gas operations in Mauritania and Senegal.\n\n## Environmental maritime regulations\n\nbp's shipping operations are subject to extensive national and international regulations governing operations, training, pollution prevention, liability, and insurance. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 Liability and spill prevention and planning requirements governing, among others, tankers, barges, and offshore facilities are imposed by OPA in US waters. OPA also mandates a levy on imported and domestically produced oil to fund oil spill responses. Some states, including Alaska, Washington, Oregon and California, impose additional liability for oil spills. Outside US territorial waters, bp shipping tankers are subject to international pollution prevention, liability, spill response and preparedness regulations developed through the UN's International Maritime Organization (IMO), including the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL), the International Convention on Oil Pollution, Preparedness, Response and Co-operation, and the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage. In April 2010, the Hazardous and Noxious Substance (HNS) Protocol 2010 was adopted to address issues that have inhibited ratification of the International Convention on Liability and\n\n## Additional disclosures\n\nCompensation for Damage in Connection with the Carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea 1996. As at 31 December 2022, the HNS Convention had not entered into force.\n\n- \u00b7 A global sulphur cap of 0.5% applies to marine fuel under MARPOL. In order to comply, ships either need to consume low sulphur marine fuels, operate on alternative low sulphur fuels such as LNG or implement approved abatement technology to enable them to meet the low sulphur emissions requirements while continuing to use higher sulphur fuel. This global cap does not alter the lower limits that apply in the sulphur oxides Emissions Control Areas established by the IMO.\n- \u00b7 From 2023 all vessels over 400 gross tonnage will be subject to IMO requirements as to energy efficiency design (EEXI) and the carbon intensity of operations (CII).\n- \u00b7 Under provisionally agreed EU legislation, maritime transport will be gradually brought into the scope of the EU ETS from 2024, applicable to all vessels over 5000 gross tonnage calling at EU ports regardless of a vessel's flag.\n- \u00b7 Under the proposed Fuel EU Maritime Regulation, we expect that ship owners will need to reduce the GHG intensity of their fuel use by 6% by 2030.\n- \u00b7 The Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR), aims to protect the marine environment of the North-East Atlantic. The OSPAR 2012 Recommendation and Guideline for the implementation of a risk-based approach to the management of produced water discharges from offshore installations in the North Sea supports a key goal of working towards eliminating harmful discharges. In 2020 the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers issued a report 'Oil And Gas Risk Based Assessment of Offshore Produced Water Discharges' which presents industry good practice and aims to broaden the understanding and acceptance of Risk Based Assessment (RBA) techniques internationally and improve consistency in the application of assumptions, levels of conservatism, and selection of risk endpoints .\n\nTo meet its financial responsibility requirements, BP Shipping maintains marine oil pollution liability insurance in respect of its operated ships to a maximum limit of $1 billion for each occurrence through mutual insurance associations (P&I Clubs), although there can be no assurance that a spill would necessarily be adequately covered by insurance or that liabilities would not exceed insurance recoveries.\n\n## International trade sanctions\n\nDuring the period covered by this report, non-US subsidiaries \u00ab , or other non-US entities of bp, conducted limited activities in, or with persons from, certain countries identified by the US Department of State as State Sponsors of Terrorism or otherwise subject to US, EU and UK sanctions (Sanctioned Countries). Sanctions restrictions continue to be insignificant to the group's financial condition and results of operations. bp monitors its activities with Sanctioned Countries, persons from Sanctioned Countries and individuals and companies subject to US, EU and UK sanctions and seeks to comply with applicable sanctions laws and regulations.\n\nbp has a 29.99% interest in and operates the Shah Deniz field in Azerbaijan (Shah Deniz), has a 29.99% interest in and performs some operations for a related gas pipeline entity, South Caucasus Pipeline Company Limited (SCPC), and has a 23.99% non-operating interest in a related gas marketing entity, Azerbaijan Gas Supply Company Limited (AGSC). Naftiran Intertrade Co. Limited and NICO SPV Limited (collectively, NICO) have a 10% nonoperating interest in each of Shah Deniz and SCPC and an 8% nonoperating interest in AGSC. Shah Deniz, SCPC and AGSC continue in operation as they were excluded from the application of US sanctions and fall within the exception for certain natural gas projects under Section 603 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (ITRA).\n\nOn 3 December 2018 bp entered into an agreement with, among others, SOCAR and NICO pursuant to which SOCAR pays to BP Exploration (Shah Deniz) Limited (BPXSD), as the Shah Deniz operator, compensation for NICO's waiver of its right to lift its share of Shah Deniz condensate. Such amounts are used to cover cash calls to NICO in respect of operating costs due from NICO to BPXSD. On 12 February 2022, OFAC issued a renewed licence in relation to these arrangements.",

        "page_content": "Following the imposition in 2011 of further US and EU sanctions against Syria, bp terminated all sales of crude oil and petroleum products into Syria, though bp continues to supply aviation fuel to non-governmental Syrian resellers outside of Syria.\n\nbp has a joint arrangement in Cuba which imports, manufactures, markets and sells lubricants.\n\nDuring 2014, the US and the EU imposed sanctions on certain sectors of the Russian economy (energy, finance and defence/military) and on certain individuals and entities, including Rosneft. These sectoral sanctions include restrictions on the provision of financial assistance, technical assistance, and services in relation to exploration and production activity in deep water, shale, and offshore Arctic.\n\nAdditional US sanctions have been imposed since 2014, broadening the scope of US sanctions on Russia-related activity to include certain international deep water, shale, and offshore Arctic projects as well as the provision of goods and services for Russian energy export pipelines.\n\nIn response to Russia's military action in Ukraine in 2022, the US, EU, UK and many other countries have imposed broad economic and trade sanctions. The scope of these sanctions continues to evolve across various jurisdictions and includes restrictions on dealing with designated individuals and entities; restrictions on the Russian financial sector; blocking economic activity in certain  areas of Ukraine not controlled by the Ukrainian government; prohibitions in relation to investment in Russia; prohibitions and restrictions relating to Russian origin oil and oil products; prohibitions and restrictions in relation to transportation, including shipping and aircraft; trade controls limiting the purchase and import of a wide range of goods from Russia, and export controls limiting the export of a wide range of goods and technical assistance to Russia.\n\nIn response, Russia has implemented new counter-sanctions including restrictions on the divestment from Russian assets by foreign investors and restrictions on the payments of dividends to certain foreign shareholders, including those based in the UK, requiring such dividends to be paid in roubles into restricted bank accounts and a requirement for approval of the Russian government for transfers from any such bank accounts out of Russia.\n\nOn 27 February 2022 bp announced that we will exit our shareholding in Rosneft and our other businesses with Rosneft in Russia. The impact of those decisions on bp is discussed elsewhere in this bp Annual Report and Form 20-F, see for example pages 43-44. Other than Rosneft and the joint ventures with Rosneft in Russia, the bp group does not source any materials directly from Russia, except deliveries of LNG from Russian sources under a small number of contracts predating the Russia and Ukraine conflict in compliance with all applicable sanctions. bp has also discontinued sales of our products to customers in Russia. Such sales were not material to the bp group. As a result, outside of our shareholding in Rosneft and related businesses in Russia, direct impacts due to exposure to Russia have not been material and are not expected to be material in the future.\n\nNevertheless, the Russia and Ukraine conflict and related export bans, export control restrictions and sanctions have had a significant impact on the macro environment and the markets in which we operate by contributing to price volatility and inflationary pressure, and thus have had an indirect impact on our business and our margins. bp continues to monitor Russia related sanctions and other international restrictions for any impacts on our businesses and the exit of our shareholding in Rosneft.\n\nbp maintains bank accounts and has registered and paid required fees to maintain registrations of patents and trademarks in certain Sanctioned Countries.\n\nbp has equity interests in non-operated joint arrangements with air fuel sellers, resellers, and fuel delivery services around the world.\n\nFrom time to time, the joint arrangement operator or other partners may sell or deliver fuel to airlines from Sanctioned Countries or flights to Sanctioned Countries, without bp's involvement.\n\nbp has no control over the activities non-controlled associates may undertake in Sanctioned Countries or with persons from Sanctioned Countries.\n\n## Disclosure pursuant to ITRA Section 219\n\nTo our knowledge, none of bp's activities, transactions or dealings are required to be disclosed pursuant to ITRA Section 219, with the following possible exceptions.\n\nIn 2022, payments in relation to tax with an aggregate US dollar equivalent value of approximately $4,400 were paid from a bp trust account held with Tadvin Co. to Iranian public entities on behalf of BP Iran. No gross revenues or net profits are attributable to BP Iran's activities.\n\nIn February 2023, we identified that our European Fleet Business had issued ten fuel cards to the embassy and consulate of Iran in both Germany and Austria. Fuel cards enable holders to acquire goods and services at bp retail sites and at retail sites operated by acceptance partners in Europe without payment in cash. Goods and services purchased with fuel cards are invoiced on a monthly or bi-monthly basis. In 2022, the total aggregate invoiced amount was approximately $18,800, in 2021 $11,900, in 2020 $9,200 and in 2023 until termination $2,700. bp has terminated the cards and related accounts.\n\n## Material contracts\n\nOn 4 April 2016 the district court approved the Consent Decree among BP Exploration & Production Inc., BP Corporation North America Inc., BP p.l.c., the United States and the states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas (the Gulf states) which fully and finally resolved any and all natural resource damages (NRD) claims of the United States, the Gulf states, and their respective natural resource trustees and all Clean Water Act (CWA) penalty claims, and certain other claims of the United States and the Gulf states.\n\nConcurrently, the definitive Settlement Agreement that bp entered into with the Gulf states (Settlement Agreement) with respect to State claims for economic, property and other losses became effective.\n\nbp has filed the Consent Decree and the Settlement Agreement as exhibits to its Annual Report on Form 20-F 2020 filed with the SEC. For further details of the Consent Decree and the Settlement Agreement, see Legal proceedings in bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2015 .\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nbp has freehold and leasehold interests in real estate and other tangible assets in numerous countries, but no individual property is significant to the group as a whole. For more on the significant subsidiaries \u00ab of the group at 31 December 2022 and the group percentage of ordinary share capital see Financial statements - Note 37. For information on significant joint ventures \u00ab and associates \u00ab of the group see Financial statements - Notes 16 and 17.\n\n## Related party transactions\n\nTransactions between the group and its significant joint ventures and associates are summarized in Financial statements - Note 16 and Note 17. In the ordinary course of its business, the group enters into transactions with various organizations with which some of its directors or executive officers are associated. Except as described in this report, the group did not have any material transactions or transactions of an unusual nature with, and did not make loans to, related parties in the period commencing 1 January 2022 to 17 February 2023.\n\n## Corporate governance practices\n\nIn the US, bp ADSs are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The significant differences between bp's corporate governance practices as a UK company and those required by NYSE listing standards for US companies are listed as follows:\n\n## Independence\n\nAs set out on page 86, bp has adopted separate terms of reference for the board and each of its committees as part of its corporate governance framework. The terms of reference for the board and each of its committees were last updated with effect from 1 December 2021, excluding the audit committee terms of reference which were updated on 22 July 2022. The terms of reference reflect the UK Corporate Governance Code approach to corporate governance. As such, the way in which bp",

        "page_content": "makes determinations of directors' independence differs from the NYSE approach.\n\nbp's corporate governance framework requires that all non-executive directors be determined by the board to be 'independent in character and judgement and free from any business or other relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise of their judgement'. The bp board has determined that, in its judgement, all of the non-executive directors are independent. In doing so, however, the board did not explicitly take into consideration the independence requirements outlined in the NYSE's listing standards.\n\n## Committees\n\nbp has a number of board committees that are broadly comparable in purpose and composition to those required by NYSE rules for domestic US companies. For instance, bp has a remuneration (rather than a compensation) committee. bp also has an audit committee, which NYSE rules require for both US companies and foreign private issuers. These committees are composed solely of non-executive directors whom the board has determined to be independent, in the manner described above.\n\nEach committee operates under its own terms of reference together with a set of terms applicable to all the committees (see the board committee reports on pages 98-147).\n\nUnder US securities law and the listing standards of the NYSE, bp is required to have an audit committee that satisfies the requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and Section 303A.06 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. bp's audit committee complies with these requirements. The bp audit committee does not have direct responsibility for the appointment, reappointment or removal of the independent auditors. Instead, it follows the UK Companies Act 2006 and the UK Corporate Governance code 2018 by making recommendations to the board on these matters for it to put forward for shareholder approval at the AGM.\n\nOne of the NYSE's additional requirements for the audit committee states that at least one member of the audit committee is to have 'accounting or related financial management expertise'. The board determined that Tushar Morzaria possesses such expertise and also possesses the financial and audit committee experiences set forth in both the UK Corporate Governance Code and SEC rules (see Audit committee report on page 102). Mr Morzaria is the audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 16A of Form 20-F.\n\n## Shareholder approval of equity compensation plans\n\nThe NYSE rules for US companies require that shareholders must be given the opportunity to vote on all equity-compensation plans and material revisions to those plans. bp complies with UK requirements that are similar to the NYSE rules. The board, however, does not explicitly take into consideration the NYSE's detailed definition of what are considered 'material revisions'.\n\n## Code of ethics\n\nThe NYSE rules require that US companies adopt and disclose a code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers and employees. bp has adopted a code of conduct, which applies to all employees and members of the board. In addition, bp has adopted a code of ethics for senior financial officers as required by the SEC. bp considers that these codes and policies address the matters specified in the NYSE rules for US companies. During 2021, the board adopted a diversity policy, which requires it to encourage a diverse and inclusive working environment in the boardroom, where everyone is accepted, valued and receives fair treatment according to their different needs and situations without discrimination or prejudice. The policy was reviewed by the board in 2022, and amendments were made to reflect regulatory changes and market practice. The updated policy was then approved and published in February 2023.\n\n## Code of ethics\n\nThe company has adopted a code of ethics for its chief executive officer, chief financial officer, svp accounting reporting control and svp internal audit whose roles are equivalent to the SEC roles as required by the provisions of Section 406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules issued by the SEC. There have been no waivers from the code of ethics relating to any officers. A copy of the code of ethics can be found at bp.com/codeofethics.\n\n## Additional disclosures\n\nbp also has a code of conduct, which is applicable to all employees, officers and members of the board. This was updated (and published) in January 2023.\n\n## Controls and procedures\n\n## Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures\n\nThe company maintains 'disclosure controls and procedures', as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports the company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the company's group chief executive and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\nIn designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, our management, including the group chief executive and chief financial officer, recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud within the company, if any, have been detected. Further, in the design and evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures our management necessarily was required to apply its judgement in evaluating the costs and benefits of possible control and procedure design options. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. As we do not control these entities, our disclosure controls and procedures with respect to such entities are necessarily substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries \u00ab . Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. The company's disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet, and management believes that they meet, reasonable assurance standards.\n\nThe company's management, with the participation of the company's group chief executive and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this annual report. Based on that evaluation, the group chief executive and chief financial officer have concluded that the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\n\n## Management's report on internal control over financial reporting\n\nManagement of bp is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. bp's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the principal executive and financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of bp's financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with IFRS.\n\nAs of the end of the 2022 fiscal year, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the criteria in the UK Financial Reporting Council's Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting relating to internal control over financial reporting. Based on this assessment, management has determined that bp's internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2022 was effective.\n\nManagement's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting excluded Archaea Energy Inc., which was acquired on 28 December 2022. Archaea Energy's financial statements constitute 5.6% and 2.1% of net and total assets respectively, 0.0% of sales and other operating revenues, and 2.2% of profit (loss) for the year of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended 31 December 2022. Management's assessment also excluded EDF Energy Services LLC, which was acquired on 30 November 2022. EDF Energy Services financial statements constitute 0.7% and 1.0% of net and total assets respectively, 0.0% of sales and other operating revenues and 1.3% of profit (loss) for the year of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended 31 December 2022. These exclusions are in accordance with the",

        "page_content": "general guidance issued by the SEC that an assessment of a recent business combination may be omitted from management's report on internal control over financial reporting in the first year of consolidation.\n\nThe company's internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of bp; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of bp's assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements. bp's internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2022 has been audited by Deloitte LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing on page 179 of bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2022 .\n\n## Changes in internal control over financial reporting\n\nThere were no changes in the group's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by the Form 20-F that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Principal accountant's fees and services\n\nThe audit committee has established policies and procedures for the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte LLP, to render audit and certain assurance services. The policies provide for pre-approval by the audit committee of specifically defined audit, auditrelated, non-audit and other services that are not prohibited by regulatory or other professional requirements. Deloitte is engaged for these services when its expertise and experience of bp are important. Most of this work is of an audit nature. The committee regularly reviews the policy, including in 2022, when it was updated to remove restrictions on EY following bp's announcement on 27 February 2022 of its intention to exit its interests in Rosneft and capture additional detail for the processes applicable to separately listed bp entities.\n\nUnder the policy, pre-approval is given for specific services within the following categories: i) audit-related services, such as those required by law or where the auditor is best placed to undertake such work on similar terms, ii) non-audit services required by law, such as reporting required by a regulatory authority, and iii) other services, such as additional assurance or updates on applicable law and accounting standards. bp operates a twotier system for audit and non-audit services. For audit related services, the audit committee has a pre-approved aggregate level, within which specific work may be approved by management. Non-audit services are preapproved for management to authorize per individual engagement, but above a defined level must be approved by the chairman of the audit committee or the full committee. The audit committee has delegated to the chair of the audit committee authority to approve permitted services provided that any decisions are reported to the committee at its next scheduled meeting. Any proposed service not included in the approved service list must be approved in advance of commencing the engagement by the audit committee chair or the full audit committee depending on the level of fee payable.\n\nThe audit committee evaluates the performance of the auditor each year. The audit fees payable to Deloitte are reviewed by the committee in the context of other global companies for cost effectiveness. The committee keeps under review the scope and results of audit work and the independence and objectivity of the auditor. External regulation and bp policy requires the auditor to rotate its lead audit partner every five years. See Financial statements - Note 36 and Audit committee report on page 102 for details of fees for services provided by the auditor.\n\n## Additional Directors' report disclosures\n\nThis section of bp Annual Report and Form 20-F 2022 forms part of the Directors' report. Certain information has been included in the Strategic report that would otherwise be required to be disclosed in the Directors' report, as noted below.\n\n## Indemnity provisions\n\nIn accordance with BP's Articles of Association, on appointment each director is granted an indemnity from the company in respect of liabilities incurred as a result of their office, to the extent permitted by law. These indemnities were in force throughout the financial year and at the date of this report. In respect of those liabilities for which directors may not be indemnified, the company maintained a directors' and officers' liability insurance policy throughout 2022. During the year, a review of the terms and scope of the policy was undertaken as part of the annual renewal. Although their defence costs may be met, neither the company's indemnity nor insurance provides cover in the event that the director is proved to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly. Certain subsidiaries \u00ab are trustees of the group's pension schemes. Each director of these subsidiaries is granted an indemnity from the company in respect of liabilities incurred as a result of such a subsidiary's activities as a trustee of the pension scheme, to the extent permitted by law. These indemnities were in force throughout the financial year and at the date of this report.\n\n## Financial risk management objectives and policies\n\nThe disclosures in relation to financial risk management objectives and policies, including the policy for hedging, are included in How we manage risk on pages 69-72, Liquidity and capital resources on page 356 and Financial statements - Notes 29 and 30.\n\n## Exposure to price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow risk\n\nThe disclosures in relation to exposure to price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow risk are included in Financial statements - Note 29.\n\n## Important events since the end of the financial year\n\nDisclosures of the particulars of the important events affecting bp which have occurred since the end of the financial year are included in the Strategic report as well as in other places in the Directors' report.\n\n## Likely future developments in the business\n\nAn indication of the likely future developments in the business of the company is included in the Strategic report.\n\n## Research and development\n\nIndications of our activities in the field of research and development are provided throughout the Strategic report and the Directors' report. See also pages 12 and 213 for our expenditure on research and development.\n\n## Branches\n\nAs a global group our interests and activities are held or operated through subsidiaries, branches, joint arrangements \u00ab or associates \u00ab established in - and subject to the laws and regulations of - many different jurisdictions.\n\n## Employees\n\nDisclosures in respect of how the directors have engaged with employees and had regard to their interests are included in Stakeholder engagement on pages 94-95.\n\nThe disclosures concerning policies in relation to the employment of disabled persons and employee involvement are included in Sustainability our people on pages 67-68.\n\n## Employee share schemes\n\nCertain shares held as a result of participation in some employee share plans carry voting rights. Voting rights in respect of such shares are exercisable via a nominee. Dividend waivers are in place in respect of unallocated shares held in employee share plan trusts.\n\n## Suppliers, customers and others\n\nDisclosures in respect of how the directors have engaged with suppliers, customers and others in business relationships with the company are included in Stakeholder engagement on pages 92-93.\n\n## Change of control provisions\n\nOn 5 October 2015, the United States lodged with the district court in MDL 2179 a proposed Consent Decree between the United States, the Gulf states, BP Exploration & Production Inc., BP Corporation North America Inc. and BP p.l.c., to fully and finally resolve any and all natural resource damages claims of the United States, the Gulf states and their respective natural resource trustees and all Clean Water Act penalty claims, and certain other claims of the United States and the Gulf states.

        "page_content": "## Share prices and listings\n\n## Markets and market prices\n\nThe primary market for the company's ordinary shares (trading symbol 'BP.'), 8% cumulative first preference shares (trading symbol 'BP.A') and 9% cumulative second preference shares (trading symbol 'BP.B') is the London Stock Exchange (LSE). The company's ordinary shares are a constituent element of the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index.\n\nIn the US, the company's securities are listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the form of ADSs (trading symbol 'BP'), for which JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is the depositary (the Depositary) and transfer agent. The Depositary's principal office is 383 Madison Avenue, Floor 11, New York, NY, 10179, US. Each ADS represents six ordinary shares. ADSs are evidenced by American depositary receipts (ADRs), which may be issued in either certificated or book entry form.\n\nThe company's ordinary shares are also traded in the form of a global depositary certificate representing the company's ordinary shares on the Frankfurt, Hamburg and Dusseldorf Stock Exchanges.\n\nOn 17 February 2023, 760,485,699 ADSs (equivalent to approximately 4,562,914,194 ordinary shares or some 25.28% of the total issued share capital, excluding shares held in treasury) were outstanding and were held by approximately 66,677 ADS holders. Of these, about 65,925 had registered addresses in the US at that date. One of the registered holders of ADSs represents approximately 1,325,215 underlying holders.\n\nOn 17 February 2023, there were approximately 207,383 ordinary shareholders. Of these shareholders, around 1,515 had registered addresses in the US and held a total of some 4,159,804 ordinary shares.\n\nSince a number of the ordinary shares and ADSs were held by brokers and other nominees, the number of holders in the US may not be representative of the number of beneficial holders or their respective country of residence.\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe company's current policy is to pay interim dividends on a quarterly basis on its ordinary shares.\n\nIts policy is also to announce dividends for ordinary shares in US dollars and state an equivalent sterling dividend. Dividends on the company's ordinary shares will be paid in sterling and on the company's ADSs in US dollars. The rate of exchange used to determine the sterling amount equivalent is the average of the market exchange rates in London over the three business days prior to the sterling equivalent announcement date. The directors may choose to declare dividends in any currency provided that a sterling equivalent is announced. It is not the company's intention to change its current policy of announcing dividends on ordinary shares in US dollars.\n\nInformation regarding dividends announced and paid by the company on ordinary shares and preference shares is provided in the consolidated Financial statements - Note 10.\n\nA Scrip Dividend Programme (Scrip Programme) was approved by shareholders in 2010 and was renewed for a further three years at the 2021 AGM. It enabled the company's ordinary shareholders and ADS holders to elect to receive dividends by way of new fully paid ordinary shares (or ADSs in the case of ADS holders) instead of cash. The operation of the Scrip Programme is always subject to the directors' decision to make the Scrip Programme offer available in respect of any particular dividend.\n\nThe company announced on 29 October 2019 and as part of all subsequent quarterly results announcements made since, that the board had suspended the Scrip Programme in respect of those quarterly dividends. The company does not expect to offer a scrip election for the foreseeable future. Ordinary shareholders and ADS holders (subject to certain exceptions) may be able to participate in dividend reinvestment plans. Any decisions with respect to future dividends will be made by the board of BP p.l.c. following the end of each quarter.\n\nFuture dividends will be dependent on future earnings, the financial condition of the group, the Risk factors set out on page 73 and other matters that may affect the business of the group set out in Our strategy on page 10 and in Liquidity and capital resources on page 356.\n\nThe following table shows dividends announced and paid by the company per ADS for the past five years.\n\n| Dividends per ADS   | a        |   March |   June |   September | December Total   |\n|---------------------|----------|---------|--------|-------------|------------------|\n| 2018                | UK pence |   43.01 |  44.66 |       47.58 | 48.15    183.40  |\n|                     | US cents |   60    |  60    |       61.5  | 61.50    243.00  |\n| 2019                | UK pence |   46.43 |  48.39 |       50.09 | 46.95    191.86  |\n| 2019                | US cents |   61.5  |  61.5  |       61.5  | 61.50    246.00  |\n| 2020                | UK pence |   48.94 |  50.05 |       24.26 | 23.50    146.75  |\n| 2020                | US cents |   63    |  63    |       31.5  | 31.50    189.00  |\n| 2021                | UK pence |   22.61 |  22.27 |       23.72 | 24.63    92.23   |\n| 2021                | US cents |   31.5  |  31.5  |       32.76 | 32.76    128.52  |\n| 2022                | UK pence |   24.96 |  26.13 |       31.01 | 29.64    111.74  |\n| 2022                | US cents |   32.76 |  32.76 |       36.04 | 36.04    137.60  |\n\nThere are currently no UK foreign exchange controls or restrictions on remittances of dividends on the ordinary shares or on the conduct of the company's operations, other than restrictions applicable to certain countries and persons subject to EU economic sanctions or those sanctions adopted by the UK government which implement resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations.\n\n## Shareholder taxation information\n\nThis section describes the material US federal income tax and UK taxation consequences of owning ordinary shares or ADSs to a US holder who holds the ordinary shares or ADSs as capital assets for tax purposes. This section does not discuss tax consequences arising under the Medicare contribution tax on net investment income or the alternative minimum tax. It also does not apply inter alia to members of special classes of holders some of which may be subject to other rules, including: tax-exempt entities, life insurance companies, dealers in securities, traders in securities that elect a mark-tomarket method of accounting for securities holdings, holders that, directly or indirectly, hold 10% or more of the company's shares (as measured by voting power or value), holders that hold the shares or ADSs as part of a straddle or a hedging or conversion transaction, holders that purchase or sell the shares or ADSs as part of a wash sale for US federal income tax purposes, or holders whose functional currency is not the US dollar. In addition, if a partnership holds the shares or ADSs, the US federal income tax treatment of a partner will generally depend on the status of the partner and the tax treatment of the partnership and may not be described fully below.\n\nA US holder is any beneficial owner of ordinary shares or ADSs that is for US federal income tax purposes (1) a citizen or resident of the US, (2) a US domestic corporation, (3) an estate whose income is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its source, or (4) a trust if a US court can exercise primary supervision over the trust's administration and one or more US persons are authorized to control all substantial decisions of the trust.\n\nThis section is based on the tax laws of the United States, including the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, its legislative history, existing and proposed US Treasury regulations thereunder, published rulings and court decisions, and the taxation laws of the UK, all as currently in effect, as well as the income tax convention between the US and the UK that entered into force on 31 March 2003 (the 'Treaty'). These laws are subject to change, possibly on a retroactive basis. This section further assumes that each obligation under the terms of the deposit agreement relating to bp ADSs and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.\n\nFor purposes of the Treaty and the estate and gift tax Convention (the 'Estate Tax Convention') and for US federal income tax and UK taxation purposes, a holder of ADRs evidencing ADSs will be treated as the owner of the company's ordinary shares represented by those ADRs. Exchanges of ordinary shares for ADRs and ADRs for ordinary shares generally will not be",

        "page_content": "subject to US federal income tax or to UK taxation other than stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax, as described below.\n\nInvestors should consult their own tax adviser regarding the US federal, state and local, UK and other tax consequences of owning and disposing of ordinary shares and ADSs in their particular circumstances, and in particular whether they are eligible for the benefits of the Treaty in respect of their investment in the shares or ADSs.\n\n## Taxation of dividends\n\n## UK taxation\n\nUnder current UK taxation law, no withholding tax will be deducted from dividends paid by the company, including dividends paid to US holders. A shareholder that is a company resident for tax purposes in the UK or trading in the UK through a permanent establishment generally will not be taxable in the UK on a dividend it receives from the company. A shareholder who is an individual resident for tax purposes in the UK is subject to UK tax on dividends received from the company, including dividends received under the dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) for ordinary shareholders, that are in excess of the annual dividend allowance.\n\nFor 2022/23 the dividend allowance is \u00a32,000 which means there is no UK tax due on the first \u00a32,000 of dividends received. Dividends above this level are subject to tax at 8.75% for basic tax payers, 33.75% for higher rate tax payers and 39.35% for additional rate tax payers.\n\nAlthough the first \u00a32,000 of dividend income is not subject to UK income tax, it does not reduce the total income for tax purposes. Dividends within the dividend allowance still count towards basic or higher rate bands, and may therefore affect the rate of tax paid on dividends received in excess of the \u00a32,000 allowance. For instance, if an individual has an annual gross salary of \u00a350,000 and also receives a dividend of \u00a312,000 they will be subject to the following scenario. The individual's personal allowance and the basic rate tax band will be used up by the gross salary. The remaining part of the salary and the whole of the dividend will be subject to tax at the higher rate, although the dividend allowance will reduce the amount of dividend subject to tax. The dividend of \u00a312,000 will be reduced by the dividend allowance of \u00a32,000 leaving taxable dividend income of \u00a310,000. The dividend will be taxed at 33.75% so that the total tax payable on the dividends is \u00a33,375.\n\nHow the shareholder pays the tax arising on the dividend income depends on the amount of dividend income and salary they receive in the tax year. If less than \u00a32,000 they will not need to report anything or pay any tax. If between \u00a32,000 and \u00a310,000, the shareholder can pay what they owe by: contacting the HMRC helpline; asking HMRC to change their tax code - the tax will be taken from their wages or pension or through completion of the 'Dividends' section of their self-assessment tax return, where one is already being filed. If over \u00a310,000 they will be required to file a self-assessment tax return and should complete the 'Dividends' section with details of the amounts received.\n\n## US federal income taxation\n\nA US holder is subject to US federal income taxation on the gross amount of any dividend paid by the company (including dividends paid but reinvested received under the Global Invest Direct (GID) Dividend Reinvestment Plan for ADS holders) out of its current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for US federal income tax purposes). Dividends paid to a non-corporate US holder that constitute qualified dividend income will be taxable to the holder at a preferential rate, provided that the holder has a holding period in the ordinary shares or ADSs of more than 60 days during the 121-day period beginning 60 days before the exdividend date and meets other holding period requirements. Dividends paid by the company with respect to the ordinary shares or ADSs will generally be qualified dividend income.\n\nFor US federal income tax purposes, a dividend must be included in income when the US holder, in the case of ordinary shares, or the Depositary, in the case of ADSs, actually or constructively receives the dividend and will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to US corporations in respect of dividends received from other US corporations. US ADS holders should consult their own tax adviser regarding the US tax treatment of the dividend fee in respect of dividends. Dividends will be income from sources outside the US and generally will be 'passive category income' for purposes of computing a US holder's foreign tax credit limitation.\n\n## Shareholder information\n\nAs noted above in UK taxation, a US holder will not be subject to UK withholding tax. Accordingly, the receipt of a dividend will not entitle the US holder to a foreign tax credit.\n\nThe amount of the dividend distribution on the ordinary shares that is paid in pounds sterling will be the US dollar value of the pounds sterling payments made, determined at the spot pounds sterling/US dollar rate on the date the dividend is distributed, regardless of whether the payment is, in fact, converted into US dollars. Generally, any gain or loss resulting from currency exchange fluctuations during the period from the date the pounds sterling dividend payment is distributed to the date the payment is converted into US dollars will be treated as ordinary income or loss and will not be eligible for the preferential tax rate on qualified dividend income. The gain or loss generally will be income or loss from sources within the US for foreign tax credit limitation purposes.\n\nDistributions in excess of the company's earnings and profits, as determined for US federal income tax purposes, will be treated as a return of capital to the extent of the US holder's basis in the ordinary shares or ADSs and thereafter as capital gain, subject to taxation as described in Taxation of capital gains - US federal income taxation section below.\n\nIn addition, the taxation of dividends may be subject to the rules for passive foreign investment companies (PFIC), described below under 'Taxation of capital gains - US federal income taxation'. Distributions made by a PFIC do not constitute qualified dividend income and are not eligible for the preferential tax rate applicable to such income.\n\n## Taxation of capital gains\n\n## UK taxation\n\nA US holder may be liable for both UK and US tax in respect of a gain on the disposal of ordinary shares or ADSs if the US holder is (1) resident for tax purposes in the UK at the date of disposal, (2) if he or she has left the UK for a period not exceeding five complete tax years between the year of departure from and the year of return to the UK and acquired the shares before leaving the UK and was resident in the UK in the previous four out of seven tax years before the year of departure, (3) a US domestic corporation resident in the UK by reason of its business being managed or controlled in the UK or (4) a citizen of the US that carries on a trade or profession or vocation in the UK through a branch or agency or a corporation that carries on a trade, profession or vocation in the UK, through a permanent establishment, and that has used, held, or acquired the ordinary shares or ADSs for the purposes of such trade, profession or vocation of such branch, agency or permanent establishment. However, such persons may be entitled to a tax credit against their US federal income tax liability for the amount of UK capital gains tax or UK corporation tax on chargeable gains (as the case may be) that is paid in respect of such gain.\n\nUnder the Treaty, capital gains on dispositions of ordinary shares or ADSs generally will be subject to tax only in the jurisdiction of residence of the relevant holder as determined under both the laws of the UK and the US and as required by the terms of the Treaty.\n\nUnder the Treaty, individuals who are residents of either the UK or the US and who have been residents of the other jurisdiction (the US or the UK, as the case may be) at any time during the six years immediately preceding the relevant disposal of ordinary shares or ADSs may be subject to tax with respect to capital gains arising from a disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs of the company not only in the jurisdiction of which the holder is resident at the time of the disposition but also in the other jurisdiction.\n\nFor gains on or after 23 June 2010, the UK Capital Gains Tax rate will be dependent on the level of an individual's taxable income. Where total taxable income and gains after all allowable deductions are less than the upper limit of the basic rate income tax band of \u00a337,700 (for 2022/23), the rate of Capital Gains Tax will be 10%. For gains (and any parts of gains) above that limit the rate will be 20%.\n\nFrom 6 April 2008, entitlement to the annual exemption is based on an individual's circumstances (taking into account Domicile status, remittance basis of taxation and number of years in the UK). For individuals who are entitled to the exemption for 2022/23, this has been set at \u00a312,300. Corporation tax on chargeable gains is levied at 25 per cent for companies from 1 April 2023.",

        "page_content": "## US federal income taxation\n\nA US holder who sells or otherwise disposes of ordinary shares or ADSs will recognize a capital gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the US dollar value of the amount realized on the disposition and the US holder's tax basis, determined in US dollars, in the ordinary shares or ADSs. Any such capital gain or loss generally will be long-term gain or loss, subject to tax at a preferential rate for a noncorporate US holder, if the US holder's holding period for such ordinary shares or ADSs exceeds one year. The tax basis of shares acquired through reinvested dividends under the GID Dividend Reinvestment Plan for ADS holders) is equal to the fair market value of the stock on the investment date. The holding period for shares acquired under the plan begins the day after the applicable investment date.\n\nGain or loss from the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs will generally be income or loss from sources within the US for foreign tax credit limitation purposes. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.\n\nWe do not believe that ordinary shares or ADSs will be treated as stock of a passive foreign investment company (PFIC) for US federal income tax purposes, but this conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually and thus is subject to change. If we are treated as a PFIC, unless a US holder elects to be taxed annually on a mark-to-market basis with respect to ordinary shares or ADSs, any gain realized on the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs would in general not be treated as capital gain. Instead, a US holder would be treated as if he or she had realized such gain rateably over the holding period for ordinary shares or ADSs and would be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect for each such year to which the gain was allocated, in addition to which an interest charge in respect of the tax attributable to each such year would apply. Certain 'excess distributions' would be similarly treated if we were treated as a PFIC.\n\n## Additional tax considerations\n\n## Scrip Programme\n\nUntil the publication of the 2019 third quarter results, the company had an optional Scrip Programme, wherein holders of bp ordinary shares or ADSs could elect to receive any dividends in the form of new fully paid ordinary shares or ADSs of the company instead of cash. Please consult your tax adviser for the consequences to you.\n\n## UK inheritance tax\n\nThe Estate Tax Convention applies to inheritance tax. ADSs held by an individual who is domiciled for the purposes of the Estate Tax Convention in the US and is not for the purposes of the Estate Tax Convention a national of the UK will not be subject to UK inheritance tax on the individual's death or on transfer during the individual's lifetime unless, among other things, the ADSs are part of the business property of a permanent establishment situated in the UK used for the performance of independent personal services. In the exceptional case where ADSs are subject to both inheritance tax and US federal gift or estate tax, the Estate Tax Convention generally provides for tax payable in the US to be credited against tax payable in the UK or for tax paid in the UK to be credited against tax payable in the US, based on priority rules set forth in the Estate Tax Convention.\n\n## UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax\n\nThe statements below relate to what is understood to be the current practice of HM Revenue & Customs in the UK under existing law.\n\nProvided that any instrument of transfer is not executed in the UK and remains at all times outside the UK and the transfer does not relate to any matter or thing done or to be done in the UK, no UK stamp duty is payable on the acquisition or transfer of ADSs. Neither will an agreement to transfer ADSs in the form of ADRs give rise to a liability to stamp duty reserve tax.\n\nPurchases of ordinary shares, as opposed to ADSs, through the CREST system of paperless share transfers will be subject to stamp duty reserve tax at 0.5%. The charge will arise as soon as there is an agreement for the transfer of the shares (or, in the case of a conditional agreement, when the condition is fulfilled). The stamp duty reserve tax will apply to agreements to transfer ordinary shares even if the agreement is made outside the UK between two non-residents. Purchases of ordinary shares outside the CREST system are subject either to stamp duty at a rate of \u00a35 per \u00a31,000\n\n(or part, unless the stamp duty is less than \u00a35, when no stamp duty is charged), or stamp duty reserve tax at 0.5%. Stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax are generally the liability of the purchaser.\n\nA subsequent transfer of ordinary shares to the Depositary's nominee will give rise to further stamp duty at the rate of \u00a31.50 per \u00a3100 (or part) or stamp duty reserve tax at the rate of 1.5% of the value of the ordinary shares at the time of the transfer. For ADR holders electing to receive ADSs instead of cash, after the 2012 first quarter dividend payment, HM Revenue & Customs no longer seeks to impose 1.5% stamp duty reserve tax on issues of UK shares and securities to non-EU clearance services and depositary receipt systems.\n\n## Major shareholders\n\nThe disclosure of certain major and significant shareholdings in the share capital of the company is governed by the Companies Act 2006, the UK Financial Conduct Authority's Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (DTR) and the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nRegister of members holding bp ordinary shares as at 31 December 2022\n\n| Range of holdings   | Number of  ordinary shareholders   |   Percentage of  total ordinary  shareholders |   Percentage of  total ordinary  share capital excluding shares held in treasury |\n|---------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1-200               | 51,663                             |                                         24.75 |                                                                             0.01 |\n| 201-1,000           | 69,447                             |                                         33.27 |                                                                             0.21 |\n| 1,001-10,000        | 76,473                             |                                         36.63 |                                                                             1.35 |\n| 10,001-100,000      | 9,695                              |                                          4.64 |                                                                             1.12 |\n| 100,001-1,000,000   | 832                                |                                          0.4  |                                                                             1.67 |\n| Over 1,000,000 a    | 636                                |                                          0.31 |                                                                            95.64 |\n| Totals              | 208,746                            |                                        100    |                                                                           100    |\n\nRegister of holders of American depositary shares (ADSs) as at 31 December 2022 a\n\n| Range of holdings   | Number of ADS holders   |   Percentage of  total ADS holders |   Percentage of  total ADSs |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| 1-200               | 40,163                  |                              59.57 |                        0.28 |\n| 201-1,000           | 17,720                  |                              26.28 |                        1.1  |\n| 1,001-10,000        | 9,182                   |                              13.62 |                        3.08 |\n| 10,001-100,000      | 349                     |                               0.52 |                        0.74 |\n| 100,001-1,000,000   | 5                       |                               0.01 |                        0.11 |\n| Over 1,000,000 b    | 2                       |                               0    |                       94.69 |\n| Totals              | 67,421                  |                             100    |                      100    |\n\nAs at 31 December 2022 there were also 1,122 preference shareholders.

The Act abolished the need to have object provisions and so at the AGM held on 15 April 2010 shareholders approved the removal of its objects clause together with all other provisions of its Memorandum that, by virtue of the Act, are treated as forming part of the company's Articles of Association.\n\n## Directors and secretary\n\nThe business and affairs of the company shall be managed by the directors. The company's Articles of Association provide that any person may be appointed by the existing directors or by the shareholders in a general meeting either as a replacement for another director or as an additional director. Any person appointed by the directors will hold office only until the next general meeting, notice of which is first given after their appointment and will then be eligible for re-election by the shareholders. A director may be removed by the company as provided for by applicable law and shall vacate office in certain circumstances as set out in the Articles of Association. In addition, the company may, by special resolution, remove a director before the expiration of his/her period of office and, subject to the Articles of Association, may by ordinary resolution appoint another person to be a director instead. There is no requirement for a director to retire on reaching any age.\n\nThe Articles of Association place a general prohibition on a director voting in respect of any contract or arrangement in which the director has a material interest other than by virtue of such director's interest in shares in the company. However, in the absence of some other material interest not indicated below, a director is entitled to vote and to be counted in a quorum for the purpose of any vote relating to a resolution concerning the following matters:\n\n- \u00b7 The giving of security or indemnity with respect to any money lent or obligation taken by the director at the request or benefit of the company or any of its subsidiary undertakings.\n- \u00b7 The giving of security or indemnity to a third party with respect to any debt or obligation of the company or any of its subsidiary undertakings for which the director has assumed responsibility.\n- \u00b7 Any proposal in which the director is interested, concerning the underwriting of company securities or debentures or the giving of any security to a third party for a debt or obligation of the company or any of its subsidiary undertakings.\n- \u00b7 Any proposal concerning any other company in which the director is interested, directly or indirectly (whether as an officer or shareholder or otherwise) provided that the director and persons connected with such director are not the holder or holders of 1% or more of the voting interest in the shares of such company.\n- \u00b7 Any proposal concerning the purchase or maintenance of any insurance policy under which the director may benefit.\n- \u00b7 Any proposal concerning the giving to the director of any other indemnity which is on substantially the same terms as indemnities given or to be given to all of the other directors or to the funding by the company of his expenditure on defending proceedings or the doing by the company of anything to enable the director to avoid incurring such expenditure where all other directors have been given or are to be given substantially the same arrangements.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 Any proposal concerning an arrangement for the benefit of the employees and directors or former employees and former directors of the company or any of its subsidiary undertakings, including but without being limited to a retirement benefits scheme and an employees' share scheme, which does not accord to any director any privilege or advantage not generally accorded to the employees or former employees to whom the arrangement relates.\n\nThe Act requires a director of a company who is in any way interested in a contract or proposed contract with the company to declare the nature of the director's interest at a meeting of the directors of the company. The definition of 'interest' includes the interests of spouses, children, companies and trusts. The Act also requires that a director must avoid a situation where a director has, or could have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the company's interests. The Act allows directors of public companies to authorize such conflicts where appropriate, if a company's Articles of Association so permit. The company's Articles of Association permit the authorization of such conflicts. The directors may exercise all the powers of the company to borrow money, except that the amount remaining undischarged of all moneys borrowed by the company shall not, without approval of the shareholders, exceed two times the amount paid up on the share capital plus the aggregate of the amount of the capital and revenue reserves of the company and its subsidiary undertakings incorporated in the UK. Variation of the borrowing power of the board may only be affected by amending the Articles of Association.\n\nRemuneration of non-executive directors shall be determined in the aggregate by resolution of the shareholders. Remuneration of executive directors is determined by the remuneration committee. This committee is made up of non-executive directors only. There is no requirement of share ownership for a director's qualification.\n\nThe Articles of Association provide entitlement to the directors' pensions and death and disability benefits to the directors' relations and dependants respectively.\n\nThe circumstances in which a director's office will automatically terminate include, amongst others: when a director ceases to hold an executive office of the company and the directors resolve that they should cease to be a director; if a medical practitioner provides an opinion that a director has become incapable of acting as a director and may remain so incapable for more than a further three months and the directors resolve that they should cease to be a director; and if all of the other directors vote in favour of a resolution stating that the person should cease to be a director.\n\nThe company secretary has express powers to delegate any of the powers or discretions conferred on him or her.\n\n## Dividend rights; other rights to share in company profits; capital calls\n\nShareholders of the company may, by resolution, declare dividends but no such dividend may be declared in excess of the amount recommended by the directors. The directors may also pay interim dividends without obtaining shareholder approval. No dividend may be paid other than out of profits available for distribution, as determined under IFRS and the Act. Dividends on ordinary shares are payable only after payment of dividends on bp preference shares. Any dividend unclaimed after a period of 10 years from the date of declaration of such dividend shall be forfeited and reverts to bp. If the company exercises its right to forfeit shares and sells shares belonging to an untraced shareholder then any entitlement to claim dividends or other monies unclaimed in respect of those shares will be for a period of 12 months after the sale. The company may take such steps as the directors decide are appropriate in the circumstances to trace the member entitled and the sale may be made at such time and on such terms as the directors may decide.\n\nThe directors have the power to declare and pay dividends in any currency provided that a sterling equivalent is announced. It is not the company's intention to change its current policy of paying dividends in US dollars. At the company's AGM held on 15 April 2010, shareholders approved the introduction of a Scrip Dividend Programme (Scrip Programme) and to include provisions in the Articles of Association to enable the company to operate the Scrip Programme. The Scrip Programme was renewed at the company's AGM held on 12 May 2021 for a further three years. The Scrip Programme enables ordinary shareholders and bp ADS holders to elect to\n\nreceive new fully paid ordinary shares (or bp ADSs in the case of bp ADS holders) instead of cash. The operation of the Scrip Programme is always subject to the directors' decision to make the scrip offer available in respect of any particular dividend. Should the directors decide not to offer the scrip in respect of any particular dividend, cash will automatically be paid instead. The directors may determine in relation to any scrip dividend plan or programme how the costs of the programme will be met, the minimum number of ordinary shares required in order to be able to participate in the programme and any arrangements to deal with legal and practical difficulties in any particular territory.\n\nApart from shareholders' rights to share in bp's profits by dividend (if any is declared or announced), the Articles of Association provide that the directors may set aside:\n\n- \u00b7 A special reserve fund out of the balance of profits each year to make up any deficit of cumulative dividend on the bp preference shares.\n- \u00b7 A general reserve out of the balance of profits each year, which shall be applicable for any purpose to which the profits of the company may properly be applied. This may include capitalization of such sum, pursuant to an ordinary shareholders' resolution, and distribution to shareholders as if it were distributed by way of a dividend on the ordinary shares or in paying up in full unissued ordinary shares for allotment and distribution as bonus shares.\n\nAny such sums so deposited may be distributed in accordance with the manner of distribution of dividends as described above.\n\nHolders of shares are not subject to calls on capital by the company, provided that the amounts required to be paid on issue have been paid off. All shares are fully paid.\n\n## Share transfers and share certificates\n\nThe directors may permit transfers to be effected other than by an instrument in writing. Share certificates will not be required to be issued by the company if they are not required by law.\n\nThe company may charge an administrative fee in the event that a shareholder wishes to replace two or more certificates representing shares with a single certificate or wishes to surrender a single certificate and replace it with two or more certificates. All certificates are sent at the member's risk.\n\n## Voting rights\n\nThe Articles of Association of the company provide that voting on resolutions at a shareholders' meeting will be decided on a poll other than resolutions of a procedural nature, which may be decided on a show of hands. If voting is on a poll, every shareholder who is present in person or by proxy has one vote for every ordinary share held and two votes for every \u00a35 in nominal amount of bp preference shares held. If voting is on a show of hands, each shareholder who is present at the meeting in person or whose duly appointed proxy is present in person will have one vote, regardless of the number of shares held, unless a poll is requested.\n\nShareholders do not have cumulative voting rights.\n\nFor the purposes of determining which persons are entitled to attend or vote at a shareholders' meeting and how many votes such persons may cast, the company may specify in the notice of the meeting a time, not more than 48 hours before the time of the meeting, by which a person who holds shares in registered form must be entered on the company's register of members in order to have the right to attend or vote at the meeting or to appoint a proxy to do so.\n\nHolders on record of ordinary shares may appoint a proxy, including a beneficial owner of those shares, to attend, speak and vote on their behalf at any shareholders' meeting, provided that a duly completed proxy form is received not less than 48 hours (or such shorter time as the directors may determine) before the time of the meeting or adjourned meeting or, where the poll is to be taken after the date of the meeting, not less than 24 hours (or such shorter time as the directors may determine) before the time of the poll.\n\nRecord holders of bp ADSs are also entitled to attend, speak and vote at any shareholders' meeting of the company by the appointment by the approved depositary, JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., of them as proxies in respect of the ordinary shares represented by their ADSs. Each such proxy may also appoint a proxy. Alternatively, holders of bp ADSs are entitled to",

        "page_content": "vote by supplying their voting instructions to the Depositary, who will vote the ordinary shares represented by their ADSs in accordance with their instructions.\n\nProxies may be delivered electronically.\n\nCorporations who are members of the company may appoint one or more persons to act as their representative or representatives at any shareholders' meeting provided that the company may require a corporate representative to produce a certified copy of the resolution appointing them before they are permitted to exercise their powers.\n\nMatters are transacted at shareholders' meetings by the proposing and passing of resolutions, of which there are two types: ordinary or special.\n\nAn ordinary resolution requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes of those persons voting at a meeting at which there is a quorum. A special resolution requires the affirmative vote of not less than three quarters of the persons voting at a meeting at which there is a quorum. Any AGM requires 21 clear days' notice. The notice period for any other general meeting is 14 clear days subject to the company obtaining annual shareholder approval, failing which, a 21 clear day notice period will apply.\n\n## Liquidation rights; redemption provisions\n\nIn the event of a liquidation of bp, after payment of all liabilities and applicable deductions under UK laws and subject to the payment of secured creditors, the holders of bp preference shares would be entitled to the sum of (1) the capital paid up on such shares plus, (2) accrued and unpaid dividends and (3) a premium equal to the higher of (a) 10% of the capital paid up on the bp preference shares and (b) the excess of the average market price over par value of such shares on the LSE during the previous six months. The remaining assets (if any) would be divided pro rata among the holders of ordinary shares.\n\nWithout prejudice to any special rights previously conferred on the holders of any class of shares, bp may issue any share with such preferred, deferred or other special rights, or subject to such restrictions as the shareholders by resolution determine (or, in the absence of any such resolutions, by determination of the directors), and may issue shares that are to be or may be redeemed.\n\n## Variation of rights\n\nThe rights attached to any class of shares may be varied with the consent in writing of holders of 75% of the shares of that class or on the adoption of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class. At every such separate meeting, all of the provisions of the Articles of Association relating to proceedings at a general meeting apply, except that the quorum with respect to a meeting to change the rights attached to the preference shares is 10% or more of the shares of that class, and the quorum to change the rights attached to the ordinary shares is one third or more of the shares of that class.\n\n## Shareholders' meetings and notices\n\nShareholders must provide bp with a postal or electronic address in the UK to be entitled to receive notice of shareholders' meetings. Holders of bp ADSs are entitled to receive notices under the terms of the deposit agreement relating to bp ADSs. The substance and timing of notices are described above under the heading Voting rights.\n\nUnder the Act, the AGM of shareholders must be held once every year, within each six-month period beginning with the day following the company's accounting reference date. All general meetings shall be held at a time and place determined by the directors. If any shareholders' meeting is adjourned for lack of quorum, notice of the time and place of the adjourned meeting may be given in any lawful manner, including electronically. Powers exist for action to be taken either before or at the meeting by authorized officers to ensure its orderly conduct and safety of those attending.\n\nThe directors have power to convene a general meeting which is a hybrid meeting, that is to provide facilities for shareholders to attend a meeting which is being held at a physical place by electronic means as well (but not to convene a purely electronic meeting).\n\nThe provisions of the Articles of Association in relation to satellite meetings permit facilities being provided by electronic means to allow those persons at each place to participate in the meeting.\n\n## Shareholder information\n\n## Limitations on voting and shareholding\n\nThere are no limitations, either under the laws of the UK or under the company's Articles of Association, restricting the right of non-resident or foreign owners to hold or vote bp ordinary or preference shares in the company other than limitations that would generally apply to all of the shareholders and limitations applicable to certain countries and persons subject to EU economic sanctions or those sanctions adopted by the UK government which implement resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations.\n\n## Disclosure of interests in shares\n\nThe Act permits a public company to give notice to any person whom the company believes to be or, at any time during the three years prior to the issue of the notice, to have been interested in its voting shares requiring them to disclose certain information with respect to those interests. Failure to supply the information required may lead to disenfranchisement of the relevant shares and a prohibition on their transfer and receipt of dividends and other payments in respect of those shares and any new shares in the company issued in respect of those shares. In this context the term 'interest' is widely defined and will generally include an interest of any kind whatsoever in voting shares, including any interest of a holder of bp ADSs.\n\n## Called-up share capital\n\nDetails of the allotted, called-up and fully-paid share capital at 31 December 2022 are set out in Financial statements - Note 31. In accordance with institutional investor guidelines, the company deems it appropriate to grant authority to the directors to allot shares and other securities and to disapply pre-emption rights by way of shareholders' resolutions at each AGM in place of authority granted by virtue of the company's Articles of Association. At the AGM on 12 May 2022, authorization was given to the directors to allot shares in the company and to grant rights to subscribe for, or to convert any security into, shares in the company up to an aggregate nominal amount as set out in the Notice of Annual General Meeting 2022 . These authorities were given for the period until the next AGM in 2023 or 12 August 2023, whichever is the earlier. These authorities are renewed annually at the AGM.\n\n## Company records and service of notice\n\nIn relation to notices not covered by the Act, the reference to notice by advertisement in a national newspaper also includes advertisements via other means such as a public announcement.",

The shares repurchased in 2022 represented 10.47% of the company's issued share capital, excluding shares held in treasury, on 31 December 2022. Of the shares repurchased in 2022, shares purchased under the 2021 AGM authority represented 4.82%, and shares purchased under the 2022 AGM authority represented 5.65%, of bp's issued share capital, excluding shares held in treasury, on 31 December 2022. A further 107,262,524 ordinary shares were repurchased between the end of the financial year and 17 February 2023 at a cost of $652,754,724 (including transaction costs) representing 0.59% of the company's issued share capital, excluding shares held in treasury, on 31 December 2022. All ordinary shares repurchased in 2022 and in 2023 up to 17 February under the share buyback programmes were cancelled.\n\nAuthorization for the company to make market purchases (as defined in section 693(4) of the Companies Act 2006) of ordinary shares with a nominal value of $0.25 each in the company was renewed at the company's 2022 AGM covering the period until the date of the company's 2023 AGM or 12 August 2023, whichever is earlier.

        "page_content": "shareholders direct the company to include in its strategic report and/or other corporate reports, as appropriate, for the year ending 2019 onwards, a description of its strategy which the board considers, in good faith, to be consistent with the goals of Articles 2.1(a)(1) and 4.1(2) of the Paris Agreement (3) (the 'Paris goals'), as well as:\n\n- (1) Capital expenditure: how the company evaluates the consistency of each new material capex investment, including in the exploration, acquisition or development of oil and gas resources and reserves and other energy sources and technologies, with (a) the Paris goals and separately (b) a range of other outcomes relevant to its strategy.\n- (2) Metrics and targets: the company's principal metrics and relevant targets or goals over the short, medium and/or long term, consistent with the Paris goals, together with disclosure of:\n- a. The anticipated levels of investment in (i) oil and gas resources and reserves; and (ii) other energy sources and technologies.\n- b. The company's targets to promote reductions in its operational greenhouse gas emissions, to be reviewed in line with changing protocols and other relevant factors.\n- c.  The estimated carbon intensity of the company's energy products and progress on carbon intensity over time.\n- d. Any linkage between the above targets and executive remuneration.\n- (3) Progress reporting: an annual review of progress against (1) and (2) above.\n\nSuch disclosure and reporting to include the criteria and summaries of the methodology and core assumptions used, and to omit commercially confidential or competitively sensitive information and be prepared at reasonable cost; and provided that nothing in this resolution shall limit the company's powers to set and vary its strategy, or associated targets or metrics, or to take any action which it believes in good faith, would best promote the long-term success of the company.\n\nThe Paris goals\n\n- (1) Article 2.1(a) of the Paris Agreement states the goal of 'Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above preindustrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change'.\n- (2) Article 4.1 of the Paris Agreement: In order to achieve the long-term temperature goal set out in Article 2, parties aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, recognizing that peaking will take longer for developing country parties, and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with best available science, so as to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century, on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty.\n- (3) U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties, Twenty-First Session, Adoption of the Paris Agreement, U.N. Doc. FCCC/CP/2015/L.9/Rev.1 (Dec. 12, 2015).\n\n## New material capex investment\n\nFor the purposes of the 2022 evaluation discussed on pages 28-31, 'new material capex investment' means a decision taken by the resource commitment meeting (RCM) in 2022 to incur inorganic or organic investments greater than $250 million that relate to a new project or asset, extending an existing project or asset, or acquiring or increasing a share in a project, asset or entity.\n\nThere were five investments that met the above criteria in 2022.\n\nMaterial capex evaluation: Paris-consistency quantitative tests. For the purposes of evaluating material capex investments for consistency with the Paris goals, two quantitative tests were applied, see page 31.\n\n## Operational carbon intensity (CI)\n\nThe annual average operational GHG emissions (TeCO2e/unit), divided by the relevant unit of output:\n\n- \u00b7 per thousand barrels of oil equivalent in upstream\n- \u00b7 per utilized equivalent distillation capacity in refining\n\n- \u00b7 per thousand tonnes of petrochemicals production.\n\n## Net zero aims and ambition glossary\n\nAverage carbon intensity of sold energy products\n\nThe rate of GHG emissions per unit of energy delivered (in grams CO2e/MJ) estimated in respect of sold energy products \u00ab . GHG emissions are estimated on a lifecycle basis covering use, production, and distribution of sold energy products.\n\n## Energy product\n\nFor the purposes of our 2022 disclosures relating to our aim 3, we consider an energy product to be one that is generally used to satisfy an energy demand. In the case of fuels, to burn them to release their calorific content, and in the case of electricity to provide work or heat. For further information on products included in bp's 2022 aim 3 reporting see the basis of reporting bp.com/basisofreporting .\n\n## Emissions from the carbon in our upstream oil and gas production\n\nEstimated CO2 emissions from the combustion of upstream production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) based on bp's net share of production, excluding bp's share of Rosneft production and assuming that all produced volumes undergo full stoichiometric combustion to CO2.\n\n## Methane intensity\n\nMethane intensity refers to the amount of methane emissions from bp's operated upstream oil and gas assets as a percentage of the total gas that goes to market from those operations. Our methodology is aligned with the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative's (OGCI).\n\n## Net zero\n\nReferences to global net zero in the phrase, 'to help the world get to net zero', means achieving '...a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases...on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty', as set out in Article 4(1) of the Paris Agreement.\n\nReferences to net zero for bp in the context of our ambition and aims 1, 2 and 3 mean achieving a balance between (a) the relevant Scope 1 and 2 emissions (for aim 1), Scope 3 emissions (for aim 2) or product lifecycle emissions (for aim 3) and (b) the aggregate of applicable deductions from qualifying activities such as sinks under our methodology at the applicable time.\n\n## Net zero \u00ab operations\n\nbp's aim to reach net zero operational greenhouse gas (CO2 and methane) emissions by 2050 or sooner, on a gross operational control basis, in accordance with bp's aim 1 which relates to our reported Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Any interim target or aim in respect of bp's aim 1 is defined in terms of absolute reductions relative to the baseline year of 2019.\n\n## Net zero \u00ab production\n\nbp's aim to reach net zero CO2 emissions, in accordance with bp's aim 2, from the carbon in our upstream oil and gas production, in respect of the estimated CO2 emissions from the combustion of upstream production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (based on bp's net share of production, excluding bp's share of Rosneft production and assuming that all produced volumes undergo full stoichiometric combustion to CO2). Aim 2 is bp's Scope 3 aim and relates to Scope 3 category 11 emissions. Any interim target or aim in respect of bp's aim 2 is defined in terms of absolute reductions relative to the baseline year of 2019.\n\n## Net zero \u00ab sales\n\nbp's aim to reach net zero for the carbon intensity of sold energy products \u00ab , in accordance with bp's aim 3. Any interim target or aim in respect of bp's aim 3 is defined in terms of reductions in the carbon intensity of the energy products we sell (in grams CO2e/MJ) relative to the baseline year of 2019.\n\n## Physically traded energy products\n\nFor the purposes of aim 3, this includes trades in energy products \u00ab which are physically settled, with the exception of, for example, financial trades and certain other transactions where the purpose or effect is that the volumes traded or supplied net off against each other.",

        "page_content": "## Sold energy products\n\nFor the purposes of aim 3, these represent the energy products \u00ab we sell to third parties including both marketed sales and physically traded energy products \u00ab . For these purposes bp group subsidiaries and equity accounted entities are not considered third parties, other than in our trading & shipping and customer & products businesses, where sales to equity accounted entities are considered third-party sales.\n\n## Sustainable emissions reductions (SER)\n\nSERs result from actions or interventions that have led to ongoing reductions in Scope 1 (direct) and/or Scope 2 (indirect) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (carbon dioxide and methane) such that GHG emissions would have been higher in the reporting year if the intervention had not taken place. SERs must meet three criteria: a specific intervention that has reduced GHG emissions, the reduction must be quantifiable and the reduction is expected to be ongoing. Reductions are reportable for a 12month period from the start of the intervention/action.\n\n## Adjusted EBIDA\n\nAdjusted EBIDA is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as profit or loss for the period, adjusting for finance costs and net finance (income) or expense relating to pensions and other post-retirement benefits and taxation, inventory holding gains or losses before tax, net adjusting items \u00ab before interest and tax, and taxation on an underlying RC basis, and adding back depreciation, depletion and amortization (pre-tax) and exploration expenditure written-off (net of adjusting items, pre-tax). bp believes that adjusted EBIDA is a useful measure for investors because it is a measure closely tracked by management to evaluate bp's operating performance and to make financial, strategic and operating decisions and because it may help investors to understand and evaluate, in the same manner as management, the underlying trends in bp's operational performance on a comparable basis, period on period. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is profit or loss for the period. A reconciliation of profit or loss for the period to adjusted EBIDA is provided on page 399.\n\n## Adjusted EBIDA per share compound annual growth rate (CAGR)\n\nNon-GAAP measure. Adjusted EBIDA per share is calculated based on the\n\nshares in issue at period end.\n\n## Adjusted EBITDA\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure presented for bp's operating segments and is defined as replacement cost (RC) profit before interest and tax, excluding net adjusting items before interest and tax, and adding back depreciation, depletion and amortization and exploration write-offs (net of adjusting items). Adjusted EBITDA by business is a further analysis of adjusted EBITDA for the customers & products businesses. bp believes it is helpful to disclose adjusted EBITDA by operating segment and by business because it reflects how the segments measure underlying business delivery. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis for the segment is RC profit or loss before interest and tax, which is bp's measure of profit or loss that is required to be disclosed for each operating segment under IFRS. A reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on pages 367 and 400.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the group is defined as profit or loss for the period, adjusting for finance costs and net finance (income) or expense relating to pensions and other post-retirement benefits and taxation, inventory holding gains or losses before tax, net adjusting items before interest and tax, and adding back depreciation, depletion and amortization (pre-tax) and exploration expenditure written-off (net of adjusting items, pre-tax). The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis for the group is profit or loss for the period. A reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 400.\n\nWe are unable to present reconciliations of forward-looking information for adjusted EBITDA for the group, strategic themes or transition growth engine, because without unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast accurately certain adjusting items required to calculate a meaningful comparable GAAP forward-looking financial measure. These items include inventory holding gains or losses, adjusting items and exploration expenditure written off that are difficult to predict in advance in order to include in a GAAP estimate.\n\n## Adjusted free cash flow\n\nAdjusted free cash flow, as applicable to the directors' remuneration performance measure, is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as Operating cash flow less: (1) net cash used in investing activities as presented in the group cash flow statement; and (2) lease liability payments included in financing activities and adjusting for other proceeds reported within financing activities in the group cash flow statement and movements in lease creditor.\n\n## Adjusting items\n\nAdjusting items are items that bp discloses separately because it considers such disclosures to be meaningful and relevant to investors. They are items that management considers to be important to period-on-period analysis of the group's results and are disclosed in order to enable investors to better understand and evaluate the group's reported financial performance. Adjusting items include gains and losses on the sale of businesses and fixed assets, impairments, environmental and other provisions, restructuring, integration and rationalization costs, fair value accounting effects, costs relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and other items. Adjusting items within equity-accounted earnings are reported net of incremental income tax reported by the equity-accounted entity. Adjusting items are used as a reconciling adjustment to derive underlying RC profit or loss and related underlying measures which are non-GAAP measures. An analysis of adjusting items by segment and type is shown on page 353.\n\n## Associate\n\nAn entity over which the group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor a joint arrangement of the group. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.\n\n## Biofuels production\n\nBiofuels production is average thousands of barrels of biofuel production per day during the period covered net to bp. This includes equivalent ethanol production, bp Bunge biopower for grid export, refining coprocessing and standalone hydrogenated vegetable oil (HVO).\n\n## Biogas supply volumes\n\nBiogas supply volumes is the average thousands of barrels of oil equivalent per day of production and offtakes during the period covered net to bp.\n\n## Bio-refinery\n\nA facility that is dedicated to processing biological materials (including waste oil and crop waste) to produce biofuels such as biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel, which may be blended to customer specifications with other components such as hydrocarbons at co-located or adjacent terminals and tanks.\n\n## Blue hydrogen\n\nHydrogen made from natural gas in combination with carbon captured and stored (CCS).\n\n## Capital employed\n\nNon-GAAP measure. It is defined as total equity plus finance debt.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nTotal cash capital expenditure as stated in the group cash flow statement. Capital expenditure for the operating segments and customers & products businesses is presented on the same basis.\n\n## Cash balance point\n\nCash balance point is defined as the implied Brent oil price 2021 real to balance bp's sources and uses of cash assuming an average bp refining marker margin around $11/bbl and Henry Hub at $3/mmBtu in 2021 real terms.\n\n## Commodity trading contracts\n\nbp participates in regional and global commodity trading markets in order to manage, transact and hedge the crude oil, refined products and natural gas that the group either produces or consumes in its manufacturing operations. The range of contracts the group enters into in its commodity trading operations is described below. Using these contracts, in combination with rights to access storage and transportation capacity, allows the group to access advantageous pricing differences between locations, time periods and grades.",

        "page_content": "## Exchange-traded commodity derivatives\n\nContracts that are typically in the form of futures and options traded on a recognized exchange, such as Nymex and ICE. Such contracts are traded in standard specifications for the main marker crude oils, such as Brent and West Texas Intermediate; the main product grades, such as gasoline and gasoil; and for natural gas and power. Gains and losses, otherwise referred to as variation margin, are generally settled on a daily basis with the relevant exchange. These contracts are used for the trading and risk management of crude oil, refined products, and natural gas and power. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on exchange-traded commodity derivatives are included in sales and other operating revenues for accounting purposes.\n\n## Over-the-counter (OTC) contracts\n\nContracts that are typically in the form of forwards, swaps and options. Some of these contracts are traded bilaterally between counterparties or through brokers, others may be cleared by a central clearing counterparty. These contracts can be used both for trading and risk management activities. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on OTC contracts are included in sales and other operating revenues for accounting purposes. Many grades of crude oil bought and sold use standard contracts including US domestic light sweet crude oil, commonly referred to as West Texas Intermediate, and a standard North Sea crude blend - Brent, Forties, Oseberg and Ekofisk (BFOE). Forward contracts are used in connection with the purchase of crude oil supplies for refineries and for marketing and sales of the group's oil production and refined products. The contracts typically contain standard delivery and settlement terms. These transactions call for physical delivery of oil with consequent operational and price risk. However, various means exist and are used from time to time, to settle obligations under the contracts in cash rather than through physical delivery. Physically settled BFOE contracts delivered by cargo additionally specify a standard volume and tolerance.\n\nGas and power OTC markets are highly developed in North America and the UK, where commodities can be bought and sold for delivery in future periods. These contracts are negotiated between two parties to purchase and sell gas and power at a specified price, with delivery and settlement at a future date. Typically, the contracts specify delivery terms for the underlying commodity. Some of these transactions are not settled physically as they can be net settled by transacting offsetting sale or purchase contracts for the same location and delivery period. The contracts contain standard terms such as delivery point, pricing mechanism, settlement terms and specification of the commodity. Typically, volume, price and term (e.g. daily, monthly and balance of month) are the main variable contract terms.\n\nSwaps are typically contractual obligations to exchange cash flows between two parties. A typical swap transaction usually references a floating price and a fixed price with the net difference of the cash flows being settled. Options give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell crude, oil products, natural gas or power at a specified price on or before a specific future date. Amounts under these derivative financial instruments are settled at expiry. Typically, netting agreements are used to limit credit exposure and support liquidity.\n\n## Spot and term contracts\n\nSpot contracts are contracts to purchase or sell a commodity at the market price prevailing on or around the delivery date when title to the inventory is taken. Term contracts are contracts to purchase or sell a commodity at regular intervals over an agreed term. Though spot and term contracts may have a standard form, there is no offsetting mechanism in place. As such, these transactions result in physical delivery with operational and price risk. Spot and term contracts typically relate to purchases of crude for a refinery, products for marketing, or third-party natural gas, or sales of the group's oil production, oil products or gas production to third parties. For accounting purposes, spot and term sales are included in sales and other operating revenues when title passes. Similarly, spot and term purchases are included in purchases for accounting purposes.\n\n## Consolidation adjustment - UPII\n\nUnrealized profit in inventory arising on inter-segment transactions.\n\n## Convenience gross margin\n\nNon-GAAP measure. Convenience gross margin is calculated as RC profit before interest and tax for the customers & products segment, excluding\n\nRC profit before interest and tax for the refining & trading and petrochemicals businesses, and adjusting items \u00ab (as defined above) for the convenience & mobility business to derive underlying RC profit before interest and tax for the convenience & mobility business; subtracting underlying RC profit before interest and tax for the Castrol business; adding back depreciation, depletion and amortization, production and manufacturing, distribution and administration expenses for convenience & mobility (excluding Castrol); subtracting earnings from equity-accounted entities in the convenience & mobility business (excluding Castrol) and gross margin for the retail fuels, EV charging, aviation, B2B and midstream businesses. bp believes it is helpful to disclose the convenience gross margin because this measure may help investors to understand and evaluate, in the same way as management, our progress against our strategic objectives of convenience growth. The nearest GAAP measure is RC profit before interest and tax for the customers & products segment.A reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 367.\n\n## Convenience gross margin growth\n\nNon-GAAP measure. See convenience gross margin definition above. Convenience gross margin growth in 2022 is compared to 2021 which has been restated for 2022 year-end foreign exchange.\n\n## Cumulative cash costs reductions\n\nNon-GAAP measure. Cash costs is defined as production and manufacturing expenses plus distribution and administration expenses and excludes costs that are classified as adjusting items and costs that are variable, primarily with volumes (such as freight costs). It also includes exploration geological and geophysical costs, which are included in the exploration expenses line in the group income statement. Cumulative cash cost reductions by the end of 2022 compared to 2019 baseline, as applicable to the directors' remuneration performance measure, are defined as reinvent headcount savings, restructuring, location, agile, operational and other savings, less agreed portfolio changes and costs in direct support of growth.\n\n## Customer touchpoints\n\nCustomer touchpoints are the number of retail customer transactions per day on bp forecourts globally. These include transactions involving fuel and/or convenience across all channels of trade.\n\n## Developed renewables to final investment decision (FID)\n\nTotal generating capacity for assets developed to FID by all entities where bp has an equity share (proportionate to equity share). If asset is subsequently sold bp will continue to record capacity as developed to FID. If bp equity share increases developed capacity to FID will increase proportionately to share increase for any assets where bp held equity at the point of FID.\n\n## Divestment proceeds\n\nDisposal proceeds as per the group cash flow statement.\n\n## Dividend yield\n\nSum of the four quarterly dividends announced in respect of the year as a percentage of the year-end share price.\n\n## Dutch Title Transfer Facility\n\nThe TTF (Title Transfer Facility) is the virtual trading point for natural gas in the Netherlands. It is commonly used as a benchmark hub for gas prices in Europe.\n\n## Effective tax rate (ETR) on replacement cost (RC) profit or loss\n\nNon-GAAP measure. The ETR on RC profit or loss is calculated by dividing taxation on a RC basis by RC profit or loss before tax. Taxation on a RC basis for the group is calculated as taxation as stated on the group income statement adjusted for taxation on inventory holding gains and losses. Information on RC profit or loss is provided below. bp believes it is helpful to disclose the ETR on RC profit or loss because this measure excludes the impact of price changes on the replacement of inventories and allows for more meaningful comparisons between reporting periods. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is the ETR on profit or loss for the period. A reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 398.\n\n## Electric vehicle charge points / EV charge points\n\nDefined as the number of connectors on a charging device, operated by either bp or a bp joint venture.",

        "page_content": "## Fair value accounting effects\n\nNon-GAAP adjustments to our IFRS profit (loss). They reflect the difference between the way bp manages the economic exposure and internally measures performance of certain activities and the way those activities are measured under IFRS. Fair value accounting effects are included within adjusting items. They relate to certain of the group's commodity, interest rate and currency risk exposures as detailed below. Other than as noted below, the fair value accounting effects described are reported in both the gas & low carbon energy and customer & products segments.\n\nbp uses derivative instruments to manage the economic exposure relating to inventories above normal operating requirements of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products. Under IFRS, these inventories are recorded at historical cost. The related derivative instruments, however, are required to be recorded at fair value with gains and losses recognized in the income statement. This is because hedge accounting is either not permitted or not followed, principally due to the impracticality of effectiveness-testing requirements. Therefore, measurement differences in relation to recognition of gains and losses occur. Gains and losses on these inventories, other than net realizable value provisions, are not recognized until the commodity is sold in a subsequent accounting period. Gains and losses on the related derivative commodity contracts are recognized in the income statement, from the time the derivative commodity contract is entered into, on a fair value basis using forward prices consistent with the contract maturity.\n\nbp enters into physical commodity contracts to meet certain business requirements, such as the purchase of crude for a refinery or the sale of bp's gas production. Under IFRS these physical contracts are treated as derivatives and are required to be fair valued when they are managed as part of a larger portfolio of similar transactions. Gains and losses arising are recognized in the income statement from the time the derivative commodity contract is entered into.\n\nIFRS require that inventory held for trading is recorded at its fair value using period-end spot prices, whereas any related derivative commodity instruments are required to be recorded at values based on forward prices consistent with the contract maturity. Depending on market conditions, these forward prices can be either higher or lower than spot prices, resulting in measurement differences.\n\nbp enters into contracts for pipelines and other transportation, storage capacity, oil and gas processing, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and certain gas and power contracts that, under IFRS, are recorded on an accruals basis. These contracts are risk-managed using a variety of derivative instruments that are fair valued under IFRS. This results in measurement differences in relation to recognition of gains and losses.\n\nThe way that bp manages the economic exposures described above, and measures performance internally, differs from the way these activities are measured under IFRS. bp calculates this difference for consolidated entities by comparing the IFRS result with management's internal measure of performance. We believe that disclosing management's estimate of this difference provides useful information for investors because it enables investors to see the economic effect of these activities as a whole.\n\nThese include:\n\n- \u00b7 Under management's internal measure of performance the inventory, transportation and capacity contracts in question are valued based on fair value using relevant forward prices prevailing at the end of the period.\n- \u00b7 Fair value accounting effects also include changes in the fair value of the near-term portions of LNG contracts that fall within bp's risk management framework. LNG contracts are not considered derivatives, because there is insufficient market liquidity, and they are therefore accrual accounted under IFRS. However, oil and natural gas derivative financial instruments used to risk manage the near-term portions of the LNG contracts are fair valued under IFRS. The fair value accounting effect, which is reported in the gas & low carbon energy segment, represents the change in value of LNG contacts that are being risk managed and which is reflected in the underlying result, but not in reported earnings. Management believes that this gives a better representation of performance in each period.\n\nFurthermore, the fair values of derivative instruments used to risk manage certain other oil, gas, power and other contracts, are deferred to match with\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00ab\n\nthe underlying exposure. The commodity contracts for business requirements are accounted for on an accruals basis.\n\nIn addition, fair value accounting effects include changes in the fair value of derivatives entered into by the group to manage currency exposure and interest rate risks relating to hybrid bonds to their respective first call periods. The hybrid bonds which were issued on 17 June 2020 are classified as equity instruments and were recorded in the balance sheet at that date at their USD equivalent issued value. Under IFRS these equity instruments are not remeasured from period to period, and do not qualify for application of hedge accounting. The derivative instruments relating to the hybrid bonds, however, are required to be recorded at fair value with mark-to-market gains and losses recognized in the income statement. Therefore, measurement differences in relation to the recognition of gains and losses occur. The fair value accounting effect, which is reported in the other businesses & corporate segment, eliminates the fair value gains and losses of these derivative financial instruments that are recognized in the income statement. We believe that this gives a better representation of performance, by more appropriately reflecting the economic effect of these risk management activities, in each period.\n\n## Finance debt ratio\n\nFinance debt ratio is defined as the ratio of finance debt to the total of finance debt plus total equity.\n\n## Gearing and net debt\n\nNon-GAAP measures. Net debt is calculated as finance debt, as shown in the balance sheet, plus the fair value of associated derivative financial instruments that are used to hedge foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks relating to finance debt, for which hedge accounting is applied, less cash and cash equivalents. Net debt does not include accrued interest, which is reported within other receivables and other payables on the balance sheet and for which the associated cash flows are presented as operating cash flows in the group cash flow statement. Gearing is defined as the ratio of net debt to the total of net debt plus total equity. bp believes these measures provide useful information to investors. Net debt enables investors to see the economic effect of finance debt, related hedges and cash and cash equivalents in total. Gearing enables investors to see how significant net debt is relative to total equity. The derivatives are reported on the balance sheet within the headings 'Derivative financial instruments'. See Financial statements - Note 27 for information on finance debt, which is the nearest equivalent measure to net debt on an IFRS basis. The nearest equivalent GAAP measure to gearing on an IFRS basis is finance debt ratio.\n\nWe are unable to present reconciliations of forward-looking information for net debt or gearing to finance debt and total equity, because without unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast accurately certain adjusting items required to present a meaningful comparable GAAP forward-looking financial measure. These items include fair value asset (liability) of hedges related to finance debt and cash and cash equivalents, that are difficult to predict in advance in order to include in a GAAP estimate.\n\n## Gearing including leases and net debt including leases\n\nNon-GAAP measures. Net debt including leases is calculated as net debt plus lease liabilities, less the net amount of partner receivables and payables relating to leases entered into on behalf of joint operations. Gearing including leases is defined as the ratio of net debt including leases to the total of net debt including leases plus total equity. bp believes these measures provide useful information to investors as they enable investors to understand the impact of the group's lease portfolio on net debt and gearing. See Financial statements - Note 27 for information on finance debt, which is the nearest equivalent measure to net debt including leases on an IFRS basis. The nearest equivalent GAAP measure to gearing including leases on an IFRS basis is finance debt ratio. A reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 355.\n\n## Green hydrogen\n\nHydrogen produced by electrolysis of water using renewable power.\n\n## Grey hydrogen\n\nProduced via natural gas or coal without CCUS.\n\n## Hydrocarbons\n\nLiquids and natural gas. Natural gas is converted to oil equivalent at 5.8 billion cubic feet = 1 million barrels.",

        "page_content": "## Inorganic capital expenditure\n\nA subset of capital expenditure on a cash basis and a non-GAAP measure. Inorganic capital expenditure comprises consideration in business combinations and certain other significant investments made by the group. It is reported on a cash basis. bp believes that this measure provides useful information as it allows investors to understand how bp's management invests funds in projects which expand the group's activities through acquisition. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is capital expenditure on a cash basis. Further information and a reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 352.\n\n## Installed renewables capacity\n\nInstalled renewables capacity is bp's share of capacity for operating assets owned by entities where bp has an equity share.\n\n## Inventory holding gains and losses\n\nInventory holding gains and losses are non-GAAP adjustments to our IFRS profit (loss) and represent:\n\n- a the difference between the cost of sales calculated using the replacement cost of inventory and the cost of sales calculated on the first-in first-out (FIFO) method after adjusting for any changes in provisions where the net realizable value of the inventory is lower than its cost. Under the FIFO method, which we use for IFRS reporting of inventories other than for trading inventories, the cost of inventory charged to the income statement is based on its historical cost of purchase or manufacture, rather than its replacement cost. In volatile energy markets, this can have a significant distorting effect on reported income. The amounts disclosed as inventory holding gains and losses represent the difference between the charge to the income statement for inventory on a FIFO basis (after adjusting for any related movements in net realizable value provisions) and the charge that would have arisen based on the replacement cost of inventory. For this purpose, the replacement cost of inventory is calculated using data from each operation's production and manufacturing system, either on a monthly basis, or separately for each transaction where the system allows this approach; and\n- b an adjustment relating to certain trading inventories that are not price risk managed which relate to a minimum inventory volume that is required to be held to maintain underlying business activities. This adjustment represents the movement in fair value of the inventories due to prices, on a grade-by-grade basis, during the period. This is calculated from each operation's inventory management system on a monthly basis using the discrete monthly movement in market prices for these inventories.\n\nThe amounts disclosed are not separately reflected in the financial statements as a gain or loss. No adjustment is made in respect of the cost of inventories held as part of a trading position and certain other temporary inventory positions that are price risk-managed. See Replacement cost (RC) profit or loss definition below.\n\n## Joint arrangement\n\nAn arrangement in which two or more parties have joint control.\n\n## Joint control\n\nContractually agreed sharing of control over an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\n## Joint operation\n\nA joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement.\n\n## Joint venture\n\nA joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.\n\n## Liquids\n\nComprises crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids. For the oil production & operations segment, it also includes bitumen.\n\n## LNG portfolio\n\nLNG portfolio refers to bp group's LNG equity production plus additional long-term merchant LNG volumes.\n\n## LNG train\n\nAn LNG train is a processing facility used to liquefy and purify natural gas in the formation of LNG.\n\n## Low carbon activity\n\nAn activity relating to low carbon including: renewable electricity; bioenergy; electric vehicles and other future mobility solutions; trading and marketing low carbon products; blue or green hydrogen \u00ab and carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS).\n\nNote that, while there is some overlap of activities, these terms do not mean the same as bp's strategic focus area of low carbon energy or our low carbon energy sub-segment, reported within the gas & low carbon energy segment.\n\n## Low carbon activity investment\n\nCapital investment in relation to low carbon activity \u00ab .\n\n## Major projects\n\nHave a bp net investment of at least $250 million, or are considered to be of strategic importance to bp or of a high degree of complexity.\n\n## Margin share from convenience and electrification\n\nConvenience, retail fuels and electrification gross margin, as applicable to the directors' remuneration performance measure, is calculated as RC profit before interest and tax for the customers & products segment, excluding RC profit before interest and tax for the refining & trading and petrochemicals businesses, and adjusting items \u00ab (as defined above) for the convenience & mobility business to derive underlying RC profit before interest and tax for the convenience & mobility business; subtracting underlying RC profit before interest and tax for the Castrol business; adding back depreciation, depletion and amortization, production and manufacturing, distribution and administration expenses for convenience & mobility (excluding Castrol); subtracting earnings from equity-accounted entities in the convenience & mobility business (excluding Castrol) and gross margin for aviation, B2B and midstream businesses. Margin share from convenience and electrification is the ratio of convenience and electrification gross margin to total gross margin for convenience, retail fuels and electrification.\n\n## Operating cash flow\n\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities as stated in the group cash flow statement. When used in the context of a segment rather than the group, the terms refer to the segment's share thereof.\n\n## Operating management system (OMS)\n\nbp's OMS helps us manage risks in our operating activities by setting out bp's principles for good operating practice. It brings together bp requirements on health, safety, security, the environment, social responsibility and operational reliability, as well as related issues, such as maintenance, contractor relations and organizational learning, into a common management system.\n\n## Organic capital expenditure\n\nNon-GAAP measure. Organic capital expenditure comprises capital expenditure on a cash basis less inorganic capital expenditure. bp believes that this measure provides useful information as it allows investors to understand how bp's management invests funds in developing and maintaining the group's assets. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is capital expenditure on a cash basis. An analysis of organic capital expenditure by segment and region, and a reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 352.\n\nWe are unable to present reconciliations of forward-looking information for organic capital expenditure to total cash capital expenditure, because without unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast accurately the adjusting item, inorganic capital expenditure, that is difficult to predict in advance in order to derive the nearest GAAP estimate.\n\n## Production-sharing agreement / contract (PSA / PSC)\n\nAn arrangement through which an oil and gas company bears the risks and costs of exploration, development and production.

Revenue generating hydrocarbon production reflects the bp share of production as adjusted for any production which does not generate revenue. Adjustments may include losses due to shrinkage, amounts consumed during processing, and contractual or regulatory host committed volumes such as royalties. For the gas & low carbon energy and oil production & operations segments, realizations include transfers between businesses.\n\n## Refining availability\n\nRepresents Solomon Associates' operational availability for bp-operated refineries, which is defined as the percentage of the year that a unit is available for processing after subtracting the annualized time lost due to turnaround activity and all planned mechanical, process and regulatory downtime.\n\n## Refining marker margin (RMM)\n\nThe average of regional indicator margins weighted for bp's crude refining capacity in each region. Each regional marker margin is based on product yields and a marker crude oil deemed appropriate for the region. The regional indicator margins may not be representative of the margins achieved by bp in any period because of bp's particular refinery configurations and crude and product slate.\n\n## Replacement cost (RC) profit or loss / RC profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders\n\nReflects the replacement cost of inventories sold in the period and is calculated as profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders, adjusting for inventory holding gains and losses (net of tax). RC profit or loss for the group is not a recognized GAAP measure. bp believes this measure is useful to illustrate to investors the fact that crude oil and product prices can vary significantly from period to period and that the impact on our reported result under IFRS can be significant. Inventory holding gains and losses vary from period to period due to changes in prices as well as changes in underlying inventory levels. In order for investors to understand the operating performance of the group excluding the impact of price changes on the replacement of inventories, and to make comparisons of operating performance between reporting periods, bp's management believes it is helpful to disclose this measure. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders. See Financial statements - Note 5. A reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 398.\n\n## Renewables pipeline\n\nRenewable projects satisfying the criteria below until the point they can be considered developed to FID:\n\nSite based projects that have obtained land exclusivity rights, or for PPA based projects an offer has been made to the counterparty, or for auction projects pre-qualification criteria has been met, or for acquisition projects post a binding offer has been accepted.\n\n## Reserves replacement ratio\n\nThe extent to which the year's production has been replaced by proved reserves added to our reserve base. The ratio is expressed in oil-equivalent terms and includes changes resulting from discoveries, improved recovery and extensions and revisions to previous estimates, but excludes changes resulting from acquisitions and disposals.\n\n## Retail sites\n\nRetail sites include sites operated by dealers, jobbers, franchisees or brand licensees or joint venture (JV) partners, under the bp brand. These may move to and from the bp brand as their fuel supply agreement or brand licence agreement expires and are renegotiated in the normal course of business. Retail sites are primarily branded bp , ARCO, Amoco , Aral and Thorntons , and also includes sites in India through our Jio-bp JV.\n\n## Return on average capital employed\n\nNon-GAAP measure. Return on average capital employed (ROACE) is defined as underlying replacement cost profit, which is defined as profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders adjusted for inventory holding gains and losses, adjusting items and related taxation on inventory holding gains and losses and adjusting items total taxation, after adding back noncontrolling interest and interest expense net of tax, divided by the average of the beginning and ending balances of total equity plus finance debt, excluding cash and cash equivalents and goodwill as presented on the group balance sheet over the periods presented.  Interest expense before tax is finance costs as presented on the group income statement, excluding lease interest, the unwinding of the discount on provisions and other payables and other adjusting items reported in finance costs. bp believes it is helpful to disclose the ROACE because this measure gives an indication of the company's capital efficiency. The nearest GAAP measures of the numerator and denominator are profit or loss for the period attributable to bp shareholders and total equity respectively. The reconciliation of the numerator and denominator is provided on page 399.\n\nWe are unable to present forward-looking information of the nearest GAAP measures of the numerator and denominator for ROACE, because without unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast accurately certain adjusting items required to calculate a meaningful comparable GAAP forward-looking financial measure. These items include inventory holding gains or losses and interest net of tax, that are difficult to predict in advance in order to include in a GAAP estimate.\n\n## Strategic convenience sites\n\nStrategic convenience sites are retail sites, within the bp portfolio, which sell bp-branded vehicle energy (e.g. bp , Aral , ARCO, Amoco , Thorntons and Pulse) and either carry one of the strategic convenience brands (e.g. M&S, REWE to Go) or a differentiated convenience offer. To be considered a strategic convenience site, the convenience offer should have a demonstrable level of differentiation in the market in which it operates. Strategic convenience site count includes sites under a pilot phase.\n\n## Subsidiary\n\nAn entity that is controlled by the bp group. Control of an investee exists when an investor is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.\n\n## Surplus cash flow\n\nSurplus cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. It is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net cash provided by operating activities, reported in accordance with IFRS. The surplus cash flow forms part of bp's financial frame.\n\nSurplus cash flow refers to the net surplus of sources of cash over uses of cash, after reaching the $35 billion net debt target. Sources of cash include net cash provided by operating activities, cash provided from investing activities and cash receipts relating to transactions involving noncontrolling interests. Uses of cash include lease liability payments, payments on perpetual hybrid bond, dividends paid, cash capital expenditure, the cash cost of share buybacks to offset the dilution from vesting of awards under employee share schemes, cash payments relating to transactions involving non-controlling interests and currency translation differences relating to cash and cash equivalents as presented on the condensed group cash flow statement.\n\nFor 2022, the sources of cash includes other proceeds related to the proceeds from the disposal of a loan note related to the Alaska divestment. The cash was received in the fourth quarter 2021, was reported as a financing cash flow and was not included in other proceeds at the time due to potential recourse from the counterparty. The proceeds are being recognized as the potential recourse reduces.",

In return, the oil and gas company receives entitlement to variable physical volumes of hydrocarbons, representing recovery of the costs incurred and a profit margin which reflects incremental production added to the oilfield.\n\n## Tier 1 and tier 2 process safety events\n\nTier 1 events are losses of primary containment from a process of greatest consequence - causing harm to a member of the workforce, damage to equipment from a fire or explosion, a community impact or exceeding defined quantities. Tier 2 events are those of lesser consequence. These represent reported incidents occurring within bp's operational HSSE reporting boundary. That boundary includes bp's own operated facilities and certain other locations or situations.\n\n## Tight oil and gas\n\nNatural oil and gas reservoirs locked in hard sandstone rocks with low permeability, making the underground formation extremely tight.\n\n## Transition growth\n\nActivities, represented by a set of transition growth engines, that transition bp toward its objective to be an Integrated Energy Company, and that comprise our low carbon activity \u00ab alongside other businesses that support transition, such as our power trading & marketing business and convenience.\n\n## Transition growth investment\n\nCapital investment in relation to Transition growth \u00ab , that is aligned to our aim 5 (to increase the proportion of investment we make into our non-oil and -gas businesses. For this purpose, we define 'oil and gas' activities as those primarily encompassing the production, refining and sale of fossil hydrocarbons and their products and those associated with the dedicated gas and oil trading businesses).\n\n## UK National Balancing Point\n\nA virtual trading location for sale, purchase and exchange of UK natural gas. It is the pricing and delivery point for the Intercontinental Exchange natural gas futures contract.\n\n## Ultra fast / Ultra-fast charging\n\nElectric vehicle charging of greater than or equal to 150kW.\n\n## Unconventionals\n\nResources found in geographic accumulations over a large area, that usually present additional challenges to development such as low permeability or high viscosity. Examples include shale gas and oil, coalbed methane, gas hydrates and natural bitumen deposits. These typically require specialized extraction technology such as hydraulic fracturing or steam injection.\n\n## Underlying effective tax rate (ETR)\n\nNon-GAAP measure. The underlying ETR is calculated by dividing taxation on an underlying replacement cost (RC) basis by underlying RC profit or loss before tax. Taxation on an underlying RC basis for the group is calculated as taxation as stated on the group income statement adjusted for taxation on inventory holding gains and losses and adjusting items total taxation. Information on underlying RC profit or loss is provided below. Taxation on an underlying RC basis presented for the operating segments is calculated through an allocation of taxation on an underlying RC basis to each segment. bp believes it is helpful to disclose the underlying ETR because this measure may help investors to understand and evaluate, in the same manner as management, the underlying trends in bp's operational performance on a comparable basis, period on period. Taxation on an underlying RC basis and underlying ETR are non-GAAP measures. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is the ETR on profit or loss for the period.\n\nWe are unable to present reconciliations of forward-looking information for underlying ETR to ETR on profit or loss for the period, because without unreasonable efforts, we are unable to forecast accurately certain adjusting items required to present a meaningful comparable GAAP forward-looking\n\nfinancial measure. These items include the taxation on inventory holding gains and losses and adjusting items, that are difficult to predict in advance in order to include in a GAAP estimate. A reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 398.\n\n## Underlying production\n\nProduction after adjusting for acquisitions and divestments and entitlement impacts in our production-sharing agreements (PSAs). 2022 underlying production, when compared with 2021, is production after adjusting for acquisitions and divestments, curtailments, and entitlement impacts in our production-sharing agreements/contracts and technical service contract.\n\n## Underlying replacement cost (RC) profit or loss / underlying RC profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders\n\nNon-GAAP measure. RC profit or loss \u00ab (as defined above) after excluding net adjusting items and related taxation. See page 353 for additional information on the adjusting items that are used to arrive at underlying RC profit or loss in order to enable a full understanding of the items and their financial impact. Underlying RC profit or loss before interest and tax for the operating segments or customers & products businesses is calculated as RC profit or loss (as defined above) including profit or loss attributable to non-controlling interests before interest and tax for the operating segments and excluding net adjusting items for the respective operating segment or business.\n\nbp believes that underlying RC profit or loss is a useful measure for investors because it is a measure closely tracked by management to evaluate bp's operating performance and to make financial, strategic and operating decisions and because it may help investors to understand and evaluate, in the same manner as management, the underlying trends in bp's operational performance on a comparable basis, period on period, by adjusting for the effects of these adjusting items. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis for the group is profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis for segments and businesses is RC profit or loss before interest and taxation. A reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 398 for the group and pages 36-44 for the segments.\n\n## Underlying RC profit or loss per share and underlying RC profit or loss per ADS\n\nNon-GAAP measures. Earnings per share is defined in Note 11. Underlying RC profit or loss per ordinary share is calculated using the same denominator as earnings per share as defined in the consolidated financial statements. The numerator used is underlying RC profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders rather than profit or loss attributable to bp shareholders. Underlying RC profit or loss per ADS is calculated as outlined above for underlying RC profit or loss per share except the denominator is adjusted to reflect one ADS equivalent to six ordinary shares. bp believes it is helpful to disclose the underlying RC profit or loss per ordinary share and per ADS because these measures may help investors to understand and evaluate, in the same manner as management, the underlying trends in bp's operational performance on a comparable basis, period on period. The nearest equivalent measure on an IFRS basis is basic earnings per share based on profit or loss for the period attributable to bp shareholders. A reconciliation to GAAP information is provided on page 398.\n\n## upstream\n\nupstream includes oil and natural gas field development and production within the gas & low carbon energy and oil production & operations segments. References to upstream exclude Rosneft.\n\n## upstream / hydrocarbon plant reliability\n\nbp-operated upstream plant reliability is calculated taking 100% less the ratio of total unplanned plant deferrals divided by installed production capacity, excluding non-operated assets and bpx energy. Unplanned plant deferrals are associated with the topside plant and where applicable the subsea equipment (excluding wells and reservoir). Unplanned plant deferrals include breakdowns, which does not include Gulf of Mexico weather-related downtime.\n\n## upstream unit production costs\n\nupstream unit production costs are calculated as production costs divided by units of production.
