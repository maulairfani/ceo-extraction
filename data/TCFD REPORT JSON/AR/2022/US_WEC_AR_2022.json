Our employees recorded their safest year since the company doubled its size through a major acquisition in 2015. We delivered record net income and earnings per share. And we exceeded our forecast.\n\nIn November, we updated our ESG Progress Plan the largest five-year investment plan in our history - totaling $20.1 billion for efficiency, sustainability and growth. We expect the plan to drive earnings growth of 6.5 to 7 percent a year from 2023 through 2027.\n\nA key part of the plan is a major commitment to renewable generation projects in both our regulated business and our infrastructure segment.\n\n## Gale Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\n## Scott Lauber\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n\n## Given the strong earnings growth and cash flow, what is your dividend outlook?\n\nGale: At its January meeting, our board of directors raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7.2 percent to a new annual rate of $3.12 per share. This marks the 20th consecutive year that our company will reward shareholders with higher dividends. We expect this dividend increase to rank in the top decile of our industry.\n\nWe continue to target a payout ratio of 65 to 70 percent of earnings. We're in the middle of the range now, so we expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in earnings per share.\n\n## What are you doing to assure reliability and strengthen your energy infrastructure?\n\nScott: We're dedicating significant resources in our capital investment plan to strengthen the reliability of our networks. Between 2023 and 2027, we expect to invest $3.6 billion to address aging electric infrastructure and further our system hardening. We also are continuing to upgrade our natural gas infrastructure. In Chicago, work continues on our long-term Safety Modernization Program, which is replacing old, corroding iron pipes with safe, state-of-the-art materials.\n\nIn addition to infrastructure upgrades, we have planned investments to meet the energy needs of our customers - particularly at times of peak energy demand. For example, construction is underway on two liquefied natural gas storage facilities to provide additional gas supply in Wisconsin - on track to go into service later this year and in 2024.",

        "page_content": "## Where do you see growth in the WEC Infrastructure segment?\n\nScott: A key part of our capital plan is investing in renewable projects outside of our traditional footprint projects that have long-term contracts with creditworthy customers such as Microsoft, Google and Verizon.\n\nJust last month, we announced that our infrastructure group will acquire an 80 percent ownership interest in phase one of the Samson Solar Energy Center in northeast Texas. Samson I has a capacity of 250 megawatts. It entered commercial service in May 2022 and has a long-term power purchase agreement with AT&T. Pending regulatory approval, we plan to invest approximately $250 million early in 2023.\n\n## With the evolution of the energy industry, what role are you playing in technology development?\n\nGale: We're active in exploring promising technologies that may help shape the future of clean energy. In February, we announced an important pilot project to test a new form of long-duration energy storage. This experiment will take place at our Valley Power Plant in Milwaukee. We're collaborating with EPRI, an independent energy research and development institute, and CMBlu Energy, the developer and manufacturer of the long-duration battery based in California and Germany.\n\nThis 1- to 2-megawatt-hour pilot project will be one of the first of its kind on the U.S. electric grid. The project will test the performance of the battery system, including discharge durations of five to 10 hours - up to twice as long as the typical batteries in use today.\n\nScott: And I'm pleased to share with you that the hydrogen pilot we outlined for you last year was completed successfully. Hydrogen and natural gas were tested in blends of up to 25/75 percent to power a reciprocating combustion engine - a modern generating unit that serves customers in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The results of this project are a strong indicator that this technology - which produces energy on demand - could run efficiently on very low- and no-carbon fuels.\n\nEPRI will share a complete analysis of both projects with interested parties across the energy industry.\n\n## Given the economic uncertainty we have seen in the past year, how well is WEC Energy Group positioned for a potential recession?\n\nGale: First, I would say that our management team has a strong track record of managing through the ups and downs of economic cycles. Our focus is on the fundamentals. On execution. On financial discipline. In addition, the economy in our region is remarkably diverse. These factors position us well for uncertain times.\n\nAs we move forward, we remain committed to a mission that matters - strengthening the fabric of the communities we serve, leading by example, and delivering affordable, reliable and clean energy to the millions of customers who depend on us every day.\n\nThank you for your confidence, your support and your investment in WEC Energy Group.\n\nSincerely,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGale E.

        "page_content": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## CORPORATE DEVELOPMENTS\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nWe are a diversified holding company with natural gas and electric utility operations (serving customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota), an approximately 60% equity ownership interest in American Transmission Company LLC (ATC) (a for-profit electric transmission company regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and certain state regulatory commissions), and nonutility energy infrastructure operations through W.E. Power LLC (which owns generation assets in Wisconsin), Bluewater Natural Gas Holding LLC (which owns underground natural gas storage facilities in Michigan), and WEC Infrastructure LLC (WECI), which holds ownership interests in several renewable generating facilities.\n\n## CORPORATE STRATEGY\n\nOur goal is to continue to build and sustain long-term value for our shareholders and customers by focusing on the fundamentals of our business: environmental stewardship; reliability; operating efficiency; financial discipline; exceptional customer care; and safety. Our capital investment plan for efficiency, sustainability and growth, referred to as our ESG Progress Plan, provides a roadmap for us to achieve this goal. It is an aggressive plan to cut emissions, maintain superior reliability, deliver significant savings for customers, and grow our investment in the future of energy.\n\nThroughout our strategic planning process, we take into account important developments, risks and opportunities, including new technologies, customer preferences and affordability, energy resiliency efforts, and sustainability. We published the results of a priority sustainability issue assessment in 2020, identifying the issues that are most important to our company and its stakeholders over the short and long terms. Our risk and priority assessments have formed our direction as a company.\n\n## Creating a Sustainable Future\n\nOur ESG Progress Plan includes the retirement of older, fossil-fueled generation, to be replaced with zero-carbon-emitting renewables and clean natural gas-fired generation. When taken together, the retirements and new investments should better balance our supply with our demand, while maintaining reliable, affordable energy for our customers. The retirements will contribute to meeting our goals to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from our electric generation.\n\nIn May 2021, we announced goals to achieve reductions in carbon emissions from our electric generation fleet by 60% by the end of 2025 and by 80% by the end of 2030, both from a 2005 baseline. We expect to achieve these goals by making operating refinements, retiring less efficient generating units, and executing our capital plan. Over the longer term, the target for our generation fleet is net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050.\n\nAs part of our path toward these goals, we are exploring co-firing with natural gas at our ERGS coal-fired units. By the end of 2030, we expect to use coal as a backup fuel only, and we believe we will be in a position to eliminate coal as an energy source by the end of 2035.\n\nWe already have retired more than 1,800 megawatts (MW) of coal-fired generation since the beginning of 2018, which included the 2019 retirement of the Presque Isle power plant as well as the 2018 retirements of the Pleasant Prairie power plant, the Pulliam power plant, and the jointly-owned Edgewater Unit 4 generating units. See Note 6, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, for more information related to these power plant retirements. Through our ESG Progress Plan, we expect to retire approximately 1,600 MW of additional fossil-fueled generation by the end of 2026, which includes the planned retirement in 2024-2025 of Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5-8 and the planned retirement in 2026 of jointly-owned Columbia Units 1-2. See Note 7, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information related to these planned power plant retirements.\n\nIn addition to retiring these older, fossil-fueled plants, we expect to invest approximately $5.4 billion from 2023-2027 in regulated renewable energy in Wisconsin. Our plan is to replace a portion of the retired capacity by building and owning zero-carbon-emitting renewable generation facilities that are anticipated to include the following new investments:\n\n- \u00b7 1,900 MW of utility-scale solar;\n- \u00b7 700 MW of battery storage; and\n- \u00b7 700 MW of wind.",

        "page_content": "We also plan on investing in a combination of clean, natural gas-fired generation, including:\n\n- \u00b7 100 MW of reciprocating internal combustion engine (RICE) natural gas-fueled generation; and\n- \u00b7 the planned purchase of up to 200 MW of capacity in the West Riverside Energy Center - a combined cycle natural gas plant recently completed by Alliant Energy in Wisconsin.\n\nFor more details, see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Requirements - Significant Capital Projects.\n\nIn December 2018, WE received approval from the PSCW for two renewable energy pilot programs. The Solar Now pilot is expected to add a total of 35 MW of solar generation to WE's portfolio, allowing non-profit and governmental entities, as well as commercial and industrial customers, to site utility owned solar arrays on their property. Under this program, WE has energized 24 Solar Now projects and currently has another five under construction, together totaling more than 30 MW. The second program, the Dedicated Renewable Energy Resource (DRER) pilot, would allow large commercial and industrial customers to access renewable resources that WE would operate, adding up to 150 MW of renewables to WE's portfolio. The DRER pilot would help these larger customers meet their sustainability and renewable energy goals.\n\nIn August 2021, the PSCW approved pilot programs for WE and WPS to install and maintain electric vehicle (EV) charging equipment for customers at their homes or businesses. The programs provide direct benefits to customers by removing cost barriers associated with installing EV equipment. In October 2021, subject to the receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals, we pledged to expand the EV charging network within the service territories of our electric utilities. In doing so, we joined a coalition of utility companies in a unified effort to make EV charging convenient and widely available throughout the Midwest. The coalition we joined is planning to help build and grow EV charging corridors, enabling the general public to safely and efficiently charge their vehicles.\n\nWe also continue to reduce methane emissions by improving our natural gas distribution system. We set a target across our natural gas distribution operations to achieve net-zero methane emissions by the end of 2030. We plan to achieve our net-zero goal through an effort that includes both continuous operational improvements and equipment upgrades, as well as the use of renewable natural gas (RNG) throughout our utility systems. In 2022, we received approval from the PSCW for our RNG pilots. We have since signed our first five contracts for RNG for our natural gas distribution business, which will be transporting the output of local dairy farms onto our gas distribution system. The RNG supplied will directly replace higher-emission methane from natural gas that would have entered our pipes. Our first five contracts bring us to a total of 1 Bcf of RNG planned to enter our system. We expect to have RNG flowing to our distribution network in 2023, supporting our goal to reduce methane emissions.\n\nAs part of our effort to look for new opportunities in sustainable energy, during 2022 we completed testing the effects of blending hydrogen, a clean generating fuel, with natural gas at one of our RICE generating units in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We partnered with the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in this research that could help create another viable option for decarbonizing the economy. We are still evaluating the data; however, our initial findings indicate that all project measures exceeded our expectations. The results of this testing continue to be analyzed and will be shared more broadly when complete.\n\nIn 2023, we are planning a pilot program with EPRI and CMBlu Energy, a Germany-based designer and manufacturer, to test a new form of long-duration energy storage on the U.S. electric grid. The program will test battery system performance, including the ability to store and discharge energy for up to twice as long as the typical lithium-ion batteries in use today. The pilot is planned for the fourthquarter of 2023.\n\n## Reliability\n\nWe have made significant reliability-related investments in recent years, and in accordance with our ESG Progress Plan, expect to continue strengthening and modernizing our generation fleet, as well as our electric and natural gas distribution networks to further improve reliability.\n\nBelow are a few examples of reliability projects that are proposed, currently underway, or recently completed.\n\n- \u00b7 WE and Wisconsin Gas LLC (WG) have received approval to each construct their own liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility to meet anticipated peak demand. Commercial operation of the WE and WG LNG facilities is targeted for the end of 2023 and 2024, respectively.\n- \u00b7 The Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company continues to work on its Safety Modernization Program, which primarily involves replacing old iron pipes and facilities in Chicago's natural gas delivery system with modern polyethylene pipes to reinforce the longterm safety and reliability of the system.\n- \u00b7 Our utilities continue to upgrade their electric and natural gas distribution systems to enhance reliability.\n\nWe expect to spend approximately $3.6 billion from 2023 to 2027 on reliability related projects with continued investment over the next decade.

        "page_content": "## Operating Efficiency\n\nWe continually look for ways to optimize the operating efficiency of our company and will continue to do so under the ESG Progress Plan. For example, we are making progress on our Advanced Metering Infrastructure program, replacing aging meter-reading equipment on both our network and customer property. An integrated system of smart meters, communication networks, and data management programs enables two-way communication between our utilities and our customers. This program reduces the manual effort for disconnects and reconnects and enhances outage management capabilities.\n\nWe continue to focus on integrating the resources of all our businesses and finding the best and most efficient processes.\n\n## Financial Discipline\n\nA strong adherence to financial discipline is essential to meeting our earnings projections and maintaining a strong balance sheet, stable cash flows, a growing dividend, and quality credit ratings.\n\nWe follow an asset management strategy that focuses on investing in and acquiring assets consistent with our strategic plans, as well as disposing of assets, including property, plants, equipment, and entire business units, that are no longer strategic to operations, are not performing as intended, or have an unacceptable risk profile. See Note 3, Dispositions, for information on recent transactions.\n\nOur investment focus remains in our regulated utility and non-utility energy infrastructure businesses, as well as our investment in ATC. In our non-utility energy infrastructure segment, we have acquired or agreed to acquire majority interests in eight wind parks and two solar parks, with total available capacity of more than 2,000 MW. These renewable energy assets represent more than $2.9 billion in committed investments and have long-term agreements to serve customers outside our traditional service areas. Production tax credits from these renewable investments reduce our cash tax expense. In addition, we anticipate that credits generated in 2023 and beyond will be eligible to be transferred to third parties in exchange for cash. See Note 2, Acquisitions, for information on recent and pending transactions.\n\nWe expect total capital expenditures for our regulated utility and non-utility energy infrastructure businesses to be approximately $18.1 billion from 2023 to 2027. In addition, we currently forecast that our share of ATC's projected capital expenditures over the next five years will be approximately $2.0 billion. Specific projects included in the $20.1 billion ESG Progress Plan are discussed in more detail below under Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Requirements - Significant Capital Projects.\n\n## Exceptional Customer Care\n\nOur approach is driven by an intense focus on delivering exceptional customer care every day. We strive to provide the best value for our customers by demonstrating personal responsibility for results, leveraging our capabilities and expertise, and using creative solutions to meet or exceed our customers' expectations.\n\nA multiyear effort is driving a standardized, seamless approach to digital customer service across our companies. We have moved all utilities to a common platform for all customer-facing self-service options. Using common systems and processes reduces costs, provides greater flexibility and enhances the consistent delivery of exceptional service to customers.\n\n## Safety\n\nSafety is one of our core values and a critical component of our culture. We are committed to keeping our employees and the public safe through a comprehensive corporate safety program that focuses on employee engagement and elimination of at-risk behaviors.\n\nUnder our \"Target Zero\" mission, we have an ultimate goal of zero incidents, accidents, and injuries. Management and union leadership work together to reinforce the Target Zero culture. We set annual goals for safety results as well as measurable leading indicators, in order to raise awareness of at-risk behaviors and situations and guide injury-prevention activities. All employees are encouraged to report unsafe conditions or incidents that could have led to an injury. Injuries and tasks with high levels of risk are assessed, and findings and best practices are shared across our companies.\n\nOur corporate safety program provides a forum for addressing employee concerns, training employees and contractors on current safety standards, and recognizing those who demonstrate a safety focus.\n\n## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our Results of Operations includes comparisons of our results for the year ended December 31, 2022 with the year ended December 31, 2021. For a similar discussion that compares our results for the year ended December 31, 2021 with the year ended December 31, 2020, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations in Part II of our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the SEC on February 24, 2022.",

The significant factors impacting the $107.8 million increase in earnings were:\n\n- \u00b7 A $51.9 million increase in net income attributed to common shareholders at the Wisconsin segment, driven by lower operation and maintenance expense, largely due to the amortization of certain regulatory liabilities to offset a portion of our 2022 forecasted revenue deficiencies. The amortization was approved by the PSCW in order to forego filing for 2022 base rate increases. An increase in natural gas margins related to higher retail sales volumes, as well as higher net credits from the non-service components of our net periodic pension and OPEB costs, also contributed to the increase in earnings. These increases in earnings were partially offset by a negative year-over-year impact from collections of fuel and purchased power costs, higher property and revenue taxes, and higher depreciation and amortization.\n- \u00b7 A $45.2 million increase in net income attributed to common shareholders at the non-utility energy infrastructure segment, driven by an increase in PTCs during 2022, primarily due to the Jayhawk wind park that achieved commercial operation in December 2021, higher generation at our other wind parks, and an increase in the PTC rate related to the PTC inflation adjustment issued by the IRS. In addition, Upstream recognized revenue during 2022 related to market settlements it received from SPP in February 2021. Due to a complaint filed with the FERC, the revenue related to these settlements could not be recognized until the FERC issued an order denying the complaint in the first quarter of 2022. A positive impact from a sharing arrangement with one of our Blooming Grove customers, resulting from strong energy prices, also contributed to the increase in earnings.\n- \u00b7 A $23.2 million increase in net income attributed to common shareholders at the electric transmission segment, primarily due to the impact of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals opinion issued in August 2022 addressing complaints related to ATC's ROE and the year-over-year impact of a goodwill impairment recorded during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nThese increases in earnings were partially offset by a $20.3 million increase in the net loss attributed to common shareholders at the corporate and other segment, driven by net losses from the investments held in the Integrys rabbi trust during 2022, compared with net gains during 2021. The gains and losses from the investments held in the rabbi trust partially offset the changes in benefit costs related to deferred compensation, which are included in other operation and maintenance expense in our operating segments. See Note 17, Fair Value Measurements, for more information on our investments held in the Integrys rabbi trust. A decrease in earnings from our equity method investments in technology and energy-focused investment funds and higher interest expense also contributed to the higher net loss. Partially offsetting these negative impacts was the year-over-year impact from the loss on debt extinguishment recorded in 2021.\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThe discussions below address the contribution of each of our segments to net income attributed to common shareholders. The discussions include financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP, as well as electric margins and natural gas margins, which are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. Electric margins (electric revenues less fuel and purchased power costs) and natural gas margins (natural gas revenues less cost of natural gas sold) are non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude other operation and maintenance expense, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenue taxes.\n\nWe believe that electric and natural gas margins provide a useful basis for evaluating utility operations since the majority of prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs, as well as prudently incurred natural gas costs, are passed through to customers in current rates. As a result, management uses electric and natural gas margins internally when assessing the operating performance of our segments as these measures exclude the majority of revenue fluctuations caused by changes in these expenses. Similarly, the presentation of electric and natural gas margins herein is intended to provide supplemental information for investors regarding our operating performance.\n\nOur electric margins and natural gas margins may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Furthermore, these measures are not intended to replace operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating",

During 2022 and 2021, $516.7 million and $503.6 million, respectively, of costs were billed to our electric utilities by transmission providers.\n\nDuring 2022, WE and WPS amortized $81.0 million of the regulatory liabilities associated with their transmission escrows to offset certain 2022 revenue deficiencies, as approved by the PSCW in order to forego filing for 2022 base rate increases. This amortization drove the decrease in transmission expense during 2022, compared with 2021.\n\nThe following tables provide information on delivered sales volumes by customer class and weather statistics:\n\n|                                              | Year Ended December 31   | Year Ended December 31   | Year Ended December 31   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Electric Sales Volumes  (MWh - in thousands) | 2022                     | 2021                     | B (W)                    |\n| Customer class                               |                          |                          |                          |\n| Residential                                  | 11,372.6                 | 11,460.1                 | (87.5)                   |\n| Small commercial and industrial  (1)         | 12,867.1                 | 12,785.1                 | 82.0                     |\n| Large commercial and industrial  (1)         | 12,181.6                 | 12,406.4                 | (224.8)                  |\n| Other                                        | 139.0                    | 147.6                    | (8.6)                    |\n| Total retail  (1)                            | 36,560.3                 | 36,799.2                 | (238.9)                  |\n| Wholesale                                    | 2,444.7                  | 2,862.5                  | (417.8)                  |\n| Resale                                       | 3,962.8                  | 4,869.2                  | (906.4)                  |\n| Total sales in MWh  (1)                      | 42,967.8                 | 44,530.9                 | (1,563.1)                |\n\n|                                                   | Year Ended December 31   | Year Ended December 31   | Year Ended December 31   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Natural Gas Sales Volumes  (Therms - in millions) | 2022                     | 2021                     | B (W)                    |\n| Customer class                                    |                          |                          |                          |\n| Residential                                       | 1,189.6                  | 1,036.7                  | 152.9                    |\n| Commercial and industrial                         | 746.6                    | 634.0                    | 112.6                    |\n| Total retail                                      | 1,936.2                  | 1,670.7                  | 265.5                    |\n| Transportation                                    | 1,438.1                  | 1,392.6                  | 45.5                     |\n| Total sales in therms                             | 3,374.3                  | 3,063.3                  | 311.0                    |\n\n|                        | Year Ended December 31   | Year Ended December 31   | Year Ended December 31   |\n|------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Weather  (Degree Days) | 2022                     | 2021                     | B (W)                    |\n| WE and WG  (1)         |                          |                          |                          |\n| Heating (6,518 Normal) | 6,369                    | 5,735                    | 11.1 %                   |\n| Cooling (774 Normal)   | 944                      | 1,061                    | (11.0) %                 |\n| WPS  (2)               |                          |                          |                          |\n| Heating (7,360 Normal) | 7,387                    | 6,735                    | 9.7 %                    |\n| Cooling (538 Normal)   | 718                      | 643                      | 11.7 %                   |\n| UMERC  (3)             |                          |                          |                          |\n| Heating (8,387 Normal) | 8,643                    | 7,744                    | 11.6 %                   |\n| Cooling (344 Normal)   | 358                      | 428                      | (16.4) %                 |\n\n## Electric Revenues\n\nElectric revenues increased $433.2 million during 2022, compared with 2021. To the extent that changes in fuel and purchased power costs are passed through to customers, the changes are offset by comparable changes in revenues. See the discussion of electric utility margins below for more information related to recovery of fuel and purchased power costs and the remaining drivers of the changes in electric revenues.",

        "page_content": "## Electric Utility Margins\n\nElectric utility margins at the Wisconsin segment increased $40.0 million during 2022, compared with 2021. The significant factors impacting the higher electric utility margins were:\n\n- \u00b7 A $103.5 million increase in margins related to the impact of unprotected excess deferred taxes during 2021, which we agreed to return to customers in our PSCW-approved rate orders. This increase in margins is offset in income taxes. See Note 16, Income Taxes, and Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\n- \u00b7 A $9.6 million increase in other revenues, primarily related to third-party use of our assets.\n\nThese increases in margins were partially offset by:\n\n- \u00b7 A $50.8 million year-over-year negative impact from collections of fuel and purchased power costs compared with costs collected in rates. Under the Wisconsin fuel rules, the margins of our electric utilities are impacted by under- or over-collections of certain fuel and purchased power costs that are within a 2% price variance from the costs included in rates, and the remaining variance beyond the 2% price variance is generally deferred for future recovery or refund to customers. As a result of the higher fuel costs in both 2021 and 2022, WPS was unable to defer a portion of its under-collected fuel and purchased power costs due to earning an ROE in excess of the PSCW authorized amount.\n- \u00b7 Lower margins of $14.9 million driven by the expiration of certain wholesale contracts.\n- \u00b7 An $8.4 million net decrease in margins related to lower sales volumes, driven by the impact of cooler weather during the 2022 cooling season, compared with 2021. As measured by cooling degree days, 2022 was 11.0% cooler than 2021 in the Milwaukee area.\n\n## Natural Gas Revenues\n\nNatural gas revenues increased $490.3 million during 2022, compared with 2021. Because prudently incurred natural gas costs are passed through to our customers in current rates, the changes are offset by comparable changes in revenues. The average per-unit cost of natural gas increased approximately 27% during 2022, compared with 2021. The remaining drivers of changes in natural gas revenues are described in the discussion of natural gas utility margins below.\n\n## Natural Gas Utility Margins\n\nNatural gas utility margins at the Wisconsin segment increased $69.4 million during 2022, compared with 2021. The most significant factors impacting the higher natural gas utility margins were:\n\n- \u00b7 A $59.7 million increase in margins from higher sales volumes, driven by the continued economic recovery in Wisconsin from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as colder weather during the 2022 heating season, compared with 2021. As measured by heating degree days, 2022 was 11.1% and 9.7% colder than 2021 in the Milwaukee area and Green Bay area, respectively.\n- \u00b7 A $9.9 million increase in margins related to the amortization of a certain portion of WG's regulatory liability consisting of credit balances associated with the escrow of natural gas storage service costs from Bluewater Gas Storage. In September 2021, the PSCW issued a written order for our Wisconsin utilities approving certain accounting treatments to offset certain 2022 revenue deficiencies in order to forego filing for 2022 base rate increases. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\n\n## Other Operating Expenses (includes other operation and maintenance, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenue taxes)\n\nOther operating expenses at the Wisconsin segment decreased $44.4 million during 2022, compared with 2021. The significant factors impacting the decrease in other operating expenses were:\n\n- \u00b7 An $80.2 million decrease in transmission expense driven by the amortization of a certain portion of WE's and WPS's regulatory liabilities associated with transmission escrow balances, as discussed in the notes under the other operation and maintenance table above.\n- \u00b7 A $19.3 million decrease in expense related to the earnings sharing mechanisms in place at our Wisconsin utilities, as discussed in the notes under the other operation and maintenance table above. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\n- \u00b7 A $14.5 million decrease in other operation and maintenance expense due to increases to certain regulatory assets resulting from decisions included in the December 2022 Wisconsin rate orders.\n- \u00b7 An $8.6 million decrease in other operation and maintenance expense during 2022, compared with 2021, related to certain COVID-19 expenditures.\n- \u00b7 A $6.8 million decrease in other operation and maintenance expense related to the We Power leases, as discussed in the notes under the other operation and maintenance table above.\n- \u00b7 A $3.1 million decrease in other operating and maintenance expense related to our power plants, driven by increases to certain plant-related regulatory assets resulting from decisions included in the December 2022 Wisconsin rate orders. This decrease in expense was partially offset by increased maintenance at our plants, including a planned outage at the Weston power plant, and reductions in refined coal credits during 2022, compared with 2021.",

        "page_content": "- \u00b7 A $2.8 million decrease in expense related to higher gains on land sales during 2022, compared with 2021.\n- \u00b7 A $2.4 million decrease in expense related to charitable projects supporting our customers and the communities within our service territories.\n\nThese decreases in other operating expenses were partially offset by:\n\n- \u00b7 A $31.7 million increase in property and revenue taxes, driven by higher gross receipt and property taxes.\n- \u00b7 A $29.3 million increase in electric and natural gas distribution expenses, primarily driven by higher costs to manage system reliability, for storm restoration, and for overall maintenance of our distribution system during 2022.\n- \u00b7 A $27.8 million net increase in depreciation and amortization, driven by assets being placed into service as we continue to execute on our capital plan and an increase related to the We Power leases. These increases were partially offset by $10.2 million of deferred depreciation related to capital investments made by WG since it's last rate case, as approved by the PSCW in an order that allowed our Wisconsin utilities to offset certain 2022 revenue deficiencies in order to forego filing for 2022 base rate increases.\n- \u00b7 A $3.9 million increase in regulatory amortizations and other pass through expenses, as discussed in the notes under the other operation and maintenance table above.\n\n## Other Income, Net\n\nOther income, net at the Wisconsin segment increased $26.0 million during 2022, compared with 2021, driven by higher net credits from the non-service components of our net periodic pension and OPEB costs. See Note 20, Employee Benefits, for more information on our benefit costs. Higher AFUDC-Equity due to continued capital investment also contributed to the increase in other income, net.\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nInterest expense at the Wisconsin segment increased $0.3 million during 2022, compared with 2021. The increase was primarily driven by WE and WPS issuing long-term debt during the third and fourth quarters of 2022, respectively. Also driving the increase was an increase to short-term debt interest rates. These increases were partially offset by the deferral of interest expense related to capital investments made by WG since its last rate case, as approved by the PSCW in an order that allowed our Wisconsin utilities to offset certain 2022 revenue deficiencies in order to forego filing for a 2022 base rate increase. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information. Also offsetting the increases was lower interest expense on finance lease liabilities, primarily related to the We Power leases, as finance lease liabilities decrease each year as payments are made. Higher AFUDC-Debt due to continued capital investment also contributed to offsetting the increases.\n\n## Income Tax Expense\n\nIncome tax expense at the Wisconsin segment increased $127.6 million during 2022, compared with 2021. The increase was primarily due to an approximate $100 million negative impact related to the lower year-over-year amortization of the unprotected excess deferred tax benefits from the Tax Legislation in connection with the Wisconsin rate orders approved by the PSCW, effective January 1, 2020. The impact due to the benefit from the amortization of these unprotected excess deferred tax benefits in 2021 did not impact earnings as there was an offsetting impact in operating income. Also contributing to the increase was higher pre-tax income in 2022. See Note 16, Income Taxes, and Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\n\n## ILLINOIS SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO NET INCOME ATTRIBUTED TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS\n\nThe Illinois segment's contribution to net income attributed to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $226.9 million, representing a $3.9 million, or 1.7%, increase over the prior year. The increase was driven by a gain on the sale of certain real estate in Chicago, as well as higher natural gas margins due to PGL's continued capital investment in the SMP project under its QIP rider and NSG's rate increase, effective September 15, 2021. These positive impacts were partially offset by increases in various operating expenses, as discussed below.",

Because prudently incurred natural gas costs are passed through to our customers in current rates, the changes are offset by comparable changes in revenues. The average per-unit cost of natural gas sold increased approximately 14% during 2022, compared with 2021. The remaining drivers of changes in natural gas revenues are described in the discussion of margins below.",

        "page_content": "## Natural Gas Utility Margins\n\nNatural gas utility margins at the Illinois segment, net of the $15.1 million impact of the riders referenced in the table above, increased $38.9 million during 2022, compared with 2021. The increase in margins was primarily driven by:\n\n- \u00b7 A $24.9 million increase in revenues at PGL due to continued capital investment in the SMP project. PGL recovers the costs related to the SMP through a surcharge on customer bills pursuant to an ICC approved QIP rider, which is in effect through 2023. For information on the QIP rider and PGL's plan to recover these costs after 2023, see Note 26, Regulatory Environment.\n- \u00b7 An $8.0 million increase related to the impact of the NSG rate order approved by the ICC, effective September 15, 2021, which includes the Variable Income Tax Adjustment Rider in base rates. The Variable Income Tax Adjustment Rider recovers or refunds changes in actual income tax expense resulting from changes in income tax rates and amortization of deferred taxes, which differ from amounts included in rates. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information on NSG's rate order.\n- \u00b7 A $5.0 million increase in the invested capital tax adjustment rider, which did not impact net income as it was offset in property and revenue taxes. The invested capital tax adjustment rider is a mechanism that allows PGL and NSG to recover or refund the difference between the cost of invested capital tax incurred and the amount collected through base rates.\n\n## Other Operating Expenses (includes other operation and maintenance, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenue taxes)\n\nOther operating expenses at the Illinois segment increased $30.8 million, net of the $15.1 million impact of the riders referenced in the table above, during 2022, compared with 2021. The significant factors impacting the increase in operating expenses were:\n\n- \u00b7 A $22.4 million increase in expenses related to charitable projects supporting our customers and the communities within our service territories.\n- \u00b7 A $12.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization, primarily driven by PGL's continued capital investment in the SMP project.\n- \u00b7 A $12.7 million increase in natural gas distribution and maintenance costs, primarily related to maintaining the natural gas infrastructure, including costs associated with PGL's gas storage field.\n- \u00b7 An $11.4 million increase in expenses associated with the settlement of legal claims.\n- \u00b7 A $9.8 million increase in benefit costs, primarily due to higher pension and stock-based compensation costs.\n- \u00b7 A $7.4 million increase in property and revenue taxes, primarily driven by an increase in the invested capital tax related to continued capital investment. This increase was offset in natural gas utility margins.\n- \u00b7 A $6.9 million increase in customer service expense, primarily driven by higher call volumes.\n\nThese increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $54.5 million pre-tax gain on the sale of certain real estate in Chicago. See Note 3, Dispositions, for more information.\n\n## Other Income, Net\n\nOther income, net at the Illinois segment increased $6.8 million during 2022, compared with 2021, driven by higher net credits from the non-service components of our net periodic pension and OPEB costs. See Note 20, Employee Benefits, for more information on our benefit costs.\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nInterest expense at the Illinois segment increased $7.2 million during 2022, compared with 2021, driven primarily by $225.0 million and $100.0 million of long-term debt issuances in November 2021 and December 2022, respectively, and increased short-term debt interest rates.\n\n## Income Tax Expense\n\nIncome tax expense at the Illinois segment increased $3.8 million during 2022, compared with 2021, driven by an increase in pre-tax income and a $1.3 million negative impact associated with previously unrecognized tax benefits recorded in 2021. See Note 16, Income Taxes, for more information.\n\n## OTHER STATES SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO NET INCOME ATTRIBUTED TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS\n\nThe other states segment's contribution to net income attributed to common shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2022 was $39.7 million, representing a $3.9 million, or 10.9%, increase over the prior year. The increase was driven by higher natural gas margins due to a rate increase at MGU, effective January 1, 2022, and higher sales volumes during 2022, compared with 2021. These positive impacts were partially offset by increases in operating expenses, as well as interest expense, as discussed below.",

Because prudently incurred natural gas costs are passed through to our customers in current rates, the changes are offset by comparable changes in revenues. The average per-unit cost of natural gas sold increased approximately 4.0% during 2022, compared with 2021. The remaining drivers of changes in natural gas revenues are described in the discussion of margins below.",

        "page_content": "## Natural Gas Utility Margins\n\nNatural gas utility margins increased $27.2 million during 2022, compared with 2021. The increase in margins was primarily driven by:\n\n- \u00b7 A $13.0 million increase related to the new rates at MGU that went into effect in 2022. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\n- \u00b7 A $9.3 million increase related to higher sales volumes due to both continued economic recovery and colder weather during 2022, compared with 2021.\n- \u00b7 A $2.6 million increase related to MERC's GUIC rider, which was in place through December 31, 2022. The GUIC rider allowed MERC to recover previously approved GUIC incurred to replace or modify natural gas facilities to the extent the work is required by state, federal, or other government agencies and exceeds the costs included in base rates.\n- \u00b7 A $1.2 million increase related to MERC CIP revenue, which was offset in operation and maintenance expense. Rebates and programs are available to residential and commercial customers of MERC through the CIP, which is funded by rate payers using the Conservation Cost Recovery Charge and the Conservation Cost Recovery Adjustment funds that are collected on their monthly billing statements.\n\n## Other Operating Expenses (includes other operation and maintenance, depreciation and amortization, and property and revenue taxes)\n\nOther operating expenses at the other states segment increased $15.4 million during 2022, compared with 2021. The significant factors impacting the increase in operating expenses were:\n\n- \u00b7 A $7.9 million increase in natural gas operations and customer service expense, primarily driven by various operation and maintenance projects approved in MGU's rate case and an increase in costs related to safety and reliability programs at MERC.\n- \u00b7 A $4.5 million increase in property and revenue taxes, driven by higher use tax at MGU.\n- \u00b7 A $2.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization related to continued capital investment.\n- \u00b7 A $1.2 million increase in operation and maintenance expense due to MERC's CIP program, which has an offsetting increase in margins.\n\n## Other Income, Net\n\nOther income, net at the other states segment increased $1.4 million during 2022, compared with 2021, driven by higher net credits from the non-service components of our net periodic pension and OPEB costs. See Note 20, Employee Benefits, for more information on our benefit costs.\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nInterest expense at the other states segment increased $7.7 million during 2022, compared with 2021, driven primarily by the deferral of $4.9 million of interest expense during 2021, as approved by the MPSC to mitigate the impacts from delaying the filing of MGU's 2021 rate case. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for additional information. This deferred interest expense is now being amortized over a four-year period as a result of MGU's approved rate increase.\n\n## Income Tax Expense\n\nIncome tax expense at the other states segment increased $1.6 million during 2022, compared with 2021, driven by an increase in pretax income.\n\n## ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO NET INCOME ATTRIBUTED TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS\n\n|                                               | Year Ended December 31   | Year Ended December 31   | Year Ended December 31   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| (in millions)                                 | 2022                     | 2021                     | B (W)                    |\n| Equity in earnings of transmission affiliates | $  194.7                 | $  158.1                 | $  36.6                  |\n| Other expense                                 | -                        | 0.1                      | 0.1                      |\n| Interest expense                              | 19.4                     | 19.4                     | -                        |\n| Income before income taxes                    | 175.3                    | 138.6                    | 36.7                     |\n| Income tax expense                            | 45.8                     | 32.3                     | (13.5)                   |\n| Net income attributed to common shareholders  | $  129.5                 | $  106.3                 | $  23.2                  |",

        "page_content": "## Equity in Earnings of Transmission Affiliates\n\nEquity in earnings of transmission affiliates increased $36.6 million during 2022, compared with 2021, driven by:\n\n- \u00b7 A $20.5 million increase in equity earnings due to the impact of a D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals opinion issued in August 2022 addressing complaints related to ATC's ROE. For information on this D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals opinion, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources - Regulatory, Legislative, and Legal Matters - American Transmission Company Allowed Return on Equity Complaints.\n- \u00b7 An $8.5 million increase in equity earnings related to a goodwill impairment recorded during the fourth quarter of 2021 by ATC Holdco, which was formed to invest in transmission-related projects outside of ATC's traditional footprint.\n\nContinued capital investment by ATC also contributed to the year-over-year increase in equity earnings.\n\n## Income Tax Expense\n\nIncome tax expense at the electric transmission segment increased $13.5 million during 2022, compared with 2021, driven by an increase in pre-tax income and a $3.3 million negative impact associated with a previously recorded reversal of a tax remeasurement in 2021.\n\n## NON-UTILITY ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SEGMENT CONTRIBUTION TO NET INCOME ATTRIBUTED TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS\n\n|                                                          | Year Ended December 31   | Year Ended December 31   | Year Ended December 31   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| (in millions)                                            | 2022                     | 2021                     | B (W)                    |\n| Operating income                                         | $  372.8                 | $  350.3                 | $  22.5                  |\n| Interest expense                                         | 68.9                     | 71.0                     | 2.1                      |\n| Income before income taxes                               | 303.9                    | 279.3                    | 24.6                     |\n| Income tax expense (benefit)                             | (20.9)                   | 3.1                      | 24.0                     |\n| Net (income) loss attributed to noncontrolling interests | (0.4)                    | 3.0                      | (3.4)                    |\n| Net income attributed to common shareholders             | $  324.4                 | $  279.2                 | $  45.2                  |\n\n## Operating Income\n\nOperating income at the non-utility energy infrastructure segment increased $22.5 million during 2022, compared with 2021, driven by:\n\n- \u00b7 A $15.2 million positive impact from recognition of revenue related to our Upstream wind park in 2022 that was associated with market settlements received from SPP in February 2021. These settlements were subject to a FERC complaint, so we were not able to recognize them as revenue until the FERC issued an order denying that complaint in 2022.\n- \u00b7 A $13.4 million positive impact from a sharing arrangement with one of our Blooming Grove customers resulting from strong energy prices.\n\nThese increases in operating income were partially offset by:\n\n- \u00b7 A $5.1 million negative impact from higher operating losses at our Jayhawk wind park that achieved commercial operation in December 2021. The site experienced operating losses in 2022 due to SPP reliability curtailments reducing output and transmission congestion reducing energy market prices.\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nInterest expense at the non-utility energy infrastructure segment decreased $2.1 million during 2022, compared with 2021, primarily due to a lower principal balance as a result of the semi-annual principal payments on long-term debt.\n\n## Income Tax Expense (Benefit)\n\nAt the non-utility energy infrastructure segment, $20.9 million of income tax benefit was recorded during 2022, compared with $3.1 million of income tax expense recorded during 2021. The change was primarily due to a $30.3 million increase in PTCs in 2022, driven by the Jayhawk wind park that achieved commercial operation in December 2021, higher generation at our other wind parks, and an increase in the PTC rate related to the PTC inflation adjustment issued by the IRS. This favorable change in the income tax benefit was partially offset by higher pre-tax earnings in 2022.",

The decrease was driven by a $12.6 million net loss from the investments held in the Integrys rabbi trust during 2022, compared with an $18.6 million net gain during 2021. The gains and losses from the investments held in the rabbi trust partially offset the changes in benefit costs related to deferred compensation, which are included in other operation and maintenance expense in our operating segments. See Note 17, Fair Value Measurements, for more information on our investments held in the Integrys rabbi trust. An $11.9 million decrease in earnings from our equity method investments in technology and energy-focused investment funds also contributed to the lower other income, net.\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nInterest expense at the corporate and other segment increased $26.6 million during 2022, compared with 2021, due to a $900.0 million long-term debt issuance in September 2022. See Note 14, Long-Term Debt, for more information. Also contributing to the increase was higher short-term debt interest rates.\n\n## Loss on Debt Extinguishment\n\nThere was no loss on debt extinguishment during 2022, as we did not refinance any debt obligations prior to maturity during 2022.\n\n## Income Tax Benefit\n\nThe income tax benefit at the corporate and other segment decreased $0.1 million during 2022, compared with 2021, driven by $10.3 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits recorded during 2021. This decrease in income tax benefit was offset by higher pre-tax loss and a $3.9 million increase in excess tax benefits recognized related to stock option exercises during 2022, compared with 2021.\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nWe expect to maintain adequate liquidity to meet our cash requirements for operation of our businesses and implementation of our corporate strategy through internal generation of cash from operations and access to the capital markets.\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our Liquidity and Capital Resources includes comparisons of our cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 with the year ended December 31, 2021. For a similar discussion that compares our cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021 with the year ended December 31, 2020, see Item 7.

In addition, we continued to recover the natural gas costs we under-collected from our Illinois and Minnesota customers related to the extreme weather conditions that occurred in February 2021. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information on the recovery of these natural gas costs.\n- \u00b7 A $51.2 million increase in cash related to a decrease in contributions and payments related to pension and OPEB plans during 2022, compared with 2021.\n\nThese increases in net cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by:\n\n- \u00b7 A $461.3 million decrease in cash from higher payments for fuel and purchased power at our plants during 2022, compared with 2021. Our plants incurred higher fuel costs throughout 2022 as a result of an increase in the price of natural gas.\n- \u00b7 A $174.3 million decrease in cash from higher payments for operating and maintenance expenses. During 2022, our payments were higher for reliability and storm restoration, transmission, benefit costs, natural gas distribution and maintenance costs, natural gas storage costs, and customer service.\n- \u00b7 A $28.3 million decrease in cash related to higher payments for property and revenue taxes, driven by higher gross receipt taxes, property taxes, and an increase in the Illinois invested capital tax during 2022, compared with 2021.\n- \u00b7 An $18.6 million decrease in cash related to higher cash paid for income taxes, driven by higher taxable income during 2022, compared with 2021.\n- \u00b7 A $12.8 million decrease in cash related to higher payments for environmental remediation related to work completed on former manufactured gas plant sites during 2022, compared with 2021.\n- \u00b7 A $12.6 million decrease in cash related to lower distributions from ATC during 2022, compared with 2021.\n- \u00b7 An $11.4 million decrease in cash related to higher payments for interest related to increases in long-term and short-term debt interest rates during 2022, compared with 2021.\n\n## Investing Activities\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $330.6 million during 2022, compared with 2021, driven by:\n\n- \u00b7 The acquisition of a 90% ownership interest in Thunderhead in September 2022 for $382.0 million. See Note 2, Acquisitions, for more information.\n- \u00b7 A $62.1 million increase in cash paid for capital expenditures during 2022, compared with 2021, which is discussed in more detail below.\n- \u00b7 Capital contributions paid to transmission affiliates of $45.5 million during 2022. See Note 21, Investment in Transmission Affiliates, for more information. There were no payments to transmission affiliates during 2021.\n- \u00b7 The purchase of spectrum frequencies for $19.2 million during 2022. See Note 10, Goodwill and Intangibles, for more information.\n- \u00b7 A $17.8 million increase in cash paid for ATC's construction costs during 2022, compared with 2021, which will be reimbursed in the future. See Note 21, Investment in Transmission Affiliates, for more information.\n\nThese increases in net cash used in investing activities were partially offset by:\n\n- \u00b7 The acquisition of a 90% ownership interest in Jayhawk in February 2021 for $119.9 million. See Note 2, Acquisitions, for more information.\n- \u00b7 A $47.1 million increase in proceeds from the sale of assets during 2022, compared with 2021, primarily related to the sale of real estate owned by PGL.

These increases were partially offset by lower payments for capital expenditures related to upgrades to WE's and WPS's natural gas distribution systems and the restoration of WE's PSB. See Note 7, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information on the PSB.\n\nThe decrease in cash paid for capital expenditures at the Illinois segment during 2022, compared with 2021, was primarily driven by lower capital expenditures related to upgrades at the Manlove Gas Storage Field and upgrades to PGL's natural gas distribution system.\n\nThe decrease in cash paid for capital expenditures at the non-utility energy infrastructure segment during 2022, compared with 2021, was primarily driven by lower payments for capital expenditures related to the construction of Jayhawk, which went into commercial operation in December 2021. See Note 2, Acquisitions, for more information. This decrease in cash paid for capital expenditures was partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures for wastewater treatment system modifications for We Power's ERGS units. See Note 24, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information on the wastewater treatment system modifications.\n\nSee Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Requirements - Significant Capital Projects below for more information.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nNet cash provided by financing activities increased $382.4 million during 2022, compared with 2021, driven by:\n\n- \u00b7 A $1,168.3 million increase in cash due to a decrease in retirements of long-term debt during 2022, compared with 2021.\n- \u00b7 A $340.0 million increase in cash due to a repayment of a 364-day term loan during 2021.\n- \u00b7 A $51.6 million increase in cash due to a decrease in payments for debt extinguishment and issuance costs during 2022, compared with 2021.\n- \u00b7 A $17.9 million increase in cash received from the exercise of stock options during 2022, compared with 2021.\n\nThese increases in net cash provided by financing activities were partially offset by:\n\n- \u00b7 A $711.8 million decrease in cash due to $252.6 million of net repayments of commercial paper during 2022, compared with $459.2 million of net borrowings of commercial paper during 2021.\n- \u00b7 A $384.5 million decrease in cash due to lower issuances of long-term debt during 2022, compared with the same period in 2021.\n- \u00b7 A $63.1 million decrease in cash due to higher dividends paid on our common stock during 2022, compared with 2021. In January 2022, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by $0.05 per share (7.4%) effective with the March 2022 dividend payment.\n- \u00b7 A $36.1 million decrease in cash due to an increase in common stock purchased during 2022, compared with 2021, to satisfy requirements of our stock-based compensation plans.\n\n## Significant Financing Activities\n\nFor more information on our financing activities, see Note 13, Short-Term Debt and Lines of Credit, and Note 14, Long-Term Debt.",

        "page_content": "## CASH REQUIREMENTS\n\nWe require funds to support and grow our businesses. Our significant cash requirements primarily consist of capital and investment expenditures, payments to retire and pay interest on long-term debt, the payment of common stock dividends to our shareholders, and the funding of our ongoing operations. Our significant cash requirements are discussed in further detail below.\n\n## Significant Capital Projects\n\nWe have several capital projects that will require significant capital expenditures over the next three years and beyond. All projected capital requirements are subject to periodic review and may vary significantly from estimates, depending on a number of factors. These factors include environmental requirements, regulatory restraints and requirements, changes in tax laws and regulations, acquisition and development opportunities, market volatility, economic trends, supply chain disruptions, inflation, and interest rates. Our estimated capital expenditures and acquisitions for the next three years are reflected below. These amounts include anticipated expenditures for environmental compliance and certain remediation issues. For a discussion of certain environmental matters affecting us, see Note 24, Commitments and Contingencies.\n\n| (in millions)                     | 2023       | 2024       | 2025       |\n|-----------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Wisconsin                         | $  2,530.7 | $  2,432.8 | $  2,445.5 |\n| Illinois                          | 557.1      | 659.5      | 614.0      |\n| Other states                      | 111.8      | 115.0      | 104.7      |\n| Non-utility energy infrastructure | 747.0      | 683.8      | 217.2      |\n| Corporate and other               | 28.1       | 17.0       | 2.7        |\n| Total                             | $  3,974.7 | $  3,908.1 | $  3,384.1 |\n\nOur utilities continue to upgrade their electric and natural gas distribution systems to enhance reliability. These upgrades include addressing our aging infrastructure and system hardening and the AMI program. AMI is an integrated system of smart meters, communication networks, and data management systems that enable two-way communication between utilities and customers.\n\nWe are committed to investing in solar, wind, battery storage, and clean natural gas-fired generation. Below are examples of projects that are proposed or currently underway.\n\n- \u00b7 We have received approval to invest in 100 MW of utility-scale solar within our Wisconsin segment. WE has partnered with an unaffiliated utility to construct a solar project, Badger Hollow II, that will be located in Iowa County, Wisconsin. Once constructed, WE will own 100 MW of this project. WE's share of the cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $151 million. Commercial operation of Badger Hollow II is targeted for 2023.\n- \u00b7 WE and WPS, along with an unaffiliated utility, received PSCW approval to acquire and construct Paris, a utility-scale solarpowered electric generating facility with a battery energy storage system. The project will be located in Kenosha County, Wisconsin and once fully constructed, WE and WPS will collectively own 180 MW of solar generation and 99 MW of battery storage of this project. WE's and WPS's combined share of the cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $390 million, with construction of the solar portion expected to be completed in 2023.\n- \u00b7 WE and WPS, along with an unaffiliated utility, received PSCW approval to acquire and construct Darien, a utility-scale solarpowered electric generating facility with a battery energy storage system. The project will be located in Rock and Walworth counties, Wisconsin and once fully constructed, WE and WPS will collectively own 225 MW of solar generation and 68 MW of battery storage of this project. WE's and WPS's combined share of the cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $400 million, with construction of the solar portion expected to be completed in 2024.\n- \u00b7 WPS, along with an unaffiliated utility, received PSCW approval to acquire Red Barn, a utility-scale wind-powered electric generating facility. The project will be located in Grant County, Wisconsin and once constructed, WPS will own 82 MW of this project. WPS's share of the cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $160 million, with construction expected to be completed in the first half of 2023.\n- \u00b7 In April 2021, WE and WPS, along with an unaffiliated utility, filed an application with the PSCW for approval to acquire the Koshkonong Solar-Battery Park, a utility-scale solar-powered electric generating facility with a battery energy storage system. The project will be located in Dane County, Wisconsin and once fully constructed, WE and WPS will collectively own 270 MW of solar generation and 149 MW of battery storage of this project. If approved, WE's and WPS's combined share of the cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $585 million, with construction of the solar portion expected to be completed in 2025.\n- \u00b7 WE and WPS received PSCW approval to construct 128 MWs of natural gas-fired generation at WPS's existing Weston power plant site in northern Wisconsin. The new facility will consist of seven RICE units. We estimate the cost of this project to be approximately $170 million, with construction expected to be completed in 2023.\n- \u00b7 Effective January 1, 2023, WE and WPS completed the acquisition of Whitewater, a commercially operational 236.5 MW dual fueled (natural gas and low sulfur fuel oil) combined cycle electrical generation facility in Whitewater, Wisconsin. The cost of this facility was approximately $75.0 million, which includes transaction costs and working capital. See Note 15, Leases, for more information.\n- \u00b7 In January 2022, WPS, along with an unaffiliated utility, filed an application with the PSCW for approval to acquire a portion of West Riverside's nameplate capacity. WPS is also requesting approval to assign the option to purchase part of West Riverside to WE. If",

        "page_content": "approved, WPS or WE would acquire 100 MW of capacity, in the first of two potential option exercises. West Riverside is a combined cycle natural gas plant recently completed by an unaffiliated utility in Rock County, Wisconsin. If approved, our share of the cost of this ownership interest is approximately $91 million, with the transaction expected to close in the second quarter of 2023. In addition, WPS could exercise a second option to acquire an additional 100 MW of capacity. If approved, our share of the cost of this ownership interest is expected to be approximately $90 million, with the transaction expected to close in 2024.\n\nIn March 2022, the DOC opened an investigation into whether new tariffs should be imposed on solar panels and cells imported from multiple southeast Asian countries. See Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources - Regulatory, Legislative, and Legal Matters - United States Department of Commerce Complaints and Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources Regulatory, Legislative, and Legal Matters - Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act for information on the potential impacts to our solar projects as a result of the DOC investigation and CBP actions related to solar panels, respectively. The expected in-service dates identified above already reflect some of these impacts.\n\nWE and WG have received PSCW approval to each construct its own LNG facility. Each facility would provide approximately one Bcf of natural gas supply to meet anticipated peak demand without requiring the construction of additional interstate pipeline capacity. These facilities are expected to reduce the likelihood of constraints on WE's and WG's natural gas systems during the highest demand days of winter. The total cost of both projects is estimated to be approximately $370 million, with approximately half being invested by each utility. Commercial operation of the WE and WG LNG facilities are targeted for the end of 2023 and 2024, respectively.\n\nPGL is continuing work on the SMP, a project under which PGL is replacing approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging natural gas pipeline infrastructure. PGL currently recovers these costs through a surcharge on customer bills pursuant to an ICC approved QIP rider, which is in effect through 2023. After 2023, PGL will return to the traditional ratemaking process to recover the costs of necessary infrastructure improvements. PGL's projected average annual investment through 2025 is between $280 million and $300 million. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information on the SMP.\n\nThe non-utility energy infrastructure line item in the table above includes WECI's recent and planned investments in Sapphire Sky, Samson I, and Maple Flats. See Note 2, Acquisitions, for more information on these projects.\n\nWe expect to provide total capital contributions to ATC (not included in the above table) of approximately $244 million from 2023 through 2025. We do not expect to make any contributions to ATC Holdco during that period.\n\n## Long-Term Debt\n\nA significant amount of cash is required to retire and pay interest on our long-term debt obligations. See Note 14, Long-Term Debt, for more information on our outstanding long-term debt, including a schedule of our long-term debt maturities over the next five years. The following table summarizes our required interest payments on long-term debt (excluding finance lease obligations) as of December 31, 2022:\n\n|                                          | Interest Payments Due by Period More Than   | Interest Payments Due by Period More Than   | Interest Payments Due by Period More Than   | Interest Payments Due by Period More Than   | Interest Payments Due by Period More Than   |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| (in millions)                            | Total                                       | Less Than  1 Year                           | 1-3 Years                                   | 3-5 Years                                   | 5 Years                                     |\n| Interest payments on long-term debt  (1) | $  8,639.1                                  | $  578.2                                    | $  1,096.1                                  | $  940.4                                    | $  6,024.4                                  |\n\n## Common Stock Dividends\n\nOn January 19, 2023, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend to $0.78 per share effective with the first quarter of 2023 dividend payment, an increase of 7.2%. This equates to an annual dividend of $3.12 per share. In addition, the Board of Directors affirmed our dividend policy that continues to target a dividend payout ratio of 65-70% of earnings.\n\nWe have been paying consecutive quarterly dividends dating back to 1942 and expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends in the future. Any payment of future dividends is subject to approval by our Board of Directors and is dependent upon future earnings, capital requirements, and financial and other business conditions. In addition, our ability as a holding company to pay common stock dividends primarily depends on the availability of funds received from our subsidiaries. Various financing arrangements and regulatory requirements impose certain restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in the form of cash dividends, loans, or advances. We do not believe that these restrictions will materially affect our operations or limit any dividend payments in the foreseeable future. See Note 11, Common Equity, for more information related to these restrictions and our other common stock matters.\n\n## Other Significant Cash Requirements\n\nOur utility and non-utility operations have purchase obligations under various contracts for the procurement of fuel, power, and gas supply, as well as the related storage and transportation. These costs are a significant component of funding our ongoing operations. See Note 24, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information, including our minimum future commitments related to these purchase obligations.",

        "page_content": "In addition to our energy-related purchase obligations, we have commitments for other costs incurred in the normal course of business, including costs related to information technology services, meter reading services, maintenance and other service agreements for certain generating facilities, and various engineering agreements. Our estimated future cash requirements related to these purchase obligations are reflected below.\n\n|                 | Payments Due by Period More Than   | Payments Due by Period More Than   | Payments Due by Period More Than   | Payments Due by Period More Than   | Payments Due by Period More Than   |\n|-----------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| (in millions)   | Total                              | Less Than  1 Year                  | 1-3 Years                          | 3-5 Years                          | 5 Years                            |\n| Purchase orders | $  526.2                           | $  218.3                           | $  223.8                           | $  72.1                            | $  12.0                            |\n\nWe have various finance and operating lease obligations. Our finance lease obligations primarily relate to power purchase commitments and land leases for our solar projects. Our operating lease obligations are for office space and land. See Note 15, Leases, for more information, including an analysis of our minimum lease payments due in future years.\n\nWe make contributions to our pension and OPEB plans based upon various factors affecting us, including our liquidity position and tax law changes. See Note 20, Employee Benefits, for our expected contributions in 2023 and our expected pension and OPEB payments for the next 10 years. We expect the majority of these future pension and OPEB payments to be paid from our outside trusts. See Sources of Cash-Investments in Outside Trusts below for more information.\n\nIn addition to the above, our balance sheet at December 31, 2022 included various other liabilities that, due to the nature of the liabilities, the amount and timing of future payments cannot be determined with certainty. These liabilities include AROs, liabilities for the remediation of manufactured gas plant sites, and liabilities related to the accounting treatment for uncertainty in income taxes. For additional information on these liabilities, see Note 9, Asset Retirement Obligations, Note 24, Commitments and Contingencies, and Note 16, Income Taxes, respectively.\n\n## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe are a party to various financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk as a part of our normal course of business, including financial guarantees and letters of credit that support construction projects, commodity contracts, and other payment obligations. We believe that these agreements do not have, and are not reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources. For additional information, see Note 13, Short-Term Debt and Lines of Credit, Note 19, Guarantees, and Note 23, Variable Interest Entities.\n\n## SOURCES OF CASH\n\n## Liquidity\n\nWe anticipate meeting our short-term and long-term cash requirements to operate our businesses and implement our corporate strategy through internal generation of cash from operations and access to the capital markets, which allows us to obtain external shortterm borrowings, including commercial paper and term loans, and intermediate or long-term debt securities. Cash generated from operations is primarily driven by sales of electricity and natural gas to our utility customers, reduced by costs of operations. Our access to the capital markets is critical to our overall strategic plan and allows us to supplement cash flows from operations with external borrowings to manage seasonal variations, working capital needs, commodity price fluctuations, unplanned expenses, and unanticipated events.\n\nWEC Energy Group, WE, WPS, WG, and PGL maintain bank back-up credit facilities, which provide liquidity support for each company's obligations with respect to commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. We review our bank back-up credit facility needs on an ongoing basis and expect to be able to maintain adequate credit facilities to support our operations.\n\nThe amount, type, and timing of any financings in 2023, as well as in subsequent years, will be contingent on investment opportunities and our cash requirements and will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory approvals for certain subsidiaries, and other factors. Our regulated utilities plan to maintain capital structures consistent with those approved by their respective regulators.\n\nThe issuance of securities by our utility companies is subject to the approval of the applicable state commissions or FERC. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, we, WE, and WPS file registration statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of securities authorized by the appropriate regulatory authorities, as well as the securities registered under the 1933 Act, are closely monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by $1,423.3 million. We do not expect this to have an impact on our liquidity as we currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents, our available capacity of $1,454.2 million under existing revolving credit facilities, cash generated from ongoing operations, and access to the capital markets are adequate to meet our shortterm and long-term cash requirements.\n\nSee Note 13, Short-Term Debt and Lines of Credit, and Note 14, Long-Term Debt, for more information about our credit facilities and debt securities.",

        "page_content": "## Investments in Outside Trusts\n\nWe maintain investments in outside trusts to fund the obligation to provide pension and certain OPEB benefits to current and future retirees. As of December 31, 2022, these trusts had investments of approximately $3.5 billion, consisting of fixed income and equity securities, that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates. The performance of existing plan assets, long-term discount rates, changes in assumptions, and other factors could affect our future contributions to the plans, our financial position if our accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of the plan assets, and future results of operations related to changes in pension and OPEB expense and the assumed rate of return. For additional information, see Note 20, Employee Benefits.\n\n## Capitalization Structure\n\nThe following table shows our capitalization structure as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, as well as an adjusted capitalization structure that we believe is consistent with how a majority of the rating agencies currently view our 2007 Junior Notes:\n\n|                                            | 2022        | 2022        | 2021        | 2021        |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| (in millions)                              | Actual      | Adjusted    | Actual      | Adjusted    |\n| Common shareholders' equity                | $  11,376.9 | $  11,626.9 | $  10,913.2 | $  11,163.2 |\n| Preferred stock of subsidiary              | 30.4        | 30.4        | 30.4        | 30.4        |\n| Long-term debt (including current portion) | 15,647.4    | 15,397.4    | 13,693.1    | 13,443.1    |\n| Short-term debt                            | 1,647.1     | 1,647.1     | 1,897.0     | 1,897.0     |\n| Total capitalization                       | $  28,701.8 | $  28,701.8 | $  26,533.7 | $  26,533.7 |\n| Total debt                                 | $  17,294.5 | $  17,044.5 | $  15,590.1 | $  15,340.1 |\n| Ratio of debt to total capitalization      | 60.3 %      | 59.4 %      | 58.8 %      | 57.8 %      |\n\nIncluded in long-term debt on our balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, is $500.0 million principal amount of the 2007 Junior Notes. The adjusted presentation attributes $250.0 million of the 2007 Junior Notes to common shareholders' equity and $250.0 million to long-term debt.\n\nThe adjusted presentation of our consolidated capitalization structure is included as a complement to our capitalization structure presented in accordance with GAAP. Management evaluates and manages our capitalization structure, including our total debt to total capitalization ratio, using the GAAP calculation as adjusted to reflect the treatment of the 2007 Junior Notes by the majority of rating agencies. Therefore, we believe the non-GAAP adjusted presentation reflecting this treatment is useful and relevant to investors in understanding how management and the rating agencies evaluate our capitalization structure.\n\n## Debt Covenants\n\nCertain of our short-term and long-term debt agreements contain financial covenants that we must satisfy, including debt to capitalization ratios and debt service coverage ratios. At December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with all such covenants related to outstanding short-term and long-term debt. We expect to be in compliance with all such debt covenants for the foreseeable future. See Note 13, Short-Term Debt and Lines of Credit, Note 14, Long-Term Debt, and Note 11, Common Equity, for more information.\n\n## Credit Rating Risk\n\nCash collateral postings and prepayments made with external parties, including postings related to exchange-traded contracts, and cash collateral posted by external parties were immaterial as of December 31, 2022. From time to time, we may enter into commodity contracts that could require collateral or a termination payment in the event of a credit rating change to below BBB- at S&P Global Ratings, a division of S&P Global Inc., and/or Baa3 at Moody's Investors Service, Inc. If WE had a sub-investment grade credit rating at December 31, 2022, it could have been required to post $100 million of additional collateral or other assurances pursuant to the terms of a PPA. We also have other commodity contracts that, in the event of a credit rating downgrade, could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties.\n\nIn addition, access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. Any credit ratings downgrade could impact our ability to access capital markets.\n\nIn December 2022, Moody's changed the rating outlook for WG to stable from negative as a result of the rate case decision WG received in December 2022. Moody's affirmed WG's ratings including its A3 senior unsecured rating and its P-2 short term rating for commercial paper. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information on the rate case decision.\n\nSubject to other factors affecting the credit markets as a whole, we believe our current ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agency only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from the rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency.",

        "page_content": "## FACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n## COMPETITIVE MARKETS\n\n## Electric Utility Industry\n\nThe FERC supports large RTOs, which directly impacts the structure of the wholesale electric market. Due to the FERC's support of RTOs, MISO uses the MISO Energy Markets to carry out its operations, including the use of LMP to value electric transmission congestion and losses. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us.\n\n## Wisconsin\n\nElectric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date. It is uncertain when, if at all, retail choice might be implemented in Wisconsin.\n\n## Michigan\n\nMichigan has adopted a limited retail choice program. Under Michigan law, our retail customers may choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. As a result, some of our small retail customers have switched to an alternative electric supplier. At December 31, 2022, Michigan law limited customer choice to 10% of an electric utility's Michigan retail load. Our iron ore mine customer, Tilden, is exempt from this 10% cap based on current law, but Tilden is required under a long-term agreement to purchase electric power from UMERC through March 2039. In addition, certain load increases by facilities already using an alternative electric supplier can still be serviced by their alternative electric supplier, when various conditions exist, even if the cap has already been met. When a customer switches to an alternative electric supplier, we continue to provide distribution and customer service functions for the customer.\n\n## Natural Gas Utility Industry\n\nWe offer natural gas transportation services to our customers that elect to purchase natural gas directly from a third-party supplier. Since these transportation customers continue to use our distribution systems to transport natural gas to their facilities, we earn distribution revenues from them. As such, the loss of revenue associated with the cost of natural gas that our transportation customers purchase from third-party suppliers has little impact on our net income, as it is substantially offset by an equal reduction to natural gas costs.\n\n## Wisconsin\n\nOur Wisconsin utilities offer both natural gas transportation service and interruptible natural gas sales to enable customers to better manage their energy costs. Customers continue to switch between firm system supply, interruptible system supply, and transportation service each year as the economics and service options change.\n\nDue to the PSCW's previous proceedings on natural gas industry regulation in a competitive environment, the PSCW currently provides all Wisconsin customer classes with competitive markets the option to choose a third-party natural gas supplier. All of our Wisconsin non-residential customer classes have competitive market choices and, therefore, can purchase natural gas directly from either a thirdparty supplier or their local natural gas utility. Since third-party suppliers can be used in Wisconsin, the PSCW has also adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its natural gas marketing affiliates.\n\nWe are currently unable to predict the impact, if any, of potential future industry restructuring on our results of operations or financial position.\n\n## Illinois\n\nAbsent extraordinary circumstances, potential competitors are not allowed to construct competing natural gas distribution systems in the service territories for PGL and NSG. A charter from the State of Illinois gives PGL the right to provide natural gas distribution service in the City of Chicago as a public utility. Further, the \"first in the field\" and public interest standards limit the ability of potential competitors to operate in an existing utility service territory. In addition, we believe it would be impractical to construct competing duplicate distribution facilities due to the high cost of installation.\n\nSince 2002, PGL and NSG have, under ICC-approved tariffs, provided their customers with the option to choose a third-party natural gas supplier. There are no state laws requiring PGL and NSG to make this choice option available to customers, but since this option is currently provided to our Illinois customers under tariff, ICC approval would be needed to withdraw those tariffs.\n\nAn interstate pipeline may seek to provide transportation service directly to our Illinois end users, which would bypass our natural gas transportation service. However, PGL and NSG have anti-bypass tariffs approved by the ICC, which allow them to negotiate rates with customers that are potential bypass candidates to help ensure that such customers continue to use utility transportation service.",

        "page_content": "## Minnesota\n\nNatural gas utilities in the state of Minnesota do not have exclusive franchise service territories and, as a matter of law and policy, natural gas utilities may compete for new customers. However, natural gas utilities have customarily avoided competing for existing customers of other utilities, as there would be duplicative utility facilities and/or increased costs to customers. If this approach were to change, it could lead to a greater level of competition amongst utilities to obtain customers.\n\nMERC offers both natural gas transportation service and interruptible natural gas sales to enable customers to better manage their energy costs. Customers continue to switch between firm system supply, interruptible system supply, and transportation service each year as the economics and service options change. MERC has provided its commercial and industrial customers with the option to choose a third-party natural gas supplier since 2006. We are not required by the MPUC or state law to make this choice option available to customers, but since this option is currently provided to our Minnesota commercial and industrial customers, we would need MPUC approval to eliminate it.\n\n## Michigan\n\nThe option to choose a third-party natural gas supplier has been provided to UMERC's natural gas customers (formerly WPS's Michigan natural gas customers) since the late 1990s and MGU's customers since 2005. We are not required by the MPSC or state law to make this choice option available to customers, but since this option is currently provided to our Michigan customers, we would need MPSC approval to eliminate it.\n\n## REGULATORY, LEGISLATIVE, AND LEGAL MATTERS\n\n## Regulatory Recovery\n\nOur utilities account for their regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance under the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC. Our rates are determined by various regulatory commissions.\n\nRegulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if the regulated entity believes the recovery of those costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to generic and/or specific orders issued by our regulators. Recovery of the deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval by those regulators. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of the deferred costs, including those referenced below, is not approved by our regulators, the costs would be charged to income in the current period. Regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. We record these items as regulatory liabilities. See Note 6, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, for more information on our regulatory assets and liabilities.\n\nIn January 2014, the ICC approved PGL's use of the QIP rider as a recovery mechanism for costs incurred related to investments in QIP. This rider is subject to an annual reconciliation whereby costs are reviewed for accuracy and prudency. In March 2022, PGL filed its 2021 reconciliation with the ICC, which, along with the 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016 reconciliations, are still pending. In addition, costs incurred during 2022 under the QIP rider are also still subject to reconciliation and review. As of December 31, 2022, there can be no assurance that all costs incurred under the QIP rider during the open reconciliation years, which include 2016 through 2022, will be deemed recoverable by the ICC.\n\nSee Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information regarding recent and pending rate proceedings, orders, and investigations involving our utilities.\n\n## Petitions Before PSCW Regarding Third-Party Financed Distributed Energy Resources\n\nIn May 2022, two petitions were filed with the PSCW requesting a declaratory ruling that the owner of a third-party financed DER is not a \"public utility\" as defined under Wisconsin law and, therefore, is not subject to the PSCW's jurisdiction under any statute or rule regulating public utilities. The parties that filed the petitions provide financing to their customers for installation of DERs (including solar panels and energy storage) on the customer's property. A DER is connected to the host customer's utility meter and is used for the customer's energy needs. It may also be connected to the grid for distribution.\n\nIn July 2022, the PSCW found that the specific facts and circumstances merited the opening of a docket for each petition to consider whether to grant all or part of the requested declaratory ruling.\n\nOn December 1, 2022, the PSCW granted one petitioner's request for a declaratory ruling, finding that the owner of the third-party financed DER at issue in the petitioner's brief is not a public utility under Wisconsin law. The ruling was limited to the specific facts and circumstances of the lease presented in that petition. A second petition is also being considered. Although the finding in the first petition was limited to the specific facts and circumstances of the lease presented in that petition, similar findings or a broader policy position could adversely impact our business operations.",

        "page_content": "## Climate and Equitable Jobs Act\n\nOn September 15, 2021, the state of Illinois signed into law the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. This new legislation includes, among other things, a path for Illinois to move towards 100% clean energy, expanded commitments to energy efficiency and renewable energy, additional consumer protections, and expanded ethics reform. The provisions in this legislation with the potential to have the most significant financial impact on PGL and NSG relate to the new consumer protection requirements.\n\nEffective September 15, 2021, the new legislation prohibits utilities from charging customers a fee when they elect to pay for service with a credit card. Utilities are now required to incur these expenses and seek recovery through a rate proceeding or by establishing a recovery mechanism. In December 2021, the ICC approved the use of a TPTFA rider for PGL. The TPTFA rider allows PGL to recover the costs incurred for these third-party transaction fees. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information on the rider. NSG recovers costs related to these third-party transaction fees through its base rates, effective September 15, 2021.\n\nIn accordance with the new legislation, effective January 1, 2023, natural gas utilities are also no longer allowed to charge late payment fees to low-income residential customers. We are currently evaluating the impact this legislation may have on our future results of operations.\n\n## Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act\n\nThe CBP issued a WRO in June 2021, applicable to certain silica-based products originating from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China (Xinjiang), such as polysilicon, included in the manufacturing of solar panels. In June 2022, the WRO was superseded by the implementation of the UFLPA, which was signed into law by President Biden in December 2021. The UFLPA establishes a rebuttable presumption that any imports wholly or partially manufactured in Xinjiang are prohibited from entering the United States. While our suppliers were able to provide the CBP sufficient documentation to meet WRO compliance requirements, and we expect the same will be true for UFLPA purposes, we cannot currently predict what, if any, impact the UFLPA will have on the overall supply of solar panels into the United States and the related impact to timing and cost of solar projects included in our capital plan.\n\n## United States Department of Commerce Complaints\n\nIn August 2021, a group of anonymous domestic solar manufacturers filed a petition (AD/CVD) with the DOC seeking to impose new tariffs on solar panels and cells imported from several countries, including Malaysia, Vietnam, and Thailand. The petitioners claimed that Chinese solar manufacturers are shifting products to these countries to avoid the tariffs required on products imported from China. In November 2021, the DOC rejected this petition. In denying the petition, the DOC cited the anonymous group's refusal of the DOC's request to provide more detail and identify its members due to the members' concerns about retribution from the dominant Chinese solar industry.\n\nIn February 2022, a California based company filed a petition (AD/CVD) with the DOC seeking to impose new tariffs on solar panels and cells imported from multiple countries, including Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia. While the petition is similar to the one rejected by the DOC in November 2021, there are notable differences. The group added Cambodia to the petition and requested that the DOC conduct a country-wide inquiry into each of the four countries. In March 2022, the DOC decided to act on the February petition and investigate the claim. On December 2, 2022, the DOC announced its preliminary determination that certain companies are circumventing anti-dumping and countervailing duty orders on solar cells and modules from China. As the next step, the DOC will conduct in-person audits to verify the information that was the basis of the finding. If the DOC makes a final determination, which is currently expected in the second quarter of 2023, that such circumvention is occurring it would be able to apply any final tariffs retroactively to November 4, 2021. If imposed, the new tariffs could further disrupt the supply of solar modules to the United States, and could impact the cost and timing of our solar projects.\n\nIn June 2022, the Biden Administration used its executive powers to issue a 24-month tariff moratorium on solar panels manufactured in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. The moratorium comes as a direct response to concerns raised about the adverse impact from the ongoing DOC complaint on the U.S. solar industry. As the DOC will continue its investigation discussed above, companies may still be subject to tariffs after the moratorium ends; however, U.S. companies will reportedly be exempt from any retroactive tariffs that previously could have applied. The Biden Administration also announced that it plans to invoke the Defense Production Act to accelerate the production of solar panels in the U.S. The Biden Administration's actions did not address whether WROs applied to panels under previous complaints would be affected.\n\n## Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\n\nIn November 2021, President Biden signed into law the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which provides for approximately $1.2 trillion of federal spending over the next five years, including approximately $85 billion for investments in power, utilities, and renewables infrastructure across the United States. We expect funding from this Act will support the work we are doing to reduce GHG emissions, increase EV charging, and strengthen and protect the energy grid. Funding in the Act should also help to expand emerging technologies, like hydrogen and carbon management, as we continue the transition to a clean energy future. We believe the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act will accelerate investment in projects that will help us meet our net zero emission goals to the benefit of our customers, the communities we serve, and our company.",

        "page_content": "## Inflation Reduction Act\n\nIn August 2022, President Biden signed into law the IRA, which provides for $258 billion in energy-related provisions over a 10-year period. The provisions of the IRA are intended to, among other things, lower gasoline and electricity prices, incentivize domestic clean energy investment, manufacturing, and production, and promote reductions in carbon emissions. We believe that we and our customers can benefit from the IRA's provisions that extend tax benefits for renewable technologies, increase or restore higher rates for PTCs, add an option to claim PTCs for solar projects, expand qualified ITC facilities to include standalone energy storage, and its provision to allow companies to transfer tax credits generated from renewable projects. The IRA also implements a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax and a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases. Although significant regulatory guidance is expected on the tax provisions in the IRA, we currently believe the provisions on alternative minimum tax and stock repurchases will not have a material impact on us. Overall, we believe the IRA will help reduce our cost of investing in projects that will support our commitment to reduce emissions and provide customers affordable, reliable, and clean energy over the longer term.\n\n## Return on Equity Incentive for Membership in a Transmission Organization\n\nThe FERC currently allows transmission utilities, including ATC, to increase their ROE by 50 basis points as an incentive for membership in a transmission organization, such as MISO. This incentive was established to stimulate infrastructure development and to support the evolving electric grid. However, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was issued by the FERC on April 15, 2021 proposing to limit the 50 basis point increase in ROE to only be available to transmission utilities initially joining a transmission organization for the first three years of membership. If this proposal becomes a final rule, ATC would be required to submit, within 30 days of the final rule's effective date, a compliance filing eliminating the 50 basis point incentive from its tariff. As a result, we estimate that this proposal, if adopted, would reduce our future after-tax equity earnings from ATC by approximately $7 million annually on a prospective basis. The transmission costs WE, WPS, and UMERC are required to pay ATC after the effective date would also be reduced by this proposal.\n\n## American Transmission Company Allowed Return on Equity Complaints\n\nThe ROE allowed by the FERC helps determine how much transmission owners, such as ATC, earn on their transmission assets as well as how much consumers pay for those assets. When two complaints were filed arguing the base ROE for MISO transmission owners, including ATC, was too high, the FERC started analyzing the base ROE for these transmission owners.\n\nThe base ROEs listed in the two ROE complaint sections below do not include the 50 basis point ROE incentive currently provided for membership in a transmission organization. See the Return on Equity Incentive for Membership in a Transmission Organization section above for more information on this incentive.\n\nFirst Return on Equity Complaint - In November 2013, a group of MISO industrial customers filed a complaint with the FERC asking that the FERC order a reduction to the base ROE used by MISO transmission owners, including ATC, from 12.2% to 9.15%. Due to this complaint, the FERC and the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued the following orders and opinion. The refunds resulting from these orders and opinion are also described below.\n\n- \u00b7 Orders Issued by the FERC\n- \u00b7 September 2016 Order - On September 28, 2016, the FERC issued an order reducing the base ROE for MISO transmission owners to 10.32% for the period covered by the first complaint, November 12, 2013 through February 11, 2015 and September 28, 2016 going forward.\n- \u00b7 November 2019 Order - On November 21, 2019, the FERC issued another order after directing MISO transmission owners and other stakeholders to provide briefs and comments on a proposed change to the methodology for calculating base ROE. In this order, the FERC expanded its base ROE methodology to include the capital-asset pricing model in addition to the discounted cash flow model to better reflect how investors make their investment decisions. The FERC also rejected the use of the risk premium model as part of its base ROE methodology in this order. The FERC's modified methodology further reduced the base ROE for all MISO transmission owners, including ATC, to 9.88% for the period covered by the first complaint. In response to this FERC decision, requests for the FERC to rehear the November 2019 Order in its entirety were filed by various parties.\n- \u00b7 May 2020 Order - On May 21, 2020, the FERC issued an order that granted in part and denied in part the requests to rehear the November 2019 Order. In this May 2020 Order, the FERC made additional revisions to its base ROE methodology, including reinstating the use of the risk premium model. The additional revisions made by the FERC increased the base ROE for all MISO transmission owners, including ATC, from the 9.88% authorized in the November 2019 Order to 10.02% for the period covered by the first complaint. Various parties then filed requests to rehear certain parts of the May 2020 Order with the FERC.\n- \u00b7 November 2020 Order - In response to the rehearing requests filed concerning certain parts of the May 2020 Order, the FERC issued an order in November 2020 that confirmed the ROE previously authorized in its May 2020 Order.\n- \u00b7 Refunds - Due to the base ROE changes resulting from these FERC orders, ATC was required to provide refunds, with interest, for the 15-month refund period from November 12, 2013 through February 11, 2015 and for the period from September 28, 2016 through November 19, 2020. In January 2022, ATC completed providing WE, WPS, and UMERC with the net refunds related to the transmission costs they paid during the period covered by the first complaint. The refunds were applied to WE's and WPS's PSCW-approved escrow accounting for transmission expense.\n- \u00b7 Opinion Issued by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals\n- \u00b7 August 2022 Decision - Since several petitions for review were filed with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals concerning this ROE complaint, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion on August 9, 2022 addressing these petitions. In its August 2022",

        "page_content": "Decision, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the FERC failed to adequately explain why it reinstated the use of the risk premium model as part of its ROE methodology in its May 2020 Order after previously rejecting the model in its November 2019 Order. Due to this ruling, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the FERC's previous orders and remanded the issue of determining an appropriate base ROE for MISO transmission owners back to the FERC for additional proceedings. As of December 31, 2022, the FERC had not provided a ruling in response to the August 2022 Decision issued by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n- \u00b7 Refunds - Since the FERC is required to conduct more proceedings, additional refunds could still be required for the 15-month period from November 12, 2013 through February 11, 2015 and for the period from September 28, 2016 until the date of any future order. Therefore, ATC recorded a liability on its financials for these potential refunds, which reduced our equity earnings from ATC by $18.6 million during the third quarter of 2022. The liability recorded by ATC is based on a 9.88% base ROE for the first complaint period. If it is ultimately determined a refund is required for the first complaint period, we would not expect any such refund to have a material impact on our financial statements or results of operations in the future. In addition, WE, WPS, and UMERC would be entitled to receive a portion of the refund from ATC for the benefit of their customers.\n\nSecond Return on Equity Complaint - In February 2015, a second complaint was filed with the FERC requesting a reduction in the base ROE used by MISO transmission owners, including ATC, to 8.67%, with a refund effective date retroactive to February 12, 2015. To resolve this complaint, the following orders and opinion were issued by the FERC and the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The orders and opinion discussed below are the same orders and opinion described above in the first complaint section.\n\n- \u00b7 Orders Issued by the FERC\n- \u00b7 November 2019 Order - Similar to the first complaint, the November 2019 Order stated the newly calculated base ROE of 9.88% was also reasonable for the period covered by the second complaint, February 12, 2015 through May 10, 2016. However, in the November 2019 Order, the FERC relied on certain provisions of the Federal Power Act to dismiss the second complaint and to determine refunds were not allowed for this period.\n- \u00b7 May 2020 Order - In its May 2020 Order, the FERC stated the newly calculated base ROE of 10.02% was also reasonable for the period covered by the second complaint. However, the FERC relied on the same provisions of the Federal Power Act to again dismiss the complaint and to determine refunds were not allowed for this period. In addition, the FERC denied in its May 2020 Order the requests to rehear both the dismissal of the second complaint and the determination that no refunds are allowed for the second complaint period.\n- \u00b7 Opinion Issued by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals\n- \u00b7 August 2022 Decision - The August 2022 Decision issued by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed both the FERC's dismissal of the second complaint and the FERC's finding that no refunds are allowed for the second complaint period. Therefore, during the third quarter of 2022, we reduced the liability previously recorded for the potential refunds related to the second complaint period by $39.1 million, which increased our equity earnings from ATC.\n\n## Environmental Matters\n\nSee Note 24, Commitments and Contingencies, for a discussion of certain environmental matters affecting us, including rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, land quality, and climate change.\n\n## MARKET RISKS AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT RISKS\n\nWe are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environments in which those businesses operate. These risks, described in further detail below, include but are not limited to:\n\n## Commodity Costs\n\nIn the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations in the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power, and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. We manage our fuel and natural gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long-term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas, and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the risk of price volatility through natural gas and electric hedging programs.\n\nEmbedded within our utilities' rates are amounts to recover fuel, natural gas, and purchased power costs. Our utilities have recovery mechanisms in place that generally allow them to recover or refund all or a portion of the changes in prudently incurred fuel, natural gas, and purchased power costs from rate case-approved amounts.\n\nHigher commodity costs can increase our working capital requirements, result in higher gross receipts taxes, and lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and/or fuel substitution. Higher commodity costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write-offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. See Note 5, Credit Losses, for more information on riders and other mechanisms that allow for cost recovery or refund of uncollectible expense.\n\nDue to the cold temperatures, wind, snow and ice throughout the central part of the country during February 2021, the cost of gas purchased for our natural gas utility customers was temporarily driven higher than our normal winter weather expectations. As a result",

        "page_content": "of this extreme weather event, we requested approval for the recovery of an additional $322 million of natural gas costs across our service territories, above what was either set as a benchmark in our respective GCRMs or included in rates. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information on our recovery efforts associated with these costs.\n\n## Weather\n\nOur utilities' rates are based upon estimated normal temperatures. Our electric utility margins are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season and, to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our natural gas utility margins are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. PGL, NSG, and MERC have decoupling mechanisms in place that help reduce the impacts of weather. Decoupling mechanisms differ by state and allow utilities to recover or refund certain differences between actual and authorized margins. A summary of actual weather information in our utilities' service territories during 2022 and 2021, as measured by degree days, can be found in Results of Operations.\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk resulting from our short-term and long-term borrowings and projected near-term debt financing needs. We manage exposure to interest rate risk by limiting the amount of our variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes on interest rates. When it is advantageous to do so, we enter into long-term fixed rate debt. We may also enter into derivative financial instruments, such as swaps, to mitigate interest rate exposure.\n\nBased on the variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021, a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of one percentage point would have increased annual interest expense by $21.4 million and $24.0 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. This sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in interest rates, with no other changes for the remainder of the period.\n\n## Marketable Securities Return\n\nWe use various trusts to fund our pension and OPEB obligations. These trusts invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. The financial risks associated with investment returns are mitigated at our Wisconsin utilities through the requirement that WE, WPS, and WG implement escrow accounting treatment for pension and OPEB costs in 2023 and 2024, as required by the December 2022 rate order issued by the PSCW. We also believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated at our other utilities through future rate actions by regulators. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information on 2023 and 2024 rates at our Wisconsin utilities.\n\nThe fair value of our trust fund assets and expected long-term returns were approximately:\n\n| (in millions)       | As of  December 31, 2022   | Expected Return  on Assets in 2023   |\n|---------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Pension trust funds | $  2,628.0                 | 6.88 %                               |\n| OPEB trust funds    | $  835.3                   | 7.00 %                               |\n\nFiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. The targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long-term financial stability for the plans, and maintain funded levels which meet long-term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near-term benefit payments. Investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers.\n\nWe consult with our investment advisors on an annual basis to help us forecast expected long-term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted-average of long-term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the funds.\n\n## Economic Conditions\n\nWe have electric and natural gas utility operations that serve customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, and Michigan. As such, we are exposed to market risks in the regional Midwest economy. In addition, any economic downturn or disruption of national or international markets could adversely affect the financial condition of our customers and demand for their products, which could affect their demand for our products.\n\n## Inflation and Supply Chain Disruptions\n\nWe continue to monitor the impact of inflation and supply chain disruptions. We monitor the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, regulatory and environmental compliance costs, and other costs in order to minimize inflationary effects in future years, to the extent possible, through pricing strategies, productivity improvements, and cost reductions. We monitor the global supply chain, and related disruptions, in order to ensure we are able to procure the necessary materials and other resources necessary to both maintain our energy services in a safe and reliable manner and to grow our infrastructure in accordance with our capital plan.",

        "page_content": "For additional information concerning other risk factors, including market risks, see the Cautionary Statement Regarding ForwardLooking Information at the beginning of this report.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in compliance with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies, as well as the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments that could have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures. Judgments regarding future events may include the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges, and anticipated recovery of costs. Actual results may differ significantly from estimated amounts based on varying assumptions.\n\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The following is a list of accounting policies and estimates that require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments and may change in subsequent periods.\n\n## Regulatory Accounting\n\nOur utility operations follow the guidance under the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 980). Our financial statements reflect the effects of the ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating us. Certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as revenues and expenses are deferred as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers, as authorized by our regulators.\n\nFuture recovery of regulatory assets, including the timeliness of recovery and our ability to earn a reasonable return, is not assured and is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness. Once approved, the regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into earnings over the rate recovery or refund period. If recovery or refund of costs is not approved or is no longer considered probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in current period earnings. Management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as changes in the regulatory environment, earnings from our electric and natural gas utility operations, rate orders issued by our regulators, historical decisions by our regulators regarding regulatory assets and liabilities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation.\n\nThe application of the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC would be discontinued if all or a separable portion of our utility operations no longer met the criteria for application. Our regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off to income as an unusual or infrequently occurring item in the period in which discontinuation occurred. See Note 6, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, for more information on our regulatory assets and liabilities.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment tests for all of our reporting units that carried a goodwill balance as of July 1, 2022. No impairments were recorded as a result of these tests. For all of our reporting units, the fair values calculated in step one of the test were greater than their carrying values. The fair values for the reporting units were calculated using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. The income approach received a weighting of 60% while the market approach received a weighting of 40% to determine an overall valuation.\n\nFor the income approach, we used internal forecasts to project cash flows. Any forecast contains a degree of uncertainty, and changes in these cash flows could significantly increase or decrease the calculated fair value of a reporting unit. Since all of our reporting units are regulated, a fair recovery of and return on costs prudently incurred to serve customers is assumed. An unfavorable outcome in a rate case could cause the fair values of our reporting units to decrease.\n\nKey assumptions used in the income approach include ROEs, the long-term growth rates used to determine terminal values at the end of the discrete forecast period, and the discount rates. The discount rate is applied to estimated future cash flows and is one of the most significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the income approach. As interest rates rise, the calculated fair values will decrease. The discount rate is based on the weighted-average cost of capital for each reporting unit, taking into account both the aftertax cost of debt and cost of equity. The terminal year ROE for each utility is driven by its current allowed ROE. The terminal growth rate is based primarily on a combination of historical and forecasted statistics for real gross domestic product and personal income for each utility service area.\n\nFor the market approach, we used a higher weighting for the guideline public company method than the guideline merged and acquired company method due to a low number of mergers and acquisitions in recent years. The guideline public company method uses financial metrics from similar publicly traded companies to determine fair value. The guideline merged and acquired company method calculates fair value by analyzing the actual prices paid for recent mergers and acquisitions in the industry. We applied multiples derived from these two methods to the appropriate operating metrics for our reporting units to determine fair value.\n\nThe underlying assumptions and estimates used in the impairment tests were made as of a point in time. Subsequent changes in these assumptions and estimates could change the results of the tests.",

        "page_content": "For all of our reporting units that carried a goodwill balance at July 1, 2022, the fair value exceeded its carrying value by over 50%. Based on these results, our reporting units are not at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test.\n\nSee Note 10, Goodwill and Intangibles, for more information.\n\n## Long-Lived Assets\n\nIn accordance with ASC 980-360, Regulated Operations - Property, Plant, and Equipment, we periodically assess the recoverability of certain long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those long-lived assets may not be recoverable. Examples of events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the market price, a significant change in use, a regulatory decision related to recovery of assets from customers, adverse legal factors or a change in business climate, operating or cash flow losses, or an expectation that the asset might be sold or abandoned. See Note 1(k), Asset Impairment, for our policy on accounting for abandonments.\n\nPerforming an impairment evaluation involves a significant degree of estimation and judgment by management in areas such as identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets, and developing the undiscounted future cash flows. An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset in comparison to the fair value of the asset. The fair value of the asset is assessed using various methods, including recent comparable third-party sales for our nonregulated operations, internally developed discounted cash flow analysis, expected recovery of regulated assets, and analysis from outside advisors.\n\nSee Note 7, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information on our generating units probable of being retired. See Note 6, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, and Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information on our retired generating units, including various approvals we received from the FERC and the PSCW.\n\n## Pension and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits\n\nThe costs of providing non-contributory defined pension benefits and OPEB, described in Note 20, Employee Benefits, are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience.\n\nPension and OPEB costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels, and employment periods), the level of contributions made to the plans, and earnings on plan assets. Pension and OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets, mortality and discount rates, and expected health care cost trends. Changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and OPEB costs.\n\nPension and OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity and fixed income market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods. Changes in benefit costs are mitigated at our Wisconsin utilities through the requirement that WE, WPS, and WG implement escrow accounting treatment for pension and OPEB costs in 2023 and 2024, as required by the December 2022 rate orders issued by the PSCW. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information on 2023 and 2024 rates at our Wisconsin utilities. We believe that changes to benefit costs at our other utilities would be recovered or refunded through the ratemaking process.\n\nThe following table shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the projected benefit obligation and the reported net periodic pension cost (including amounts capitalized to our balance sheets). Each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only.\n\n| Actuarial Assumption (in millions, except percentages)   | Percentage-Point  Change in  Assumption   | Impact on  Projected Benefit  Obligation   | Impact on 2022 Pension Cost   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Discount rate                                            | (0.5)                                     | $  114.5                                   | $  17.8                       |\n| Discount rate                                            | 0.5                                       | (101.6)                                    | (11.1)                        |\n| Rate of return on plan assets                            | (0.5)                                     | N/A                                        | 14.8                          |\n| Rate of return on plan assets                            | 0.5                                       | N/A                                        | (14.8)                        |",

From the hypothetical bond portfolios, a single rate is determined that equates the market value of the bonds purchased to the discounted value of the plans' expected future benefit payments.\n\nWe establish our expected return on assets based on consideration of historical and projected asset class returns, as well as the target allocations of the benefit trust portfolios. The assumed long-term rate of return on pension plan assets was 6.88% in 2022 and 2021, and 6.87% in 2020. The actual rate of return on pension plan assets, net of fees, was (14.03)%, 9.5%, and 12.65%, in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\n\nIn selecting assumed health care cost trend rates, past performance and forecasts of health care costs are considered. For more information on health care cost trend rates and a table showing future payments that we expect to make for our pension and OPEB, see Note 20, Employee Benefits.\n\n## Unbilled Revenues\n\nWe record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated.\n\nUnbilled revenues are estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses, and applicable customer rates. Energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in rate mix due to fluctuations in usage patterns of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total unbilled utility revenues were $663.1 million and $531.7 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The changes in unbilled revenues are primarily due to changes in the cost of natural gas, weather, and customer rates.\n\n## Income Tax Expense\n\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets. The assumptions involved are supported by historical data, reasonable projections, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. Significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 1(q), Income Taxes, and Note 16, Income Taxes, for a discussion of accounting for income taxes.\n\nWe are required to estimate income taxes for each of our applicable tax jurisdictions as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements. This process involves estimating current income tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, for income tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our balance sheets. We also assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance, which is offset by an adjustment to income tax expense in our income statements.\n\nUncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes and regulations, the outcomes of tax audits and appeals, changes in income tax law, enacted tax rates or amounts subject to income tax, and changes in the regulatory treatment of any tax reform benefits requires that judgments and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of effective tax rates. Only income tax benefits that meet the \"more likely than not\" recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized. Unrecognized tax benefits are re-evaluated quarterly and changes are recorded based on new information, including the issuance of relevant guidance by the courts or tax authorities and developments occurring in the examinations of our tax returns.\n\nWe expect our 2023 annual effective tax rate to be between 13.0% and 14.0%. Our effective tax rate calculations are revised every quarter based on the best available year-end tax assumptions, adjusted in the following year after returns are filed. Tax accrual estimates are trued-up to the actual amounts claimed on the tax returns and further adjusted after examinations by taxing authorities, as needed.",

        "page_content": "## WEC ENERGY GROUP, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## NOTE 1-SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n(a) Nature of Operations -WEC Energy Group serves approximately 1.6 million electric customers and 3.0 million natural gas customers, owns approximately 60% of ATC, and owns majority interests in multiple wind generating facilities as part of its non-utility energy infrastructure segment.\n\nAs used in these notes, the term \"financial statements\" refers to the consolidated financial statements. This includes the income statements, statements of comprehensive income, balance sheets, statements of cash flows, and statements of equity, unless otherwise noted. On our financial statements, we consolidate our majority-owned subsidiaries which we control, and VIEs of which we are the primary beneficiary. We reflect noncontrolling interests for the portion of entities that we do not own as a component of consolidated equity separate from the equity attributable to our shareholders. The noncontrolling interests that we reported as equity on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 related to the minority interests held by third parties in the wind generating facilities that are included in our non-utility energy infrastructure segment.\n\nOur financial statements include the accounts of WEC Energy Group, a diversified energy holding company, and the accounts of our subsidiaries in the following reportable segments:\n\n- \u00b7 Wisconsin segment - Consists of WE, WPS, and WG, which are engaged primarily in the generation of electricity and the distribution of electricity and natural gas in Wisconsin; and UMERC, which generates electricity and distributes electricity and natural gas to customers located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\n- \u00b7 Illinois segment - Consists of PGL and NSG, which are engaged primarily in the distribution of natural gas in Illinois.\n- \u00b7 Other states segment - Consists of MERC and MGU, which are engaged primarily in the distribution of natural gas in Minnesota and Michigan, respectively.\n- \u00b7 Electric transmission segment - Consists of our approximate 60% ownership interest in ATC, a for-profit, electric transmission company regulated by the FERC and certain state regulatory commissions, and our approximate 75% ownership interest in ATC Holdco, which invests in transmission-related projects outside of ATC's traditional footprint.\n- \u00b7 Non-utility energy infrastructure segment - Consists of We Power, which is principally engaged in the ownership of electric power generating facilities for long-term lease to WE, and Bluewater, which owns underground natural gas storage facilities in Michigan. WECI, which holds our ownership interests in several wind generating facilities, is also included in this segment. See Note 2, Acquisitions, for more information on the recently acquired WECI renewable generating facilities.\n- \u00b7 Corporate and other segment - Consists of the WEC Energy Group holding company, the Integrys holding company, the PELLC holding company, Wispark, Wisvest, WECC, WBS, and also included the operations of PDL prior to the sale of its remaining solar facilities in the fourth quarter of 2020. See Note 3, Dispositions, for more information on the sale of these solar facilities.\n\nInvestments in companies not controlled by us, but over which we have significant influence regarding the operating and financial policies of the investee, are accounted for using the equity method. We use the cumulative earnings approach for classifying distributions received in the statements of cash flows. Under the cumulative earnings approach, we compare the distributions received to cumulative equity method earnings since inception. Any distributions received up to the amount of cumulative equity earnings are considered a return on investment and classified in operating activities. Any excess distributions are considered a return of investment and classified in investing activities.\n\nOur financial statements also reflect our proportionate interests in certain jointly owned utility facilities. See Note 8, Jointly Owned Utility Facilities, for more information.\n\n- (b) Basis of Presentation -We prepare our financial statements in conformity with GAAP. We make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n- (c) Cash and Cash Equivalents -Cash and cash equivalents include marketable debt securities with an original maturity of three months or less.\n- (d) Operating Revenues -The following discussion includes our significant accounting policies related to operating revenues. For additional required disclosures on disaggregation of operating revenues, see Note 4, Operating Revenues.\n\n## Revenues from Contracts with Customers\n\nElectric Utility Operating Revenues - Electricity sales to residential and commercial and industrial customers are generally accomplished through requirements contracts, which provide for the delivery of as much electricity as the customer needs. These contracts represent discrete deliveries of electricity and consist of one distinct performance obligation satisfied over time, as the",

        "page_content": "electricity is delivered and consumed by the customer simultaneously. For our Wisconsin residential and commercial and industrial customers and the majority of our Michigan residential and commercial and industrial customers, our performance obligation is bundled to consist of both the sale and the delivery of the electric commodity. In our Michigan service territory, a limited number of residential and commercial and industrial customers can purchase the commodity from a third party. In this case, the delivery of the electricity represents our sole performance obligation.\n\nThe transaction price of the performance obligations for residential and commercial and industrial customers is valued using the rates, charges, terms, and conditions of service included in the tariffs of our regulated electric utilities, which have been approved by state regulators. These rates often have a fixed component customer charge and a usage-based variable component charge. We recognize revenue for the fixed component customer charge monthly using a time-based output method. We recognize revenue for the usagebased variable component charge using an output method based on the quantity of electricity delivered each month. Our retail electric rates in Wisconsin include base amounts for fuel and purchased power costs, which also impact our revenues. The electric fuel rules set by the PSCW allow us to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, under- or over-collections of actual fuel and purchased power costs beyond a 2% price variance from the costs included in the rates charged to customers. Our electric utilities monitor the deferral of under-collected costs to ensure that it does not cause them to earn a greater ROE than authorized by the PSCW. In contrast, the rates of our Michigan retail electric customers include recovery of fuel and purchased power costs on a one-for-one basis. In addition, the Wisconsin residential tariffs of WE and WPS include a mechanism for cost recovery or refund of uncollectible expense based on the difference between actual uncollectible write-offs and the amounts recovered in rates.\n\nWholesale customers who resell power can choose to either bundle capacity and electricity services together under one contract with a supplier or purchase capacity and electricity separately from multiple suppliers. Furthermore, wholesale customers can choose to have our utilities provide generation to match the customer's load, similar to requirements contracts, or they can purchase specified quantities of electricity and capacity. Contracts with wholesale customers that include capacity bundled with the delivery of electricity contain two performance obligations, as capacity and electricity are often transacted separately in the marketplace at the wholesale level. When recognizing revenue associated with these contracts, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Revenue is recognized as control of each individual component is transferred to the customer. Electricity is the primary product sold by our electric utilities and represents a single performance obligation satisfied over time through discrete deliveries to a customer. Revenue from electricity sales is generally recognized as units are produced and delivered to the customer within the production month. Capacity represents the reservation of an electric generating facility and conveys the ability to call on a plant to produce electricity when needed by the customer. The nature of our performance obligation as it relates to capacity is to stand ready to deliver power. This represents a single performance obligation transferred over time, which generally represents a monthly obligation. Accordingly, capacity revenue is recognized on a monthly basis.\n\nThe transaction price of the performance obligations for wholesale customers is valued using the rates, charges, terms, and conditions of service, which have been approved by the FERC. These wholesale rates include recovery of fuel and purchased power costs from customers on a one-for-one basis. For the majority of our wholesale customers, the price billed for energy and capacity is a formulabased rate. Formula-based rates initially set a customer's current year rates based on the previous year's expenses. This is a predetermined formula derived from the utility's costs and a reasonable rate of return. Because these rates are eventually trued up to reflect actual, current-year costs, they represent a form of variable consideration in certain circumstances. The variable consideration is estimated and recognized over time as wholesale customers receive and consume the capacity and electricity services.\n\nWe are an active participant in the MISO Energy Markets, where we bid our generation into the Day Ahead and Real Time markets and procure electricity for our retail and wholesale customers at prices determined by the MISO Energy Markets. Purchase and sale transactions are recorded using settlement information provided by MISO. These purchase and sale transactions are accounted for on a net hourly position. Net purchases in a single hour are recorded as purchased power in cost of sales, and net sales in a single hour are recorded as resale revenues on our income statements. For resale revenues, our performance obligation is created only when electricity is sold into the MISO Energy Markets.\n\nFor all of our customers, consistent with the timing of when we recognize revenue, customer billings generally occur on a monthly basis, with payments typically due in full within 30 days.\n\nNatural Gas Utility Operating Revenues - We recognize natural gas utility operating revenues under requirements contracts with residential, commercial and industrial, and transportation customers served under the tariffs of our regulated utilities. Tariffs provide our customers with the standard terms and conditions, including rates, related to the services offered. Requirements contracts provide for the delivery of as much natural gas as the customer needs. These requirements contracts represent discrete deliveries of natural gas and constitute a single performance obligation satisfied over time. Our performance obligation is both created and satisfied with the transfer of control of natural gas upon delivery to the customer. For most of our customers, natural gas is delivered and consumed by the customer simultaneously. A performance obligation can be bundled to consist of both the sale and the delivery of the natural gas commodity. In certain of our service territories, customers can purchase the commodity from a third party. In this case, the performance obligation only includes the delivery of the natural gas to the customer.\n\nThe transaction price of the performance obligations for our natural gas customers is valued using the rates, charges, terms, and conditions of service included in the tariffs of our regulated utilities, which have been approved by state regulators. These rates often have a fixed component customer charge and a usage-based variable component charge. We recognize revenue for the fixed component customer charge monthly using a time-based output method. We recognize revenue for the usage-based variable component charge using an output method based on natural gas delivered each month.",

        "page_content": "The tariffs of our natural gas utilities include various rate mechanisms that allow them to recover or refund changes in prudently incurred costs from rate case-approved amounts. The rates for all of our natural gas utilities include one-for-one recovery mechanisms for natural gas commodity costs. Under normal circumstances, we defer any difference between actual natural gas costs incurred and costs recovered through rates as a current asset or liability. The deferred balance is returned to or recovered from customers at intervals throughout the year. However, as a result of the extreme weather in the Midwest in February 2021, the cost of gas purchased for our natural gas customers was temporarily driven significantly higher than our normal winter weather expectations. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information on the recovery of these high natural gas costs.\n\nIn addition, the rates of PGL and NSG, and the residential tariffs of WE, WPS, and WG, include riders or other mechanisms for cost recovery or refund of uncollectible expense based on the difference between actual uncollectible write-offs and the amounts recovered in rates. The rates of PGL and NSG include riders for cost recovery of both environmental cleanup costs and energy conservation and management program costs. Finally, PGL's rates include a rider for pass through of income tax expense changes resulting from the Tax Legislation and a cost recovery mechanism for SMP costs, and similarly, the rates of MERC and MGU include riders to recover costs incurred to replace or modify natural gas facilities.\n\nConsistent with the timing of when we recognize revenue, customer billings generally occur on a monthly basis, with payments typically due in full within 30 days.\n\nOther Natural Gas Operating Revenues - We have other natural gas operating revenues from Bluewater, which is in our non-utility energy infrastructure segment. Bluewater has entered into long-term service agreements for natural gas storage services with WE, WPS, and WG, and also provides limited service to unaffiliated customers. All amounts associated with the service agreements with WE, WPS, and WG have been eliminated at the consolidated level.\n\nOther Non-Utility Operating Revenues - Wind generation revenues from WECI's ownership interests in wind generation facilities continued to grow in 2022. See Note 2, Acquisitions, for more information on recent acquisitions. Most of these wind generation facilities have offtake agreements with unaffiliated third parties for all of the energy to be produced by the facility, some of which are bundled with capacity and RECs. We consider bundled energy, capacity and RECs within these offtake agreements to be distinct performance obligations as each are often transacted separately in the marketplace.\n\nWhen recognizing revenue associated with these contracts, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Revenue is recognized as control of each individual component is transferred to the customer. Revenue from the sale of this renewable energy is generally recognized as units are produced and delivered to the customer within the production month. Capacity represents the reservation of the renewable generation facility and conveys the ability to call on the wind facility to produce electricity when needed by the customer. The nature of our performance obligation as it relates to capacity is to stand ready to deliver power. This represents a single performance obligation transferred over time, which generally represents a monthly obligation. Accordingly, capacity revenue is recognized on a monthly basis. The performance obligation for RECs is recognized at a point-in-time; however, the timing of revenue recognition is the same, as the generation of renewable energy and the recognition of REC revenues generally occur concurrently.\n\nNon-utility operating revenues are also derived from servicing appliances for customers at MERC. These contracts customarily have a duration of one year or less and consist of a single performance obligation satisfied over time. We use a time-based output method to recognize revenues monthly for the service fee.\n\nConsistent with the timing of when we recognize revenue, customer billings for the wind generation and servicing revenues generally occur on a monthly basis, with payments typically due in full within 30 days.\n\nAs part of the construction of the We Power electric generating units, we capitalized interest during construction, which is included in property, plant, and equipment. As allowed by the PSCW, we collected these carrying costs from WE's utility customers during construction. The equity portion of these carrying costs was recorded as a contract liability, which is presented as deferred revenue, net on our balance sheets. We continually amortize the deferred carrying costs to revenues over the related lease term that We Power has with WE. During 2022, 2021, and 2020, we recorded $23.4 million, $23.3 million, and $22.9 million, respectively, of revenues related to these deferred carrying costs.\n\n## Other Operating Revenues\n\nAlternative Revenues - Alternative revenues are created from programs authorized by regulators that allow our utilities to record additional revenues by adjusting rates in the future, usually as a surcharge applied to future billings, in response to past activities or completed events. Alternative revenue programs allow compensation for the effects of weather abnormalities, other external factors, or demand side management initiatives. Alternative revenue programs can also provide incentive awards if the utility achieves certain objectives and in other limited circumstances. We record alternative revenues when the regulator-specified conditions for recognition have been met. We reverse these alternative revenues as the customer is billed, at which time this revenue is presented as revenues from contracts with customers.",

        "page_content": "Below is a summary of the alternative revenue programs at our utilities:\n\n- \u00b7 The rates of PGL, NSG, and MERC include decoupling mechanisms. These mechanisms differ by state and allow the utilities to recover or refund the differences between actual and authorized margins for certain customer classes. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\n- \u00b7 PGL and NSG were authorized to implement a SPC rider for the recovery of incremental direct costs resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, foregone late fees and reconnection charges, and the costs associated with their bill payment assistance programs. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\n- \u00b7 MERC's rates include a CIP rider, which includes a financial incentive for meeting energy savings goals.\n- \u00b7 WE and WPS provide wholesale electric service to customers under market-based rates and FERC formula rates. The customer is charged a base rate each year based upon a formula using prior year actual costs and customer demand. A true-up is calculated based on the difference between the amount billed to customers for the demand component of their rates and what the actual cost of service was for the year. The true-up can result in an amount that we will recover from or refund to the customer. We consider the true-up portion of the wholesale electric revenues to be alternative revenues.\n- (e) Credit Losses -The following discussion includes our significant accounting policies related to credit losses. For additional required disclosures on credit losses, see Note 5, Credit Losses.\n\nEffective January 1, 2020, we adopted FASB ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, using the modified retrospective transition method. This ASU amends the impairment model to utilize an expected loss methodology in place of the incurred loss methodology for financial instruments, including trade receivables. The amendment requires entities to consider a broader range of information to estimate expected credit losses, which may result in earlier recognition of loss. The cumulative effect of adopting this standard was not significant to our financial statements.\n\nOur exposure to credit losses is related to our accounts receivable and unbilled revenue balances, which are primarily generated from the sale of electricity and natural gas by our regulated utility operations. Credit losses associated with our utility operations are analyzed at the reportable segment level as we believe contract terms, political and economic risks, and the regulatory environment are similar at this level as our reportable segments are generally based on the geographic location of the underlying utility operations.\n\nWe have an accounts receivable and unbilled revenue balance associated with our non-utility energy infrastructure segment, related to the sale of electricity from our majority-owned wind generating facilities through agreements with several large high credit quality counterparties.\n\nWe evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable and unbilled revenue balances considering a combination of factors. For some of our larger customers and also in circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer's inability to meet its financial obligations to us, we record a specific allowance for credit losses against amounts due in order to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. For all other customers, we use the accounts receivable aging method to calculate an allowance for credit losses. Using this method, we classify accounts receivable into different aging buckets and calculate a reserve percentage for each aging bucket based upon historical loss rates. The calculated reserve percentages are updated on at least an annual basis, in order to ensure recent macroeconomic, political, and regulatory trends are captured in the calculation, to the extent possible. Risks identified that we do not believe are reflected in the calculated reserve percentages, are assessed on a quarterly basis to determine whether further adjustments are required.\n\nWe monitor our ongoing credit exposure through active review of counterparty accounts receivable balances against contract terms and due dates. Our activities include timely account reconciliation, dispute resolution and payment confirmation. To the extent possible, we work with customers with past due balances to negotiate payment plans, but will disconnect customers for non-payment as allowed by our regulators, if necessary, and employ collection agencies and legal counsel to pursue recovery of defaulted receivables. For our larger customers, detailed credit review procedures may be performed in advance of any sales being made. We sometimes require letters of credit, parental guarantees, prepayments or other forms of credit assurance from our larger customers to mitigate credit risk.\n\n## (f) Materials, Supplies, and Inventories -Our inventory as of December 31 consisted of:\n\n| (in millions)          | 2022     | 2021     |\n|------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Natural gas in storage | $  446.3 | $  326.0 |\n| Materials and supplies | 257.0    | 225.3    |\n| Fossil fuel            | 103.8    | 84.5     |\n| Total                  | $  807.1 | $  635.8 |\n\nPGL and NSG price natural gas storage injections at the calendar year average of the costs of natural gas supply purchased. Withdrawals from storage are priced on the LIFO cost method. Inventories stated on a LIFO basis represented approximately 13% and 19% of total inventories at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The estimated replacement cost of natural gas in inventory at December 31, 2022 and 2021, exceeded the LIFO cost by $98.3 million and $114.2 million, respectively. In calculating these replacement amounts, PGL and NSG used a Chicago city-gate natural gas price per Dth of $3.41 at December 31, 2022, and $3.67 at December 31, 2021.",

When this occurs, regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recorded on the balance sheet. Regulatory assets represent deferred costs probable of recovery from customers that would have otherwise been charged to expense. Regulatory liabilities represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future rates or future costs already collected from customers in rates.\n\nThe recovery or refund of regulatory assets and liabilities is based on specific periods determined by our regulators or occurs over the normal operating period of the related assets and liabilities. If a previously recorded regulatory asset is no longer probable of recovery, the regulatory asset is reduced to the amount considered probable of recovery, and the reduction is charged to expense in the current period. See Note 6, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, for more information.\n\n(h) Property, Plant, and Equipment -We record property, plant, and equipment at cost. Cost includes material, labor, overhead, and both debt and equity components of AFUDC. Additions to and significant replacements of property are charged to property, plant, and equipment at cost; minor items are charged to other operation and maintenance expense. The cost of depreciable utility property less salvage value is charged to accumulated depreciation when property is retired.\n\nWe record straight-line depreciation expense over the estimated useful life of utility property using depreciation rates approved by the applicable regulators. Annual utility composite depreciation rates are shown below:\n\n| Annual Utility Composite Depreciation Rates   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| WE                                            | 3.06%  | 3.09%  | 3.19%  |\n| WPS                                           | 2.67%  | 2.66%  | 2.63%  |\n| WG                                            | 2.47%  | 2.44%  | 2.33%  |\n| PGL                                           | 3.13%  | 3.12%  | 3.16%  |\n| NSG                                           | 2.43%  | 2.52%  | 2.48%  |\n| MERC                                          | 2.56%  | 2.58%  | 2.47%  |\n| MGU                                           | 2.75%  | 2.70%  | 2.67%  |\n| UMERC                                         | 3.01%  | 2.94%  | 2.97%  |\n\nWe depreciate our We Power assets over the estimated useful life of the various property components. The components have useful lives of between 10 to 45 years for PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 and 10 to 55 years for ER 1 and ER 2.\n\nWe capitalize certain costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use and record these costs to amortization expense over the estimated useful life of the related software, which ranges from 3 to 15 years. If software is retired prior to being fully amortized, the difference is recorded as a loss on the income statement.\n\nThird parties reimburse the utilities for all or a portion of expenditures for certain capital projects. Such contributions in aid of construction costs are recorded as a reduction to property, plant, and equipment.\n\nSee Note 7, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information.\n\n(i) Allowance for Funds Used During Construction -AFUDC is included in utility plant accounts and represents the cost of borrowed funds (AFUDC-Debt) used during plant construction, and a return on shareholders' capital (AFUDC-Equity) used for construction purposes. AFUDC-Debt is recorded as a reduction of interest expense, and AFUDC-Equity is recorded in other income, net.\n\nThe majority of AFUDC is recorded at WE, WPS, WG, UMERC, and WBS. Approximately 50% of WE's, WPS's, WG's, UMERC's, and WBS's retail jurisdictional CWIP expenditures are subject to the AFUDC calculation. The AFUDC calculation for WBS uses the WPS AFUDC retail rate, while our utilities' AFUDC rates are determined by their respective state commissions, each with specific requirements. Average AFUDC rates are shown below:\n\n|       | 2022                       | 2022                          |\n|-------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|       | Average AFUDC  Retail Rate | Average AFUDC  Wholesale Rate |\n| WE    | 8.68%                      | 5.35%                         |\n| WPS   | 7.55%                      | 5.49%                         |\n| WG    | 8.32%                      | N/A                           |\n| UMERC | 6.28%                      | N/A                           |\n| WBS   | 7.55%                      | N/A                           |",

These projects include, among other things, developing a centralized repository for data to improve analytics and reporting, targeted enterprise resource planning systems, a project management tool, and a power generation employee scheduling system. We present prepaid hosting fees that are service contracts in either prepayments or other long-term assets on our balance sheets and amortize them as the hosting services are received. Amortization expense, as well as the fees associated with the hosting arrangements, is recorded in other operation and maintenance expense on our income statements.\n\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $4.7 million and $3.3 million, respectively, of capitalized implementation costs related to cloud computing arrangements that are hosted service contracts. We amortize the implementation costs on a straight-line basis over the cloud computing service arrangement term once the component of the hosted service is ready for its intended use. Accumulated amortization at December 31, 2022 and 2021, was $1.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively. Amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was not significant. The presentation of the implementation costs, along with the related accumulated amortization, follows the prepaid hosting fees.\n\n(k) Asset Impairment -Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to an annual impairment test. Interim impairment tests are performed when impairment indicators are present. During the third quarter of each year, we perform an annual impairment test at all of our reporting units that carry a goodwill balance. The carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill is considered not recoverable if the carrying amount of the reporting unit's net assets exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. An impairment loss is recorded as the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over its fair value. For our indefinite-lived intangible assets, an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the asset. An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible assets over its fair value. No impairment losses were recorded for our indefinite-lived intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. See Note 10, Goodwill and Intangibles, for more information.\n\nWe periodically assess the recoverability of certain long-lived assets when factors indicate the carrying value of such assets may be impaired or such assets are planned to be sold. Long-lived assets that would be subject to an impairment assessment generally include any assets within regulated operations that may not be fully recovered from our customers as a result of regulatory decisions that will be made in the future, as well as assets within nonregulated operations that are proposed to be sold or are currently generating operating losses. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the asset. The carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value of the asset.\n\nWhen it becomes probable that a generating unit will be retired before the end of its useful life, we assess whether the generating unit meets the criteria for abandonment accounting. Generating units that are considered probable of abandonment are expected to cease operations in the near term, significantly before the end of their original estimated useful lives. If a generating unit meets the applicable criteria to be considered probable of abandonment, and the unit has been abandoned, we assess the likelihood of recovery of the remaining net book value of that generating unit at the end of each reporting period. If it becomes probable that regulators will disallow full recovery as well as a return on the remaining net book value of a generating unit that is either abandoned or probable of being abandoned, an impairment loss may be required. An impairment loss would be recorded if the remaining net book value of the generating unit is greater than the present value of the amount expected to be recovered from ratepayers, using an incremental borrowing rate. See Note 6, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, and Note 7, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information.",

        "page_content": "We periodically assess the recoverability of equity method investments when factors indicate the carrying amount of such assets may be impaired. Equity method investments are assessed for impairment by comparing the fair values of these investments to their carrying amounts if a fair value assessment was completed or by reviewing for the presence of impairment indicators. If an impairment exists, and it is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the investment's fair value.\n\n(l) Asset Retirement Obligations -We recognize, at fair value, legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development, and normal operation of the assets. An ARO liability is recorded, when incurred, for these obligations as long as the fair value can be reasonably estimated, even if the timing or method of settling the obligation is unknown. The associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and are depreciated over the useful life of the asset. The ARO liabilities are accreted each period using the credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates associated with the expected settlement dates of the AROs. These rates are determined when the obligations are incurred. Subsequent changes resulting from revisions to the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows are recognized as an increase or a decrease to the carrying amount of the liability and the associated capitalized retirement costs. For our regulated entities, we recognize regulatory assets or liabilities for the timing differences between when we recover an ARO in rates and when we recognize the associated retirement costs. See Note 9, Asset Retirement Obligations, for more information.\n\n(m) Intangible Liabilities -Our finite-lived intangible liabilities include revenue contracts, consisting of PPAs and a proxy revenue swap, in addition to interconnection agreements, which were all obtained through the acquisitions of wind generation facilities by WECI in our non-utility energy infrastructure segment. Intangible liabilities are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life. Amortization of revenue contracts is recorded within operating revenues in the income statements. Amortization related to the interconnection agreements is recorded within other operation and maintenance in the income statements. The straight-line method of amortization is used because it best reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangibles are consumed or otherwise used. The amounts and useful lives assigned to intangible liabilities assumed impact the amount and timing of future amortization.\n\n(n) Stock-Based Compensation -In accordance with the Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, we provide long-term incentives through our equity interests to our non-employee directors, officers, and other key employees. The plan provides for the granting of stock options, restricted stock, performance shares, and other stock-based awards. Awards may be paid in common stock, cash, or a combination thereof. In addition to those shares of common stock that were subject to awards outstanding as of May 6, 2021, 9.0 million shares are reserved for issuance under the plan.\n\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Awards classified as equity awards are measured based on their grant-date fair value. Awards classified as liability awards are recorded at fair value each reporting period. We account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimating potential future forfeitures and recording them over the vesting period.\n\n## Stock Options\n\nWe grant non-qualified stock options that generally vest on a cliff-basis after three years. The exercise price of a stock option under the plan cannot be less than 100% of our common stock's fair market value on the grant date. Historically, all stock options have been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant. Options vest immediately upon retirement, death, or disability; however, they may not be exercised within six months of the grant date except in connection with certain termination of employment events following a change in control. Options expire no later than 10 years from the date of the grant.\n\nOur stock options are classified as equity awards. The fair value of our stock options was calculated using a binomial option-pricing model. The following table shows the estimated weighted-average fair value per stock option granted along with the weighted-average assumptions used in the valuation models:\n\n|                                                        | 2022        | 2021        | 2020        |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n| Stock options granted                                  | 437,269     | 530,612     | 554,594     |\n| Estimated weighted-average fair value per stock option | $  14.71    | $  13.20    | $  10.94    |\n| Assumptions used to value the options:                 |             |             |             |\n| Risk-free interest rate                                | 0.2% - 1.6% | 0.1% - 0.9% | 0.2% - 1.9% |\n| Dividend yield                                         | 3.2 %       | 2.9 %       | 3.0 %       |\n| Expected volatility                                    | 21.0 %      | 21.0 %      | 16.3 %      |\n| Expected life (years)                                  | 8.7         | 8.7         | 8.6         |\n\nThe risk-free interest rate was based on the United States Treasury interest rate with a term consistent with the expected life of the stock options. The dividend yield was based on our dividend rate at the time of the grant and historical stock prices. Expected volatility and expected life assumptions were based on our historical experience.",

        "page_content": "## Restricted Shares\n\nRestricted shares granted to employees generally have a vesting period of three years with one-third of the award vesting on each anniversary of the grant date. Restricted shares granted to certain officers and all non-employee directors fully vest after one year.\n\nOur restricted shares are classified as equity awards.\n\n## Performance Units\n\nOfficers and other key employees are granted performance units under the WEC Energy Group Performance Unit Plan. All grants of performance units are settled in cash and are accounted for as liability awards accordingly. Performance units accrue forfeitable dividend equivalents in the form of additional performance units. The fair value of the performance units reflects our estimate of the final expected value of the awards, which is based on our stock price and performance achievement under the terms of the award. Stockbased compensation costs are generally recorded over the performance period, which is three years.\n\nThe ultimate number of units that will be awarded is dependent on our total shareholder return (stock price appreciation plus dividends) as compared to the total shareholder return of a peer group of companies over three years, as well as other performance metrics, as may be determined by the Compensation Committee. Under the terms of awards granted prior to 2023, participants may earn between 0% and 175% of the performance unit award based on our total shareholder return. Pursuant to the plan terms governing these awards, these percentages can be adjusted upwards or downwards by up to 10% based on our performance against additional performance measures, if any, adopted by the Compensation Committee.\n\nThe WEC Energy Group Performance Unit Plan was amended and restated, effective January 1, 2023. In accordance with the amended plan, the Compensation Committee selected multiple performance measures that will be weighted to determine the ultimate payout for the awards granted in 2023. The ultimate number of units awarded will be based on our total shareholder return compared to the total shareholder return of a peer group of companies over three years (55%), and our performance against the weighted average authorized ROE of all of our utility subsidiaries (45%). In addition, the Compensation Committee selected the level of our stock price to earnings ratio compared to our peer companies as a performance measure that can increase the payout by up to 25%. In no event can the performance unit payout be greater than 200% of the target award.\n\nSee Note 11, Common Equity, for more information on our stock-based compensation plans.\n\n- (o) Earnings Per Share -We compute basic earnings per share by dividing our net income attributed to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed in a similar manner, but includes the exercise and/or conversion of all potentially dilutive securities. Such dilutive securities include in-the-money stock options. The calculation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 excluded 653,323; 769,030; and 207,445 stock options, respectively, that had an anti-dilutive effect.\n- (p) Leases -We recognize a right of use asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases with a term of greater than one year. As a policy election, we account for each lease component separately from the nonlease components of a contract.\n\nWe are currently party to several easement agreements that allow us access to land we do not own for the purpose of constructing and maintaining certain electric power and natural gas equipment. The majority of payments we make related to easements relate to our renewable generating facilities. We have not classified our easements as leases because we view the entire parcel of land specified in our easement agreements to be the identified asset, not just that portion of the parcel that contains our easement. As such, we have concluded that we do not control the use of an identified asset related to our easement agreements, nor do we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits associated with these shared-use assets.\n\nSee Note 15, Leases, for more information.\n\n- (q) Income Taxes -We follow the liability method in accounting for income taxes. Accounting guidance for income taxes requires the recording of deferred assets and liabilities to recognize the expected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in our financial statements or tax returns and the adjustment of deferred tax balances to reflect tax rate changes. We are required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets would expire before being realized. If we conclude that certain deferred tax assets are likely to expire before being realized, a valuation allowance would be established against those assets. GAAP requires that, if we conclude in a future period that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets would be realized before expiration, we reverse the related valuation allowance in that period. Any change to the allowance, as a result of a change in judgment about the realization of deferred tax assets, is reported in income tax expense.\n\nITCs associated with regulated operations are deferred and amortized over the life of the assets. PTCs are recognized in the period in which such credits are generated. The amount of the credit is based upon power production from our qualifying generation facilities. We file a consolidated federal income tax return. Accordingly, we allocate federal current tax expense, benefits, and credits to our subsidiaries based on their separate tax computations and our ability to monetize all credits on our consolidated federal return. See Note 16, Income Taxes, for more information.\n\nWe recognize interest and penalties accrued, related to unrecognized tax benefits, in income tax expense in our income statements.",

        "page_content": "- (r) Fair Value Measurements -Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).\n\nFair value accounting rules provide a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:\n\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n\n- Level 2 - Pricing inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, but are not quoted prices included within Level 1. Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using external inputs within models or other valuation methods.\n- Level 3 - Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may be used with internally developed methods that result in management's best estimate of fair value. Level 3 instruments include those that may be more structured or otherwise tailored to customers' needs.\n\nAssets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. We use a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical measure for valuing certain derivative assets and liabilities. We primarily use a market approach for recurring fair value measurements and attempt to use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nWhen possible, we base the valuations of our assets and liabilities on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. These valuations are classified in Level 1. The valuations of certain contracts not classified as Level 1 may be based on quoted market prices received from counterparties and/or observable inputs for similar instruments. Transactions valued using these inputs are classified in Level 2. Certain derivatives, such as FTRs and TCRs, are categorized in Level 3 due to the significance of unobservable or internally-developed inputs. FTRs and TCRs are valued using auction prices from the applicable RTO.\n\nSee Note 17, Fair Value Measurements, for more information.\n\n- (s) Derivative Instruments -We use derivatives as part of our risk management program to manage the risks associated with the price volatility of interest rates, purchased power, generation, and natural gas costs for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. Our approach is non-speculative and designed to mitigate risk. Regulated hedging programs are approved by our state regulators.\n\nWe record derivative instruments on our balance sheets as assets or liabilities measured at fair value unless they qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception, and are so designated. We continually assess our contracts designated as normal and will discontinue the treatment of these contracts as normal if the required criteria are no longer met. Changes in the derivative's fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met or we receive regulatory treatment for the derivative. For most energy-related physical and financial contracts in our regulated operations that qualify as derivatives, our regulators allow the effects of fair value accounting to be offset to regulatory assets and liabilities.\n\nWe classify derivative assets and liabilities as current or long-term on our balance sheets based on the maturities of the underlying contracts. Cash flows from derivative activities are presented in the same category as the item being hedged within operating activities on our statements of cash flows.\n\nDerivative accounting rules provide the option to present certain asset and liability derivative positions net on the balance sheets and to net the related cash collateral against these net derivative positions. We elected not to net these items. On our balance sheets, cash collateral provided to others is reflected in other current assets, and cash collateral received is reflected in other current liabilities. See Note 18, Derivative Instruments, for more information.\n\n- (t) Guarantees -We follow the guidance of the Guarantees Topic of the FASB ASC, which requires, under certain circumstances, that the guarantor recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee at its inception. See Note 19, Guarantees, for more information.\n- (u) Employee Benefits -The costs of pension and OPEB plans are expensed over the periods during which employees render service. These costs are distributed among our subsidiaries based on current employment status and actuarial calculations, as applicable. Our regulators allow recovery in rates for the utilities' net periodic benefit cost calculated under GAAP. See Note 20, Employee Benefits, for more information.\n- (v) Customer Deposits and Credit Balances -When utility customers apply for new service, they may be required to provide a deposit for the service. Customer deposits are recorded within other current liabilities on our balance sheets.\n\nUtility customers can elect to be on a budget plan. Under this type of plan, a monthly installment amount is calculated based on estimated annual usage. During the year, the monthly installment amount is reviewed by comparing it to actual usage. If necessary, an",

    {
        "page_content": "adjustment is made to the monthly amount. Annually, the budget plan is reconciled to actual annual usage. Payments in excess of actual customer usage are recorded within other current liabilities on our balance sheets.\n\n(w) Environmental Remediation Costs -We are subject to federal and state environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to pay for environmental remediation at sites where we have been, or may be, identified as a potentially responsible party. Loss contingencies may exist for the remediation of hazardous substances at various potential sites, including coal combustion residual landfills and manufactured gas plant sites. See Note 9, Asset Retirement Obligations, for more information regarding coal combustion residual landfills and Note 24, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information regarding manufactured gas plant sites.\n\nWe record environmental remediation liabilities when site assessments indicate remediation is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of losses. The estimate includes both our share of the liability and any additional amounts that will not be paid by other potentially responsible parties or the government. When possible, we estimate costs using site-specific information but also consider historical experience for costs incurred at similar sites. Remediation efforts for a particular site generally extend over a period of several years. During this period, the laws governing the remediation process may change, as well as site conditions, potentially affecting the cost of remediation.\n\nOur utilities have received approval to defer certain environmental remediation costs, as well as estimated future costs, through a regulatory asset. The recovery of deferred costs is subject to the applicable state regulatory commission's approval.\n\nWe review our estimated costs of remediation annually for our manufactured gas plant sites and coal combustion residual landfills. We adjust the liabilities and related regulatory assets, as appropriate, to reflect the new cost estimates. Any material changes in cost estimates are adjusted throughout the year.\n\n- (x) Customer Concentrations of Credit Risk -The geographic concentration of our customers did not contribute significantly to our overall exposure to credit risk. We periodically review customers' credit ratings, financial statements, and historical payment performance and require them to provide collateral or other security as needed. Credit risk exposure at WE, WPS, WG, PGL, and NSG is mitigated by their recovery mechanisms for uncollectible expense discussed in Note 1(d), Operating Revenues. As a result, we did not have any significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2022. In addition, there were no customers that accounted for more than 10% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n## NOTE 2-ACQUISITIONS\n\nIn accordance with Topic 805: Clarifying the Definition of a Business (ASU 2017-01), transactions are evaluated and are accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses, and transaction costs are capitalized in asset acquisitions. It was determined that all of the below acquisitions met the criteria of an asset acquisition. The purchase price of certain acquisitions described below includes intangibles recorded as long-term liabilities related to PPAs. See Note 10, Goodwill and Intangibles, for more information.\n\n## Acquisition of Wind Generation Facilities in Illinois\n\nIn February 2023, WECI completed the acquisition of a 90% ownership interest in Sapphire Sky, a commercially operational 250 MW wind generating facility in McLean County, Illinois, for a total investment of approximately $442.9 million, which includes transaction costs.

We believe that the high energy costs that customers are seeing, which have been driven by high natural gas prices, contributed to higher past due accounts receivable balances and a related increase in the allowance for credit losses. The increase was substantially offset by customer write-offs related to collection practices returning to pre-pandemic levels, including the restoration of our ability to disconnect customers. After a customer is disconnected for a period of time without payment on their account, we will write off that customer balance.\n\n| (in millions)                                                       | Wisconsin   | Illinois   | Other States   | Total Utility Operations   | Corporate and Other   | WEC Energy  Group  Consolidated   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------|----------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Balance at January 1, 2021                                          | $  102.1    | $  111.6   | $  6.4         | $  220.1                   | $                     | -  $  220.1                       |\n| Provision for credit losses                                         | 46.4        | 25.6       | 3.7            | 75.7                       | -                     | 75.7                              |\n| Provision for credit losses deferred for future  recovery or refund | (16.6)      | 3.5        | -              | (13.1)                     | -                     | (13.1)                            |\n| Write-offs charged against the allowance                            | (74.8)      | (52.5)     | (2.5)          | (129.8)                    | -                     | (129.8)                           |\n| Recoveries of amounts previously written off                        | 26.9        | 17.3       | 1.2            | 45.4                       | -                     | 45.4                              |\n| Balance at December 31, 2021                                        | $  84.0     | $  105.5   | $  8.8         | $  198.3                   | $                     | -  $  198.3                       |\n\nThe allowance for credit losses decreased during the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily related to normal collection practices resuming in April 2021 for our Wisconsin utilities and in June 2021 for our Illinois utilities.

Also, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related regulatory orders we received, we were unable to disconnect any of our Wisconsin and Illinois customers during the year ended December 31, 2020.",

The net book value of this plant was $575.1 million at December 31, 2022, representing book value less cost of removal and accumulated depreciation. In addition, previously deferred unprotected tax benefits from the Tax Legislation related to the unrecovered balance of this plant were $17.5 million as of December 31, 2022. The net amount of $557.6 million was classified as a regulatory asset on our balance sheet at December 31, 2022 due to the retirement of the plant. This regulatory asset does not include certain other previously recorded deferred tax liabilities of $156.7 million related to the retired Pleasant Prairie power plant. Pursuant to its rate order issued by the PSCW in December 2019, WE will continue to amortize this regulatory asset on a straight-line basis through 2039, using the composite depreciation rates approved by the PSCW before this plant was retired. The amortization is included in depreciation and amortization in the income statement. WE also has FERC approval to continue to collect the net book value of the Pleasant Prairie power plant using the approved composite depreciation rates, in addition to a return on the remaining net book value.\n\nWE received approval from the PSCW in December 2019 to collect a full return of the net book value of the Pleasant Prairie power plant and a return on all but $100 million of the net book value. During May 2021, WE securitized the remaining $100 million of the Pleasant Prairie power plant's book value, the carrying costs accrued on the $100 million during the securitization process, and the related financing fees, in accordance with a written order issued by the PSCW in November 2020. See Note 23, Variable Interest Entities, for more information on this securitization.\n\n## Presque Isle Power Plant\n\nPursuant to MISO's April 2018 approval of the retirement of the PIPP, these units were retired on March 31, 2019. The net book value of the PIPP was $163.7 million at December 31, 2022, representing book value less cost of removal and accumulated depreciation. In addition, previously deferred unprotected tax benefits from the Tax Legislation related to the unrecovered balance of these units were $5.2 million as of December 31, 2022. The net amount of $158.5 million was classified as a regulatory asset on our balance sheet at December 31, 2022 as a result of the retirement of the plant. This regulatory asset does not include certain other previously recorded deferred tax liabilities of $44.4 million related to the retired PIPP. After the retirement of the PIPP, a portion of the regulatory asset and related cost of removal reserve was transferred to UMERC for recovery from its retail customers. Effective with its rate order issued by the PSCW in December 2019, WE received approval to collect a return of and on its share of the net book value of the PIPP and, as a result, will continue to amortize the regulatory assets on a straight-line basis through 2037, using the composite depreciation rates approved by the PSCW before the units were retired. UMERC will also continue to amortize the regulatory assets on a straight-line basis using the composite depreciation rates approved by the PSCW before the units were retired. This amortization is included in depreciation and amortization in the income statement. UMERC will address the accounting and regulatory treatment related to the retirement of the PIPP with the MPSC in conjunction with a future rate case. WE also has FERC approval to continue to collect the net book value of the PIPP using the approved composite depreciation rates, in addition to a return on the net book value.",

        "page_content": "## Wisconsin Segment Plant to be Retired\n\n## Oak Creek Power Plant Units 5 - 8\n\nAs a result of a PSCW approval for the construction of a solar and battery project received in December 2022, retirement of the OCPP generating units 5 - 8 became probable. OCPP units 5 and 6 are expected to be retired by May 2024, while units 7 and 8 are expected to be retired by late 2025. The total net book value of WE's ownership share of units 5 - 8 was $812.5 million at December 31, 2022, which does not include deferred taxes. These amounts were classified as plant to be retired within property, plant, and equipment on our balance sheet. These units are included in rate base, and WE continues to depreciate them on a straight-line basis using the composite depreciation rates approved by the PSCW.\n\n## Columbia Units 1 and 2\n\nAs a result of a MISO ruling received in June 2021, retirement of the jointly-owned Columbia generating units 1 and 2 became probable. Columbia generating units 1 and 2 are expected to be retired by June 2026. The net book value of WPS's ownership share of unit 1 and unit 2 was $84.0 million and $189.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2022, which does not include deferred taxes. These amounts were classified as plant to be retired within property, plant, and equipment on our balance sheet. These units are included in rate base, and WPS continues to depreciate them on a straight-line basis using the composite depreciation rates approved by the PSCW.\n\n## Public Service Building and Steam Tunnel Assets\n\nDuring a significant rain event in May 2020, an underground steam tunnel in downtown Milwaukee flooded and steam vented into WE's PSB. The damage to the building and adjacent steam tunnel assets from the flooding and steam was extensive and required significant repairs and restorations. As of December 31, 2022, WE had incurred $95.3 million of costs related to these repairs and restorations. In 2020, WE received $20.0 million of insurance proceeds to cover a portion of these costs and wrote off $12.5 million of costs that we do not intend to seek recovery for through other operation and maintenance expense. In the first quarter of 2022, WE received $41.0 million of insurance proceeds as a result of a settlement that was reached in February 2022. The remaining $21.8 million of costs is expected to be recovered through rates.\n\nIn June 2021, we received approval from the PSCW to restore the PSB and adjacent steam tunnel assets and to defer the project costs, net of insurance proceeds, as a component of rate base. As such, and in light of the agreement with insurers noted above, we do not currently expect a significant impact to our future results of operations.\n\n## NOTE 8-JOINTLY OWNED UTILITY FACILITIES\n\nWe Power and WPS hold joint ownership interests in certain electric generating facilities. They are entitled to their share of generating capability and output of each facility equal to their respective ownership interest. They pay their ownership share of additional construction costs and have supplied their own financing for all jointly owned projects. We record We Power's and WPS's proportionate share of significant jointly owned electric generating facilities as property, plant, and equipment on the balance sheets.\n\nWe Power leases its ownership interest in ER 1 and ER 2 to WE, and WE operates these units. WE and WPS record their respective share of fuel inventory purchases and operating expenses, unless specific agreements have been executed to limit their maximum exposure to additional costs. WE's and WPS's proportionate share of direct expenses for the joint operation of these plants is recorded within operating expenses in the income statements.\n\nInformation related to jointly owned utility facilities at December 31, 2022 was as follows:\n\n|                                               | We Power                                     | WPS           | WPS                                    | WPS          | WPS        | WPS                  |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------|--------------|------------|----------------------|\n| (in millions, except for  percentages and MW) | Elm Road  Generating  Station Units 1  and 2 | Weston Unit 4 | Columbia  Energy Center  Units 1 and 2 | Forward Wind | Two Creeks | Badger Hollow I  (2) |\n| Ownership                                     | 83.34 %                                      | 70.0 %        | 27.5 %                                 | 44.6 %       | 66.7 %     | 66.7 %               |\n| Share of capacity (MW)  (1)                   | 1,060.8                                      | 387.3         | 311.1                                  | 61.5         | 100.0      | 100.0                |\n| In-service date                               | 2010 and 2011                                | 2008          | 1975 and 1978                          | 2008         | 2020       | 2021                 |\n| Property, plant, and equipment                | $  2,425.1                                   | $  612.1      | $  426.1                               | $  119.3     | $  136.8   | $  146.2             |\n| Accumulated depreciation                      | $  (505.7)                                   | $  (213.0)    | $  (159.7)                             | $  (53.9)    | $  (9.7)   | $  (4.9)             |\n| CWIP                                          | $  64.1                                      | $  1.2        | $  6.8                                 | $  0.2       | $  0.1     | $  -                 |",

In January 2023, the Compensation Committee also awarded 157,035 performance units to certain of our officers and other key employees under its normal schedule of awarding long-term incentive compensation.\n\n## Restrictions\n\nOur ability as a holding company to pay common stock dividends primarily depends on the availability of funds received from our utility subsidiaries, We Power, Bluewater, ATC Holding, and WECI. Various financing arrangements and regulatory requirements impose certain restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in the form of cash dividends, loans, or advances. All of our utility subsidiaries, with the exception of UMERC and MGU, are prohibited from loaning funds to us, either directly or indirectly.\n\nIn accordance with their most recent rate orders, WE, WPS, and WG may not pay common dividends above the test year forecasted amounts reflected in their respective rate cases, if it would cause their average common equity ratio, on a financial basis, to fall below their authorized level of 53.0%. A return of capital in excess of the test year amount can be paid by each company at the end of the year provided that their respective average common equity ratios do not fall below the authorized level.\n\nWE may not pay common dividends to us under WE's Restated Articles of Incorporation if any dividends on its outstanding preferred stock have not been paid. In addition, pursuant to the terms of WE's 3.60% Serial Preferred Stock, WE's ability to declare common dividends would be limited to 75% or 50% of net income during a 12-month period if its common stock equity to total capitalization, as defined in the preferred stock designation, is less than 25% and 20%, respectively.\n\nNSG's long-term debt obligations contain provisions and covenants restricting the payment of cash dividends and the purchase or redemption of its capital stock.\n\nThe long-term debt obligations of UMERC, Bluewater Gas Storage, and ATC Holding contain a provision requiring them to maintain a total funded debt to capitalization ratio of 65% or less.\n\nWECI Wind Holding I's and WECI Wind Holding II's long-term debt obligations contain various conditions that must be met prior to them making any cash distributions. Included in these provisions is a requirement to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of 1.2 or greater for the 12-month period prior to the distribution.\n\nWEC Energy Group and Integrys have the option to defer interest payments on their junior subordinated notes, from time to time, for one or more periods of up to 10 consecutive years per period. During any period in which they defer interest payments, they may not declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, repurchase or acquire, their respective common stock.\n\nSee Note 13, Short-Term Debt and Lines of Credit, for discussion of certain financial covenants related to short-term debt obligations.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, restricted net assets of our consolidated subsidiaries totaled approximately $9.8 billion. Our equity in undistributed earnings of investees accounted for by the equity method was approximately $487 million.\n\nWe do not believe that these restrictions will materially affect our operations or limit any dividend payments in the foreseeable future.\n\n## Share Purchases\n\nWe have instructed our independent agents to purchase shares on the open market to fulfill obligations under various stock-based employee benefit and compensations plans and to provide shares to participants in our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan. As a result, no new shares of common stock were issued in 2022, 2021, or 2020.\n\nThe following is a summary of shares purchased to fulfill exercised stock options and restricted stock awards during the years ended December 31:\n\n| (in millions)            | 2022    | 2021    |   2020 |\n|--------------------------|---------|---------|--------|\n| Shares purchased         | 0.7     | 0.4     |    1   |\n| Cost of shares purchased | $  69.2 | $  33.1 |   99.2 |\n\n## Common Stock Dividends\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, our Board of Directors declared common stock dividends which are summarized below:\n\n| Date Declared    | Date Payable      | Per Share   | Period         |\n|------------------|-------------------|-------------|----------------|\n| January 20, 2022 | March 1, 2022     | $0.7275     | First quarter  |\n| April 21, 2022   | June 1, 2022      | $0.7275     | Second quarter |\n| July 21, 2022    | September 1, 2022 | $0.7275     | Third quarter  |\n| October 20, 2022 | December 1, 2022  | $0.7275     | Fourth quarter |",

        "page_content": "## NOTE 15-LEASES\n\n## Obligations Under Operating Leases\n\nWe have recorded right of use assets and lease liabilities associated with the following operating leases.\n\n- \u00b7 Leases of office space, primarily related to several floors we are leasing in the Aon Center office building in Chicago, Illinois, though April 2029.\n- \u00b7 Land we are leasing related to our Rothschild biomass plant through June 2051.\n- \u00b7 Land we are leasing related to our Solar Now projects.\n\nThe operating leases generally require us to pay property taxes, insurance premiums, and operating and maintenance costs associated with the leased property. Certain of our leases contain options for early termination or to renew past the initial term, as set forth in the lease agreements. These options are not included in our calculation of the lease obligations, as it is not reasonably certain that they will be exercised.\n\n## Obligations Under Finance Leases\n\nIn accordance with ASC Subtopic 980-842, Regulated Operations - Leases, the expense recognition pattern of our finance leases at our regulated entities resembles that of an operating lease. The difference between the minimum lease payments and the sum of imputed interest and unadjusted amortization costs calculated under Topic 842 is deferred as a regulatory asset on our balance sheets in accordance with Subtopic 980-842.\n\n## Power Purchase Commitment\n\nIn 1997, WE entered into a 25-year PPA with LSP-Whitewater Limited Partnership. The contract, for 236.5 MW of firm capacity from a natural gas-fired cogeneration facility, included zero minimum energy requirements. The PPA expired on May 31, 2022; however, in November 2021, WE entered into a tolling agreement with LSP-Whitewater Limited Partnership that commenced on June 1, 2022. Concurrent with the execution of the tolling agreement, WE and WPS entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the natural gas-fired cogeneration facility for $72.7 million, which excludes working capital and transaction costs. This asset purchase agreement was approved by the PSCW in December 2022, and the acquisition closed effective January 1, 2023.\n\n## Land Leases - Utility Solar Generation\n\nWE and WPS, along with an unaffiliated utility, have entered into various land leases related to their investment in utility-scale solar generation. Each lease has an initial term and one or more optional extensions. We expect the optional extensions to be exercised, and, as a result, all of the land leases are being amortized over an extended term of approximately 50 years. Once a solar project achieves commercial operation, the lease liability is remeasured to reflect the final total acres being leased. Our payments related to these leases are being recovered through rates.",

The swaps provided a fixed interest rate of 4.9765% on $250.0 million of the $500.0 million of outstanding 2007 Junior Notes. As these swaps qualified for cash flow hedge accounting treatment, the related gains and losses were deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss and were amortized to interest expense as interest was accrued on the 2007 Junior Notes.\n\nWe previously entered into forward interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the interest rate exposure associated with the issuance of long-term debt related to the acquisition of Integrys. These swap agreements were settled in 2015, and we continue to amortize amounts out of accumulated other comprehensive loss into interest expense over the periods in which the interest costs are recognized in earnings.\n\nThe table below shows the amounts related to these cash flow hedges recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and in earnings, along with our total interest expense on the income statements, for the years ended December 31:\n\n| (in millions)                                                                                          | 2022   | 2021   | 2020     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Derivative gain (loss) recognized in other comprehensive income / loss                                 | $  -   | $  0.8 | $  (5.9) |\n| Net derivative gain (loss) reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive  loss to interest expense | 0.4    | (1.3)  | (2.1)    |\n| Total interest expense line item on the income statements                                              | 515.1  | 471.1  | 493.7    |\n\nWe estimate that during the next twelve months $0.4 million will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss as a reduction to interest expense.",

In addition, we and our subsidiaries offer multiple OPEB plans to employees. The benefits for a portion of these plans are funded through irrevocable trusts, as allowed for income tax purposes. We also offer medical, dental, and life insurance benefits to active employees and their dependents. We expense the costs of these benefits as incurred.\n\nGenerally, former Wisconsin Energy Corporation employees who started with the company after 1995 receive a benefit based on a percentage of their annual salary plus an interest credit, while employees who started before 1996 receive a benefit based upon years of service and final average salary. Wisconsin Energy Corporation management employees hired after December 31, 2014, and certain new represented employees hired after May 1, 2017, receive an annual company contribution to their 401(k) savings plan instead of being enrolled in the defined benefit plans.\n\nFor former Integrys employees, the defined benefit pension plans are closed to all new hires. In addition, the service accruals for the defined benefit pension plans were frozen for non-union employees as of January 1, 2013. These employees receive an annual company contribution to their 401(k) savings plan, which is calculated based on age, wages, and full years of vesting service as of December 31 each year.\n\nWe use a year-end measurement date to measure the funded status of all of our pension and OPEB plans. Due to the regulated nature of our business, we have concluded that substantially all of the unrecognized costs resulting from the recognition of the funded status of our pension and OPEB plans qualify as a regulatory asset.",

For 2023, the expected return on assets assumption is 6.88% for the pension plans and 7.00% for the OPEB plans.\n\n## Plan Assets\n\nCurrent pension trust assets and amounts which are expected to be contributed to the trusts in the future are expected to be adequate to meet pension payment obligations to current and future retirees.\n\nThe Investment Trust Policy Committee oversees investment matters related to all of our funded benefit plans. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an on-going basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. They are intended to reduce risk, provide long-term financial stability for the plans and maintain funded levels which meet long-term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near-term benefit payments.\n\nThe legacy Wisconsin Energy Corporation pension trust target asset allocations are 30% equity investments, 55% fixed income investments, and 15% private equity and real estate investments. The legacy Integrys pension trust target asset allocations are 40% equity investments, 45% fixed income investments, and 15% private equity and real estate investments. The legacy Wisconsin Energy Corporation OPEB trust target asset allocations are 50% equity investments, 40% fixed income investments, and 10% real estate investments. The two largest legacy OPEB trusts for Integrys have the same target asset allocations of 45% equity investments, 45% fixed income investments, and 10% real estate investments. Equity securities include investments in large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap companies. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage and other asset backed securities, commercial paper, and United States Treasuries.\n\nPension and OPEB plan investments are recorded at fair value. See Note 1(r), Fair Value Measurements, for more information regarding the fair value hierarchy and the classification of fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used.",

We also own approximately 75% of ATC Holdco, a separate entity formed in December 2016 to invest in transmission-related projects outside of ATC's traditional footprint. ATC's corporate manager has an eleven-member board of directors, and ATC Holdco's corporate manager has a four-member board of directors. We have one representative on each board. Each member of the board has only one vote. The following tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in our investments in ATC and ATC Holdco:\n\n|                                             | 2022       | 2022       | 2022       |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| (in millions)                               | ATC        | ATC Holdco | Total      |\n| Balance at January 1                        | $  1,766.9 | $  22.5    | $  1,789.4 |\n| Add: Earnings from equity method investment | 192.6      | 2.1        | 194.7      |\n| Add: Capital contributions                  | 45.5       | -          | 45.5       |\n| Less: Distributions                         | 120.4      | -          | 120.4      |\n| Balance at December 31                      | $  1,884.6 | $  24.6    | $  1,909.2 |\n\n|                                                    | 2021       | 2021       | 2021       |\n|----------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| (in millions)                                      | ATC        | ATC Holdco | Total      |\n| Balance at January 1                               | $  1,733.5 | $  30.8    | $  1,764.3 |\n| Add: Earnings (loss) from equity method investment | 166.4      | (8.3)      | 158.1      |\n| Less: Distributions                                | 133.0      | -          | 133.0      |\n| Balance at December 31                             | $  1,766.9 | $  22.5    | $  1,789.4 |\n\n|                                             | 2020       | 2020       | 2020       |\n|---------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| (in millions)                               | ATC        | ATC Holdco | Total      |\n| Balance at January 1                        | $  1,684.7 | $  36.1    | $  1,720.8 |\n| Add: Earnings from equity method investment | 174.3      | 1.5        | 175.8      |\n| Add: Capital contributions                  | 21.2       | -          | 21.2       |\n| Less: Distributions                         | 146.7      | -          | 146.7      |\n| Less: Return of capital                     | -          | 6.8        | 6.8        |\n| Balance at December 31                      | $  1,733.5 | $  30.8    | $  1,764.3 |\n\nIn November 2019 and May 2020, the FERC issued orders that addressed complaints related to ATC's allowed ROE. Due to the various petitions related to the complaint filed in February 2015, our financials at December 31, 2021 and 2020, included a $39.1 million liability for potential future refunds that ATC may have been required to provide. In August 2022, a decision issued by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the FERC's previous orders related to the February 2015 complaint. Therefore, during the third quarter of 2022, we reversed the liability that was previously recorded, which increased our equity earnings from ATC.\n\nWe pay ATC for network transmission and other related services it provides. In addition, we provide a variety of operational, maintenance, and project management work for ATC, which is reimbursed by ATC. We are also required to initially fund the construction of transmission infrastructure upgrades needed for new generation projects. ATC owns these transmission assets and reimburses us for these costs when the new generation is placed in service.\n\nThe following table summarizes our significant related party transactions with ATC during the years ended December 31:\n\n| (in millions)                                                 | 2022    | 2021    | 2020    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Charges to ATC for services and construction                  | $  18.9 | $  22.9 | $  27.5 |\n| Charges from ATC for network transmission services            | 363.7   | 361.0   | 350.5   |\n| Net refund (payment) from (to) ATC related to FERC ROE orders | (0.1)   | 7.3     | 10.7    |",

In addition, certain disclosures are required for significant interest holders in VIEs.\n\nWe assess our relationships with potential VIEs, such as our coal suppliers, natural gas suppliers, coal transporters, natural gas transporters, and other counterparties related to PPAs, investments, and joint ventures. In making this assessment, we consider, along with other factors, the potential that our contracts or other arrangements provide subordinated financial support, the obligation to absorb the entity's losses, the right to receive residual returns of the entity, and the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance.\n\n## WEPCo Environmental Trust Finance I, LLC\n\nIn November 2020, the PSCW issued a financing order approving the securitization of $100 million of undepreciated environmental control costs related to WE's retired Pleasant Prairie power plant, the carrying costs accrued on the $100 million during the securitization process, and the related financing fees. The financing order also authorized WE to form WEPCo Environmental Trust, a bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity, for the sole purpose of issuing ETBs to recover the costs approved in the financing order. WEPCo Environmental Trust is a wholly owned subsidiary of WE.\n\nIn May 2021, WEPCo Environmental Trust issued ETBs and used the proceeds to acquire environmental control property from WE. The environmental control property is recorded as a regulatory asset on our balance sheets and includes the right to impose, collect, and receive a non-bypassable environmental control charge from WE's retail electric distribution customers until the ETBs are paid in full and all financing costs have been recovered. The ETBs are secured by the environmental control property. Cash collections from the environmental control charge and funds on deposit in trust accounts are the sole sources of funds to satisfy the debt obligation. The bondholders have no recourse to WE or any of WE's affiliates.\n\nWE acts as the servicer of the environmental control property on behalf of WEPCo Environmental Trust and is responsible for metering, calculating, billing, and collecting the environmental control charge. As necessary, WE is authorized to implement periodic adjustments of the environmental control charge. The adjustments are designed to ensure the timely payment of principal, interest, and other ongoing financing costs. WE remits all collections of the environmental control charge to WEPCo Environmental Trust's indenture trustee.\n\nWEPCo Environmental Trust is a VIE primarily because its equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations. As described above, WE has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact WEPCo Environmental Trust's economic performance. Therefore, WE is considered the primary beneficiary of WEPCo Environmental Trust, and consolidation is required.",

We have determined that ATC is a VIE but consolidation is not required since we are not ATC's primary beneficiary. As a result of our limited voting rights, we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact ATC's economic performance. Therefore, we account for ATC as an equity method investment. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, our equity investment in ATC was $1,884.6 million and $1,766.9 million, respectively, which approximates our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with ATC.\n\nWe also own approximately 75% of ATC Holdco, a separate entity formed in December 2016 to invest in transmission-related projects outside of ATC's traditional footprint. We have determined that ATC Holdco is a VIE but consolidation is not required since we are not ATC Holdco's primary beneficiary. As a result of our limited voting rights, we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact ATC Holdco's economic performance. Therefore, we account for ATC Holdco as an equity method investment. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, our equity investment in ATC Holdco was $24.6 million and $22.5 million, respectively, which approximates our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with ATC Holdco.\n\nSee Note 21, Investment in Transmission Affiliates, for more information, including any significant assets and liabilities related to ATC and ATC Holdco recorded on our balance sheets.\n\n## Power Purchase Commitment\n\nOn May 31, 2022, WE's PPA with LSP-Whitewater Limited Partnership that represented a variable interest expired. This agreement was for 236.5 MWs of firm capacity from a natural gas-fired cogeneration facility, and we accounted for it as a finance lease.\n\nIn November 2021, WE entered into a tolling agreement with LSP-Whitewater Limited Partnership that commenced on June 1, 2022 upon the expiration of the PPA. Concurrent with the execution of the tolling agreement, WE and WPS also entered into an agreement to purchase the natural gas-fired cogeneration facility. This asset purchase agreement was approved by the PSCW in December 2022, and the acquisition closed effective January 1, 2023. See Note 2, Acquisitions, for more information on the acquisition of this facility. The tolling agreement represented a variable interest until the facility was acquired since its terms were substantially similar to the terms of the PPA. Based on the risks of the entity, including operations, maintenance, dispatch, financing, fuel costs, and other factors, we were not the primary beneficiary of the entity. We did not hold an equity or debt interest in the entity, and there was no residual guarantee associated with the tolling agreement. Similar to the PPA, we accounted for the tolling agreement as a finance lease.\n\n## NOTE 24-COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n\nWe and our subsidiaries have significant commitments and contingencies arising from our operations, including those related to unconditional purchase obligations, environmental matters, and enforcement and litigation matters.\n\n## Unconditional Purchase Obligations\n\nOur electric utilities have obligations to distribute and sell electricity to their customers, and our natural gas utilities have obligations to distribute and sell natural gas to their customers. The utilities expect to recover costs related to these obligations in future customer rates. In order to meet these obligations, we routinely enter into long-term purchase and sale commitments for various quantities and lengths of time.\n\nThe generation facilities that are part of our non-utility energy infrastructure segment have obligations to distribute and sell electricity through long-term offtake agreements with their customers for all of the energy produced. In order to support these sales obligations, these companies enter into easements and other service agreements associated with the generating facilities.",

Specific environmental issues affecting us include, but are not limited to, current and future regulation of air emissions such as SO2, NOx, fine particulates, mercury, and GHGs; water intake and discharges; management of coal combustion products such as fly ash; and remediation of impacted properties, including former manufactured gas plant sites.\n\nWe have continued to pursue a proactive strategy to manage our environmental compliance obligations, including:\n\n- \u00b7 the development of additional sources of renewable electric energy supply;\n- \u00b7 the addition of improvements for water quality matters such as treatment technologies to meet regulatory discharge limits and improvements to our cooling water intake systems;\n- \u00b7 the addition of emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules;\n- \u00b7 the protection of wetlands and waterways, biodiversity including threatened and endangered species, and cultural resources associated with utility construction projects;\n- \u00b7 the retirement of older coal-fired power plants and conversion to modern, efficient, natural gas generation, super-critical pulverized coal generation, and/or replacement with renewable generation;\n- \u00b7 the beneficial use of ash and other products from coal-fired and biomass generating units;\n- \u00b7 the remediation of former manufactured gas plant sites;\n- \u00b7 the reduction of methane emissions across our natural gas distribution system by upgrading infrastructure; and\n- \u00b7 the reporting of GHG emissions to comply with federal clean air rules.\n\n## Air Quality\n\nCross State Air Pollution Rule - Good Neighbor Plan - The proposed rule to address the 2015 ozone NAAQS, resulting in more stringent regulation of ozone-season NOx emissions from electric utility generating units in 26 states, is expected to take effect in 2023. Based on a review of our existing units' 2020 and 2021 actual ozone season emissions and projected future emissions versus proposed NOx ozone season allocations, we anticipate that we should be able to comply with the expanded rule requirements without procuring additional allowances on the open market.\n\nOur RICE units in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and planned RICE units in Wisconsin are not subject to this rule as proposed as each unit is less than 25 MW. We note that, to the extent we use RICE engines for natural gas distribution operations, those engines may be subject to the emission limits and operational requirements of the rule beginning in 2026. In June 2022, we submitted comments on this proposed rule seeking clarification of its applicability, as well as other items, and we will closely monitor the final rule for any changes from the proposed rule.\n\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards -Ozone -After completing its review of the 2008 ozone standard, the EPA released a final rule in October 2015, creating a more stringent standard than the 2008 NAAQS. The 2015 ozone standard lowered the 8-hour limit for ground-level ozone. In November 2022, the EPA's 2022 CASAC Ozone Review Panel issued a draft report supporting a previously issued EPA staff-written Integrated Science Assessment for ozone which supported the reconsideration of the 2015 standard. The EPA had planned a proposed rule in April 2023, but the CASAC review is expected to slow the process.",

        "page_content": "In June 2021, the EPA published its final action to revise the nonattainment area designations and/or boundaries for 13 counties associated with six nonattainment areas, including several in Illinois and Wisconsin. Under the new designations, all of Milwaukee and Ozaukee counties are now listed as nonattainment and portions of Racine, Waukesha, and Washington counties have been added to the \"Milwaukee\" nonattainment area. Additionally, the Chicago, IL-IN-WI nonattainment area now includes an expanded portion of Kenosha County, and the partial nonattainment areas of Sheboygan, Door, and Manitowoc counties were also expanded.\n\nIn February 2022, revisions to the Wisconsin Administrative Code to adopt the 2015 standard were finalized. The amended regulations adopted the standard and incorporated by reference the federal air pollution monitoring requirements related to the standard. The WDNR submitted the rule updates as a SIP revision to the EPA in April 2022, which the EPA proposed to approve in August 2022.\n\nIn April 2022, the EPA proposed to find that the Milwaukee and Chicago, IL-IN-WI nonattainment areas did not meet the marginal attainment deadline of August 2021 and will be adjusted to \"moderate\" nonattainment status for the 2015 standard. In October 2022, the EPA published its final reclassifications from \"marginal\" to \"moderate\" for these areas, effective November 7, 2022. Accordingly, the WDNR must submit a SIP revision to address the moderate nonattainment status. We also expect the moderate nonattainment designation to impact emission offset ratios for major construction permitting in these areas.\n\nWe believe that we are well positioned to meet the requirements associated with the 2015 ozone standard and do not expect to incur significant costs to comply with the associated state and federal rules.\n\nParticulate Matter -In December 2020, the EPA completed its 5-year review of the 2012 annual and 24-hour standards for fine PM and determined that no revisions were necessary to the current annual standard of 12 \u00b5g/m 3 or the 24-hour standard of 35 \u00b5g/m 3 . Under the Biden Administration's policy review, the EPA concluded that the scientific evidence and information from the December 2020 determination supports revising the level of the annual standard for the PM NAAQS to below the current level of 12 \u00b5g/m 3 , while retaining the 24-hour standard. In January 2023, the EPA announced its proposed decision to revise the primary (health-based) annual PM2.5 standard from its current level of 12 \u00b5g/m 3 to within the range of 9 to 10 \u00b5g/m 3 . The EPA also proposed not to change the current secondary (welfare-based) annual PM2.5 standard, primary and secondary 24-hour PM2.5 standards, and primary and secondary PM10 standards. The EPA is also taking comments on the full range (between 8 and 11 \u00b5g/m 3 ) included in the CASAC's latest report. We anticipate the final rule to be released in late 2023. All counties within our service territories are in attainment with the current 2012 standards. If the EPA lowers the annual standard to 10 or 11 \u00b5g/m 3 , our generating facilities within our service territories should remain in attainment. If the EPA lowers it to below 10 \u00b5g/m 3 , there could be some nonattainment areas that may affect permitting of some smaller ancillary equipment located at our facilities. After finalization of the rule, the WDNR will need to draft a SIP and submit for the EPA's approval.\n\nClimate Change -The ACE rule, which replaced the Clean Power Plan, was vacated by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in January 2021. In October 2021, the Supreme Court agreed to review the D.C. Circuit Court's ruling vacating the EPA's ACE rule and in June 2022, the Supreme Court issued its decision. The Supreme Court found that the EPA may regulate GHGs under section 111 of the CAA but cannot rely on generation shifting to lower carbon emitting sources to do so. We expect a new GHG replacement rule for existing sources to be proposed in March 2023.\n\nIn January 2021, the EPA finalized a rule to revise the NSPS for GHG emissions from new, modified, and reconstructed fossil-fueled power plants; however, it was vacated by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in April 2021. Based on an updated EPA regulatory timeline, we expect a new rule to be proposed in March 2023. We continue to move forward on the ESG Progress Plan, which is heavily focused on reducing GHG emissions.\n\nThe EPA released proposed regulations for the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule, 40 CFR Part 98, in June 2022. The proposed revisions could impact the reporting required of our local natural gas distribution companies and underground natural gas storage facilities with updates to emission factors for equipment counts and increased disclosure for large release events. We expect the final rule in 2023, pending the EPA's review and consideration of public comments.\n\nOur ESG Progress Plan includes the retirement of older, fossil-fueled generation, to be replaced with zero-carbon-emitting renewables and clean natural gas-fueled generation. We have already retired more than 1,800 MW of coal-fired generation since the beginning of 2018. Through our ESG Progress Plan, we expect to retire approximately 1,600 MW of additional fossil-fueled generation by the end of 2026, which includes the planned retirements in 2024-2025 of OCPP Units 5-8 and the planned retirement by June 2026 of jointlyowned Columbia Units 1-2. See Note 7, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information on the timing of the retirements. In May 2021, we announced goals to achieve reductions in carbon emissions from our electric generation fleet by 60% by the end of 2025 and by 80% by the end of 2030, both from a 2005 baseline. We expect to achieve these goals by making operating refinements, retiring less efficient generating units, and executing our capital plan. Over the longer term, the target for our generation fleet is net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050.\n\nWe also continue to reduce methane emissions by improving our natural gas distribution system and have set a target across our natural gas distribution operations to achieve net-zero methane emissions by the end of 2030. We plan to achieve our net-zero goal through an effort that includes both continuous operational improvements and equipment upgrades, as well as the use of RNG throughout our utility systems.",

        "page_content": "We are required to report our CO2 equivalent emissions from the electric generating facilities we operate under the EPA Greenhouse Gases Reporting Program. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the data, we estimate that we will report CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 19.5 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2022. The level of CO2 and other GHG emissions varies from year to year and is dependent on the level of electric generation and mix of fuel sources, which is determined primarily by demand, the availability of the generating units, the unit cost of fuel consumed, and how our units are dispatched by MISO.\n\nWe are also required to report CO2 equivalent emissions related to the natural gas that our natural gas utilities distribute and sell. Based upon our preliminary analysis of the data, we estimate that we will report CO2 equivalent emissions of approximately 29.3 million metric tonnes to the EPA for 2022.\n\n## Water Quality\n\nClean Water Act Cooling Water Intake Structure Rule In August 2014, the EPA issued a final regulation under Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act that requires the location, design, construction, and capacity of cooling water intake structures at existing power plants reflect the BTA for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The federal rule became effective in October 2014 and applies to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures, except for the ERGS units, which were permitted and received a final BTA determination under the rules governing new facilities.\n\nIn 2016, the WDNR initiated a state rulemaking process to incorporate the federal Section 316(b) requirements into the Wisconsin Administrative Code. This new state rule, NR 111, became effective in June 2020, and the WDNR will apply it when establishing BTA requirements for cooling water intake structures at existing facilities. These BTA requirements are incorporated into WPDES permits for WE and WPS facilities.\n\nWe have received a final BTA determination for VAPP. We have received interim BTA determinations for PWGS, OCPP Units 5-8 and Weston Units 2, 3, and 4. Existing technology at the PWGS may satisfy the BTA requirements; however, a final determination will not be made until the WPDES permit is renewed for this facility, which is expected in the first half of 2023. We believe that existing technology installed at the OCPP facility meets the BTA requirements; however, depending on the timing of the permit reissuance, all four generating units may be retired prior to the WDNR making a final BTA decision anticipated in 2025. In addition, we believe that existing technology installed at the Weston facility will result in a final BTA determination during the WPDES permit reissuance in 2023.\n\nAs a result of past capital investments completed to address Section 316(b) compliance at WE and WPS, we believe our fleet overall is well positioned to continue to meet this regulation and do not expect to incur significant additional compliance costs.\n\nSteam Electric Effluent Limitation Guidelines The EPA's final 2015 ELG rule took effect in January 2016 and was modified in 2020 to revise the treatment technology requirements related to BATW and wet FGD wastewaters at existing facilities. This rule created new requirements for several types of power plant wastewaters. The two new requirements that affect WE and WPS relate to discharge limits for BATW and wet FGD wastewater. Our power plant facilities already have advanced wastewater treatment technologies installed that meet many of the discharge limits established by this rule. There will, however, need to be facility modifications to meet water permit requirements for the BATW system at Weston Unit 3, which is expected to be completed by December 2023. Modifications to OC 7 and OC 8 BATW systems were completed and placed in-service in mid-2021. Wastewater treatment system modifications also will be required for wet FGD discharges and site wastewater from the ERGS units. Based on existing contracts and engineering cost estimates, we expect that compliance with the ELG rule will require $100 million in capital investment. In December 2021, the PSCW issued a Certificate of Authority approving the ERGS FGD wastewater treatment system modification. The BATW modifications do not require PSCW approval prior to construction. All of these ELG required projects are either in-service or are on track for completion by the WPDES permit deadline in December 2023.\n\nIn July 2021, the EPA announced its intention to initiate a \"supplemental rulemaking\" to revise the ELG Reconsideration Rule that was finalized in late 2020. The EPA has stated that the 2020 ELG Rule will continue to be implemented and enforced while the agency pursues this rulemaking process. As part of their regulatory agenda, the EPA Office of Water included plans to issue a direct final rule reopening the NOPP deadline to enter the cessation of the coal subcategory (i.e. unit retirements or conversions to natural gas by the end of December 2028 instead of making capital investments to add more treatment technology) established in the 2020 ELG Rule. The new NOPP deadline will be 90 days after publication in the Federal Register , which is anticipated during the first quarter of 2023. The EPA will publish the direct final rule at the same time as the proposed ELG supplemental rulemaking.\n\nWaters of the United States In January 2023, the EPA and the United States Army Corps of Engineers together released a final rule revising the definition of WOTUS. This rule will be effective March 20, 2023. The final rule states that it is based on the pre-2015 definition of \"waters of the United States.\" The pre-2015 approach involves applying factors established through case law and agency precedents to determine whether a wetland or surface drainage feature is subject to federal jurisdiction.\n\nThe recent rulemaking could be affected by a significant pending Supreme Court case involving WOTUS determination. In January 2022, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in a case, Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency , to evaluate the proper test for determining whether wetlands are WOTUS. A decision by the Supreme Court is expected in spring 2023.\n\nAt this point, our projects requiring federal permits are moving ahead, but we are monitoring these recent developments to better understand potential future impacts. The Sackett case, once decided, should provide some clarity regarding the definition of WOTUS. We will continue to monitor this litigation and any subsequent agency action.",

        "page_content": "## Land Quality\n\nManufactured Gas Plant Remediation We have identified sites at which our utilities or a predecessor company owned or operated a manufactured gas plant or stored manufactured gas. We have also identified other sites that may have been impacted by historical manufactured gas plant activities. Our natural gas utilities are responsible for the environmental remediation of these sites, some of which are in the EPA Superfund Alternative Approach Program. We are also working with various state jurisdictions in our investigation and remediation planning. These sites are at various stages of investigation, monitoring, remediation, and closure.\n\nIn addition, we are coordinating the investigation and cleanup of some of these sites subject to the jurisdiction of the EPA under what is called a \"multisite\" program. This program involves prioritizing the work to be done at the sites, preparation and approval of documents common to all of the sites, and use of a consistent approach in selecting remedies. At this time, we cannot estimate future remediation costs associated with these sites beyond those described below.\n\nThe future costs for detailed site investigation, future remediation, and monitoring are dependent upon several variables including, among other things, the extent of remediation, changes in technology, and changes in regulation. Historically, our regulators have allowed us to recover incurred costs, net of insurance recoveries and recoveries from potentially responsible parties, associated with the remediation of manufactured gas plant sites. Accordingly, we have established regulatory assets for costs associated with these sites.\n\nWe have established the following regulatory assets and reserves for manufactured gas plant sites as of December 31:\n\n| (in millions)                                 | 2022     |   2021 |\n|-----------------------------------------------|----------|--------|\n| Regulatory assets                             | $  610.7 |  630.9 |\n| Reserves for future environmental remediation | 499.6    |  532.6 |\n\n## Renewables, Efficiency, and Conservation\n\nWisconsin Legislation In 2005, Wisconsin enacted Act 141, which established a goal that 10% of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources annually. WE and WPS have achieved their required renewable energy percentages of 8.27% and 9.74%, respectively, by constructing various wind parks, solar parks, a biomass facility, and by also relying on renewable energy purchases. WE and WPS continue to review their renewable energy portfolios and acquire cost-effective renewables as needed to meet their requirements on an ongoing basis. The PSCW administers the renewable program related to Act 141, and each utility funds the program based on 1.2% of its annual retail operating revenues.\n\nMichigan Legislation In December 2016, Michigan enacted Act 342, which required 12.5% of the state's electric energy to come from renewables for 2019 and 2020, and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to 1% annually. The renewable requirement increased to 15.0% for 2021 and beyond. UMERC was in compliance with its requirements under this statute as of December 31, 2022. The legislation continues to allow recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost-effective.\n\n## Enforcement and Litigation Matters\n\nWe and our subsidiaries are involved in legal and administrative proceedings before various courts and agencies with respect to matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Although we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters, management believes that appropriate reserves have been established and that final settlement of these actions will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\n\n## Consent Decrees\n\nWisconsin Public Service Corporation - Weston and Pulliam Power Plants In November 2009, the EPA issued an NOV to WPS, which alleged violations of the CAA's New Source Review requirements relating to certain projects completed at the Weston and Pulliam power plants from 1994 to 2009. WPS entered into a Consent Decree with the EPA resolving this NOV. This Consent Decree was entered by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin in March 2013. With the retirement of Pulliam Units 7 and 8 in October 2018, WPS completed the mitigation projects required by the Consent Decree and received a completeness letter from the EPA in October 2018. See Note 6, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, for more information about the retirement. We are working with the EPA on a closeout process for the Consent Decree and expect that process to begin in 2023.\n\nJoint Ownership Power Plants - Columbia and Edgewater In December 2009, the EPA issued an NOV to Wisconsin Power and Light Company, the operator of the Columbia and Edgewater plants, and the other joint owners of these plants, including Madison Gas and Electric Company, WE (former co-owner of an Edgewater unit), and WPS. The NOV alleged violations of the CAA's New Source Review requirements related to certain projects completed at those plants. WPS, along with Wisconsin Power and Light Company, Madison Gas and Electric Company, and WE, entered into a Consent Decree with the EPA resolving this NOV. This Consent Decree was entered by the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin in June 2013. As a result of the continued implementation of the Consent Decree related to the jointly owned Columbia and Edgewater plants, the Edgewater 4 generating unit was retired in September 2018. See Note 6, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, for more information about the retirement. Wisconsin Power and Light Company started the process to close out this Consent Decree in early 2023.",

Our restricted cash consists of the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Cash held in the Integrys rabbi trust, which is used to fund participants' benefits under the Integrys deferred compensation plan and certain Integrys non-qualified pension plans. All assets held within the rabbi trust are restricted as they can only be withdrawn from the trust to make qualifying benefit payments.\n- \u00b7 Cash on deposit in financial institutions that is restricted to satisfy the requirements of certain debt agreements at WECI Wind Holding I and WEPCo Environmental Trust.\n- \u00b7 Cash we received when WECI acquired ownership interests in certain wind generation projects. This cash is restricted as it can only be used to pay for any remaining costs associated with the construction of the wind generation facilities.\n- \u00b7 Cash used by WE and WPS for the purchase of a natural gas-fired cogeneration facility located in Whitewater, Wisconsin.

All of our utilities have regulatory mechanisms in place for recovering all prudently incurred gas costs.\n\nIn March 2021, WE and WG received approval from the PSCW to recover approximately $54 million and $24 million, respectively, of natural gas costs in excess of the benchmark set in their GCRMs over a period of three months, beginning in April 2021. In March 2021, WPS also filed its revised natural gas rate sheets with the PSCW reflecting approximately $28 million of natural gas costs in excess of the benchmark set in its GCRM. WPS also recovered these excess costs over a period of three months, beginning in April 2021.\n\nPGL and NSG incurred approximately $131 million and $10 million, respectively, of natural gas costs in February 2021 in excess of the amounts included in their rates. These costs were recovered over a period of 12 months, which started on April 1, 2021. PGL's and NSG's natural gas costs were reviewed for prudency by the ICC as part of their annual natural gas cost reconciliation. On January 5, 2023, the ICC issued written orders approving each company's 2021 reconciliation.\n\nIn February 2021, MERC incurred approximately $75 million of natural gas costs in excess of the benchmark set in its GCRM. In August 2021, the MPUC issued a written order approving a joint proposal filed by MERC and four other Minnesota utilities to recover their respective excess natural gas costs. In accordance with the order, MERC recovered $10 million of these costs through its annual natural gas true-up process over a period of 12 months, and the remaining $65 million was to be recovered over a period of 27 months, both beginning in September 2021. Recovery of these costs and the issue of prudence was referred to a contested-case proceeding. In October 2022, the MPUC issued a written order approving a settlement agreement entered into by MERC and various parties related to the recovery of the extraordinary natural gas costs incurred in February 2021. Under the settlement agreement, MERC agreed to not seek recovery of $3 million of these costs. MERC will continue to recover the remaining $62 million of extraordinary natural gas costs over the previously approved 27-month recovery period.\n\nNatural gas costs incurred at MGU and UMERC in excess of the amount included in their respective rates were not significant.",

        "page_content": "## Coronavirus Disease - 2019\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the PSCW, the ICC, the MPUC, and the MPSC all issued written orders requiring certain actions to ensure that essential utility services were available to customers in their respective jurisdictions. A summary of these orders is included below.\n\n## Wisconsin\n\nIn March 2020, the PSCW issued two orders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The first order required all public utilities in the state of Wisconsin, including WE, WPS, and WG, to temporarily suspend disconnections, the assessment of late fees, and deposit requirements for all customer classes. In addition, it required utilities to reconnect customers that were previously disconnected, offer deferred payment arrangements to all customers, and streamline the application process for customers applying for utility service.\n\nIn the second order issued in March 2020, the PSCW authorized Wisconsin utilities to defer expenditures and certain foregone revenues resulting from compliance with the first order, and expenditures as otherwise incurred to ensure safe, reliable, and affordable access to utility services during the declared public health emergency. In December 2021, the PSCW approved a motion to end all COVID-related deferrals as of December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022, our Wisconsin utilities did not have any amounts deferred related to the COVID-19 pandemic as the rate orders received from the PSCW in December 2022 did not allow recovery of these costs.\n\nIn June 2020, the PSCW issued a written order providing a timeline for the lifting of the temporary provisions required in the first March 2020 order. Utilities were allowed to disconnect commercial and industrial customers and require deposits for new service as of July 25, 2020 and July 31, 2020, respectively. After August 15, 2020, utilities were no longer required to offer deferred payment arrangements to all customers. Additionally, utilities were authorized to reinstate late fees except for the period between the first order and this supplemental order. Our Wisconsin utilities resumed charging late payment fees in late August 2020. Late payment fees were not charged on outstanding balances that were billed between the first order and late August 2020.\n\nSubsequent to the June 2020 order, the PSCW extended the moratorium on disconnections of residential customers until November 1, 2020. In accordance with Wisconsin regulations, utilities are generally not allowed to disconnect residential customers for non-payment during the winter moratorium, which customarily begins on November 1 and ends on April 15 of each year. Utilities were allowed to continue assessing late payment fees during the winter moratorium. On April 5, 2021, the PSCW issued a written order indicating that it would not extend the moratorium on disconnections further; therefore, utilities could begin disconnecting residential customers for nonpayment after April 15, 2021. The order also allowed our Wisconsin utilities to resume charging late payment fees on the full balance of all outstanding arrears, regardless of the associated dates the service was provided, after April 15, 2021. We continue to offer flexible payment arrangements to low-income residential customers prior to disconnecting service.\n\n## Illinois\n\nIn March 2020, the ICC issued an order to all Illinois utilities, including PGL and NSG, requiring, among other things, a moratorium on disconnections of utility service and a suspension of late fees and penalties during the declared public health emergency. These provisions applied to all utility customer classes. Illinois utilities were also required to temporarily enact more flexible credit and collections procedures.\n\nIn June 2020, the ICC issued a written order approving a settlement agreement negotiated by Illinois utilities, ICC staff, and certain intervenors. The key terms of the settlement agreement included the following:\n\n- \u00b7 The moratorium on disconnections and the suspension of late fees and penalties were extended until July 26, 2020.\n- \u00b7 Customers disconnected after June 18, 2019 could be reconnected without being assessed a reconnection fee if reconnection was requested prior to August 25, 2020.\n- \u00b7 Flexible deferred payment arrangements were required to be offered to residential and commercial and industrial customers for an extended period of time and with reduced down payment requirements.\n- \u00b7 Deposit requirements were waived until August 25, 2020 for all residential customers, and were waived for an additional four months for residential customers that verbally expressed financial hardship.\n- \u00b7 PGL and NSG were required to establish a bill payment assistance program with approximately $12.0 million and $1.2 million, respectively, available for eligible residential customers to provide relief from high arrearages.\n\nIn addition to the above, the settlement agreement approved in June 2020 authorized PGL and NSG to implement a SPC rider for certain costs incurred between March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The SPC rider allows for recovery of incremental direct costs resulting from COVID-19, foregone late fees and reconnection charges, and the costs associated with the bill payment assistance programs. PGL and NSG began recovering costs under the SPC rider on October 1, 2020. Amounts deferred under the SPC rider are being recovered over 36 months and will be subject to review and reconciliation by the ICC. As of December 31, 2022, PGL's and NSG's remaining regulatory assets related to the COVID-19 pandemic were $9.5 million, collectively.\n\nSubsequent to the approval of the June 2020 settlement agreement, and at the request of the ICC, PGL and NSG agreed to extend the moratorium on disconnections for qualified low-income residential customers and residential customers expressing financial hardship through March 31, 2021. The annual winter moratorium in Illinois that generally prohibits PGL and NSG from disconnecting residential customers for non-payment customarily begins on December 1 and ends on March 31 of each year.",

        "page_content": "In March 2021, the ICC issued a written order approving a second settlement agreement negotiated by Illinois utilities, ICC staff, and certain intervenors. The key terms of this new settlement agreement were as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Utilities could start sending disconnection notices, on a staggered basis, as of April 1, 2021. Disconnections were done on a staggered schedule based on customer arrears and income levels. Utilities were not allowed to disconnect customers for nonpayment prior to June 30, 2021 if the customer's household income was below 300% of the federal poverty level and the customer was on a deferred payment plan.\n- \u00b7 Utilities were required to continue offering flexible deferred payment arrangements with reduced down payment requirements to residential customers through June 30, 2021.\n- \u00b7 Reconnection fees were waived for eligible low income customers through June 30, 2021. In addition, utilities will continue to exempt eligible low income customers from late payment fees and deposits.\n- \u00b7 Each utility was required to continue, or renew, its bill payment assistance program through 2021. In addition to the $12.0 million PGL initially funded, PGL was required to fund an additional $6.0 million to its bill payment assistance program. No additional funding was required for NSG due to the amount still available for assistance from its initial funding. PGL's and NSG's bill payment assistance programs ended in April 2021 and August 2021, respectively, as all of their respective funds were exhausted.\n- \u00b7 Costs related to the provisions in the settlement agreement, including costs related to the bill payment assistance programs, were recoverable through the SPC rider.\n\n## Minnesota\n\nIn May 2020, the MPUC issued a written order authorizing Minnesota utilities, including MERC, to track and defer COVID-19 related expenses and certain foregone revenues. Costs incurred at MERC related to the COVID-19 pandemic were not significant, and at December 31, 2022, MERC did not have any amounts deferred.\n\nIn June 2020, the MPUC verbally ordered Minnesota utilities to temporarily suspend disconnections and waive reconnection fees, service deposits, late fees, interest, and penalties for all residential customers. In addition, utilities were required to immediately reconnect residential customers that were previously disconnected. In August 2020, the MPUC issued a written order affirming these temporary provisions. Prior to the June 2020 verbal order issued by the MPUC, MERC had voluntarily taken actions to ensure its customers continued to receive utility services during the pandemic. These actions included, but were not limited to, temporarily suspending disconnections and waiving late payment fees for residential and small commercial and industrial customers that entered into payment plans.\n\nIn March 2021, the MPUC issued an order requiring Minnesota utilities to file a transition plan to resume collections and disconnections. MERC filed its transition plan in April 2021, and it was subsequently deemed complete by the Executive Secretary. In accordance with the transition plan, MERC resumed disconnections on August 2, 2021. MERC will not disconnect residential customers with past due balances if the customer has a pending application or has been deemed eligible for a financial assistance program. In addition, MERC continues to offer flexible deferred payment arrangements to residential customers. For customers who enter, or are complying with, a payment arrangement, MERC did not impose any service deposits, down payments, interest, late payment fees, or reconnections fees through April 30, 2022.\n\n## Michigan\n\nIn April 2020, the MPSC issued a written order requiring Michigan utilities, including MGU and UMERC, to put certain minimum protections in place during the COVID-19 pandemic. The minimum protections required by the order included the suspension of disconnections, late payment fees, deposits, and reconnection fees for certain vulnerable customers. In addition, utilities were required to extend access to and enhance the flexibility of payment plans to customers financially impacted by COVID-19.\n\nAs required in the MPSC order, MGU and UMERC filed responses with the MPSC in April 2020 affirming the actions being taken to protect customers. These actions provided protections to more customers than required by the MPSC order, and included suspending disconnections for all residential customers, waiving deposit requirements for new service, suspending the assessment of late fees for customers that entered into payment plans, and enhancing payment plan options for all customers.\n\nThe April 2020 MPSC order also authorized all Michigan utilities to defer, for potential future recovery, uncollectible expense incurred on or after March 24, 2020 that exceeded the amounts being recovered in rates. MGU and UMERC did not record any deferrals related to the COVID-19 pandemic as they did not experience any significant COVID-19 related expenses.\n\nIn June 2021, MGU and UMERC worked with MPSC staff to develop a transition plan to resume collections and disconnections, while continuing to assist customers in managing their arrears balances. In accordance with the agreed upon transition plan, MGU and UMERC resumed pre-pandemic collection activities and residential service disconnections on August 2, 2021. Flexible deferred payment arrangements continue to be available to customers.",

        "page_content": "## Wisconsin Electric Power Company, Wisconsin Public Service Corporation, and Wisconsin Gas LLC 2023 and 2024 Rates\n\nIn April 2022, WE, WPS, and WG filed requests with the PSCW to increase their retail electric, natural gas, and steam rates, as applicable. These requests were updated in July 2022 to reflect new developments that impacted the original proposals. The requested increases in electric rates were driven by capital investments in new wind, solar, and battery storage; capital investments in natural gas generation; reliability investments, including grid hardening projects to bury power lines and strengthen WE's distribution system against severe weather; and changes in wholesale business with other utilities. Many of these investments have already been approved by the PSCW. The requested increases in natural gas rates primarily related to capital investments previously approved by the PSCW, including LNG storage for our natural gas distribution system.\n\nIn September 2022, WE, WPS, and WG entered into settlement agreements with certain intervenors to resolve most of the outstanding issues in each utility's respective rate case; however, the PSCW declined to approve the settlement agreements. In December 2022, the PSCW issued final written orders approving electric, natural gas, and steam base rate increases, effective January 1, 2023. The final orders reflect the following:\n\n|                                                      | WE                      | WPS                     | WG                     |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|\n| 2023 base rate increase                              |                         |                         |                        |\n| Electric                                             | $  283.5 million / 9.1% | $  120.5 million / 9.8% | N/A                    |\n| Gas                                                  | $  46.1 million / 9.6%  | $  26.4 million / 7.1%  | $  46.5 million / 6.4% |\n| Steam                                                | $  7.6 million / 35.3%  | N/A                     | N/A                    |\n| ROE                                                  | 9.8%                    | 9.8%                    | 9.8%                   |\n| Common equity component average on a financial basis | 53.0%                   | 53.0%                   | 53.0%                  |\n\nIn addition to the above, the final orders include the following terms:\n\n- \u00b7 The utilities will keep their current earnings sharing mechanisms, under which, if a utility earns above its authorized ROE: (i) the utility will retain 100.0% of earnings for the first 15 basis points above the authorized ROE; (ii) 50.0% of the next 60 basis points will be required to be refunded to ratepayers; and (iii) 100.0% of any remaining excess earnings will be required to be refunded to ratepayers.\n- \u00b7 WE and WPS are required to complete an analysis of alternative recovery scenarios for generating units that will be retired prior to the end of their useful life.\n- \u00b7 WE and WPS will not propose any changes to their real time pricing rates for large commercial and industrial electric customers through the end of 2024.\n- \u00b7 WE and WPS will lower monthly residential and small commercial electric customer fixed charges by $1.00 and $3.33, respectively, from currently authorized rates.\n- \u00b7 WE and WPS will offer an additional voluntary renewable energy pilot for commercial and industrial customers.\n- \u00b7 WE and WPS will work with PSCW staff and other interested parties to develop alternative low income assistance programs. WE and WPS will also collectively contribute $4.0 million to the Keep Wisconsin Warm Fund.\n- \u00b7 WE, WPS, and WG are required to implement escrow accounting treatment for pension and OPEB costs in 2023 and 2024.\n- \u00b7 WE and WPS are authorized to file a limited electric rate case re-opener for 2024 to address changes to revenue requirements associated with generation projects that are expected to be placed into service in 2023 and 2024 and future plant retirements. WE and WG are also authorized to file a limited natural gas rate case re-opener for 2024 to address additional revenue requirements associated with LNG projects that are expected to be placed into service in 2023 and 2024, respectively.\n\n## 2022 Rates\n\nIn March 2021, WE, WPS, and WG filed an application with the PSCW for the approval of certain accounting treatments that allowed them to maintain their electric, natural gas, and steam base rates through 2022 and forego filing a rate case for one year. In connection with the request, the three utilities also entered into an agreement, dated March 23, 2021, with various stakeholders. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the stakeholders fully supported the application. In September 2021, the PSCW issued written orders approving the application.\n\nThe final orders reflected the following:\n\n- \u00b7 WE, WPS, and WG amortized, in 2022, certain previously deferred balances to offset approximately half of their forecasted revenue deficiencies.\n- \u00b7 WG deferred interest and depreciation expense associated with capital investments since its last rate case that otherwise would have been added to rate base in a 2022 test-year rate case.\n- \u00b7 WE, WPS, and WG were able to defer any increases in tax expense due to changes in tax law that occurred in 2021 and/or 2022.",

The earnings sharing mechanisms were modified to authorize the utility to retain 100.0% of the first 15 basis points of earnings above its currently authorized ROE. The earnings sharing mechanisms otherwise remained as previously authorized.\n\n## 2020 and 2021 Rates\n\nIn March 2019, WE, WPS, and WG filed applications with the PSCW to increase their retail electric, natural gas, and steam rates, as applicable, effective January 1, 2020. In August 2019, all three utilities filed applications with the PSCW for approval of settlement agreements entered into with certain intervenors to resolve several outstanding issues in each utility's respective rate case. In December 2019, the PSCW issued written orders that approved the settlement agreements without material modification and addressed the remaining outstanding issues that were not included in the settlement agreements. The new rates were effective January 1, 2020. The final orders reflected the following:\n\n|                                                      | WE                      | WPS                     | WG                         |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|\n| 2020 Effective rate increase (decrease)              |                         |                         |                            |\n| Electric  (1) (2)                                    | $  15.3  million / 0.5% | $  15.8  million / 1.6% | N/A                        |\n| Gas  (3)                                             | $  10.4  million / 2.8% | $  4.3  million / 1.4%  | $  (1.5)  million / (0.2)% |\n| Steam                                                | $  1.9  million / 8.6%  | N/A                     | N/A                        |\n| ROE                                                  | 10.0%                   | 10.0%                   | 10.2%                      |\n| Common equity component average on a financial basis | 52.5%                   | 52.5%                   | 52.5%                      |\n\nIn accordance with its rate order, WE filed an application with the PSCW in July 2020 requesting a financing order to securitize $100 million of Pleasant Prairie power plant's book value, plus the carrying costs accrued on the $100 million during the securitization process and the related financing fees. In November 2020, the PSCW issued a written order approving the application. The financing order also authorized WE to form a bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity, WEPCo Environmental Trust, for the sole purpose of issuing ETBs to recover the approved costs. In May 2021, WEPCo Environmental Trust issued $118.8 million of 1.578% ETBs due December 15, 2035. See Note 23, Variable Interest Entities, for more information regarding WEPCo Environmental Trust.\n\nThe WPS rate order allows WPS to collect the previously deferred revenue requirement for ReACT\u2122 costs above the authorized $275 million level. The total cost of the ReACT\u2122 project was $342 million. This regulatory asset is being collected from customers over eight years.\n\nThe PSCW approved all three Wisconsin utilities continuing to have an earnings sharing mechanism through 2021. The earnings sharing mechanism was modified from its previous structure to one that was consistent with other Wisconsin investor-owned utilities. Under this earnings sharing mechanism, if the utility earned above its authorized ROE: (i) the utility retained 100.0% of earnings for the first 25 basis points above the authorized ROE; (ii) 50.0% of the next 50 basis points were required to be refunded to customers; and (iii) 100.0% of any remaining excess earnings were required to be refunded to customers. In addition, the rate orders also required WE, WPS, and WG to maintain residential and small commercial electric and natural gas customer fixed charges at previously authorized rates and to maintain the status quo for WE's and WPS's electric market-based rate programs for large industrial customers through 2021.\n\n## The Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company and North Shore Gas Company 2023 Rate Case\n\nOn January 6, 2023, PGL and NSG filed requests with the ICC to increase their natural gas base rates. They are requesting incremental rate increases of $194.7 million (13.0%) and $18.7 million (7.8%), respectively. The requested rate increases are primarily driven by capital investments made to strengthen the safety and reliability of each utility's natural gas distribution system. PGL is also seeking to recover costs incurred to upgrade its natural gas storage field and operations facilities and to continue improving customer service.\n\nBoth companies are requesting an ROE of 9.90% and a common equity component average of 54.0%. PGL is not seeking an extension of the QIP rider. Instead, PGL will return to the traditional rate making process to recover the costs of necessary infrastructure improvements. See the Qualifying Infrastructure Plant Rider section below for more information on the QIP rider.",

        "page_content": "An ICC decision is anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2023, with any rate adjustments expected to be effective January 1, 2024.\n\n## Third-Party Transaction Fee Adjustment Rider\n\nIn accordance with the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act that was signed into law in Illinois, effective September 15, 2021, Illinois utilities are prohibited from charging customers a fee when they elect to pay for service with a credit card. Utilities are now required to incur these expenses and seek recovery through a rate proceeding or by establishing a recovery mechanism. In December 2021, the ICC approved the use of a TPTFA rider for PGL. The TPTFA rider allows PGL to recover the costs incurred for these third-party transaction fees. PGL began recovering costs under the rider on February 1, 2022. Amounts deferred under the rider will be recovered over a period of 12 months and will be subject to an annual reconciliation whereby costs will be reviewed by the ICC for accuracy and prudency. NSG recovers costs related to these third-party transaction fees through its base rates, effective September 15, 2021.\n\n## North Shore Gas Company 2021 Rate Order\n\nIn October 2020, NSG filed a request with the ICC to increase its natural gas rates. In September 2021, the ICC issued a written order authorizing a rate increase of $4.1 million (4.5%). The rate increase reflects a 9.67% ROE and a common equity component average of 51.58%. The natural gas rate increase was primarily driven by NSG's ongoing significant investment in its distribution system since its last rate review that resulted in revised base rates effective January 28, 2015. The new rates were effective September 15, 2021.\n\n## Qualifying Infrastructure Plant Rider\n\nIn July 2013, Illinois Public Act 98-0057, The Natural Gas Consumer, Safety & Reliability Act, became law. This law provides natural gas utilities with a cost recovery mechanism that allows collection, through a surcharge on customer bills, of prudently incurred costs to upgrade Illinois natural gas infrastructure. In January 2014, the ICC approved a QIP rider for PGL, which is in effect through 2023. PGL will not seek an extension of the rider beyond 2023.\n\nPGL's QIP rider is subject to an annual reconciliation whereby costs are reviewed for accuracy and prudency. In March 2022, PGL filed its 2021 reconciliation with the ICC, which, along with the 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017, and 2016 reconciliations, are still pending. In addition, costs incurred during 2022 under the QIP rider are also still subject to reconciliation and review.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, there can be no assurance that all costs incurred under PGL's QIP rider during the open reconciliation years, which include 2016 through 2022, will be deemed recoverable by the ICC.\n\n## Minnesota Energy Resources Corporation\n\n## 2023 Rate Case\n\nOn November 1, 2022, MERC initiated a rate proceeding with the MPUC to increase its retail natural gas base rates by $40.3 million (9.9%). MERC's request reflects a 10.3% ROE and a common equity component average of 53.0%. The proposed retail natural gas rate increase is primarily driven by increased capital investments as well as inflationary pressure on operating costs. In December 2022, the MPUC approved MERC's request for interim rates totaling $37.0 million, subject to refund. The interim rates went into effect on January 1, 2023.\n\n## Michigan Gas Utilities Corporation\n\n## 2021 Rate Order\n\nIn February 2020, MGU provided notification to the MPSC of its intent to file an application requesting an increase to MGU's natural gas rates to be effective January 1, 2021. However, MGU decided that it would delay its filing of the rate case as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn May 2020, MGU filed an application with the MPSC requesting approval to defer $5.0 million of depreciation and interest expense during 2021 related to capital investments made by MGU since its last rate case. In July 2020, the MPSC issued a written order approving MGU's request. The deferral of these costs helped to mitigate the impacts from delaying the filing of the rate case.\n\nIn March 2021, MGU filed its request with the MPSC to increase its natural gas rates. In July 2021, MGU filed with the MPSC, a settlement agreement it reached with certain intervenors, which the MPSC approved in a written order in September 2021. The order authorizes a rate increase of $9.3 million (6.35%) and reflects a 9.85% ROE and a common equity component average of 51.5%. The natural gas rate increase was primarily driven by MGU's significant investment in capital infrastructure since its last rate review that resulted in revised base rates effective January 1, 2016. The order also allows MGU to implement a rider for its Main Replacement Program that will support recovery of planned capital investment related to pipeline replacements to maintain system safety and reliability between 2023 and 2027, without having to file a rate case. We expect approximately $31.7 million of costs to be recovered through this rider. All costs recovered through the rider are subject to a prudence review by the MPSC. The new rates became effective January 1, 2022.",

The amendments apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. Under ASU No. 2020-04, this relief was effective for all entities beginning March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848, which extends the relief for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform to December 31, 2024. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on our financial statements and related disclosures.\n\n## Government Assistance\n\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832). The amendments in this update increase the transparency surrounding government assistance by requiring disclosure of: (i) the types of assistance received; (ii) an entity's accounting for the assistance; and (iii) the effect of the assistance on the entity's financial statements. The update was effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. The adoption of ASU No. 2021-10, effective for our fiscal year ending on December 31, 2022, did not have a significant impact on our financial statements and related disclosures.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Regulatory Assets and Liabilities - Impact of rate regulation on financial statements - Refer to Notes 6 and 26 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's regulated utilities are subject to regulation by various state and federal regulatory bodies (collectively the 'Commissions') which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric and gas distribution companies in each respective state. Management has determined the Company meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the Regulated Operations Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standard Codification.\n\n## Deloitte & Touche LLP\n\n555 East Wells Street Suite 1400 Milwaukee, WI  53202-3824 USA\n\nTel:   +1 414 271 3000\n\nFax:  +1 414 347 6200\n\nwww.deloitte.com",

        "page_content": "Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the Company's costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, the Company's investment in the utility business. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investment, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The Commissions' regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as revenues and expenses are deferred as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers, as authorized by the Company's regulators. Future decisions of the Commissions will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of allowable costs and return on invested capital included in rates, and any refunds that may be required.\n\nWhile the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment or (3) timely recovery of costs incurred. The Company had $3,306.9 million and $3,791.9 million of regulatory assets and liabilities, respectively, as of December 31, 2022.\n\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Given that management's accounting judgments can be based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities.\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following procedures, among others:\n\n- \u00b7 We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over regulatory assets and liabilities, including management's controls over the identification of costs recorded as regulatory assets and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates.\n- \u00b7 We inquired of Company management and independently obtained and read: (1) relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company and other public utilities in each respective state, (2) company filings, (3) filings made by intervenors and (4) other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. To assess completeness, we evaluated the information obtained and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances.\n- \u00b7 For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company's filings with the Commissions and the filings with the Commissions by intervenors that may impact the Company's future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions.\n- \u00b7 We obtained management's analysis regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates.\n- \u00b7 We evaluated the Company's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFebruary 23, 2023\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.",

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 23, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFebruary 23, 2023\n\n## Deloitte & Touche LLP\n\n555 East Wells Street Suite 1400 Milwaukee, WI  53202-3824 USA\n\nTel:   +1 414 271 3000\n\nFax:  +1 414 347 6200\n\nwww.deloitte.com",

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our and our subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control -Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that our and our subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nFor Deloitte & Touche LLP's Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, attesting to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, see Page F-102.\n\n## CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the fourth quarter of 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## MARKET FOR OUR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS\n\n## NUMBER OF COMMON SHAREHOLDERS\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, based upon the number of WEC Energy Group shareholder accounts (including accounts in our stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan), we had approximately 37,000 registered shareholders.\n\n## COMMON STOCK LISTING AND TRADING\n\nOur common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \"WEC.\"\n\n## COMMON STOCK DIVIDENDS OF WEC ENERGY GROUP\n\nWe review our dividend policy on a regular basis.

In addition to WEC Energy Group, the companies in the Prior Custom Peer Group Index are: Alliant Energy Corporation; Ameren Corporation; American Electric Power Company, Inc.; CMS Energy Corporation; Consolidated Edison, Inc.; DTE Energy Company; Duke Energy Corp.; Edison International; Evergy, Inc.; Eversource Energy; FirstEnergy Corp.; NiSource Inc.; OGE Energy Corp.; PG&E Corporation; Pinnacle West Capital Corporation; The Southern Company; and Xcel Energy Inc.\n\nCustom Peer Group Index . In December 2022, it was determined that PG&E Corporation (\"PG&E\") was no longer an appropriate peer comparison and PG&E was removed from the Custom Peer Group Index. PG&E is a public utility holding company whose primary operating subsidiary sells and delivers electricity and natural gas to customers located in Northern and Central California. As a result, PG&E is subject to a significantly increased financial risk from wildfires and other natural disasters. In fact, in 2020 PG&E emerged from bankruptcy resulting from incidents related to these risks. And further, some financial analysts have recently dropped their coverage of PG&E. In addition, Dominion Energy, Inc. was added to the peer group effective January 1, 2022. The Custom Peer Group Index includes Dominion Energy, Inc. and excludes PG&E.\n\n## Five-Year Cumulative Return\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Value of Investment at Year-End\n\n|                               | 12/31/17   | 12/31/18   | 12/31/19   | 12/31/20   | 12/31/21   | 12/31/22   |\n|-------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| WEC Energy Group, Inc.        | $100       | $107.86    | $147.79    | $151.46    | $164.55    | $163.74    |\n| S&P 500                       | $100       | $95.61     | $125.70    | $148.82    | $191.49    | $156.78    |\n| Custom Peer Group Index       | $100       | $102.99    | $130.95    | $125.17    | $143.66    | $145.39    |\n| Prior Custom Peer Group Index | $100       | $101.43    | $127.04    | $121.89    | $139.83    | $147.10    |",

        "page_content": "## How our Compensation Program Supports our Business Strategy\n\nAn important aspect of the Board's oversight responsibilities is to hold the executive management team accountable to achieving the Company's goals and objectives, and reward them appropriately when they do. This includes oversight of executive compensation.\n\nSince 2004, our executive compensation program has included metrics that link a substantial portion of executive pay to achieving financial, operational and social targets tied to our business fundamentals. These targets are linked to key objectives that underpin the company's sustainability.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Social Matters\n\nIncentive targets associated with operational and social goals are tied to strategic priorities, which include, among other things, a focus on employee safety, customer satisfaction, and workforce and supplier diversity.\n\n## Environmental Matters\n\nDelivering a cleaner energy future to our customers while maintaining affordability and reliability, is one of our core responsibilities and a major focus of our capital plan. Rather than attempting to create unique metrics associated with long-term climate goals, the Compensation Committee assesses management's performance against environmental goals through the execution of its capital plan. Management annually refreshes the capital plan, discusses it with the Board, including a preview of anticipated capital spending over five years, and then publicly discloses its plan during the fourth quarter each year.\n\nThe Company's ability to fund its substantial capital plan without issuing additional equity has been directly linked with the Company's ability to consistently deliver on its financial plan, including meeting the targets associated with the financial metrics used in the Company's compensation program. These financial metrics are key performance indicators underlying our executives' incentive compensation.\n\n## Our Efficiency, Sustainability and Growth Progress Plan\n\nIn November 2022, the Company announced its 2023-2027 capital plan, referred to as our ESG Progress Plan, which details planned significant investments in low- and no-carbon generation and modernization of the Company's electric and natural gas infrastructure aimed at helping to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases (carbon and methane). These investments are the building blocks for the Company's carbon dioxide emission reduction goals from our electric generation - 60% below 2005 levels by the end of 2025, 80% below 2005 levels by the end of 2030, and net carbon neutral by 2050. The plan also supports the Company's goal to achieve net-zero methane emissions from natural gas distribution lines in its network by the end of 2030.\n\n*Includes projection of potential carbon offsets by 2050\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReduction goals:\n\nNet carbon neutral by 2050\n\n## Net-zero methane emissions by 2030\n\nGoals aligned with Paris Agreement",

Acting on the recommendation of the Corporate Governance Committee, the Board is recommending the following 12 nominees for election as directors at our annual meeting. Each nominee, if elected, will serve until the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, or until a successor is duly elected and qualified.\n\n| 1. Ave M. Bie            | 5. Cristina A. Garcia-Thomas   | 9. Scott J. Lauber    |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------|\n| 2. Curt S. Culver        | 6. Maria C. Green              | 10.

Tellock   |\n\n- \u00b7 All director nominees currently serve as directors on our Board. Other than Director Bie, who was appointed to our Board effective January 1, 2023, all nominees were elected by our stockholders at our 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, each having received at least 92.91% of the votes cast.\n- \u00b7 All director nominees are independent with the exception of Directors Klappa and Lauber, who are employees of the Company. Each nominee has consented to being nominated and to serve if elected. In the unlikely event that any nominee becomes unable to serve for any reason, the proxies will be voted for a substitute nominee selected by the Board upon the recommendation of the Corporate Governance Committee.\n- \u00b7 This is an uncontested election; therefore, our majority vote standard for election of directors will apply. Under this standard, each director nominee will be elected only if the number of votes cast favoring such nominee's election exceeds the number of votes cast opposing that nominee's election, as long as a quorum is present. Therefore, presuming a quorum is present, shares not voted, whether by broker non-vote, abstention, or otherwise, have no effect on the election of directors. Proxies may not be voted for more than 12 persons in the election of directors.\n\nThe process through which the Board arrived at these director nominees is the result of the Board's regular assessment of its composition and its focused attention to ongoing succession planning, as described in the following pages.",

        "page_content": "## BOARD COMPOSITION\n\nThe Corporate Governance Committee and the Board evaluate director nominees in light of the Board's current members, with the goal of recommending nominees with diverse backgrounds and experiences who, together with the current directors, can best perpetuate the success of WEC Energy Group's business and represent stockholder interests. Director nominees are evaluated on the basis of certain key attributes, core competencies, diversity, age/tenure, existing time commitments and independence. By following this process, the Board is able to ensure that its director candidates bring a broad range of perspectives and experiences, will effectively contribute to the Board, and will complement the other directors.\n\nThe Corporate Governance Committee and the Board determined that the director nominees' complementary breadth of characteristics are suited to executing the duties of the Board and, when taken together, embody the personal qualities, qualifications, skills, and diversity of background that best serve our Company and its stockholders.\n\n----------------\n\n## 2023 BOARD OF DIRECTORS 12 NOMINEES\n\n------------------\n\nGender diversity\n\nRacial/Ethnic diversity\n\nAverage age\n\nAverage tenure\n\nIndependence\n\n33%\n\n33%\n\n65 years\n\n7.5 years\n\n83%\n\n## Key Attributes Required of All Directors\n\nThe Corporate Governance Committee routinely evaluates the expertise and needs of the Board to determine its proper membership and size. The Board believes that all directors must demonstrate certain key attributes, as noted below.\n\n- \u00b7 Proven integrity\n- \u00b7 Ability to appraise problems objectively\n- \u00b7 Relevant technological, civic, economic, and/or social/cultural experience\n- \u00b7 Familiarity with domestic and international issues affecting the Company's business\n- \u00b7 Vision and imagination\n- \u00b7 Willingness to dedicate sufficient time to board service\n- \u00b7 Sound business experience/acumen\n- \u00b7 Achievement of prominence in career\n- \u00b7 Availability to serve for five years before reaching retirement age of 72 (in the case of new, non-management directors)\n\n## Core Competencies\n\nThe Board regularly evaluates director qualifications and core competencies in the context of the Board's oversight of strategic initiatives, financial and operational performance objectives, and material risks. To that end, the Board seeks directors whose collective knowledge, experience and skills provide a broad range of perspectives and leadership expertise in domains particularly relevant to our business including: highly complex and regulated industries, strategic planning, financial strategy, utility/energy industry, technology and security, audit oversight and financial controls, human capital management, corporate governance, sustainability matters (including those associated with climate strategy), public policy, and other areas important to executing the Company's strategy.\n\nWith that in mind, the Corporate Governance Committee and Board have determined that the Board's composition should consist of candidates that collectively possess a specific set of core competencies, as listed below, in alphabetical order, in order to effectively carry out its oversight function.\n\n- \u00b7 Audit/Financial Planning\n- \u00b7 CEO/Senior Leadership\n- \u00b7 Corporate Governance\n- \u00b7 Financial Strategy/Investment Management/Investor Relations\n- \u00b7 Government/Public Policy\n- \u00b7 Human Capital Management/Exec Comp\n- \u00b7 Regulated Industry Knowledge\n- \u00b7 Risk Management and Oversight\n- \u00b7 Strategic Planning\n- \u00b7 Sustainability Matters\n- \u00b7 Technology and Security\n- \u00b7 Utility/Energy Industry Experience\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the Corporate Governance Committee and Board evaluated and affirmed this set of competencies. Each director performed a self-assessment of his/her level of knowledge in each skill area using the following 3-point scale: '1' Limited knowledge (e.g., no direct experience, primary exposure comes from Board or Committee reports); '2' Intermediate knowledge (e.g., general managerial/oversight experience or broad exposure as a Board or Committee member); '3' Advanced knowledge (e.g., direct experience; subject matter expert). A summary of the Board's level of knowledge with respect to each of the core competencies is shown on the following page.\n\n- \u00b7 Mature and independent judgment\n- \u00b7 Ability to evaluate strategic options and risks\n- \u00b7 Social consciousness\n- \u00b7 Contribution to the Board's desired collective diversity",

of the Corporate Governance Committee for decades when identifying director nominees. It is committed to actively seeking highly qualified individuals from underrepresented communities as it strives to cast a wide net and recommend candidates who bring unique perspectives to the Board, which contributes to its collective diversity - diversity of knowledge, skills, experiences, thought, gender, race/ethnicity, retirement age and tenure. We believe this diversity improves the overall effectiveness of the Board as it carries out its oversight role.\n\n## Age and Tenure\n\nUnder the Corporate Governance Guidelines, a non-management director shall not be nominated for election to the Board after attaining the age of 72, unless nominated by the Board for special circumstances. The Board does not believe it is appropriate or necessary to limit the number of terms a director may serve. The Board values the participation and insight of directors who have developed an increased understanding of the Company and the specific issues it faces doing business in a complex, regulated industry, as well as those directors who bring fresh and varied perspectives, resulting in a Board with a balanced tenure.",

        "page_content": "## Time Commitment\n\nOur Corporate Governance Committee recommends and the Board nominates candidates whom they believe are capable of devoting the time necessary to carefully fulfill their fiduciary duties. The Corporate Governance Committee regularly reviews stockholders' views on the appropriate number of public company boards on which directors may serve, which the Board takes into consideration each year as it reviews its Corporate Governance Guidelines.\n\nThe Corporate Governance Guidelines limit the maximum number of public company boards on which a WEC Energy Group director may serve to four public companies (including our Board), and specify that any public company chief executive officer who serves as a director on our Board may not serve on more than two public company boards (including our Board). Limited exceptions may be made with Corporate Governance Committee approval. All of our director nominees are in compliance.\n\n## Independence\n\nOur Corporate Governance Guidelines state that to be independent, the Board should consist of at least a two-thirds majority of independent directors. In order to be deemed independent, the individual must have no material relationship with the Company that would interfere with the exercise of good judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities as a director.\n\nThe independence standards found in our Corporate Governance Guidelines are not only in compliance with the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange ('NYSE'), but are actually more stringent than the NYSE rules. Our director independence guidelines are located in Appendix A of our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which are available on the Corporate Governance section of the Company's website at www.wecenergygroup.com/govern/governance.htm.\n\nPrior to initial and annual election, all directors complete a detailed questionnaire that elicits information that is used to ensure compliance with the Board's and the NYSE's standards of independence. The Corporate Governance Committee also reviews potential conflicts of interest, including related-party transactions, interlocking directorships, and substantial business, civic and/or social relationships with other members of the Board that could impair the prospective Board member's ability to act independently from the other Board members and management. The Board also considers whether a director's immediate family members meet the independence criteria outlined in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, as well as whether a director has certain relationships with WEC Energy Group's affiliates, when determining the director's independence.\n\nThe Board has affirmatively determined that Directors Bie, Culver, Cunningham, Farrow, Garcia-Thomas, Green, Lane, Payne, Stanek, and Tellock are independent. Directors Klappa and Lauber are not independent due to their employment with the Company. J. Kevin Fletcher, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and President until February 1, 2022, who was a director until that date, was not independent due to his employment with the Company.\n\n## Director Stanek\n\nSince 2005, WEC Energy Group has engaged Baird Financial Group (\"Baird\") primarily to provide consulting services for investments held in the Company's various benefit plan trusts. Baird also provides certain related administrative services. The Board reviewed the terms of this engagement, including the $754,451 in fees paid to Baird in 2022 (which are less than one-tenth of 1% of Baird's total revenue), and Director Stanek's position at Baird, and concluded that such engagement is not material and did not impact Director Stanek's independence. Director Stanek is not involved with and does not consult on the contract with or recommendations made by Baird and receives no direct financial benefit from these services. WEC Energy Group management evaluates Baird's services against market standards for overall quality and value on a regular basis. Neither the Board nor Director Stanek plays a role in the retention of Baird for these services or any related negotiation of commercial terms. In addition, WEC Energy Group's pension trusts and other benefit accounts do not hold any investments in Baird funds.",

These discussions are co-facilitated by the Executive Chairman and Independent Lead Director during the Board's executive sessions.\n\nDuring 2022, these discussions took into consideration the Board's desire to add further utility industry experience, including a deep understanding of risks and opportunities facing utilities, such as those related to climate change, while being mindful of the Board's goal to return to over 30% female representation.\n\nGuided by the Board's succession planning discussions, the Corporate Governance Committee, comprised entirely of independent directors, is responsible for identifying and recommending director candidates to our Board for nomination.\n\n## Director Nomination Process\n\nThe Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for recommending a slate of nominees to the Board for election at each Annual Meeting of Stockholders using the formal process detailed below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1\n\nBoard Succession Planning\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIdentify Candidates\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEvaluate Candidate Recommendations\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMeet with Candidates\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRecommend Candidate Nomination\n\nDevelop list of skills and qualifications sought in new directors and evaluate current Board composition\n\nProposed by stockholders, directors, and/or others\n\nScreen qualifications, assess impact on Board composition, and review independence\n\nMultiple meetings scheduled with the Board Executive Chairman and Independent Lead Director, other members of Corporate Governance Committee, and other members of the Board\n\nCorporate Governance Committee considers feedback and makes recommendation to the Board\n\n- 1. Board succession planning. The Corporate Governance Committee facilitates the director recruitment and nomination process through the lens of the Board's ongoing director succession planning process, as described above. The Corporate Governance Committee seeks to fulfill its duty to stockholders to consistently maintain a Board that is comprised of directors who each embody key attributes, and who, as a group, have the skills and experiences to effectively oversee management's strategy for operating in a complex industry while performing their fiduciary obligations.\n- 2.

The effectiveness of this oversight was particularly apparent in 2022 as the Board achieved a seamless transition to a new Chief Executive Officer and a new President of its Illinois utility subsidiaries, and ended 2022 with the most diverse senior leadership team in Company history.\n\n## Oversight of Strategy\n\nThe Board believes that a fundamental, collective understanding of the issues facing the Company is imperative to its ability to carry out its strategic oversight responsibilities. Throughout the year, the Board engages in substantive discussions with management about the Company's strategy. Elements of strategy are discussed within the Board committee meetings and at every regularly scheduled Board meeting. This includes updates from management on the Company's financial performance and the status of operational and social goals and performance, and the internal and external factors that influence performance and sustainability.\n\nAt least annually, the Board engages in significant educational sessions that include briefings and presentations from the Company's senior leadership team, other members of management, and outside advisors and subject matter experts, including scientists and institutional investors. These sessions help the Board to understand the environment within which the Company operates and the risks and opportunities presented thereby, and inform and shape the Board's understanding of management's decision-making, leading to more effective oversight of the Company's short-, medium- and long-term strategies and operational objectives.\n\n## 2022 Highlights\n\nThe Company closed out 2022 having achieved record net income and record earnings per share, while also returning more cash to stockholders than in any other year in Company history. Significant progress was made on the Company's continuing energy transition including regulatory approval for its first two solar-battery projects. The Board executed on its succession plan and appointed a new female director effective January 1, 2023, who brings significant knowledge and experience surrounding major risks and opportunities facing the utility sector, including those related to climate change, advancing technology and cyber security.\n\n## Oversight of Risk Management\n\nOur Board of Directors is responsible for providing oversight with respect to our major strategic initiatives, which requires ongoing dialogue with our senior management team about opportunities and risks, and the processes through which senior management maintains focus on the organization's key financial and business objectives, corporate policies, and overall economic, environmental and social performance. Senior management, in turn, is responsible for effectively planning and executing daily operations within a strong risk framework.\n\nWith that in mind, the Company has created a framework from which management is able to provide meaningful information to the Board to aid in its oversight responsibility. Included below is a high-level overview of that structure.\n\n## Audit Services\n\nAs a standing corporate practice, each year, management systematically evaluates the Company's risk areas. Our Audit Services department conducts an annual enterprise risk assessment, whereby business leaders identify existing, new or emerging issues or changes within their business areas that could have enterprise implications. Risk areas are then mapped to create a cumulative assessment of their significance and likelihood, taking into consideration industry benchmarking information, as appropriate. The mapping also identifies lines of responsibility for managing the risks to ensure accountability and focus.",

        "page_content": "## Enterprise Risk Steering Committee\n\nChaired by the Chief Executive Officer and consisting of other senior-level management employees, our Enterprise Risk Steering Committee (\"ERSC\") regularly reviews the Company's key risk areas and provides input into the development and implementation of effective compliance and risk management practices. On a bimonthly basis, the ERSC discusses findings of Audit Services' annual enterprise risk assessment, holds in-depth discussions with members of management on identified subjects, and tracks the status of ongoing progress. The Chief Executive Officer provides the Board with routine updates on the Company's key risk areas during the Board meetings, including summaries from the bimonthly discussions held by the ERSC.\n\nClimate Risk: Given the significant risks and opportunities associated with climate change, management has created a separate committee under the guidance of the Chief Executive Officer. The Climate Risk Committee, which is a sub-committee of the ERSC, brings together senior-level officers responsible for overall climate-related corporate strategy. This committee meets at least quarterly to review and discuss climate-related goals, risks and opportunities.\n\n## Board Committees\n\nTo carry out its oversight function, the Board is organized into five standing committees with specific duties and risk-monitoring responsibilities: Audit and Oversight, Compensation, Corporate Governance, Executive and Finance. With the exception of the Executive Committee, the Board and each of its committees meet regularly throughout the year, and receive regular briefings prepared by management and outside advisors on specific areas of current and emerging risks to the enterprise, which are identified and monitored through the Company's enterprise risk management framework, as described above.\n\nThe Committees routinely report to the full Board on matters that fall within designated areas of responsibility as described in their charters. Examples of risk monitoring activity that have been designated to the full Board and its committees are shown in the chart below. More information on the committees' duties and responsibilities begins on page P-32.\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nWhile the Board delegates specified duties to its committees, the Board retains collective responsibility for comprehensive risk oversight, including short- and long-term critical risks that could significantly impact the Company. The Board believes that certain matters should be contemplated by the diverse perspective of its full membership. This includes oversight of environmental, social and governance risks that have the potential to result in significant financial or reputational consequences that could impact the Company's brand, limit its sustainability or jeopardize its value to stockholders.\n\nAs part of the Board's approach to risk oversight and management, the Chief Executive Officer provides reports to the Board at each Board meeting and routinely calls upon members of the management team to provide detailed reports to the Board in their respective areas of responsibility, including matters of enterprise risk.\n\n## Executive Sessions\n\nExecutive sessions for the non-management directors are generally held at every regularly scheduled Board and committee meeting, during which directors have direct access to, and meet as desired with, Company representatives to discuss matters of interest, including those related to risk management.\n\nOutside of scheduled meetings, the Board, its committees and individual Board members have full access to executives, senior managers and other key employees, including the Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, EVP External Affairs, Chief Audit Officer, Compliance Officer, Chief Information Officer and Controller. They are also free to engage as needed with the leaders of our utility companies and our corporate center departments, including customer service, environmental, enterprise security, human resources, investor relations, tax and treasury.",

        "page_content": "## OUR ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE COMMITMENT\n\nThe Board's oversight of the Company's strategic direction includes reviewing with senior management our approach to environmental, social and governance matters. The Board is mindful of management's responsibility to provide safe, reliable and affordable energy, to preserve the Company's long-term value and to make decisions that take into account not only the Company's stockholders, but also the interests of its other stakeholders, including our employees and the well-being of the communities we serve, now and in the future.\n\nBelow are some highlights from 2022 that demonstrate the Company's and the Board's commitment to ensuring that the Company's goals and practices are aligned with a strong focus on environmental, social and governance priorities and, ultimately, sustainability. More details on Company performance in key areas are available under '2022 WEC Energy Group Operational Goals and Performance under the Short-Term Performance Plan,' which begins on P-49.\n\n## Delivering a clean energy future\n\n## ESG Progress Plan: A Road Map for Investment in Efficiency, Sustainability and Growth\n\nIn advance of publicly announcing the Company's five-year (2023-2027) capital plan in November 2022, management reviewed this updated ESG Progress Plan with the Board.\n\nManagement and the Board discussed the foundation underlying the $20.1 billion in projected investments over five years that are designed to set the Company on the course to meet its long-term emission reduction targets while also ensuring continued focus on business fundamentals. Those discussions included criteria such as underlying customer preferences and needs, regulatory environment, financial implications, and technological advancements that will influence the trajectory of the plan's execution, and resulted in the Board's approval of management's strategic vision and recommendations.\n\n## Supporting our colleagues and communities\n\n## Human Capital Management\n\nWe strive to make our companies great places to work, with programs for individual development, initiatives to promote our core values of diversity, equity and inclusion, and targeted recruitment as we build the workforce of the future. During 2022, we demonstrated this commitment through many initiatives focused on, among other priorities: employee education; significant support for and leveraging of our nine business resource groups; increasing workforce diversity in our senior leadership; meeting our vigorous health and safety expectations; training and development opportunities for employees at all levels of the organization; our robust talent review and succession planning process that ensures we have a talent pipeline for the future and supporting charitable giving to diverse communities to improve local employment opportunities.\n\n## Supplier Diversity\n\nWe have had a supplier diversity program under the watchful guidance of senior leadership since 2002. In 2022, we spent $299 million with diverse suppliers, including certified minority-, women-, veteran- and service disabled-owned businesses.\n\n## Community Support\n\nManagement and the Board have always embraced the Company's role as a leader in the communities we are privileged to serve. During 2022, our companies and foundations contributed more than $20 million in charitable grants to support nonprofits hard at work helping others.\n\n## Upholding strong governance\n\n## Board Oversight\n\nOur Board has been deeply engaged in careful succession planning over the past several years, with a clear focus on maintaining a board composition that has the professional experience, core competencies, and diversity to provide effective oversight of the complex matters the Company faces in the highly regulated utility industry. Between 2019 and 2022, five new independent directors have been added to the Board. This has successfully resulted in enhancing the Board's collective core competencies and oversight expertise in key risk areas including technology and cyber security, enterprise risk, renewable energy investment strategy, corporate sustainability, and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, while simultaneously increasing its overall ethnic, racial and gender diversity, and decreasing overall Board tenure. In 2022, the Company launched a formal process of quarterly reporting to the Audit and Oversight Committee on matters relating to political advocacy.\n\n## United Nations SDGs\n\nDelivering reliable, affordable energy to our customers, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and building and maintaining safe, resilient infrastructure are central to our business. These commitments align directly with three of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The results of this comprehensive assessment have strengthened our existing commitment to sustainability, and are being used to develop strategies and drive changes to meet and exceed stakeholder expectations and pave the way for the Company's successful future.\n\n## Our Priority Sustainability Issues (alphabetical order)\n\n- \u00b7 Climate strategy\n- \u00b7 Community engagement\n- \u00b7 Customer satisfaction\n- \u00b7 Cybersecurity\n- \u00b7 Economic development\n\n## Climate Report\n\nSince 2019, the Company has issued climate reports as needed to illustrate its approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and to present an analysis of factors that could affect future decision-making. The Company published its third climate report in 2022, including new scenario analysis for the Company's natural gas utility business, along with further discussion of risks, opportunities and uncertainties across the enterprise. This report was again prepared in conformity with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (\"TCFD\"). The Company plans to issue another TCFD-aligned report in 2023.\n\n## Independent assurance of climate data\n\nIn 2021, the Company engaged an independent, third-party to provide a limited assurance statement regarding the Company's processes, systems and controls for the collection and analysis of activity data related to its greenhouse gas emissions for years 2005, 2011, 2015 and 2020 .\n\n## Commitment to reporting transparency\n\nWe value the importance our stakeholders place on understanding how we manage risks and opportunities associated with sustaining our enterprise. In addition to engaging directly with stakeholders on environmental and social issues, we are committed to transparent reporting on these matters through a variety of mechanisms, including those noted below.

        "page_content": "## BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE\n\n## Roles of the Chairman and CEO\n\nConsistent with WEC Energy Group's bylaws and Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board has discretion to combine and separate the offices of the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. The Board believes the current leadership structure of separate CEO and Chairman positions is in the best interests of the Company's stockholders at this time. This structure allows Mr. Lauber to focus on implementing the Company's operating plans and leading the day-to-day management of our seven customer-facing utilities, and allows Mr. Klappa to lead the Board in its oversight, advisory and risk management roles, with added leadership responsibility for Company strategy, capital allocation, investor relations and economic development matters.\n\n## Independent Lead Director\n\nThe independent members of the Board elect the Independent Lead Director, with an expectation that the individual elected will serve in that capacity for three years, subject to continuing election by stockholders in annual director elections. The independent members of the Board may adjust the Independent Lead Director's length of service in that role, including extending it beyond three years, at their discretion. Annually, the independent members of the board complete a performance evaluation of his or her effectiveness.\n\nIn May 2020, the Board elected William M. Farrow to serve as the Independent Lead Director; he also chairs the Corporate Governance Committee. The independent directors plan to hold an election for the next Independent Lead Director in May 2023.\n\nDuties of the Independent Lead Director include:\n\n- \u00b7 presides at all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present, including executive sessions of the independent directors without any management present;\n- \u00b7 serves as liaison between the CEO and the independent directors under most circumstances, although each individual director has full access to the CEO;\n- \u00b7 authority to call meetings of the independent directors;\n- \u00b7 reviews and approves meeting schedules and agendas for the Board and its committees for content and to assure there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items;\n\n## BOARD AND COMMITTEE PRACTICES\n\n## Board Meetings and Attendance\n\nDuring 2022, the Board met six times and executed three written unanimous consents. All directors attended more than 75% of the total number of meetings of the Board and Board committees on which each served, with average director attendance at more than 99%. Generally, all directors are expected to attend the Company's Annual Meetings of Stockholders. All directors standing for election in 2023, other than Ms. Bie, who was not a director at the time, attended the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n\n## Executive Sessions\n\nAt every regularly scheduled Board and committee meeting, executive sessions are scheduled, and are generally held, for the nonmanagement directors to meet without management present. In 2022, an executive session of independent, non-management directors was held at every regularly scheduled Board meeting and at most committee meetings.\n\n## Director Orientation and Continuing Education\n\nManagement takes seriously its responsibility to onboard new directors and provide ongoing education for existing directors on the unique and complex issues inherent in operating a public company in the regulated utility industry.\n\nManagement has created a robust orientation program that introduces new directors to the Company's organizational structure, businesses, strategies, risks and opportunities, which includes in-house and field programs such as walking tours of the Company's generating facilities and project sites, senior management presentations and individual sessions with senior leaders. These activities assist new directors in developing and/or enhancing their Company and industry knowledge to optimize their service on the Board. To ensure that our directors have self-directed access to governance-related resources and director training opportunities, all of our directors are members of the National Association of Corporate Directors (\"NACD\").\n\nDuring 2022, management provided significant educational opportunities for the Board to better understand the external environment within which the Company operates, including briefings and presentations provided by third-party experts, outside advisors and other stakeholders.\n\n- \u00b7 reviews all proposed changes to committee charters;\n- \u00b7 leads the annual Board evaluation;\n- \u00b7 provides input to the Chairman on the scope, quality and timeliness of information provided to the Board;\n- \u00b7 authority to attend all committee meetings, as appropriate;\n- \u00b7 be available for consultation and communication with significant stockholders and other interested parties, if needed; and\n- \u00b7 any other duties as may be prescribed by the Board.",

        "page_content": "## Annual Performance Evaluations\n\n## CEO Performance\n\nThe Compensation Committee, on behalf of the Board, annually evaluates the performance of the CEO and reports the results to the Board. The CEO is evaluated in a number of areas including leadership, vision, financial stewardship, strategy development and execution, management development, effective communication with constituencies, demonstrated integrity and effective representation of the Company in community and industry affairs.\n\nAs part of this practice, the Compensation Committee Chair individually obtains from each non-management director his or her input on the CEO's performance, which is summarized and discussed with the Compensation Committee members, followed by discussion in executive session with all non-management directors. The Compensation Committee Chair then shares the evaluation results with the CEO. This procedure allows the Board to evaluate the CEO and to communicate the Board's expectations. The Compensation Committee considers the input of all non-management directors in determining appropriate compensation for the CEO. This process was completed and the Compensation Committee approved a 2023 compensation package for Mr. Lauber in December 2022.\n\n## Executive Chairman Performance\n\nUnder the same process and timing as the CEO performance evaluation, the Compensation Committee Chair facilitated the annual performance evaluation of Mr. Klappa in his role as Executive Chairman. The results were discussed with the Compensation Committee members, followed by discussion with all non-management directors in executive session and, ultimately, with Mr. Klappa. This process was completed and the Compensation Committee approved a 2023 compensation package for Mr. Klappa in December 2022.\n\n## Independent Lead Director Performance\n\nOn an annual basis, the Independent Lead Director is evaluated on the effectiveness in carrying out his or her duties, which are outlined in the Corporate Governance Guidelines. This evaluation is led by the Chairman of the Board, who references the NACD Lead Director Assessment framework to facilitate individual conversations with the independent directors to capture feedback. The Independent Lead Director is evaluated in several areas including his facilitation of discussions between and amongst the Chairman and the directors during open sessions with management, during executive sessions, and outside of board meetings, and his collaboration with the Chairman in identifying key topics, issues and concerns that directors wish to be addressed during board meetings and executive sessions. The Chairman uses this input to provide the Independent Lead Director feedback in carrying out his or her duties in the upcoming year. This process was completed in April 2022.\n\n## Board Performance\n\nThe Board recognizes that self-reflection and continuous improvement are key to remaining an effective governing body. Led by the Independent Lead Director, the Corporate Governance Committee is charged with overseeing the Board's annual evaluation process, a process which is reviewed periodically, and includes discussion on whether to utilize a third-party facilitator.In December 2022, the Board evaluated its performance utilizing a framework of questions developed by the NACD, in addition to several broad 'reflection' questions. The Corporate Governance Committee and the Board discussed the Board evaluation results at their meetings in January 2023. It is standard practice for the Corporate Governance Committee to use the results of this process to foster continuous improvement of the Board's governance activities.\n\n## BOARD EVALUATION PROCESS\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Self-Reflection Questionnaire\n\nDirectors contemplated the Board's performance across the following elements:\n\n- \u00b7  board composition and leadership\n- \u00b7  board committees\n- \u00b7  board meetings\n- \u00b7  overall effectiveness of the Board\n- \u00b7  overall effectiveness of the Board with regard to management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOne-on-One Discussion with Independent Lead Director\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDiscussion of Key Take-Aways and Governance Enhancements\n\nThe Independent Lead Director engaged in one-on-one discussions with each director on elements of the Board's performance, allowing each director an opportunity to speak candidly.\n\nHaving captured a summary of the feedback from these discussions, the Independent Lead Director led the Corporate Governance Committee, and then the Board during its Executive Session, through group discussions of key takeaways and recommended enhancements to its governance practices.\n\n## Committee Performance\n\nEach committee, except the Executive Committee, conducts an annual performance evaluation of its own activities and reports the results to the Board. During this evaluation, each committee compares its performance against the requirements of its charter and its annual planning calendar; contemplates a series of questions related to the qualifications and performance of committee members; considers the quality and quantity of information provided to the committee in advance of its meetings; and evaluates the effectiveness of the processes the committee uses to carry out its oversight responsibilities. The results of the annual evaluations are used by each committee to identify its strengths and areas where its governance practices can be improved. Each committee may recommend changes to its charter to the full Board based upon the evaluation results.\n\nIt is also standard practice for the Corporate Governance Committee annually to conduct a holistic review of all of the committees' charters and annual planning calendars, taking into consideration evolving and new best practices with respect to risk oversight. Recommendations are routed to the appropriate Committee Chair, as needed, for consideration.\n\nFollowing this holistic review during 2022, several of the Board committees, with the exception of the Compensation and Executive Committees, adopted changes to their charters.",

(\"FW Cook\") to analyze and help develop the Company's executive compensation program, and to assess whether the compensation program is competitive and supports the Committee's objectives. FW Cook also assesses and provides recommendations on non-management director compensation, as discussed in more detail on pages P36-P37. FW Cook is engaged solely by the Compensation Committee to provide executive compensation consulting services, and does not provide any additional services to the Company.\n\nIn connection with its retention of FW Cook, the Compensation Committee reviewed FW Cook's independence, including: (1) the amount of fees received by FW Cook from WEC Energy Group as a percentage of FW Cook's total revenue; (2) FW Cook's policies and procedures designed to prevent conflicts of interest; and (3) the existence of any business or personal relationships that could impact independence. After reviewing these and other factors, the Compensation Committee determined that FW Cook is independent and the engagement did not present any conflicts of interest. FW Cook also determined that it was independent from the Company's management, which was confirmed in a written statement delivered to the Compensation Committee.\n\nFor more information regarding our director and executive compensation processes and procedures, please refer to \"Director Compensation\", beginning on page P-36, and \"Compensation and Discussion Analysis,\" beginning on P-43, respectively.\n\n| Members                                     |     | Key Responsibilities                                                                                                                                                          |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| William M.

We maintain governmental and regulatory relations offices in Chicago, Illinois; Rosemount, Minnesota; Madison, Green Bay and Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and Washington, D.C. We also hire contract lobbyists and work with trade organizations to assist in advocacy activities. Our lobbyists are lawfully registered in each jurisdiction where they perform services for us.\n\nWe have multiple political action committees (\"PACs\"). Our PACs are registered with their regulating governments and authorized by elections laws to collect voluntary contributions from employees who choose to participate. The money, in turn, is used to support candidates running for federal, state and local offices. Contribution amounts are limited by law. All of our PACs are administered by a committee that combines appointed and elected members. Oversight committees make decisions on how and where dollars are spent.\n\nWe have a corporate policy on political activity, contributions and reporting (the \"Government Relations Policy\"), and periodically conduct training on compliance with lobbying laws. As part of its oversight function, the Board's Audit and Oversight Committee, which consists solely of independent directors, conducts an annual review of this policy. The committee also reviews a summary of political activities and associated reporting excerpted from our Corporate Responsibility Report in advance of its publication each year.\n\nConsistent with best practices, among other things, the Government Relations Policy:\n\n- \u00b7 addresses our interactions with public officials, outlining expectations, requirements, restrictions and prohibitions;\n- \u00b7 requires Compliance Officer review of any requests for corporate political contributions to confirm they comply with applicable election laws and regulations; and\n- \u00b7 requires the Executive Vice President-External Affairs to submit a quarterly report to the Audit and Oversight Committee that addresses activities covered by the Government Relations Policy.\n\n## Corporate Political Donations\n\nThe Government Relations Policy sets forth the standards and requirements that govern the Company's interactions with public officials, and addresses the process for requesting and authorizing contributions to organizations operating under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code and organizations that qualify as national political committees. Corporate contributions adhere to all applicable federal and state laws where we do business. We use corporate funds to support candidates and causes to benefit energy safety, reliability and affordability, without regard for executives' personal political preferences.\n\n## Lobbying\n\nThe Company files federal quarterly lobbying reports and semiannual contribution reports with the clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives and the secretary of the U.S. Senate. Our direct lobbying is conducted in support of our corporate initiatives and targets, including our greenhouse gas reduction goals, and is consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement. Our website provides details on: (1) contributions made by our PACs; (2) corporate contributions to state party legislative committees and elected officials; (3) links to federal and state lobbying reports; and (4) trade organization memberships, including annual dues and contributions of $25,000 or more to trade associations and coalitions. To learn more, please access our \"Political Activities\" web page at www.wecenergygroup.com/csr/political-activities.htm.\n\n## Code of Business Conduct\n\nWEC Energy Group's Code of Business Conduct (the 'Code') is the foundation of the Company's Ethics and Compliance program, as it sets the standards for creating and sustaining a culture of ethics and integrity. The Compliance Officer oversees the management and operations of the program, about which she provides regular update reports to the Board's Audit and Oversight Committee. All WEC Energy Group directors, executive officers and employees, including the principal executive, financial and accounting officers, have a responsibility to comply with the Code, to seek advice in doubtful situations and to report suspected violations. All those subject to the Code, including the Company's non-management directors, are required to participate in annual training on the elements of the Code.\n\nThe Code addresses expectations for Company culture, including among other things: non-retaliation for raising concerns; safety; diversity, equity and inclusion; conflicts of interest; confidentiality; fair dealing; protection and proper use of Company resources, assets and information; and compliance with laws, rules and regulations (including political contribution and insider trading laws). The Code is available on our website at the following address: www.wecenergygroup.com/govern/codeofbusinessconduct.pdf.\n\nThe Company has several ways individuals can report concerns and raise questions concerning the Code and other Company policies. As one reporting mechanism, the Company has contracted with a third-party so that individuals can confidentially and anonymously report suspected violations of the Code or other concerns, including those regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters. The Company has not provided any waiver to the Code for any director, executive officer or other employee .",

        "page_content": "## Related Party Transactions\n\nWEC Energy Group has a written policy on the review, approval or ratification of transactions with related persons, which is overseen by the Corporate Governance Committee, as delegated by the Board.\n\nThe policy provides that the Committee will review any proposed, existing, or completed related party transaction in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which any related party had, has, or will have a direct or indirect material interest. In general, a \"related party\" includes all directors and executive officers of WEC Energy Group and their immediate family members, as well as stockholders beneficially owning 5% or more of WEC Energy Group's outstanding stock as defined in SEC rules. Legal Services reviews relevant information on transactions, arrangements, and relationships disclosed and makes a determination as to the existence of a related party transaction as defined by SEC rules and the policy. Related party transactions that are in, or are not inconsistent with, the best interests of WEC Energy Group or its subsidiaries, as applicable, are approved by the Corporate Governance Committee and reported to the Board. Related party transactions are disclosed in accordance with applicable SEC and other regulatory requirements.\n\nIn addition, the Code addresses, among other things, how to identify and report potential conflicts of interest. The Code lists the following as examples of potentially problematic situations: (1) family members who are a supplier, contractor or customer of the Company or work for one; (2) obtaining any financial interest in or participating in any business relationship with any company or individual, or concern doing business with WEC Energy Group or any of its subsidiaries that might influence the individual's decisions or job performance; (3) participating in any joint venture, partnership or other business relationship with WEC Energy Group or any of its subsidiaries; and (4) serving as an officer or member of the Board of any substantial, outside for-profit organization.\n\nBecause the Board is mindful of the expectation of its directors to devote the time necessary to fulfill their fiduciary duties, the Corporate Governance Guidelines contain additional requirements for directors seeking to join other Boards. For example, all directors must notify the Company's Corporate Secretary before accepting a nomination for a position on the Board of another public company and the CEO must obtain the approval of the full Board before accepting such a position.\n\nTo further backstop such discussions and approvals, bi-annually all directors and executive officers are required to complete a questionnaire that asks about any business relationship that may give rise to a related party transaction or other conflict of interest and all transactions in which the Company or one of its subsidiaries is involved and in which the director or executive officer, or a relative or affiliate of such director or executive officer, has a direct or indirect material interest. Director nominees under consideration by the Board for election are required to complete the same questionnaire. The Corporate Secretary discusses the results of this diligence with the Corporate Governance Committee.\n\nSince January 1, 2022, there have been no related-party transactions, and there are no currently proposed related-party transactions, required to be disclosed pursuant to SEC rules.\n\n## COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE BOARD\n\nStockholders and other interested parties who wish to communicate with members of the Board, including the Independent Lead Director or the other non-management directors individually or as a group, may send correspondence to them in care of the Corporate Secretary, Margaret C. Kelsey, at the Company's principal executive offices, PO Box 1331, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53201. All communications received as set forth above will be opened by the Corporate Secretary for the sole purpose of confirming the contents represent a message to the Company's directors. Pursuant to instructions from the Board, all communication, other than advertising, promotion of a product or service, or patently offensive material, will be forwarded promptly to the addressee.\n\n## WHERE TO FIND MORE INFORMATION ON GOVERNANCE\n\nYou can find our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Code of Business Conduct, and other corporate governance materials, including WEC Energy Group's Restated Articles of Incorporation, bylaws, Board committee charters and Board contact information, on the Corporate Governance section of our website at www.wecenergygroup.com/govern/governance.htm.

        "page_content": "## DIRECTOR COMPENSATION\n\nConsistent with its charter, the Compensation Committee seeks to maintain a competitive director compensation program that enables the Company to attract and retain key individuals and to motivate them to help the Company achieve its short- and long-term goals. As such, the Committee is responsible for reviewing key market-based trends in director compensation and benefits packages and for recommending changes to the Board, as appropriate, that will attract and retain quality directors. The Committee's charter authorizes it to engage consultants or advisors in connection with its review and analysis of director compensation. The Compensation Committee used FW Cook during 2022 for this purpose. Directors who are also employees of the Company do not receive additional compensation for service as a director.\n\n## 2022 Compensation of the Board of Directors\n\nThe following table describes the components of the non-management director compensation program during 2022. With the exception of the Annual Equity Retainer, which increased by $10,000 effective January 1, 2022, all other elements of compensation remained unchanged from 2021.\n\nThe Compensation Committee believes that this program:\n\n- \u00b7 is equitable based upon the work required of directors serving an entity of the Company's size and scope, and\n- \u00b7 ties the majority of director compensation to stockholder interests because the value of the equity awards fluctuates depending upon the Company's stock price.\n\n| Compensation Element                           | 2022 Non-Management Director Compensation Program                                                                                                                                                     |\n|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Annual Cash Retainer Fee                       | $110,000                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Annual Independent Lead Director  Retainer Fee | $30,000                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| Annual Equity Retainer                         | $150,000 in restricted stock, which vests one year from grant date                                                                                                                                    |\n| Annual Committee Chair Fees                    |                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| \u009f  Audit and Oversight                                                | $20,000 paid in $5,000 quarterly increments                                                                                                                                                           |\n| \u009f  Compensation                                                | $20,000 paid in $5,000 quarterly increments                                                                                                                                                           |\n| \u009f  Corporate Governance                                                | $15,000 paid in $3,750 quarterly increments                                                                                                                                                           |\n| \u009f  Finance Board and Committee Meeting Fees                                                | $15,000 paid in $3,750 quarterly increments None                                                                                                                                                      |\n| Stock Ownership Guideline                      | Ownership of common stock or deferred stock units that have a value equal to five times the annual  cash retainer for non-management directors to be satisfied within five years of joining the Board |\n\nInsurance is also provided by the Company for director liability coverage, fiduciary and employee benefit liability coverage, and travel accident coverage for director travel on Company business. The premiums paid for this insurance are not included in the amounts reported in the table located on the next page.\n\nThe Company reimburses directors for all out-of-pocket travel expenses. These reimbursed amounts are also not reflected in the table located on the next page.\n\n## Deferred Compensation Plan\n\nNon-management directors may defer all or a portion of their cash fees pursuant to the Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan. Directors have two investment options in the plan - the Company's phantom stock measurement fund or a prime rate fund. The value of the phantom stock measurement fund appreciates or depreciates based upon market performance of the Company's common stock, and it also grows through the accumulation of reinvested dividend equivalents. Deferral amounts are credited in the name of each participating director to accounts on the books of WEC Energy Group that are unsecured and are payable only in cash at the time elected by the director. Deferred amounts will be paid out of general corporate assets or the assets of the Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2014 Rabbi Trust addressed later in this proxy statement.\n\n## Legacy Charitable Awards Program\n\nDirectors elected prior to January 1, 2007, participate in a Directors' Charitable Awards Program under which the Company intends to contribute up to $100,000 per year for 10 years to one or more charitable organizations chosen by each participating director, including employee directors, following the director's death. Charitable donations under the program will be paid out of general corporate assets. Directors derive no financial benefit from the program, and all income tax deductions accrue solely to the Company. The tax deductibility of these charitable donations may mitigate the net cost to the Company. The Directors' Charitable Awards Program has been eliminated for any new directors elected after January 1, 2007. Current directors participating in the program are Directors Culver, Klappa and Payne.",

The amounts reported in the Stock Awards column include the aggregate grant date fair value, as computed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (\"FASB ASC\") Topic 718, excluding estimated forfeitures, of the restricted stock awarded. Each reported restricted stock award vests in full one year from the grant date.\n\n## All Other Compensation\n\nAll amounts reported in the All Other Compensation column represent costs attributed to the director for the Directors' Charitable Awards Program. See 'Legacy Charitable Awards Program' above for additional information.\n\n## 2023 Compensation of the Board of Directors\n\nIn December 2022, the Compensation Committee completed its annual review of director compensation and determined that, based upon research provided by FW Cook, total non-management director compensation was generally in alignment with market median. The Compensation Committee concluded, and the Board agreed, that it was appropriate for all 2023 fees to remain unchanged from the approved 2022 levels.",

        "page_content": "## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' FEES AND SERVICES\n\n## Pre-Approval Policy\n\nThe Audit and Oversight Committee has a formal policy delineating its responsibilities for reviewing and approving, in advance, all audit, audit-related, tax, and other services of the independent auditors. As such, the Audit and Oversight Committee is responsible for the audit fee negotiations associated with the Company's retention of independent auditors.\n\nThe Audit and Oversight Committee is committed to ensuring the independence of the auditors, both in appearance as well as in fact. In order to assure continuing auditor independence, the Audit and Oversight Committee periodically considers whether there should be a regular rotation of the independent external audit firm. In addition, the Audit and Oversight Committee is directly involved in the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP's lead audit partner.\n\nUnder the pre-approval policy, before engagement of the independent auditors for the next year's audit, the independent auditors will submit (1) a description of all services anticipated to be rendered, as well as an estimate of the fees for each of the services, for the Audit and Oversight Committee to approve, and (2) written confirmation that the performance of any non-audit services is permissible and will not impact the firm's independence. Annual pre-approval will be deemed effective for a period of twelve months from the date of pre-approval, unless the Audit and Oversight Committee specifically provides for a different period. A fee level will be established for all permissible, pre-approved non-audit services. Any additional audit service, audit-related service, tax service, and other service must also be pre-approved.\n\nThe Audit and Oversight Committee delegated pre-approval authority to the Committee's Chair. The Audit and Oversight Committee Chair is required to report any pre-approval decisions at the next scheduled Audit and Oversight Committee meeting. Under the preapproval policy, the Audit and Oversight Committee may not delegate to management its responsibilities to pre -approve services performed by the independent auditors.\n\nUnder the pre-approval policy, prohibited non-audit services are services prohibited by the SEC or by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) to be performed by the Company's independent auditors. These services include: bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or financial statements of the Company; financial information systems design and implementation; appraisal or valuation services; fairness opinions or contribution-in-kind reports; actuarial services; internal audit outsourcing services; management functions, or human resources, broker-dealer, investment advisor or investment banking services; legal services and expert services unrelated to the audit; services provided for a contingent fee or commission; and services related to planning, marketing, or opining in favor of the tax treatment of a confidential transaction or an aggressive tax position transaction that was initially recommended, directly or indirectly, by the independent auditors. In addition, the Audit and Oversight Committee has determined that the independent auditors may not provide any services, including personal financial counseling and tax services, to any officer or other employee of the Company who serves in a financial reporting oversight role or to the Audit and Oversight Committee chair or to an immediate family member of these individuals, including spouses, spousal equivalents, and dependents.\n\n## Fee Table\n\nThe following table shows the fees, all of which were approved by the Audit and Oversight Committee, for professional audit services provided by Deloitte & Touche LLP for the audit of the annual financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, and fees for other services rendered during those periods. No fees were paid to Deloitte & Touche LLP pursuant to the 'de minimus' exception to the pre-approval policy permitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n\n|                         | 2022         | 2021         |\n|-------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Audit Fees  (1)         | $  5,599,442 | $  5,867,477 |\n| Audit-Related Fees  (2) | 575,410      | -            |\n| Tax Fees  (3)           | 125,916      | 109,297      |\n| All Other Fees  (4)     | 3,790        | 5,560        |\n| Total                   | $  6,304,558 | $  5,982,334 |\n\n- 4.

The Company's independent auditors are responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the 'PCAOB') and issuing a report thereon.\n\nThe Audit and Oversight Committee held six meetings during 2022. Meetings are designed to facilitate and encourage open communication among the members of the Audit and Oversight Committee, management, the internal auditors, and the Company's independent auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP. During these meetings, we reviewed and discussed with management, among other items, the Company's unaudited quarterly and audited annual financial statements and the system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws.\n\nWe have reviewed and discussed with management and the Company's independent auditors the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and related footnotes for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, and the independent auditor's report on those financial statements. Management represented to us that the Company's financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Deloitte & Touche LLP presented the matters required to be discussed with the Audit and Oversight Committee by PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees. This review included a discussion with management and the independent auditors about the quality of the Company's accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant estimates and judgments, and the disclosures in the Company's financial statements, as well as the disclosures relating to critical accounting policies and the auditor's discussion about critical audit matters in its report on the audited consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn addition, we received the written disclosures and correspondence relative to the auditors' independence from Deloitte & Touche LLP, as required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding Deloitte & Touche LLP's communications with the Audit and Oversight Committee concerning independence. The Audit and Oversight Committee discussed with Deloitte & Touche LLP its independence and also considered the compatibility of non-audit services provided by Deloitte & Touche LLP with maintaining its independence.\n\nBased on these reviews and discussions, the Audit and Oversight Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in WEC Energy Group's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nRespectfully submitted to WEC Energy Group stockholders by the Audit and Oversight Committee of the Board.\n\n## The Audit and Oversight Committee\n\nDanny L.

In particular, we are asking whether the advisory vote should occur every year, every two years, or every three years.\n\n## Voting Recommendation:\n\n## \u00fc FOR the advisory vote for a frequency of \"EVERY YEAR\".\n\nThe Company recommends that you support the current frequency period of every year for future non-binding \"say-on-pay\" votes.\n\nA stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation is very important to the Company and its stockholders. Therefore, we believe that stockholders should have an opportunity to cast this vote annually. Setting a one-year period for holding this stockholder vote enhances stockholder communication by providing a clear, simple means for the Company to obtain information on investor sentiment about our executive compensation philosophy and program, and whether it appropriately rewards management for WEC Energy Group's financial, operational and social performance. Also, we have found that an advisory vote every year enhances our stockholder engagement and outreach. Accordingly, as indicated below, the Board of Directors recommends that you vote in favor of an annual vote on our executive compensation when considering the following resolution:\n\n'RESOLVED, that an advisory vote of the Company's stockholders to approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers be held at an annual meeting of stockholders every year, every two years, or every three years, whichever frequency receives the highest number of stockholder votes in connection with the adoption of this resolution.'\n\nYou have four choices in voting for this item. You can choose whether the \"say-on-pay\" vote should be conducted every year, every two years or every three years. You may also abstain from voting on this item.\n\nBecause your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Board or the Company. However, the Board will review the voting results and take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding the frequency of \"say-on-pay\" advisory votes on compensation of the named executive officers.\n\nThe Board of Directors recommends that you vote for a frequency of 'EVERY YEAR.'",

The Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of this advisory vote when considering future executive compensation decisions.\n\nPursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, the Company seeks your advisory vote on the approval of the compensation paid to our named executive officers (commonly referred to as \"Say-on-Pay\") as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the related tables included in this proxy statement. Approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation of the named executive officers requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy at the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Presuming a quorum is present, shares not voted, whether by broker non-vote, abstention, or otherwise, have no effect on the outcome of this matter. Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Board or the Company. However, the Compensation Committee will review the voting results and take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding executive compensation.\n\nAs described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis on pages P-43 through P-56 of this proxy statement, the Compensation Committee has structured the Company's executive compensation program with the following objectives in mind:\n\n- \u00b7 offer a competitive, performance-based plan;\n- \u00b7 enable the Company to attract and retain key individuals;\n- \u00b7 reward achievement of the Company's short-term and long-term goals; and\n- \u00b7 align with the interests of the Company's stockholders and customers.\n\nAs described in this proxy statement, the Company believes that the compensation paid to our named executed officers in 2022 was well-tailored to achieve these objectives, tying a significant portion of total pay to performance and aligning the interests of the named executive officers with those of stockholders and customers. We encourage you to carefully review the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and related tables included in this proxy statement, which describe in greater detail WEC Energy Group's compensation philosophy and programs, as well as the 2022 compensation levels, in connection with approval of the following resolution:\n\n'RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in the Proxy Statement for the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.'",

        "page_content": "## Compensation Discussion and Analysis\n\nThe following discussion provides an overview and analysis of our executive compensation program, including the role of the Compensation Committee of our Board, the elements of our executive compensation program, the purposes and objectives of these elements, and the manner in which we established the compensation of our named executive officers (\"NEOs\") for fiscal year 2022.\n\nReferences to 'we,' 'us,' 'our,' \"Company,\" and 'WEC Energy Group' in this discussion and analysis mean WEC Energy Group, Inc. and its management, as applicable.\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n## Overview\n\nThe primary objective of our executive compensation program is to provide a competitive, performance-based plan that enables the Company to attract and retain key individuals and to reward them for achieving both the Company's short-term and long-term goals without creating an incentive for our NEOs to take excessive risks. Our program has been designed to provide a level of compensation that is strongly dependent upon the achievement of short-term and long-term goals that are aligned with the interests of our stockholders and customers. To that end, a substantial portion of pay is at risk, and generally, the value will only be realized upon strong corporate performance.\n\nWe also value the input of our stockholders and recognize the increasing investor desire for companies to link environmental, social and governance factors to compensation. Environmental, social and governance initiatives are firmly entrenched in our executive compensation program. Since 2004, our performance metrics have included operational and social metrics, including those related to customer satisfaction, supplier and workforce diversity, and safety.\n\n## 2022 Business Highlights\n\nFor an overview of the Company, see \"An Energy Industry Leader\" on page P-7. During 2022, the Company achieved solid results and continued to create long-term value for our stockholders and customers by focusing on the fundamentals of our business:\n\n- \u00b7 World-class reliability\n- \u00b7 Operating efficiency\n- \u00b7 Employee safety\n- \u00b7 Financial discipline\n- \u00b7 Exceptional customer care\n- \u00b7 Environmental Stewardship\n\nCommitment to Stockholder Value Creation. In 2022, WEC Energy Group again delivered solid earnings growth, generated strong cash flow, and increased the dividend for the 19 th consecutive year. In January 2022, the Board raised the quarterly dividend 7.4% to $0.7275 per share, equivalent to an annual rate of $2.91 per share. In January 2023, the Board again increased the quarterly dividend 7.2% to $0.780 per share, which is equivalent to an annual rate of $3.12 per share, in line with our plan to maintain a dividend payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. The Company also turned in strong performances in safety and supplier and workforce diversity during 2022, while continuing to maintain effective cost controls throughout its operations.\n\nESG Progress Plan. We introduced our capital investment plan for efficiency, sustainability and growth, referred to as our ESG Progress Plan, in November 2020. Our plan calls for emission reductions, maintaining superior reliability, delivering significant savings for customers and growing our investment in the future of energy. In November 2022, we announced our planned capital investment for the next five-year period (2023-2027) of the ESG Progress Plan. We expect to invest approximately $20.1 billion over the five-year period in our regulated and non-utility energy infrastructure businesses, including approximately $5.4 billion of regulated renewable investment. We have already retired more than 1,800 megawatts (MW) of coal-fired generation since the beginning of 2018, and expect to retire approximately 1,600 MW of additional fossil-fueled generation by the end of 2026. In fact, we announced that by the end of 2030 we expect to use coal only as a backup fuel for the power we supply to our customers, and to eliminate coal as an energy source by 2035.\n\nIn addition to our carbon dioxide emission reductions, we also continue to reduce our methane emissions by improving our natural gas distribution system. We have set a target across our natural gas operations to achieve net-zero methane emissions by the end of 2030.",

        "page_content": "## Consideration of 2022 Stockholder Advisory Vote and Stockholder Outreach\n\nAt the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Company's stockholders approved the compensation of our named executive officers, with 94.2% of the votes cast supporting the say-on-pay proposal. The Compensation Committee considered this outcome as well as the feedback received during meetings we again held with many of our institutional stockholders. During 2022, we communicated with stockholders representing approximately 30% of the Company's outstanding common stock about our environmental, social, governance and compensation practices. For additional information about our stockholder outreach efforts, see \"Stockholder Engagement\" beginning on page P-29. The Compensation Committee is always looking for ways to refine our compensation program. However, in light of the significant stockholder support our executive compensation program received in 2022 and the payout levels under our performance-based program for 2022, the Compensation Committee believes that the overall compensation program structure is competitive, aligned with our financial and operational performance goals, and in the best interests of the Company, stockholders, and customers.\n\n## COMPONENTS OF OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM\n\nWe have three primary elements of total direct compensation: (1) base salary; (2) annual incentive awards; and (3) long-term incentive awards consisting of a mix of performance units, stock options, and restricted stock. The Compensation Committee again retained Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. (\"FW Cook\") as its independent compensation consultant to advise the Compensation Committee with respect to our executive compensation program. The Compensation Committee generally relied upon the recommendations of FW Cook in its development of the 2022 program.\n\nOn October 21, 2021, the Board appointed Mr. Lauber to succeed Mr. Fletcher as the Company's President and CEO, effective February 1, 2022. Mr. Fletcher continued to serve as a senior adviser until his retirement on June 1, 2022. As shown in the charts below, 86% of Mr. Lauber's 2022 total direct compensation and an average of 84% of the other NEOs' 2022 total direct compensation was tied to Company performance and was not guaranteed. Mr. Fletcher's 2022 compensation is included in the 'Other NEOs 2022 Total Direct Compensation Mix' chart below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition to the components of total direct compensation identified above, our retirement programs are another important component of our compensation program.\n\nTo the extent feasible, we believe it is important that the Company's compensation program not dilute the interests of current stockholders. Therefore, we currently use open-market purchases to satisfy our benefit plan obligations, including the exercise of stock options and awarding of restricted stock.\n\nThis Compensation Discussion and Analysis contains a more detailed discussion of each of the above components for 2022, including FW Cook's recommendations with respect to each component.",

        "page_content": "## Compensation Governance and Practices\n\nThe Compensation Committee annually reviews and considers the Company's compensation policies and practices to ensure our executive compensation program aligns with our compensation philosophy. Highlighted below is an overview of our current compensation practices.\n\n## What We Do\n\n- \u00b7 Our compensation program focuses on key Company results (financial, safety, customer satisfaction, diversity) that are aligned with our strategic goals.\n- \u00b7 A substantial portion of compensation is at risk and tied to Company performance.\n- \u00b7 The compensation program has a long-term orientation aligned with stockholder interests.\n- \u00b7 We include environmental, social and governance metrics in our compensation program.\n- \u00b7 The Compensation Committee retains an independent compensation consultant to help design the Company's compensation program and determine competitive levels of pay.\n- \u00b7 The Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant reviews competitive employment market data from two general industry surveys and a comparison group of companies similar to WEC Energy Group.\n- \u00b7 We have a clawback policy that provides for the recoupment of incentive-based compensation.\n- \u00b7 Annual incentive-based compensation contains multiple, pre-established performance metrics aligned with stockholder and customer interests.\n- \u00b7 The 2022 Performance Unit Plan award payouts (including dividend equivalents) are based on stockholder return as compared to an appropriate peer group and Additional Performance Measure(s), selected by the Compensation Committee. Starting in 2023, award payouts will be based on one or more performance measures selected by the Compensation Committee at the time of the award.\n- \u00b7 The Performance Unit Plan and the Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan require a separation from service following a change in control for award vesting to occur.\n- \u00b7 Equity award and other benefit plan obligations are satisfied through openmarket purchases of WEC Energy Group common stock.\n- \u00b7 Meaningful stock ownership levels are required for senior executives.\n- \u00b7 Ongoing engagement with investors takes place to ensure that compensation practices are responsive to stockholder interests.\n- \u00b7 We prohibit hedging and pledging of WEC Energy Group common stock.\n- \u00b7 We prohibit entry into any new arrangements that obligate the Company to pay directly or reimburse individual tax liability for benefits provided by the Company.\n- \u00b7 We prohibit repricing of stock options without stockholder approval.\n\n## Competitive Benchmarking\n\nAs a general matter, we believe the labor market for WEC Energy Group executive officers is consistent with that of general industry. Although we recognize our business is focused on the energy services industry, our goal is to have an executive compensation program that will allow us to be competitive in recruiting the most qualified candidates to serve as executive officers of the Company, including individuals who may be employed outside of the energy services industry. Further, in order to retain top performing executive officers, we believe our compensation practices must be competitive with those of general industry.\n\nTo confirm that our annual executive compensation is competitive with the market, FW Cook reviewed 2022 general industry executive compensation survey data obtained from WTW and Aon Hewitt. FW Cook also analyzed the compensation data from a peer group of 19 companies similar to WEC Energy Group in size and business model. The methodology used by FW Cook to determine the peer group of companies is described below.\n\nFW Cook started with U.S. companies in the Standard & Poor's database, and then limited those companies to the same line of business as WEC Energy Group as indicated by the Global Industry Classification Standards. This list of companies was then further limited to companies with revenues between $2.6 billion and $23.5 billion (approximately one-third to three times the size of WEC Energy Group's revenues), and that were within a reasonable size range in various other measures such as operating income, total assets, total employees, and market capitalization. From this list, FW Cook selected companies similar in overall size to WEC Energy Group with consideration given to companies that met one or more of the following criteria:\n\n- \u00b7 Diversified, technically sophisticated utility operations (e.g., multiple utilities, electric utilities); and\n- \u00b7 Minimal non-regulated business.\n\nThese criteria resulted in a comparison group of 19 companies with median revenues and market capitalization of approximately $10.5 billion and $21.2 billion, respectively.\n\nThe comparison group utilized for purposes of 2022 compensation includes the same companies as the previous year's comparison group, with the addition of Dominion Energy, Inc. The comparison group consisted of the 19 companies listed below.\n\n- \u00b7   Alliant Energy Corporation\n- \u00b7   Consolidated Edison, Inc.\n- \u00b7   Evergy, Inc.\n- \u00b7   PPL Corp.\n- \u00b7   Ameren Corporation\n- \u00b7   Dominion Energy, Inc.\n- \u00b7   Eversource Energy\n- \u00b7   Pinnacle West Capital Corp.\n- \u00b7   American Electric Power Company\n- \u00b7   DTE Energy Co.\n- \u00b7   FirstEnergy Corp.\n- \u00b7   The Southern Company\n- \u00b7   CMS Energy Corporation\n- \u00b7   Edison International\n- \u00b7   NiSource Inc.\n- \u00b7   Xcel Energy Inc.\n- \u00b7   CenterPoint Energy\n- \u00b7   Entergy Inc.\n- \u00b7   PG&E Corporation\n\nThe Compensation Committee approved this comparison group.",

        "page_content": "## DETERMINATION OF MARKET MEDIAN\n\nIn order to determine the 'market median' for our NEOs, FW Cook recommended that the survey data from WTW and Aon Hewitt receive a 75% weighting and the comparison group of 19 companies receive a 25% weighting. The Compensation Committee agreed with this recommendation. The survey data received a higher weighting because we consider the labor market for our executives to be consistent with that of general industry. Using this methodology, FW Cook recommended, and the Compensation Committee approved, the appropriate market median for each of our NEOs.\n\nThe comparison of each component of compensation with the appropriate market median when setting the compensation levels of our NEOs generally drives the allocation of cash versus non-cash compensation and short-term versus long-term incentive compensation.\n\n## ANNUAL BASE SALARY\n\nThe annual base salary component of our executive compensation program provides each executive officer with a fixed level of annual cash compensation. We believe that providing annual cash compensation through a base salary is an established market practice and is a necessary component of a competitive compensation program.\n\nBased upon the market data analyzed by FW Cook, we generally target base salaries to be at or near the market median for each NEO. However, the Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, set base salaries at a different amount when the Compensation Committee deems it appropriate.\n\nActual salary determinations are made taking into consideration factors such as the relative levels of individual experience, performance, responsibility, market compensation data and contribution to the results of the Company's operations. At the beginning of each year, our CEO and the other members of the Office of the Chair develop a list of goals for WEC Energy Group and our employees to achieve during the upcoming year. The Compensation Committee takes the Company's performance against these goals into consideration when establishing our CEO's and Executive Chairman's compensation for the upcoming year. Our CEO undertakes a similar process with the other NEOs, who develop individual goals related to the achievement of the Company's goals. At the end of the year, each officer's performance is measured against these goals. The CEO and Executive Chairman discuss these results and based on this performance assessment, a compensation recommendation is made to the Compensation Committee for the upcoming year for each executive officer.\n\n## 2022 Salary Determination Process\n\nMr. Lauber's 2022 annual base salary was initially set at $950,000 for his role as Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of WEC Energy Group. However, effective February 1, 2022, when Mr. Lauber became President and CEO of the Company, his annual base salary was increased to $1,025,050.\n\nMr. Fletcher's annualized base salary was set at $1,087,934, which was unchanged from his 2021 base salary.\n\nIn October 2020, in recognition of his strong, continued leadership and to ensure the ongoing mentoring of the next generation of leadership of the Company, the Board determined that Mr. Klappa should continue to serve as Executive Chairman until May 2024. At that time, Mr. Klappa entered into a new letter agreement, which stated his compensation would be determined in the same manner and subject to the same timing as the Compensation Committee utilizes for all other NEOs. As a result, Mr. Klappa's 2022 base salary was set at $1,126,944 by the Compensation Committee, an increase of 4.0% over his 2021 base salary.\n\nWith respect to the 2022 base salaries of Mmes. Liu and Kelsey, and Mr. Garvin, in December 2021, recommendations were made to the Compensation Committee based upon a review of the market compensation data provided by FW Cook and the other factors described above. The Compensation Committee approved the recommendations, which represented an average increase in annual base salary of approximately 3.67%. The annual base salary of each NEO was at or near the market median.\n\n## ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE COMPENSATION\n\nWe provide annual cash incentive compensation through our Short-Term Performance Plan ('STPP'). The STPP provides for annual cash awards to our executive officers and other key employees based upon the achievement of pre-established stockholder-, customer-, and employee-focused objectives. All payments under the STPP are at risk. Payments are made only if performance goals are achieved, and awards may be less or greater than targeted amounts based upon actual performance. Payments under the STPP are intended to reward achievement of short-term goals that contribute to stockholder and customer value, as well as individual contributions to successful operations.\n\n2022 Target Awards. Each year, the Compensation Committee approves a target level of compensation under the STPP for each of our NEOs. This target level of compensation is expressed as a percentage of base salary.\n\nEffective February 1, 2022, the target award level for Mr. Lauber was increased to 140% of base salary in recognition of his appointment to President and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group. Therefore, Mr. Lauber's STPP payout reflects an 85% target level for January 2022 and a 140% target level for February through the remainder of the year. In recognition of Mr. Fletcher's service as CEO until February 1, 2022, his target award level was 130%, which is the same as his 2021 target award level.",

The financial, operational and social goals established under the STPP are linked to key objectives that support the Company's sustainability.\n\nDelivering a cleaner energy future is one of the fundamentals of our business and a major focus of the Company's capital plan. The Compensation Committee assesses management's performance in achieving long-term strategic sustainability goals through the execution of the Company's capital spending plan. Our ability to fund the capital plan without issuing additional equity has been directly linked with our ability to consistently deliver on the Company's financial plan, which includes meeting the financial goals established under the STPP. These financial measures, which are discussed in more detail below, are key performance indicators underlying our NEOs' incentive compensation, linking achievement of the Company's long-term strategy through our focus on short-term priorities.\n\nThe operational and social goals established under the STPP are tied to achievement of strategic objectives, which include a focus on customer satisfaction, employee safety, and workforce and supplier diversity.\n\n2022 Financial Goals under the STPP. The Compensation Committee adopted the 2022 STPP with a continued focus on financial results. In December 2021, the Compensation Committee approved WEC Energy Group's earnings per share (75% weight) and cash flow (25% weight) as the primary performance measures to be used in 2022. We continue to believe earnings per share and cash flow are key indicators of financial strength and performance, and are recognized as such by the investment community.\n\nIn January 2022, the Compensation Committee approved the performance goals under the STPP for WEC Energy Group's earnings per share as set forth in the chart below.\n\n| Earnings Per Share Performance Goal   | Earnings Per Share CAGR   | Payout Level   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|\n| $4.25                                 | 6.0%                      | 25%            |\n| $4.26                                 | 6.2%                      | 50%            |\n| $4.29                                 | 7.0%                      | 100%           |\n| $4.30                                 | 7.2%                      | 135%           |\n| $4.33                                 | 8.0%                      | 200%           |\n\nIf the Company's performance falls between these levels, the payout level with respect to earnings per share is determined by interpolating on a straight line basis the appropriate payout level.\n\nAt the time the Compensation Committee established the earnings per share performance goals for 2022, the Company's growth plan called for a compound annual growth rate (\"CAGR\") in earnings per share of 6.0% to 7.0%, measured off a 2021 base of $4.01 per share, which represented the mid-point of the original 2021 annual earnings guidance. We believe that achievement of our projected CAGR, plus our continued growth in dividends, supports a premium valuation as compared to the Company's peers. In order to further motivate management, the Compensation Committee determined that the Company's target payout level should equal the high end of the range and the maximum payout level should exceed the high end of the 6.0% to 7.0% CAGR growth plan. Therefore, the target (100%) and maximum payout levels (200%) were tied to 7.0% and 8.0% CAGRs, respectively. The Compensation Committee tied the above-target payout level to achievement of a 7.2% CAGR. Subsequently, in November 2022, the Company announced that it tightened its projected CAGR in earnings per share to 6.5% to 7.0%.\n\nIn January 2022, the Compensation Committee approved the performance goals under the STPP for WEC Energy Group's cash flow as set forth in the chart below ($ in millions).\n\n| Cash Flow   | Payout Level   |\n|-------------|----------------|\n| $1,775      | 25%            |\n| $1,825      | 50%            |\n| $1,875      | 100%           |\n| $1,925      | 135%           |\n| $2,000      | 200%           |",

        "page_content": "If the Company's performance falls between these levels, the payout level with respect to cash flow is determined by interpolating on a straight-line basis the appropriate payout level.\n\nThe Compensation Committee based the cash flow performance level goals on WEC Energy Group's 'net cash provided by operating activities' and adjusting for certain accruals and other items related to capital spending (\"Adjusted Cash From Operations\"). GAAP requires these items to be recorded as part of cash from operations, but management views them as related to the Company's capital expenditure program. The Compensation Committee believes that basing the cash flow performance goals on Adjusted Cash From Operations provides a more accurate measurement of the cash generated by the Company's operations that is available for capital investment, which is the Company's primary driver for earnings growth. Adjusted Cash From Operations is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and the Company's calculation may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies or securities rating agencies.\n\n2022 Financial Performance under the STPP. In January 2023, the Compensation Committee reviewed our actual performance for 2022 against the financial, operational and social performance goals established under the STPP, subject to final audit.\n\nWEC Energy Group's 2022 financial performance satisfied the maximum payout level established for earnings per share and cash flow. WEC Energy Group's earnings per share were $4.45 for 2022, and its cash flow, based on Adjusted Cash From Operations, was $2,142.0 million. Our cash flow result is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP.\n\nBy satisfying the maximum payout level with respect to these financial measures, the NEOs earned 200% of the target award from the financial goal component of the STPP.\n\n2022 WEC Energy Group Operational and Social Performance Goals under the STPP. In December 2021 and January 2022, the Compensation Committee also approved operational and social performance measures and targets under the STPP that promote certain of the Company's priorities. The Compensation Committee identified commitment to customer satisfaction, supplier and workforce diversity, and safety as critical to the success of the Company. For that reason, annual incentive awards could be increased or decreased by up to 10% of the actual award based upon WEC Energy Group's performance in the areas of customer satisfaction (5% weight), safety (2.5% weight), and supplier and workforce diversity (2.5% weight).\n\nThe Compensation Committee measures customer satisfaction levels based upon the results of surveys that an independent third party conducts of customers who had direct contact with our utilities during the year, which measure (i) customers' satisfaction with the respective utility overall, and (ii) customers' satisfaction with respect to the particular transactions with the applicable utility.\n\nSafety is measured based upon performance against the number of lost-time injuries and Days Away, Restricted or Transferred (\"DART\") recordable incidents. Beginning with the 2022 STPP award, the Compensation Committee started using DART as one of the safety metrics instead of OSHA Recordable Injuries. DART is a metric that focuses on more significant injuries and measures how many workplace injuries and illnesses resulted in employees missing work, required restricted work activities or resulted in job transfers. The change is consistent with the trend in the Company's industry to focus safety practices and efforts on preventing the most severe injuries.\n\nThe operational performance measures are based upon recommendations from management and take into consideration both currentyear performance and our longer-term objective of achieving top quartile performance of all of our principal utilities. The Compensation Committee reviews management's recommendations and may make adjustments to the performance measures if it determines changes are necessary. The following table provides the operational and social goals approved by the Compensation Committee for 2022, as well as WEC Energy Group's performance against these goals:\n\n| Operational Measure                                     | Below Goal   | Goal          | Above Goal   | Final Result   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|\n| Customer Satisfaction Percentage of \"Highly Satisfied\": | -5.00%       | 0.00%         | +5.00%       |                |\n| Company                                                 | <79.5%       | 79.5% - 82.3% | >82.3%       | 80.4%          |\n| Transaction                                             | <82.1%       | 82.1% - 84.3% | >84.3%       | 83.6%          |\n| Safety:                                                 | -2.50%       | 0.00%         | +2.50%       |                |\n| DART-recordable injuries                                | >130         | 123 - 130     | <123         | 72             |\n| Lost-time injuries                                      | >52          | 30 - 52       | <30          | 25             |\n| Diversity:                                              | -2.50%       | 0.00%         | +2.50%       |                |\n| Supplier ($ in Millions)                                | <212.0       | 212 - 272.0   | >272.0       | 299.4          |\n| Workforce - Assessment                                  | Not Met      | Met           | Exceeded     | Exceeded       |\n\nWEC Energy Group's performance against the safety and diversity goals generated a 5.0% increase to the compensation awarded under the STPP for 2022.\n\nThe Compensation Committee retains the right to exercise discretion in adjusting awards under the STPP when it deems appropriate, but did not factor individual contributions into determining the amount of the awards for the NEOs for 2022. Because the Company's performance against the financial, operational and social goals resulted in significant STPP awards in 2022, the Compensation Committee determined that no further adjustments based upon individual contributions or otherwise were appropriate.",

        "page_content": "Based upon the Company's performance against the financial, operational and social goals established by the Compensation Committee, Mr. Lauber received annual incentive cash compensation under the STPP of $2,832,628 for 2022. This represented 276% of his annual base salary. Mmes. Liu and Kelsey, and Messrs. Klappa and Garvin, each received annual cash incentive compensation for 2022 under the STPP equal to 162%, 152%, 274%, and 131% of their respective annual base salaries, representing 205% of the target award for each officer. Mr. Fletcher's 2022 annual cash incentive compensation of $1,207,397 equals 267% of his pro-rated 2022 annual base salary, representing 205% of his pro-rated target award.\n\n## LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION\n\nThe Compensation Committee administers our WEC Energy Group Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, amended and restated, effective as of May 6, 2021 (the \"OSIP\"), which is a stockholder-approved, long-term incentive plan designed to link the interests of our executives and other key employees to creating long-term stockholder value. It allows for various types of awards tied to the performance of our common stock, including stock options, stock appreciation rights, and restricted stock. The Compensation Committee also administers the WEC Energy Group Performance Unit Plan, under which the Compensation Committee may award performance units. The Compensation Committee primarily uses (1) performance units, including dividend-equivalents, (2) stock options, and (3) restricted stock to deliver long-term incentive opportunities.\n\nAmended and Restated Performance Unit Plan. On December 1, 2022, the Compensation Committee amended and restated the Performance Unit Plan, effective as of January 1, 2023 (the 'Amended PUP').\n\nPursuant to the Amended PUP, performance units will vest based upon the Company's performance during a three-year period against one or more performance measures selected by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of the performance period. The Compensation Committee may determine achievement of a performance measure on an annual basis or over the entire three-year performance period. The Compensation Committee will determine the vesting percentages of the performance units, and performance measures may have the same or different weightings with respect to performance unit vesting. Achievement within a performance measure may be determined based upon the Company's rank in comparison to a peer group of companies or by reaching stated levels of performance. The Compensation Committee will also select the target(s) for each performance measure and the potential impact to the vesting percentage based on achievement of the performance measure(s) relative to the selected target(s). In no event will the vesting percentage over the three-year performance period be less than zero or more than 200%.\n\nThe Amended PUP governs the terms of performance units starting with the 2023 award. The performance units awarded in January 2022 were awarded under the prior version of the performance unit plan (the \"Prior PUP\"), the terms of which are described herein.\n\nPerformance Units. Each year, the Compensation Committee makes annual grants of performance units under the performance unit plan. The performance units are designed to provide a form of long-term incentive compensation that aligns the interests of management with those of a typical utility stockholder who is focused not only on stock price appreciation but also on dividends. Payouts of the 2022 performance units are based upon the Company's level of 'total stockholder return' (stock price appreciation plus reinvested dividends) in comparison to a peer group of companies over a three-year performance period, and may be adjusted based upon the Company's performance against one or more Additional Performance Measures. The performance units are settled in cash.\n\nSelection of Additional Performance Measure(s). 'Additional Performance Measure' is defined in the Prior PUP as the performance criterion or criteria (if any) that the Compensation Committee selects, in its sole discretion, based upon the attainment of specific levels of performance by WEC Energy Group. Pursuant to the terms of the Prior PUP, performance units vest in an amount between 0% and 175% of the target award based upon WEC Energy Group's comparative total stockholder return over a three-year performance period. However, the vesting percentage may be adjusted based upon WEC Energy's performance against the Additional Performance Measure(s). The Additional Performance Measure(s), if any, were selected by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of the three-year performance period. For each year during the performance period, the Compensation Committee selected the target(s) for the Additional Performance Measure(s) and the potential adjustment to the vesting percentage for that year based upon achievement of the Additional Performance Measure(s) relative to the selected target(s). The actual adjustment, if any, to the vesting percentage based upon the Additional Performance Measure(s) is determined annually. In no event will any adjustment cause the vesting percentage over the three-year performance period to be less than zero.\n\nShort-Term Dividend Equivalents. Pursuant to the terms of the Prior PUP, we increase the number of unvested performance units as of any date that we declare a cash dividend on our common stock by the amount of short-term dividend equivalents a participant is entitled to receive. Short-term dividend equivalents are calculated by multiplying (a) the number of unvested performance units held by a plan participant as of the related dividend record date by (b) the amount of cash dividend payable by the Company on a share of common stock; and (c) dividing the result by the closing price for a share of the Company's common stock on the dividend payment date. In effect, short-term dividend equivalents are credited and accumulated as reinvested dividends on each performance unit so that the performance units and accumulated dividends will be paid out at the end of the three-year performance period, rather than paying out the dividend equivalents annually on unearned performance units.\n\nShort-term dividend equivalents are treated as additional unvested performance units and are subject to the same vesting, forfeiture, payment, termination, and other terms and conditions as the original performance units to which they relate. In addition, outstanding short-term dividend equivalents are treated as unvested performance units for purposes of calculating future short-term dividend equivalents.\n\nShort-term dividend equivalents are also a part of the Amended PUP and are calculated in the same manner.",

        "page_content": "Stock Options. Each year, the Compensation Committee also makes annual stock option grants as part of our long-term incentive program. These stock options have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and expire on the 10th anniversary of the grant date. Since management benefits from a stock option award only to the extent our stock price appreciates above the exercise price of the stock option, stock options align the interests of management with those of our stockholders in attaining long-term stock price appreciation.\n\nRestricted Stock. The Compensation Committee also awards restricted stock as part of the long-term incentive plan, consistent with market practice. Similar to performance units, restricted stock aligns the interests of management with a typical utility stockholder who is focused on stock price appreciation and dividends.\n\nAggregate 2022 Long-Term Incentive Awards. Generally, when establishing the target value of long-term incentive awards and the appropriate mix of performance units, stock options, and restricted stock for each NEO, the Compensation Committee reviews the market compensation data and analysis provided by FW Cook. Based upon FW Cook's analysis, for 2022 the Compensation Committee again determined that the long-term incentive awards would be weighted 65% performance units, 20% stock options, and 15% restricted stock for the NEOs, other than Mr. Klappa. Target values also were presented to and approved by the Compensation Committee in December 2021.\n\nConsistent with prior years, the Compensation Committee determined that Mr. Klappa's 2022 long-term incentive award would be weighted 25% performance units, 15% stock options, and 60% restricted stock. Mr. Klappa's tenure as the Company's Executive Chairman is scheduled to end in May 2024. Therefore, after consultation with FW Cook, the Compensation Committee again determined that there should not be any changes to the mix of Mr. Klappa's long-term awards.\n\nBased upon the market data provided by FW Cook, we customarily target the long-term incentive award to be at or near the market median value of long-term incentive compensation for each executive officer's position. All of the NEOs' long-term incentive awards were within this target range for 2022. The following provides the 2022 target long-term incentive award value for each NEO:\n\n| Executive Officer   | Target LTI Award as a Percentage of Base Salary   |\n|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Mr. Lauber          | 330%                                              |\n| Mr. Fletcher        | 275%                                              |\n| Ms. Liu             | 225%                                              |\n| Mr. Klappa          | 280%                                              |\n| Ms. Kelsey          | 160%                                              |\n| Mr. Garvin          | 160%                                              |\n\nAlthough awarded in January 2022, Mr. Lauber's target award reflects his appointment as President and Chief Executive Officer effective February 1, 2022. Mr. Fletcher's target award is the same as 2021.\n\n2022 Stock Option Grants. In December 2021, the Compensation Committee approved the grant of stock options to each of our NEOs and established an overall pool of options that were granted to approximately 170 other employees. The annual option grants to the NEOs were made effective January 3, 2022, the first trading day of 2022.\n\nAll such options were granted with an exercise price equal to the average of the high and low prices reported on the NYSE for shares of WEC Energy Group common stock on the grant date. The January 2022 options were granted in accordance with our standard practice of making annual stock option grants effective on the first trading day of each year, and the timing of all of the grants was not tied to the timing of any release of material information.\n\nAll 2022 stock options have a term of 10 years and vest 100% on the third anniversary of the date of grant. The vesting of the stock options may be accelerated in connection with a termination of employment due to a change in control or an executive officer's termination of employment under certain circumstances. See 'Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control' beginning on page P-66 for additional information. Subject to the limitations of the OSIP, the Compensation Committee has the power to amend the terms of any option (with the participant's consent). However, without stockholder approval, the Committee may not reduce the exercise price of existing options or cancel outstanding options in exchange for cash or other options having a lower exercise price.\n\nFor purposes of determining the appropriate number of options to grant to a particular NEO, the value of an option was determined based upon the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model for purposes of the compensation valuation. The following table provides the number of options granted to each NEO in 2022:\n\n| Executive Officer   | Options Granted   |\n|---------------------|-------------------|\n| Mr. Lauber          | 58,121            |\n| Mr. Fletcher        | 51,406            |\n| Ms. Liu             | 29,331            |\n| Mr. Klappa          | 40,665            |\n| Ms. Kelsey          | 16,181            |\n| Mr. Garvin          | 14,128            |\n\nFor financial reporting purposes, the stock options granted on January 3, 2022 had a grant date fair value of $14.71 per option.",

        "page_content": "2022 Restricted Stock Awards. In December 2021, the Compensation Committee also approved the grant of restricted stock to each of our NEOs and established an overall pool of restricted stock that was granted to approximately 170 other employees. The grants were made effective January 3, 2022.\n\nOther than the shares granted to Mr. Klappa, the restricted stock vests in three equal annual installments beginning on the one year anniversary of the applicable grant date. The shares of restricted stock granted to Mr. Klappa vest in full on the one year anniversary of the grant date, consistent with the restricted stock awards he has received each year since returning to the Company. In light of Mr. Klappa's expected tenure as Executive Chairman, and after consultation with FW Cook, the Compensation Committee again determined not to make any changes to the vesting schedule.\n\nSubject to very limited exceptions, restricted stock awarded to the Company's executive officers, including the NEOs, is subject to a minimum one-year holding period following the vesting date. The vesting of the restricted stock may be accelerated in connection with a termination of employment due to a change in control, death or disability, or by action of the Compensation Committee. See 'Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control' beginning on page P-66 for additional information. Tax withholding obligations related to vesting may be satisfied, at the option of the executive officer, by withholding shares otherwise deliverable upon vesting or by cash. The NEOs have the right to vote the restricted stock and to receive cash dividends when the Company pays a dividend to its stockholders.\n\nFor purposes of determining the appropriate number of shares of restricted stock to grant to a particular NEO, the Compensation Committee used a value of $92.088 per share. This value was based upon the volume-weighted price of WEC Energy Group's common stock for the ten trading days beginning on December 1, 2021, and ending on December 14, 2021. The Compensation Committee uses the volume-weighted price for annual awards in order to minimize the impact of day-to-day volatility in the stock market.\n\nThe measurement period is customarily early- to mid-December for annual awards in order to shorten the timeframe between the calculation of the awards and the actual grant date. The following table provides the number of shares of restricted stock granted to each NEO in 2022:\n\n| Executive Officer   | Restricted Stock Granted   |\n|---------------------|----------------------------|\n| Mr. Lauber          | 5,510                      |\n| Mr. Fletcher        | 4,873                      |\n| Ms. Liu             | 2,781                      |\n| Mr. Klappa          | 20,559                     |\n| Ms. Kelsey          | 1,534                      |\n| Mr. Garvin          | 1,339                      |\n\n2022 Performance Units. In December 2021, the Compensation Committee approved the grant of performance units to each of our NEOs and approved a pool of performance units that were granted to approximately 170 other employees.\n\nWith respect to the 2022 performance units, the amount of the benefit that ultimately vests will be dependent upon the Company's total stockholder return over a three-year period ending December 31, 2024, as compared to the total stockholder return of the custom peer group described below. Total stockholder return is the calculation of total return (stock price appreciation plus reinvestment of dividends) based upon an initial investment of $100 and subsequent $100 investments at the end of each quarter during the three-year performance period. However, the vesting percentage may be adjusted based upon WEC Energy Group's performance against the Additional Performance Measure. For the 2022 performance unit awards, the Compensation Committee selected performance against the weighted average authorized return on equity of all WEC Energy Group's utility subsidiaries as the Additional Performance Measure.\n\nUpon vesting, the performance units will be settled in cash in an amount determined by multiplying the number of performance units that have vested by the closing price of the Company's common stock on the last trading day of the performance period.\n\nThe 2022 performance unit peer group against which WEC Energy Group's performance will be measured includes:\n\n- \u00b7 Alliant Energy Corporation\n- \u00b7 Dominion Energy, Inc.\n- \u00b7 Eversource Energy\n- \u00b7 The Southern Company\n- \u00b7 Ameren Corporation\n- \u00b7 DTE Energy Co.\n- \u00b7 FirstEnergy Corp.\n- \u00b7 Xcel Energy Inc.\n- \u00b7 American Electric Power Company\n- \u00b7 Duke Energy Corp.\n- \u00b7 NiSource Inc.\n- \u00b7 CMS Energy Corporation\n- \u00b7 Edison International\n- \u00b7 OGE Energy Corp.\n- \u00b7 Consolidated Edison, Inc.\n- \u00b7 Evergy, Inc.\n- \u00b7 Pinnacle West Capital Corp.\n\nThe peer group is chosen by the Compensation Committee, based upon management's recommendation and with the concurrence of FW Cook. This peer group was chosen because we believe these companies are similar to WEC Energy Group in terms of business model and long-term strategies, with a primary focus on regulated utility operations rather than a non-regulated business model. There is significant overlap between the performance unit peer group and the comparison group developed by FW Cook for purposes of benchmarking compensation levels. However, there are several companies that are different among the two groups because FW Cook places significant weight on the financial metrics of the companies included in its comparison group, whereas we focus more on operational measures for the performance unit peer group.",

        "page_content": "In December 2022, the Compensation Committee determined that PG&E Corporation (\"PG&E\") was no longer an appropriate peer comparison and approved the removal of PG&E from the custom peer group for the outstanding 2020-2022 performance unit awards. PG&E is a public utility holding company whose primary operating subsidiary sells and delivers electricity and natural gas to customers located in Northern and Central California. As a result, PG&E is subject to a significantly increased financial risk from wildfires and other natural disasters. In fact, in 2020 PG&E emerged from bankruptcy resulting from incidents related to these risks. In addition, some financial analysts have recently dropped their coverage of PG&E.\n\nThe required percentile ranking for 3-year total stockholder return and the applicable vesting percentage are set forth in the chart below.\n\n| Performance Percentile Rank   | Vesting Percent   |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------|\n| < 25 th  Percentile           | 0%                |\n| 25 th  Percentile             | 25%               |\n| Target (50 th  Percentile)    | 100%              |\n| 75 th  Percentile             | 125%              |\n| 90 th  Percentile             | 175%              |\n\nIf the Company's rank is between the benchmarks identified above, the vesting percentage will be determined by interpolating on a straight line basis the appropriate vesting percentage. Unvested performance units generally are immediately forfeited upon a NEO's cessation of employment with WEC Energy Group prior to completion of the three-year performance period. However, the performance units will vest immediately at the target 100% rate upon the termination of the NEO's employment (1) by reason of disability or death or (2) after a change in control of WEC Energy Group. In addition, a prorated number of performance units (based upon the target 100% rate) will vest upon the termination of employment of the NEO by reason of retirement prior to the end of the three-year performance period.\n\nPursuant to the terms of the performance unit plan, the vesting percentage of the performance units may be adjusted downwards or upwards based upon the Company's performance against an Additional Performance Measure. Similar to the performance units awarded in 2020 and 2021, the Additional Performance Measure for the 2022 performance unit awards is the weighted average authorized return on equity (\"ROE\") of all WEC Energy Group's utility subsidiaries. In order for WEC Energy Group to meet its earnings per share targets, it is important that our utilities earn at or close to their allowed rates of return. The Company's performance against this measure may decrease or increase the vesting percentage of the performance units up to 10% over the three-year performance period. The ROE target is based upon a formulaic calculation that varies each year based on our past and planned investments among our utilities, as well as each utility's authorized ROE. For the 2020, 2021, and 2022 performance unit awards, the ROE targets and potential adjustments were set as follows for 2022:\n\n| If Actual Annual ROE is             | The Annual Adjustment is   | ROE Ranges    |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------|\n| \u2264 20 bp below the Authorized ROE    | + 3.33%                    | \u2265 9.61%       |\n| 21 - 30 bp below the Authorized ROE | 0%                         | 9.60% - 9.51% |\n| > 30 bp below the Authorized ROE    | (3.33)%                    | < 9.51%       |\n\nWEC Energy Group's utility subsidiaries achieved a weighted average authorized ROE of 9.81% for 2022. This resulted in a 3.33% increase in the vesting percentage of the performance units awarded in January 2022, January 2021 and January 2020.\n\nFor purposes of determining the appropriate number of performance units to grant to a particular NEO, the Compensation Committee used a value of $92.088 per unit, the same value used for the 2022 restricted stock granted in January 2022.\n\nThe following table provides the number of performance units granted to each NEO in 2022, at the 100% target level:\n\n| Executive Officer   | Performance Units Granted   |\n|---------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Mr. Lauber          | 23,876                      |\n| Mr. Fletcher        | 21,118                      |\n| Ms. Liu             | 12,049                      |\n| Mr. Klappa          | 8,565                       |\n| Ms. Kelsey          | 6,647                       |\n| Mr. Garvin          | 5,804                       |\n\n2022 Payouts under Long-Term Incentive Awards Granted in 2020. The Compensation Committee granted performance unit awards to participants in the Performance Unit Plan in 2020. The terms of these performance units were substantially similar to those of the performance units granted in 2022 and described above. The required percentile ranks for total stockholder return and related vesting schedule were identical to that of the 2022 performance units.\n\nOther than the inclusion of Dominion Energy, Inc. for the 2022 performance unit awards, payouts under the 2020 performance units were based upon our total stockholder return for the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2022 compared against the same group of peer companies used for the 2022 performance unit awards.",

        "page_content": "As previously described, the Compensation Committee amended and restated the Company's Performance Unit Plan, effective as of January 1, 2023, making several changes to the plan design. For purposes of calculating total shareholder return, the Prior PUP, under which the 2020 performance units were awarded, requires an initial investment of $100 and $100 investments each quarter thereafter for the duration of the three-year performance period. On the other hand, the plans of our peer companies require only the initial $100 investment. Investing $100 each quarter rewards those companies whose stock price drops significantly during the performance period compared to their peers, and then increases even if such increase is in line with the rest of their peers. Management and the Compensation Committee reviewed the performance of companies whose stock price significantly underperformed WEC Energy Group's stock price between the start and end of the performance period, yet would have ranked higher in the total stockholder return calculation under the Company's plan. These companies were Edison International, First Energy, OGE Energy Corp. and Pinnacle West Capital. The stock price of these four companies dropped significantly during the three-year performance period for strategic, operational and/or regulatory reasons specific to each company.\n\nAs a result, when calculating the total stockholder return for these companies, the Compensation Committee adjusted for their significant underperformance during the performance period. Accounting for these adjustments, as well as the removal of PG&E Corporation from the peer group for all outstanding performance unit awards, resulted in a total stockholder return for WEC Energy Group at the 43.8 th percentile of the peer group for the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2022, resulting in the performance units vesting at a level of 81.3%. The cumulative three-year impact of the Company's performance against the Additional Performance Measure was a 10% increase in the vesting percentage of the performance units for a total vesting level of 91.3%. The actual payouts were determined by multiplying the number of vested performance units by the closing price of our common stock ($93.76) on December 30, 2022, the last trading day of the performance period. The actual payout to each NEO is reflected in the 'Option Exercises and Stock Vested for Fiscal Year 2022' table.\n\n## COMPENSATION RECOUPMENT POLICY\n\nAccountability is a fundamental value of WEC Energy Group. To reinforce this value through the Company's executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee has adopted a clawback policy that provides for the recoupment of incentive-based compensation in the event WEC Energy Group is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws (other than restatements permitted as a result of changes in accounting principles or interpretation). Pursuant to the policy, the Compensation Committee will recover from any current or former executive officer who has received incentive-based compensation during the three-year period preceding the date on which WEC Energy Group is required to prepare the accounting restatement, any portion of the incentive-based compensation paid in excess of what would have been paid to the executive officer under the restated financial results. The Company may also recover incentive-based compensation if an executive officer's employment is terminated for cause, or the executive officer violates a noncompetition or other restrictive covenant.\n\n## STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES\n\nThe Compensation Committee believes that an important adjunct to the long-term incentive program is significant stock ownership by officers who participate in the program, including the NEOs. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee has implemented stock ownership guidelines requiring officers who participate in the long-term incentive program to hold an amount of Company common stock and other equity-related Company securities that varies depending upon such officer's level.\n\nIn addition to shares owned outright, holdings of each of the following are included in determining compliance with our stock ownership guidelines: restricted stock; WEC Energy Group phantom stock units held in the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan and NonQualified Retirement Savings Plan; WEC Energy Group stock held in WEC Energy Group's 401(k) plans; performance units at target; and shares held in a brokerage account, jointly with an immediate family member or in a trust.\n\nThe guidelines require each executive officer, including the NEOs, to acquire (generally within five years of appointment as an executive officer) and hold common stock and other equity-related securities of the Company having a minimum fair market value ranging from 250% to 600% of base salary. The Compensation Committee believes these stock ownership guidelines discourage unreasonable risktaking by Company officers.\n\nThe Compensation Committee annually reviews whether executive officers are in compliance with these guidelines. The last review was completed in October 2022. The Compensation Committee determined that all NEOs are in compliance, or making sufficient progress towards compliance, with these guidelines.\n\n## PROHIBITION ON HEDGING AND PLEDGING\n\nWEC Energy Group's Corporate Securities Trading Policy prohibits Directors and active employees (including officers) or any of their designees from using any strategies or products (including derivatives, short-selling techniques, prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds) that hedge or offset, or are designed to hedge or offset, any potential changes in the value of WEC Energy Group's common stock. The policy applies to WEC Energy Group common stock granted to the employees or Directors by the Company as part of their compensation or held directly or indirectly by employees or Directors. The policy also prohibits the holding of WEC Energy Group securities in a margin account, as well as the pledging of WEC Energy Group securities as collateral for a loan.",

        "page_content": "## LIMITED TRADING WINDOWS\n\nOfficers, including the NEOs, other identified employees, and the Company's Directors may only transact in WEC Energy Group securities during approved trading windows after satisfying mandatory pre-clearance requirements, or subject to a 10b5-1 trading plan approved during an open trading window.\n\n## RETIREMENT PROGRAMS\n\nWe also maintain retirement plans in which our NEOs participate: a defined benefit pension plan of the cash balance type, a supplemental pension plan, individual letter agreements with some of the NEOs, a 401(k) plan, and a non-qualified retirement savings plan. We believe our retirement plans are a valuable benefit in the attraction and retention of our employees, including the NEOs. We believe that providing a foundation for long-term financial security for our employees, beyond their employment with the Company, is a valuable component of our overall compensation program which will inspire increased loyalty and improved performance. For more information about our retirement plans, see \"Pension Benefits at Fiscal Year-End 2022\" and \"Retirement Plans\" beginning on page P-62.\n\n## OTHER BENEFITS, INCLUDING PERQUISITES\n\nWe provide our executive officers, including the NEOs, with employee benefits and a limited number of perquisites. Except as specifically noted elsewhere in this proxy statement, the employee benefits programs in which executive officers participate (which provide benefits such as medical coverage, retirement benefits, annual contributions to a qualified savings plan, and moving and relocation costs) are generally the same programs offered to substantially all of the Company's management employees.\n\nThe perquisites made available to executive officers include financial planning, membership in a service that provides health care and safety management when traveling outside the United States, reimbursement for expenses related to annual physical exam costs not covered by insurance, and limited spousal travel for business purposes. The Company also pays periodic dues and fees for club memberships for designated officers. Mr. Garvin received this benefit in 2022.\n\nWe customarily review market data regarding executive perquisite practices on an annual basis. For 2022, the Compensation Committee again reviewed our package of perquisites with FW Cook and decided not to make any changes. WEC Energy Group has a legacy group of executives who are still eligible for gross-ups. We reimburse those executives for taxes paid on income attributable to the financial planning benefits provided to the executives only if the executive uses either of the Company's identified preferred providers, Annex Wealth Management or AYCO. We believe the use of the preferred financial advisers provides administrative benefits and eases communication between Company personnel and the financial advisers.\n\nWe pay periodic dues and fees for certain club memberships as we have found that the use of these facilities helps foster better customer and community relationships. Officers are expected to use clubs for which the Company pays dues primarily for business purposes. We do not pay any additional expenses incurred for personal use of these facilities, and officers are required to reimburse the Company to the extent that it pays for any such personal use. We do not permit personal use of the airplane available to the Company. We do allow spousal travel if an executive's spouse is accompanying the executive on business travel and the airplane is not fully utilized by Company personnel. There is no incremental cost to the Company for this travel, other than the reimbursement for taxes paid on imputed income attributable to the executives for this perquisite, as the airplane cost is the same regardless of whether or not an executive's spouse travels. Any tax reimbursement is subject to the Company's Tax Gross-Up Policy discussed below.\n\nIn addition, each of our executive officers is eligible to participate in an officer life insurance benefit. If an executive officer chooses to participate, upon such officer's death while employed by the Company, a benefit is paid to his or her designated beneficiary in an amount equal to the value of three times the officer's base salary at the time of death.\n\n## TAX GROSS-UP POLICY\n\nThe Compensation Committee adopted a formal policy that prohibits entry into any contract, agreement, or arrangement with any officer of the Company that obligates the Company to pay directly or reimburse the officer for any portion of the officer's individual tax liability for benefits provided by the Company. Excluded from this policy are (1) agreements or arrangements entered into prior to December 2014 when the policy was adopted, (2) agreements or arrangements entered into prior to, and assumed by the Company in connection with, any merger or acquisition, or (3) plans or policies applicable to Company employees generally.\n\n## SEVERANCE BENEFITS AND CHANGE IN CONTROL\n\nMr. Fletcher, who retired effective June 1, 2022, was a party to an employment agreement with the Company that included severance benefits. In conjunction with his retirement, Mr. Fletcher was not entitled to any of these benefits. None of the remaining NEOs, including Mr. Lauber, have entered into an employment agreement that provides for severance and change in control benefits. However, they are eligible to participate in the Company's Severance Pay Plan. For a discussion of the severance benefits available to our executive officers generally, see 'Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control\" located on page P-66.\n\nIn addition, our supplemental pension plan provides that in the event of a change in control, participants will be entitled to a lump sum payment of amounts due under the plan if employment is terminated within 18 months of the change in control.",

        "page_content": "## IMPACT OF PRIOR COMPENSATION\n\nThe Compensation Committee does not believe it is appropriate to consider the amounts realized or realizable from prior incentive compensation awards when establishing future levels of short-term and long-term incentive compensation.\n\n## TAX AND ACCOUNTING CONSIDERATIONS\n\nWhen reviewing and adjusting the Company's compensation program, the Compensation Committee considers factors that may have an impact on the Company's financial performance, including tax and accounting rules. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits the tax deductibility of compensation that the Company pays to certain covered employees, generally including the NEOs, to $1 million in any year per person. Although the Compensation Committee takes into consideration the provisions of Section 162(m), it believes that maintaining tax deductibility is only one consideration among many in the design of an effective executive compensation program. Accordingly, achieving the desired flexibility in the design and delivery of compensation may result in compensation that in certain cases is not deductible for federal income tax purposes.\n\n## RETENTION AGREEMENT\n\nDue to unforeseen medical circumstances in 2017 involving the Company's then-CEO, the Company, under the Board's careful oversight, was required to adjust its CEO succession plan and accelerate the development of the next generation of Company leadership. Since that time, the Company has continued to deliver strong results and shareholder value.\n\nWith his appointment, effective February 1, 2022, Mr. Lauber became the Company's fourth CEO in six years. In order to provide sufficient time for longer term succession planning, the Compensation Committee determined it was in the Company's best interest to incentivize Mr. Lauber, age 56 at that time, to remain with the Company until his retirement.\n\nAs we previously disclosed, on February 21, 2022, the Company and Mr. Lauber entered into a letter agreement, which was approved by the Compensation Committee after consideration of input from FW Cook. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, the Company will credit an annual contribution of $300,000 to a nonqualified account beginning February 21, 2022. So long as Mr. Lauber remains employed by the Company, an additional $300,000 will be credited annually on February 1, until a maximum of 10 contributions have been made. In addition, the account will be credited with interest at a rate of 5.0% annually, which is equivalent to the interest crediting rate under the Company's cash balance pension plan. The account would vest upon the sixth such contribution, at which time Mr. Lauber will be 61, or upon Mr. Lauber's death or disability.\n\n## COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT\n\nThe Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with management and, based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement.\n\n## The Compensation Committee\n\nUlice Payne, Jr., Committee Chair William M.

The amounts reported in the Total Without Change in Pension Value column may differ substantially from the amounts reported in the Total column required under SEC rules and are not a substitute for total compensation. Total Without Change in Pension Value represents total compensation, as determined under applicable SEC rules, minus the change in pension value reported in the Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings column. The change in pension value is subject to many external variables, such as interest rates, that are not related to Company performance. Therefore, we believe that total compensation minus the change in pension value provides helpful additional information for comparative purposes.\n\n- (1) As previously disclosed, Mr. Fletcher announced that he would retire in June 2022. Effective February 1, 2022, Mr. Fletcher transitioned to the role of Senior Adviser until his retirement, and Mr. Lauber became the President and CEO of the Company.\n- (2) In connection with Mr. Fletcher's 2022 retirement, and in light of his many contributions to the success of the Company, the Compensation Committee accelerated the vesting of 9,707 shares of restricted stock previously awarded to him. The fair value associated with this acceleration was $1,035,834, which is included in the reported amount. The prorated payout to Mr. Fletcher for the performance units that were granted in 2022 is reflected in the \"Option Exercises and Stock Vested for Fiscal Year 2022\" table.\n- (3) In connection with her appointment as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Ms. Liu received a signing bonus of $100,000 and a one-time restricted stock award valued at $400,000.\n- (4) The amounts reported reflect the aggregate grant date fair value, as computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 excluding estimated forfeitures, of performance units and/or restricted stock awarded to each NEO in the respective year for which such amounts are reported. The amounts reported for the performance units are based upon the probable outcome as of the grant date of associated performance and market conditions, and are consistent with our estimate, as of the grant date, of aggregate compensation cost to be recognized over the three-year performance period. The actual value received by the executives from these awards may range from $0 to greater than the reported amounts, depending upon the Company's performance and the executive's number of additional years of service with the Company.\n\nThe value of the performance unit awards as of the grant date, assuming achievement of the highest level of performance and excluding any performance units resulting from short-term dividend equivalents and the Additional Performance Measure, for each of Messrs. Lauber, Klappa, and Garvin, and Mmes. Liu and Kelsey, is $4,012,630, $1,439,469, $975,427, $2,024,994, and $1,117,079, respectively, for the 2022 awards. The value of the performance unit awards as of the grant date, assuming achievement of the highest level of performance and excluding any performance units resulting from short-term dividend equivalents and the Additional Performance Measure, for each of Messrs. Lauber, Klappa, and Garvin, and Mmes. Liu and Kelsey, is $2,242,626, $1,293,052, $766,543, $1,818,741, and $1,013,225, respectively, for the 2021 awards. See 'Option Exercises and Stock Vested For Fiscal Year 2022' for the amount of the actual payout with respect to the 2020 award of performance units. See \"Option Exercises and Stock Vested for Fiscal Year 2022\" for the amount of the actual payout with respect to Mr. Fletcher's 2020, 2021 and 2022 awards of performance units that vested pursuant to the terms of the Company's Performance Unit Plan upon his retirement on June 1, 2022. Not included are the performance unit awards resulting from short-term dividend equivalents and/or the Additional Performance Measure that may increase or, in the case of the Additional Performance Measure, decrease these amounts.",

The amounts reported for all three years also include above-market earnings on compensation that is deferred by the NEOs into the Prime Rate Fund under WEC Energy Group's Executive Deferred Compensation Plan. Above-market earnings represent the difference between the interest rate used to calculate earnings under the Plan and 120% of the applicable federal long-term rate prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code.

As the discount rate decreases, the Company's pension funding obligation increases, and vice versa. The changes in the actuarial present values of the NEOs' pension benefits do not constitute cash payments to the NEOs. For 2022, Mr. Klappa's pension value decreased by $3,315,050 due to the increase in the discount rate, and is shown as $0 pursuant to applicable SEC rules.\n\nThe pension values reported represent only WEC Energy Group's obligation of the aggregate change in the actuarial present value of each NEO's accumulated benefit under all defined benefit plans. Messrs. Fletcher and Klappa are entitled to receive pension benefits from prior employers. To the extent such prior employers are unable to pay their pension obligations, WEC Energy Group may be obligated to pay the total amount.\n\nMr. Fletcher's increase in pension value in 2022, 2021, and 2020 primarily reflects the increase in his 36-month average compensation as President and CEO.\n\n- (8) During 2022, each NEO received financial planning services and the cost of an annual physical exam; Messrs. Lauber, Fletcher, and Klappa, and Ms. Liu, were provided with membership in a service that provides healthcare and safety management when traveling outside the United States. Although Messrs. Fletcher and Klappa utilized the benefit of spousal travel for business purposes in 2022, there was no associated cost to the Company as Messrs. Fletcher and Klappa were not eligible to receive reimbursement for taxes paid on imputed income attributable for such travel.\n- (9) For Mr. Klappa, the amount reported in All Other Compensation for 2022 includes $21,947 attributable to WEC Energy Group's Directors' Charitable Awards Program in connection with Mr. Klappa's service on the Company's Board. See 'Director Compensation' for a description of the Directors' Charitable Awards Program.\n\nAll Other Compensation for Messrs. Lauber, Fletcher, Klappa, and Garvin, and Mmes. Liu and Kelsey, for 2022 also consists of:\n\n- \u00b7 Employer matching of contributions into the WEC Energy Group 401(k) plan in the amount of $12,200 for each NEO;\n- \u00b7 Employer contributions into the WEC Energy Group 401(k) plan in the amount of $18,300 for Mr. Klappa and Mmes. Liu and Kelsey, and into the WEC Energy Group Non-Qualified Retirement Savings Plan in the amount of $97,661 for Ms. Liu, $225,907 for Mr. Klappa, and $68,749 for Ms. Kelsey. These payments are in lieu of participation in the Company's pension plan;\n- \u00b7 'Make-whole' payments under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan that provides a match at the same level as the WEC Energy Group 401(k) plan (4% for up to 7% of wages) for all deferred salary and bonus not otherwise eligible for a match in the amounts of $90,724 for Mr. Lauber, $65,107 for Ms. Liu, $38,264 for Mr. Klappa, $45,833 for Ms. Kelsey, and $34,198 for Mr. Garvin;\n- \u00b7 Retention credit contributed to a nonqualified account in the amount of $300,000 for Mr. Lauber. See \"Retention Agreement\" in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis for a description;\n- \u00b7 Retirement income supplement contributed to a nonqualified account in the amount of $239,881 for Ms. Liu. See \"Ms. Liu's Retirement Income Supplement\" on page P-64 for a description of this benefit;\n- \u00b7 Relocation expense tax reimbursement to Ms. Liu; and\n- \u00b7 Tax reimbursements or 'gross-ups' for all applicable perquisites in the amount of $13,963 and $17,862 for Messrs. Lauber and Garvin, respectively.",

For a more detailed description of the STPP, see the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. For Mr. Fletcher, these represent prorated amounts to account for his 2022 retirement. For Mr. Lauber, these represent prorated amounts based upon his base salary and target STPP award as Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer for one month and President and CEO for 11 months.\n- (3) Consists of performance units awarded under the WEC Energy Group Performance Unit Plan. WEC Energy Group's Performance Unit Plan provides for shortterm dividend equivalents. The number of performance units awarded will be increased as of any date that WEC Energy Group declares a cash dividend on its common stock by the amount of short-term dividend equivalents awarded. In effect, short-term dividend equivalents will be credited and accumulated as reinvested dividends on each performance unit so that the performance units and accumulated dividends will be paid out at the end of the performance units' three-year performance period, contingent upon the Company's performance. Therefore, the number of performance units reported at each of the threshold, target, and maximum levels in this table will increase by the number of short-term dividend equivalents earned. In addition, these amounts do not reflect any potential impact of the Company's performance against the Additional Performance Measure. For a more detailed description of the performance units, short-term dividend equivalents, and Additional Performance Measure, see the Compensation Discussion and Analysis.\n- (4) Consists of restricted stock awarded under the 1993 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan. For a more detailed description of the terms of the restricted stock, see the Compensation Discussion and Analysis.\n- (5) Consists of non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of WEC Energy Group common stock pursuant to the 1993 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan. For a more detailed description of the terms of the options, see the Compensation Discussion and Analysis.\n- (6) The exercise price of the option awards is equal to the fair market value of WEC Energy Group's common stock on the date of grant. Fair market value is the average of the high and low prices of WEC Energy Group common stock, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, reported by Bloomberg L.P. on the grant date.",

Liu and Kelsey are not eligible to receive pension benefits under the WEC Energy Group Plan.\n- (3) Upon his retirement in May 2016, Mr. Klappa's ILA terminated. At that time, the number of years of credited service and the accumulated benefit effectively transferred to the WEC Energy Group Plan and the supplemental executive retirement plan (\"SERP\"). Payments related to the ILA were actually paid under the WEC SERP.\n- Mr. Klappa is not accruing additional benefits under these plans in connection with his current service.\n- (4) The key assumptions used in calculating the actuarial present values reflected in this column are:\n- \u00b7 Earliest projected unreduced retirement age based upon projected service:\n- -For Mr. Lauber, age 60.\n- -For Mr. Fletcher, age 64 (actual age at retirement in 2022).\n- -For Mr. Klappa, age 65.67 (actual age at retirement in 2016).\n- -For Mr. Garvin, age 56.42.\n- \u00b7 Discount rate of 5.50%.\n- \u00b7 Cash balance interest crediting rate of 5.00%.\n- \u00b7 Form of payment:\n- -Mr. Lauber: WEC Energy Group Plan 50% lump sum / 50% life annuity; SERP - Ten Year Annual Installment\n- -Mr. Fletcher's actual form of payment elected at retirement: WEC Energy Group Plan 100% joint & survivor annuity; SERP and ILA - 50% joint & survivor annuity\n- -Mr. Klappa's actual form of payment elected at retirement: WEC Energy Group Plan, SERP, and ILA - Single Life annuity\n- -Mr. Garvin: WEC Energy Group Plan 50% lump sum / 50% life annuity; SERP and ILA - Five Annual Installments\n- \u00b7 Mortality Table for life annuity - Pri-2012/Male/White Collar as published by the Society of Actuaries with modified MP2020 projection.\n- (5) WEC Energy Group's pension benefit obligations to Messrs. Fletcher and Klappa will be partially offset by pension benefits they are entitled to receive from their former employers. The amounts reported for Messrs. Fletcher and Klappa represent only WEC Energy Group's obligation of the aggregate actuarial present value of each of their accumulated benefit under all of the plans. The total aggregate actuarial present value of each of Messrs. Fletcher's and Klappa's accumulated benefit under all of the plans is $36,157,424 and $24,842,014 respectively, $2,399,539 and $3,624,998 of which we estimate the prior employer is obligated to pay. If Messrs. Fletcher's and Klappa's former employer becomes unable to pay its portion of his respective accumulated pension benefit, WEC Energy Group may be obligated to pay the total amount.\n- (6) Mr. Klappa continues to receive retirement benefits under the SERP; however, payments under the WEC Energy Group Plan were suspended for Mr. Klappa at the time he resumed his role as an executive officer with the Company.\n\n## RETIREMENT PLANS\n\nWEC Energy Group maintains four different plans providing for retirement payments and benefits for the NEOs: a defined benefit pension plan of the cash balance type ('WEC Energy Group Plan'); a supplemental executive retirement plan ('SERP'); ILAs; and the WEC Energy Group Retirement Savings Plan, which is a 401(k) plan, for those individuals who are not eligible to participate in the WEC Energy Group Plan. The compensation considered for purposes of the retirement plans (other than the WEC Energy Group Plan and SERP) for Mr. Fletcher is $3,995,628. This amount represents the average compensation (consisting of base salary and annual incentive compensation) for the 36 highest consecutive months. For Messrs. Lauber and Garvin, the compensation considered for purposes of the retirement plans is $2,573,089 and $1,159,947 respectively, of which $305,000 is applied to the WEC Energy Group",

Lauber and Garvin currently have 32.5 and 11.67 credited years of service, respectively, under the various plans described below. Messrs. Lauber and Garvin were not granted additional years of credited service. See below for a discussion of the contributions made to the WEC Energy Group Retirement Savings Plan on behalf of Mr. Klappa and Mmes. Liu and Kelsey, who do not participate in the WEC Energy Group Plan.\n\n## The WEC Energy Group Plan\n\nMany of our regular full-time and part-time employees, including several of the NEOs, participate in the WEC Energy Group Plan. The WEC Energy Group Plan bases a participant's defined benefit pension on the value of a hypothetical account balance. For individuals participating in the WEC Energy Group Plan as of December 31, 1995, a starting account balance was created equal to the present value of the benefit accrued as of December 31, 1994, under the plan benefit formula prior to the change to a cash balance approach. That formula provided a retirement income based on years of credited service and average compensation (consisting of base salary and annual incentive compensation) for the 36 highest consecutive months, with an adjustment to reflect the Social Security integrated benefit. In addition, individuals participating in the WEC Energy Group Plan as of December 31, 1995, received a special one-time transition credit amount equal to a specified percentage varying with age multiplied by credited service and 1994 base pay.\n\nThe present value of the accrued benefit as of December 31, 1994, plus the transition credit, was also credited with interest at a stated rate. For 1996 through 2007, a participant received annual credits to the account equal to 5% of base pay (including WEC Energy Group 401(k) plan pre-tax deferrals and other items), plus an interest credit on all prior accruals equal to 4% plus 75% of the annual time-weighted trust investment return for the year in excess of 4%. From 2008 through 2013, the interest credit percentage was set at either the long-term corporate bond third segment rate, published by the Internal Revenue Service, or 4%, whichever was greater.\n\nEffective January 1, 2014, participants receive an annual credit to the account equal to 6% of base pay (including WEC Energy Group 401(k) plan pre-tax deferrals and other items), plus an interest credit on all prior accruals equal to a 5% fixed rate. For participants in the WEC Energy Group Plan on December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2013, their WEC Energy Group Plan benefit will never be less than the benefit accrued as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2013, respectively. The WEC Energy Group Plan benefit will be calculated under all three formulas to provide participants with the greater benefit; however, in calculating a participant's benefit accrued as of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2013, interest credits as defined under each of the prior WEC Energy Group Plan formulas will be taken into account but not any additional pay credits.\n\nParticipants who were 'grandfathered' as of December 31, 1995, as discussed below, will still receive the greater of the grandfathered benefit or the cash balance benefit.\n\nThe life annuity payable under the WEC Energy Group Plan is determined by converting the hypothetical account balance credits into annuity form.\n\nIndividuals who were participants in the WEC Energy Group Plan on December 31, 1995 were 'grandfathered' so that they will not receive any lower retirement benefit than would have been provided under the formula in effect through December 31, 1995, had it continued. This amount continued to increase until December 31, 2010, at which time it was frozen. Upon retirement, participants will receive the greater of this frozen amount or the accumulated cash balance.\n\nFor Mr. Lauber, estimated benefits under the cash balance plan formula are higher than under the grandfathered formula. Messrs Fletcher and Garvin do not participate in the grandfathered formula.\n\nUnder the WEC Energy Group Plan, participants receive unreduced pension benefits upon reaching one of the following three thresholds: (1) age 65; (2) age 62 with 30 years of service; or (3) age 60 with 35 years of service.\n\nPursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, only $305,000 of pension eligible earnings (base pay and annual incentive compensation) could be considered for purposes of the WEC Energy Group Plan in 2022.\n\n## Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans and Individual Letter Agreements\n\nDesignated officers of WEC Energy Group, including all of the NEOs (other than Mmes. Liu and Kelsey) participate in the SERP, which is part of the Supplemental Pension Plan (the 'SPP') adopted to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The SERP provides monthly supplemental pension benefits to participants, which will be paid out of unsecured corporate assets, or the grantor trust described below, in an amount equal to the difference between the actual pension benefit payable under the WEC Energy Group Plan and what such pension benefit would be if calculated without regard to any limitation imposed by the Internal Revenue Code on pension benefits or covered compensation, including amounts deferred to the WEC Energy Group Executive Deferred Compensation Plan. Except for a 'change in control' of WEC Energy Group, as defined in the SPP, and pursuant to the terms of the ILAs discussed below, no payments are made until after the participant's retirement at or after age 60 or death. If a participant in the SERP dies prior to age 60, his or her beneficiary is entitled to receive retirement benefits under the SERP. Although Mr. Klappa remains a participant in the SPP, he no longer accrues any benefits under the plan as a result of his earlier retirement in 2016.\n\nWEC Energy Group entered into an agreement with Mr. Fletcher when he first commenced employment in 2011 to provide him with supplemental retirement benefits upon his retirement, provided he completed one year of service with the Company. The supplemental retirement payments are intended to make the total retirement benefits payable to Mr. Fletcher comparable to that which would have been received under his prior employer's defined benefit pension plan, calculated without regard to Internal Revenue Code limits, and as if Mr. Fletcher's employment continued with the prior employer and the defined benefit formula then in effect under the prior employer's plan continued to his retirement. The retirement benefits payable as a result of this agreement will be offset by the value of any qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plan of the prior employer.",

        "page_content": "WEC Energy Group entered into an individual letter agreement with Mr. Klappa when he first commenced employment in 2003 to provide him with supplemental retirement benefits upon retirement at or after age 60. The supplemental retirement payments are intended to make the total retirement benefits payable to Mr. Klappa comparable to that which would have been received under the WEC Energy Group Plan as in effect on December 31, 1995, had the defined benefit formula then in effect continued until his retirement, calculated without regard to Internal Revenue Code limits, and as if Mr. Klappa had started participation in the WEC Energy Group Plan at age 27. As a result, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, which terminated upon Mr. Klappa's retirement in May 2016, Mr. Klappa had 38.67 years of credited service under the WEC Energy Group Plan and the SERP upon his retirement.\n\nThe Company entered into an agreement with Mr. Garvin when he was hired in April 2011 that provides for a supplemental pension benefit account, which was credited with $50,000. This account is credited with interest annually at the same rate as the WEC Energy Group Plan. The account balance vested in April 2021, when Mr. Garvin completed 10 years of service.\n\nThe purpose of these agreements was to ensure that Messrs. Fletcher, Klappa, and Garvin did not lose pension earnings by joining the executive management team at WEC Energy Group they otherwise would have received from their former employers. Without providing a means to retain these pension benefits, it would have been difficult for WEC Energy Group to attract these officers.\n\nThe SPP provides for a mandatory lump sum payment upon a change in control if the executive's employment is terminated within 18 months after the change in control. The Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2014 Rabbi Trust, a grantor trust, funds certain non-qualified benefits, including the SPP and the ILAs, as well as the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan and the Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan. See 'Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control' later in this proxy statement for additional information.\n\n## Ms. Liu's Retirement Income Supplement\n\nWEC Energy Group entered into an employment agreement with Ms. Liu when she commenced employment in June 2020 that provides for a retirement income supplement. Pursuant to the agreement, WEC Energy Group will credit $225,000 annually to a nonqualified account. The annual credit plus interest will continue until the year in which Ms. Liu ceases employment or reaches age 62. The balance at separation or age 62 will be frozen and will not exceed $3,000,000. Effective January 1 of each year, the account will be credited with interest at the annual average prime rate, not to exceed 5%. Amounts credited to the account will vest at age 55, and will be distributed at Ms. Liu's retirement or other separation. Administration of this benefit is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of providing this benefit under Ms. Liu's agreement was to ensure that she did not lose retirement benefits by joining the executive management team at the Company she otherwise would have accrued and received from her former employer.\n\n## Mr. Lauber's Retention Agreement\n\nSee \"Retention Agreement\" in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis for information regarding an agreement the Company entered into with Mr. Lauber pursuant to which the Company will credit up to 10 annual contributions of $300,000 to a nonqualified account if Mr. Lauber remains with the Company.\n\n## WEC Energy Group Retirement Savings Plan\n\nEffective January 1, 2015, all newly hired management employees, including executive officers, will receive an annual contribution equal to 6% of pension-eligible wages from the Company into WEC Energy Group's 401(k) plan rather than participate in the WEC Energy Group Plan. Pension-eligible wages consist of annual base salary and STPP payouts. In connection with this plan, the Compensation Committee adopted the WEC Energy Group Non-Qualified Retirement Savings Plan which provides 'make-whole' benefits to address Internal Revenue Code limits on the amount of money that can be contributed to a 401(k) plan. Balances in the 401(k) and non-qualified retirement savings plans vest after one full year of service.\n\nSince Mr. Klappa is considered a new employee, he no longer accrues additional benefits under the WEC Energy Group Plan. Mr. Klappa, along with Mmes. Liu and Kelsey, are entitled to receive Company contributions to the 401(k) plan and Non-Qualified Retirement Savings Plan.",

The Legacy EDCP provides that (1) amounts earned, deferred, vested, credited, and/or accrued as of December 31, 2004 are preserved and frozen (subject to appreciation in value of such amounts) so that these amounts are exempt from Section 409A and (2) no new employees may participate in the Legacy EDCP as of January 1, 2005. Since January 1, 2005, all deferrals have been made to the EDCP. The provisions of the EDCP as in effect on December 31, 2022 are described below, as are the payout provisions of the Legacy EDCP.\n\nThe EDCP. Under the plan, a participant may defer up to 50% of his or her base salary, annual incentive compensation and vested awards of performance units. Stock option gains and vested restricted stock may not be deferred into the EDCP. Generally, deferral elections are made annually by each participant for the upcoming plan year. The Company maintains detailed records tracking each participant's 'account balance.' In addition to deferrals made by the participants, the Company may also credit each participant's account balance by matching a certain portion of each participant's deferral. Such deferral matching is determined by a formula taking into account the matching rate applicable under the Company's 401(k) plan, the percentage of compensation subject to such matching rate, the participant's gross compensation eligible for matching, and the amount of eligible compensation actually deferred. Also, in our discretion, the Company may credit any other amounts, as appropriate, to each participant's account.\n\nParticipants may elect to participate in the WEC Energy Group Common Stock Fund and/or the Prime Rate Fund. The Company tracks each participant's account balance as though the balance was actually invested in these funds. Fund elections are not actual investments, but are elections chosen only for purposes of calculating market gain or loss on deferred amounts for the duration of the deferral period. Each participant may select the amount of deferred compensation to be allocated among the two measurement funds. Contributions and deductions may be made to each participant's account based on the performance of the measurement fund(s) elected.\n\nThe annual rate of return for the calendar year ended December 31, 2022 for the WEC Energy Group Common Stock Fund and the Prime Rate Fund was -0.49% and 4.75%, respectively.\n\nEach participant's account balance is debited or credited periodically based on the performance of the measurement fund(s) elected by the participant. Subject to certain restrictions, participants may periodically make changes to their measurement fund elections.\n\nAt the time of his or her deferral election, each participant may designate a prospective payout election for any or the entire amount deferred, plus any amounts debited or credited to the deferred amount as of the designated payout. Amounts deferred into the EDCP may not be withdrawn at the discretion of the participant and a change to the designated payout delays the initial payment at least five years beyond the originally designated payout date. In addition, the Company may not limit payout amounts in order to deduct such amounts under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nThe balance of a participant's account is payable on his or her retirement in either a lump sum payout or in annual installments, at the election of the participant. Upon the death of a participant after retirement, payouts are made to the deceased participant's beneficiary in the same manner as though such payout would have been made to the participant had the participant survived. In the event of a participant's termination of employment prior to retirement, the participant may elect to receive a payout beginning the year after termination in the amount of his or her account balance as of the termination date either in a lump sum or in annual installments over a period of five years. Disability is not itself a payment event until the participant terminates employment with WEC Energy Group or its subsidiaries. A participant's account balance will be paid out in a lump sum if the participant separates from service with WEC Energy",

The deferred amounts will be paid out of the general corporate assets or the assets of the Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2014 Rabbi Trust.\n\nThe Legacy EDCP. At the time of his or her deferral election, each participant designated a prospective payout election for any or the entire amount deferred, plus any amounts debited or credited to the deferred amount as of the designated payout. A participant may elect, at any time, to withdraw part (a minimum of $25,000) or all of his or her account balance, subject to a withdrawal penalty of 10%. Payout amounts may be limited to the extent to which they are deductible by the Company under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nThe balance of a participant's account is payable on his or her retirement in either a lump sum payout or in annual installments, at the election of the participant. Upon the death of a participant after retirement, payouts are made to the deceased participant's beneficiary in the same manner as though such payout would have been made to the participant had the participant survived. In the event of a participant's termination of employment prior to retirement, the participant may elect to receive a payout beginning the year after termination in the amount of his or her account balance as of the termination date either in a lump sum or in annual installments over a period of five years. Any participant who suffers from a continued disability will be entitled to the benefits of plan participation unless and until the committee administering the plan determines that the participant has been terminated for purposes of continued participation in the plan. Upon any such determination, the disabled participant is paid out as though the participant had retired. Except in certain limited circumstances, participants' account balances will be paid out in a lump sum (1) upon the occurrence of a change in control, as defined in the plan, or (2) upon any downgrade of the Company's senior debt obligations to less than 'investment grade.' The deferred amounts will be paid out of the general corporate assets or the assets of the Wisconsin Energy Corporation 2014 Rabbi Trust.\n\n## POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL\n\nThe tables below reflect the amount of compensation payable to each of our NEOs in the event of termination of each executive's employment. These amounts are in addition to each NEO's aggregate balance in the EDCP at fiscal year-end 2022, as reported in the \"Aggregate Balance at Last Fiscal Year-End\" column under 'Nonqualified Deferred Compensation for Fiscal Year 2022.' The amount of compensation payable to each NEO upon voluntary termination, normal retirement, for-cause termination, involuntary termination (by the Company for any reason other than cause, death or disability or by the executive for 'good reason'), termination following a 'change in control,' disability, and death are set forth below. The amounts shown assume that such termination was effective as of December 31, 2022 and include amounts earned through that date, and are estimates of the amounts which would be paid out to the NEOs upon termination. The amounts shown under 'Normal Retirement' assume the NEOs were retirement eligible with no reduction of retirement benefits. The amounts shown under 'Termination Upon a Change in Control' assume the NEOs terminated employment as of December 31, 2022, which was within 18 months of a change in control of WEC Energy Group. The amounts reported in the row titled 'Retirement Plans' in each table below are not in addition to the amounts reflected under 'Pension Benefits at Fiscal Year-End 2022.' The actual amounts to be paid out can only be determined at the time of an officer's termination of employment.\n\n## Payments Made Upon Voluntary Termination or Termination for Cause, Death or Disability\n\nIn the event a NEO voluntarily terminates employment or is terminated for cause, death, or disability, the officer will receive:\n\n- \u00b7 accrued but unpaid base salary and, for termination by death or disability, prorated annual incentive compensation;\n- \u00b7 401(k) plan and EDCP account balances;\n- \u00b7 the WEC Energy Group Plan cash balance;\n- \u00b7 in the case of death or disability, full vesting in all outstanding stock options, restricted stock, and performance units (otherwise, the ability to exercise already vested options within three months of termination) as well as vesting in the SERP and ILAs; and\n- \u00b7 if voluntary termination occurs after age 60, such termination is treated as a normal retirement.\n\nNEOs are also entitled to the value of unused vacation days, if any, and for termination by death, benefits payable under the officer life insurance benefit if the NEO participates in such benefit.\n\n## Payments Made Upon Normal Retirement\n\nIn the event of the retirement of a NEO, the officer will receive:\n\n- \u00b7 accrued but unpaid base salary and prorated annual incentive compensation;\n- \u00b7 full vesting in all outstanding stock options and a prorated amount of performance units;\n- \u00b7 full vesting in all retirement plans, including the WEC Energy Group Plan, SERP, and ILAs (Ms. Liu would be entitled to full vesting of her retirement income supplement);\n- \u00b7 401(k) plan and EDCP account balances; and\n- \u00b7 the value of unused vacation days, if any.\n\nIn addition to the receipt of these benefits by Mr. Fletcher in connection with his retirement on June 1, 2022, the Compensation Committee accelerated the vesting of 9,707 shares of restricted stock. See \"Summary Compensation Table\" above for information regarding Mr. Fletcher's prorated annual incentive compensation. See \"Options Exercised and Stock Vested for Fiscal year 2022\" for additional information regarding the vesting of Mr. Fletcher's restricted stock and performance unit awards. The value of stock options that vested upon Mr. Fletcher's retirement (based on the excess of the market price of the Company's common stock on June 1, 2022 over the exercise price of such options) was $2,260,467.",

        "page_content": "## Payments Made Under Employment Agreement Upon a Change in Control, Involuntary Termination, or Termination for Good Reason\n\nPursuant to the terms of the SPP, retirement benefits are paid to all participating NEOs upon termination of employment within 18 months of a change in control. Participants appointed by the Company, including the NEOs, are also eligible to receive a supplemental disability benefit pursuant to the terms of the WEC Energy Group Supplemental Long-Term Disability Plan, in an amount equal to the difference between the actual amount of the benefit payable under the long term disability plan applicable to all employees and what such disability benefit would have been if calculated without regard to any limitation imposed by the broad-based plan on annual compensation recognized thereunder.\n\nMr. Fletcher was a party to an employment agreement with the Company that included severance benefits. In conjunction with his retirement on June 1, 2022, Mr. Fletcher was not entitled to any of these benefits.\n\n## Payments under the Severance Pay Plan\n\nMessrs. Lauber, Klappa and Garvin, and Mmes. Liu and Kelsey, have not entered into any agreement that currently provides for severance benefits upon a change in control or otherwise. These officers are eligible to participate in the Company's Severance Pay Plan, in which all management employees are eligible to participate. In the event a participant is involuntarily terminated, other than for cause, death, disability, retirement, or resignation, the participant is entitled to receive severance pay in an amount equal to the sum of: (1) 4% of the participant's annual base salary and target bonus, plus (2) 4% of the participant's annual base salary and target bonus multiplied by his or her completed years of service with the Company. The maximum amount of severance pay that can be received under the plan is twelve months of a participant's annual base salary and target bonus.\n\n## Payments under Retention Agreement\n\nPursuant to the terms of a letter agreement, Mr. Lauber will be credited an annual contribution of $300,000 to a nonqualified account beginning on February 21, 2022. So long as Mr. Lauber remains employed by the Company, an additional $300,000 will be credited on February 1, until a maximum of 10 contributions have been made. In addition, the account will be credited with interest at a rate of 5.0% annually. This account would vest upon the sixth contribution, at which time Mr. Lauber will be 61, or upon Mr. Lauber's death or disability.

        "page_content": "## PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE\n\nThe primary objective of our executive compensation program is to provide a competitive, performance-based plan that enables the Company to attract and retain key individuals and to reward them for achieving both the Company's short-term and long-term goals without creating an incentive for our NEOs to take excessive risks. In line with this objective, the Company's general pay practice for all management employees is to target the median pay for each individual's position at comparably sized companies.\n\nFor 2022, the annual total compensation of Mr. Lauber, our principal executive officer serving in that position on December 31, 2022, of $8,149,461, as shown in the Summary Compensation Table above ('CEO Compensation'), was approximately 68 times the annual total compensation of the median employee of $119,284.\n\nWe identified the median employee as of December 31, 2022, using total wages and earnings paid during the rolling 12-month period ended December 31, 2022, as reflected in our internal payroll records (including, without limitation, base salary, wages plus overtime, and annual cash incentive payments, as applicable), for all individuals who were employed by us or any of our consolidated subsidiaries on December 31, 2022 (whether employed on a full-time, part-time, seasonal or temporary basis and including union and non-union employees). After identifying the median employee, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology we use for our CEO Compensation, which includes annual salary, bonus, change in pension value and 401(k) matching by the Company. We decided to use December 31, the last day of our fiscal year, for administrative convenience to align with other fiscal year-end calculations.\n\nTo provide further context to our pay practices, due to the complexity of the work associated with operating public utilities, our workforce tends to be more highly skilled than workforces at companies in other industries. Additionally, our employees often work for the Company for long periods of time; our average employee tenure is 14 years.\n\n## RISK ANALYSIS OF COMPENSATION POLICIES AND PRACTICES\n\nAs part of its process to determine the 2022 compensation of WEC Energy Group's NEOs, the Compensation Committee analyzed whether WEC Energy Group's compensation program taken as a whole creates risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Compensation Committee concluded it does not. This analysis applies generally to the compensation program for WEC Energy Group's employees since all management employees (both officers and non-officers) above a certain level are provided with substantially the same mix of compensation as the NEOs. The compensation package provided to employees below this level is not applicable to this analysis as such compensation package does not provide sufficient incentive to take risks that could materially affect the Company.\n\nThere is no objective way to measure risk resulting from a corporation's compensation program; therefore, this analysis is subjective in nature. We believe that the only elements of WEC Energy Group's compensation program that could incentivize risk-taking by our employees, and therefore have a reasonable likelihood of materially adversely affecting the Company, are the annual cash incentive compensation and the long-term incentive compensation, the payout of which is dependent upon the achievement of certain performance levels by the Company. Based upon the value of each of these elements to the overall compensation mix and the relative value each has to the other, we believe the Company's compensation program is appropriately balanced. We believe that the mix of short- and long-term awards minimizes risks that may be taken, as any risks taken for short-term gains could ultimately jeopardize the Company's ability to meet the long-term performance objectives. Given the current balance of compensation elements, we do not believe WEC Energy Group's compensation program incentivizes unreasonable risk-taking by management.\n\nThe Compensation Committee's stock ownership guidelines require officers who participate in the long-term incentive compensation program to hold an amount of Company common stock and other equity-related Company securities that varies depending upon such officers' level. The guidelines require the Company's executive officers to hold common stock and other equity-related securities of the Company having a minimum fair market value ranging from 250% to 600% of base salary. The Compensation Committee believes these stock ownership guidelines further discourage unreasonable risk taking by Company officers.\n\nAs part of this analysis, we also considered the nature of WEC Energy Group's business as a public utility holding company and the fact that substantially all of the Company's earnings and other financial results are generated by, or relate to, regulated public utilities. The highly regulated nature of WEC Energy Group's business, including limits on the amount of profit the Company's public utility subsidiaries (and therefore, WEC Energy Group) may earn, significantly reduces any incentive to engage in conduct that would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.",

        "page_content": "## PAY VERSUS PERFORMANCE DISCLOSURE\n\nAs described in more detail in 'Compensation Discussion and Analysis,' the Company's executive compensation program has been designed to provide a level of compensation that is strongly dependent upon the achievement of short-term and long-term goals that are aligned with the interests of our stockholders and customers. As such, a substantial portion of pay will only be realized upon strong corporate performance. The Compensation Committee has not designed the compensation program to specifically align the Company's performance measures with \"compensation actually paid\" (\"CAP\") (as computed in accordance with Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K) for a particular year. For example, the Company utilizes several performance measures to align executive compensation with Company performance that are not presented in the Pay versus Performance table below.\n\nThe following tables and supplemental graphical and narrative information present information about CAP, as defined by Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K, and compares CAP to various performance measures, also in accordance with such rules. CAP is a supplemental measure to be viewed alongside performance measures as an addition to the philosophy and strategy of compensation-setting discussed in 'Compensation Discussion and Analysis,' and not in replacement thereof.\n\n|      | (1) Summary Compensation  Table (SCT) Total for PEO ($)   | (1) Summary Compensation  Table (SCT) Total for PEO ($)   | (1,2) Compensation Actually  Paid (CAP) to PEO ($)   | (1,2) Compensation Actually  Paid (CAP) to PEO ($)   | (3)                                       | (2,3) Average  Compensation  Actually Paid to   | Value of Initial Fixed $100  investment based on: ($)   | Value of Initial Fixed $100  investment based on: ($)   | Net                       | Company  Selected  Measure        |\n|------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| Year | Lauber                                                    | Fletcher                                                  | Lauber                                               | Fletcher                                             | Average SCT  total for non- PEO NEOs  ($) | non-PEO  NEOs ($)                               | (4) WEC TSR                                             | (5) Peer Group  TSR                                     | Income ($)  (in millions) | Earnings Per  Share (diluted) ($) |\n| 2022 | 8,149,461                                                 | 8,151,511                                                 | 9,721,228                                            | 17,332,947                                           | 4,358,213                                 | 5,256,205                                       | 110.80                                                  | 111.03                                                  | 1,408.1                   | 4.45                              |\n| 2021 | -

The 'measurement period' for each covered fiscal year is the period from December 31, 2019 through the end of such covered fiscal year.\n- (5) Represents the Total Shareholder Return (\"TSR\") of the Custom Peer Index Group, weighted according to the respective companies' stock market capitalization at the beginning of each period for which a return is indicated. The Compensation Committee determined that PG&E was no longer an appropriate peer comparison and approved its removal from, and the addition of Dominion Energy, Inc. to, the 2022 Custom Peer Index Group. Prior to these changes, the Custom Peer Index Group TSR would have been $115.80 for 2022. For information about the Custom Peer Index Group, including the changes made, see \"Performance Graph\" in the Company's 2022 Annual Report.\n\n## Most Important Performance Measures\n\nThe following represents the most important financial performance measures used by WEC Energy Group to link compensation actually paid to each NEO for the most recently completed fiscal year to company performance:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAchievement of the Company's goals with respect to the financial measures highlighted above should drive strong TSR performance for the Company relative to its peers, which is an important component of our compensation program as more fully described in 'Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Long-Term Incentive Compensation\".\n\n## Supplemental Graphs\n\nThe following graphs and descriptions are provided in accordance with Item 402(v) of Regulation S-K to show the relationships between the compensation actually paid for each of the PEOs, as well as the other NEOs as a group, to 1) the cumulative TSR of the Company as it relates to the TSR of the Custom Peer Index Group, 2) net income, and 3) earnings per share, which is also the Company-selected performance measure.\n\nIn 2022, Mr. Fletcher was succeeded by Mr. Lauber as CEO. Mr. Fletcher's 'compensation actually paid' includes the accelerated vesting of all unvested long-term incentive awards upon his retirement.\n\n## CAP v. TSR\n\nAs demonstrated in the following graph, the amount of compensation paid to the PEOs and the average compensation paid to the other NEOs was aligned with the Company's TSR performance. A substantial portion of the compensation awarded to each of the NEOs is long-term incentive compensation. For most of the NEOs, performance unit awards comprise 65% of the long-term incentive compensation granted each year, with vesting primarily based upon the Company's TSR performance against its peer group. As discussed further in 'Compensation Discussion and Analysis,' the performance units granted in 2020, which vested at the end of the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2022, provided a payout that was less than target. See the Five-Year Cumulative Return and Total Stockholder Returns graphs in 'Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Executive Summary' for information on the Company's TSR performance over the 5- and 10-year periods ended December 31, 2022, which exceeded the performance of its peer group.\n\n## CAP vs. Total Shareholder Return\n\n<!-- image -->",

Net Income and Earnings Per Share (Company-Selected Measure)\n\nAs demonstrated by the following graphs, during the cumulative three-year period ended December 31, 2022, the compensation paid to the PEOs and the average compensation paid to the other NEOs was aligned with the Company's net income and EPS performance. Pursuant to the terms of the Company's short-term performance plan, almost 75% of the payout was based upon the Company's performance against EPS goals, of which net income is a key component. Almost 25% was based upon the Company's performance against cash flow goals. As discussed further in 'Compensation Discussion and Analysis,' for 2022, the target level payout under the Company's short-term performance plan with respect to EPS was set at the high end of the Company's long-term EPS growth goal, and the maximum payout was set above the long-term EPS growth goal. The Company's strong performance against the EPS and cash flow goals in 2022 resulted in maximum level payouts for each measure.\n\n## CAP vs. Net Income\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCompensation Actually Paid to PEO (Fletcher)\n\nCompensation Actually Paid to PEO (Lauber)\n\nAvg Compensation Actually Paid for non-PEO NEOs\n\nNet Income\n\nCAP vs. Earnings Per Share\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCompensation Actually Paid to PEO (Fletcher)\n\nCompensation Actually Paid to PEO (Lauber)\n\nAvg Compensation Actually Paid for non-PEO NEOs\n\nEarnings Per Share",

The Board recommends a vote FOR each of the nominees. The twelve individuals will be elected as directors if the number of votes cast favoring such nominee's election exceeds the number of votes cast opposing that nominee's election. Presuming a quorum is present, shares not voted, whether by broker non-vote, abstention, or otherwise, have no effect on the outcome of this matter.\n\nProposal 2: Ratification of Deloitte & Touche LLP as Independent Auditors for 2023. The Board recommends a vote FOR this proposal. Ratification of the independent auditors requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast. Presuming a quorum is present, shares not voted, whether by abstention or otherwise, have no effect on the outcome of this matter.\n\nProposal 3: Advisory Vote to Establish the Frequency of \"Say-On-Pay\" Vote. The Board recommends a vote FOR the frequency of EVERY YEAR for future non-binding \"say-on-pay\" advisory votes. The frequency receiving the greatest number of votes - every year, every two years, or every three years  -  will be considered the frequency approved by stockholders. Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Board or the Company. The Compensation Committee will review the voting results and take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding the frequency of \"say-on-pay\" advisory votes on executive compensation.\n\nProposal 4: Advisory Vote to Approve Compensation of the Named Executive Officers, Commonly Referred to as a 'Say-onPay' Vote. The Board recommends a vote FOR this proposal. Approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation of the NEOs requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast. Presuming a quorum is present, shares not voted, whether by broker non-vote, abstention, or otherwise, have no effect on the outcome of this matter. Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Board or the Company. However, the Compensation Committee will review the voting results and take them into consideration when making future compensation decisions.\n\nThe Company is not aware of any other matters that will be voted on. If a matter does properly come before the 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the \"Meeting\"), the persons named as the proxies in the form of proxy will vote the proxy at their discretion.\n\n## VOTING INFORMATION\n\n## Who can vote?\n\nStockholders of record as of the close of business on February 23, 2023 (the 'Record Date') can vote. Each outstanding share of WEC Energy Group common stock is entitled to one vote upon each matter presented.\n\nA list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Meeting will be available for inspection by stockholders at 231 W. Michigan Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53203, prior to the Meeting. Please call us at 800-881-5882 to arrange to inspect the list. The list will also be available on the virtual meeting website during the Meeting for individuals logged into the Meeting as stockholders.\n\n## What is the difference between being a registered stockholder and a beneficial owner?\n\nRegistered Stockholder: If on the Record Date, your shares were registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, then you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares. There are several ways for you to vote your shares or submit your proxy, as detailed below under 'How do I vote?'.",

        "page_content": "Beneficial Owner: If on the Record Date, your shares were held in an account with a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee, then you are the beneficial owner of the shares, and those shares are considered to be held in 'street name.' Your brokerage, bank or other nominee is considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker or bank on how to vote the shares held in your account as explained below under 'How do I vote?'. Your broker, bank or other nominee is permitted to vote your shares in the ratification of the independent auditors even if it does not receive voting instructions from you. However, for matters considered non-routine, which includes proposals 1, 3 and 4, your broker, bank or other nominee will not be permitted to vote your shares unless you submit your voting instruction form to your broker, bank or other nominee. Alternatively, you may vote during the Meeting only if you registered in advance with Computershare to attend the Meeting, as described below under the heading \"How do I register in advance to participate in the Meeting?'.\n\n## How do I vote?\n\nRegistered Stockholder: If you are a registered stockholder, there are several ways for you to vote your shares or submit your proxy:\n\nBy Internet before the Meeting . The Company encourages you to vote this way. Please visit www.envisionreports.com/WEC and follow the instructions on the secure site.\n\nBy Internet during the Meeting . You may vote your shares online during the Meeting by following the instructions provided on the meeting website: www.meetnow.global/MPNLAWV. Even if you plan to attend the virtual Meeting, we recommend that you vote by Internet, phone or mail before the Meeting.\n\nBy phone. In the U.S. or Canada you can vote your shares toll-free by calling 1-800-652-8683.\n\nBy mail. You can vote by completing, signing and dating each proxy card received and returning it in the prepaid envelope. Sign your name exactly as it appears on the proxy card.\n\nBeneficial Owner: Follow the voting instructions you receive from your broker, bank or other nominee. If you would like to be able to vote during the Meeting, you must register with Computershare in advance. See the heading titled 'How do I register in advance to participate in the Meeting?' for more information.\n\nSpecial Instructions for Shares Held in the Company's Stock Plus Plan and ESOP Fund. If you are a participant in WEC Energy Group's Stock Plus Investment Plan (\"Stock Plus\") or own shares through investments in the WEC Energy Group Common Stock ESOP Fund in any of WEC Energy Group's 401(k) plans, your proxy will serve as voting instructions for your shares held in those plans. The administrator for Stock Plus and the trustee for WEC Energy Group's 401(k) plans will vote your shares as you direct. If a proxy is not returned for shares held in Stock Plus, the administrator will not vote those shares. If a proxy is not returned for shares held in WEC Energy Group's 401(k) plans, the trustee will vote those shares in the same proportion that all shares in the WEC Energy Group Common Stock ESOP Fund in each respective 401(k) plan, for which voting instructions have been received, are voted.\n\n## Can I change my vote?\n\nRegistered Stockholder: You may change your vote or revoke your proxy by any of the following methods:\n\n- \u00b7 Entering a new vote by Internet or phone before the polls close;\n- \u00b7 Returning a later-dated proxy card that is received prior to the Meeting;\n- \u00b7 Entering a new vote online during the Meeting before the polls close; or\n- \u00b7 Notifying WEC Energy Group's Corporate Secretary by written revocation letter that is received prior to the Meeting. Any revocation should be filed with the Corporate Secretary, Margaret C. Kelsey, at WEC Energy Group's principal business office, PO Box 1331, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53201.\n\nBeneficial Owner: You may submit new voting instructions by contacting your broker, bank, or other nominee. You may also change your vote or revoke your voting instructions during the Meeting if you registered in advance with Computershare to participate in the Meeting. See the sub-heading titled 'How do I register in advance to participate in the Meeting?' under \"Annual Meeting Attendance\" for more information.\n\n## What does it mean if I get more than one Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials (the 'Notice'), proxy card, or voting instruction form?\n\nIt means your shares are held in more than one stock account. For each Notice you receive, please enter your vote on the Internet for each control number you have been assigned. If you receive paper copies of proxy materials, please provide voting instructions for all proxy cards and voting instruction forms you receive.\n\n## What constitutes a quorum?\n\nAs of the Record Date, there were 315,434,531 shares of WEC Energy Group common stock outstanding. In order to conduct the Meeting, a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote must be represented virtually or by proxy. This is known as a 'quorum.' Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as 'present' for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. Shares voted by a broker, bank, or other nominee who has discretionary voting power and exercises such discretion to vote your shares on a proposal where you did not provide voting instructions are known as 'broker non-votes.'\n\n## Who conducts the proxy solicitation?\n\nThe Board is soliciting these proxies. WEC Energy Group will bear the cost of the solicitation of proxies. The Company contemplates that proxies will be solicited principally through the use of the mail, but employees of WEC Energy Group or our subsidiaries may solicit proxies by phone, personally, or by other communications, without compensation apart from their normal salaries. WEC Energy Group has retained Morrow Sodali LLC to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of $23,000 plus reimbursement of expenses. WEC Energy Group will also reimburse brokers, banks, and other nominees for forwarding proxy materials to beneficial stockholders.",

SEC filings are available under the \"Investors\" section on the Company's website at www.wecenergygroup.com.\n\n## ACCESS TO PROXY MATERIALS\n\n## Why did I receive a separate Notice instead of printed proxy materials?\n\nPursuant to rules adopted by the SEC, we are providing access to our proxy materials over the Internet. Accordingly, we began mailing a separate Notice to stockholders on or about March 23, 2023, instead of a full set of our printed proxy materials. The Notice is not a proxy card and cannot be used to vote your shares. However, the Notice includes instructions on how to access our proxy materials online and vote your shares.\n\nIf you are a registered stockholder, you may request a printed set of proxy materials by (1) logging on to www.envisionreports.com/WEC and following the applicable instructions, (2) calling 866-641-4276, or (3) sending an email requesting a paper copy of current meeting materials to investorvote@computershare.com with \"Proxy Materials WEC Energy Group\" in the subject line and include your full name and address plus the number located in the shaded bar on the Notice.\n\nIf you are a beneficial owner, please refer to the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee on how to access our proxy materials and vote.\n\nWhat practices may stockholders follow that are friendly to the environment and help reduce printing and postage costs? Stockholders may wish to participate in the following:\n\n- \u00b7 View the following documents online at www.envisionreports.com/WEC\n- \u00b7 Notice of Annual Meeting\n- \u00b7 Proxy Statement\n- \u00b7 2022 Annual Report\n- \u00b7 Form of Proxy\n- \u00b7 Vote your proxy by phone or Internet. Page P-4\n- \u00b7 Choose to receive future proxy materials and annual reports electronically instead of receiving paper copies. If you are a registered stockholder and received a paper copy of our proxy materials or a paper notice this year, you may elect to receive access to future copies of these documents and other stockholder communications (e.g., investment plan statements, tax documents, and more) electronically by (1) following the instructions when voting by Internet or by phone, or (2) registering for our eDelivery paperless communication program. If you are a beneficial owner, please refer to the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee on how to elect to receive online access to our future proxy materials and annual reports.\n- \u00b7 Choose our eDelivery paperless communication program for all your stockholder needs. Electronic distribution gives stockholders faster delivery of account documents and saves the Company and our stockholders the cost of printing and mailing these materials. eDelivery also provides you with fast and secure 24/7 online access to proxy materials, investment plan statements, tax documents, and more. You may access your registered stockholder account and sign up for eDelivery at www.computershare.com/investor.\n- \u00b7 Sign up for Householding. 'Householding' is a delivery method that allows for only one paper copy of the Annual Report and Proxy Statement to be delivered to stockholders who reside at the same address. If you are a registered stockholder and received multiple paper copies of the Annual Report and Proxy Statement, you may wish to contact the Company's transfer agent, Computershare, at 800-558-9663, to request householding, or you may provide written instructions to WEC Energy Group, c/o Computershare, PO Box 43078, Providence, RI 02940-3078. If you wish to receive separate copies of the Annual Report and Proxy Statement now or in the future, or to discontinue householding entirely, you may contact Computershare using the contact information provided above. Upon request, the Company will promptly send a separate copy of the document. Whether or not a stockholder is householding, each stockholder will continue to receive a proxy card. If your shares are held through a bank, broker, or other holder of record, you may request householding by contacting the holder of record.\n\n## ANNUAL MEETING ATTENDANCE\n\n## What is the date, time and place of the Meeting?\n\nThe Meeting will be held at 1:30 p.m. Central time on Thursday, May 4, 2023.
