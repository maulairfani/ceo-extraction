        "page_content": "## Chair's statement\n\n## Right action. Right now.\n\nA year of unprecedented challenge in the global energy markets has cemented the role that SSE and other energy providers must play in providing long-term solutions to the challenges of national energy security, affordability and climate change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe actions SSE is taking now will be part of the foundation of a transformed energy system aligned to the sector's 1.5\u00b0C global warming pathway - one that is cleaner, more affordable and more secure. In support of those goals we are accelerating renewables, transforming electricity networks, providing vital flexible generation back-up, and working hard to ensure no-one is left behind along the way.\n\n## Responding to uncertainty\n\nThe war in Ukraine exposed Western Europe's dependency on imported gas. The resulting market volatility and energy price spikes have rightly made policy makers and energy providers the subject of intense scrutiny and public discourse.\n\nOur response has been unambiguous, focusing our efforts on where we can make the biggest difference. By investing record amounts - in excess of profits in critical national infrastructure we are helping to address the causes rather than the symptoms of the energy crisis.\n\nAs this Strategic Report shows, we have successfully navigated the challenges that came with turbulent markets and unfavourable weather, and engaged constructively with policy makers to ensure that we can continue to fulfil our purpose, and generate value for our shareholders and society more widely.\n\n## The people driving our delivery\n\nNone of our objectives or outcomes are possible without the dedication and hard work of our people. The executive team and our highly capable and committed employees and contractors have delivered strong operational and financial performance in a challenging year, and on behalf of the Board I thank them all for their efforts.\n\nI'd also like to express my personal gratitude to our outgoing Finance Director, Gregor Alexander, who leaves us in December after more than 20 years' excellent financial stewardship of the Company. He should be very proud - not only of what he has achieved during his time at SSE - but of the strong position in which he leaves us.\n\nWe are losing one of the FTSE's finest FDs but after a rigorous selection process we have a highly capable successor in Barry O'Regan. Barry has been integral to SSE's growth story for many years now, particularly in terms of the reshaping of the Group, and we all look forward to working with him through the transition.\n\nDirectors' Report\n\n'None of our objectives or outcomes are possible without the dedication and hard work of our workforce. The executive team and our highly capable and committed employees and contractors have delivered strong operational and financial performance in a challenging year, and on behalf of the Board I thank them all for their efforts.'\n\nEngagement with SSE colleagues was a feature of the 2022/23 Board agenda and I was particularly pleased that we were able to use the time after the main business of the AGM to meet a number of employees face-to-face and more than 3,500 in a virtual townhall setting to discuss the Board's commitment to ensuring SSE offers a truly safe and inclusive workplace.\n\nGetting everyone who works for SSE home safe at the end of each working day has always been our top priority, but it has been a difficult year. The devastating death in June of Liam Macdonald, a young contractor working on Shetland, has caused us to refocus our efforts. A new contractor safety team has been established to ensure our partners are supported and performance is closely monitored across all our large capital projects (See pages 63 and 162 \uf150 ).\n\n## Right strategy at the right time\n\nWith SSE's opportunities for growth defined by the imperative to decarbonise power sectors at home and abroad, our Net Zero Transition Plan spells out how we will remove greenhouse gas emissions from our own operations, supported by a process for accountability with an annual shareholder 'say on climate' resolution.\n\nWe welcomed the overwhelming support given to our first AGM vote on SSE's Net Zero Transition Report in July 2022.\n\nSince then, record levels of investment and the sale of a minority stake in our transmission business have provided the platform for us to push ahead with large capital projects, grow our development pipeline both at home and abroad, and implement ambitious business plans in our regulated networks businesses.\n\nHowever, we have always been clear that our Net Zero Acceleration Programme (NZAP) was just the start of our ambitions.\n\nThe opportunities and options for SSE to deploy its capabilities and resources have grown substantially since the programme launch in November 2021.\n\nWe have since refreshed the programme with the launch of a more stretching 'NZAP Plus' which includes plans for \u00a318bn of investment out to 2027.\n\nThese revised plans, in the context of SSE's Net Zero Transition Plan, reflect the continuing strength of our business model and balance sheet, the urgency of climate action and the wealth of opportunities presented to us by the transition to net zero and the encouraging economic and policy tailwinds we see for the sector.\n\n## Going further, and faster\n\nWe are proud of the progress we are making with a strategy that, over the medium term, will help to address the dilemmas of affordability, environment and security of energy provision.\n\nWe are working with governments to create policy frameworks which will accelerate investment into much needed infrastructure, and bring forward longterm solutions for energy users, the environment, and society generally.\n\nAs a long-standing Fair Tax-accredited company, we are committed to paying the right amount of tax, in the right place, at the right time. And we recognise that taxing extraordinary profits is reasonable where those profits are actually realised. But the bigger prize will be the fruits of large-scale investment in clean energy, so the overall investment climate remains important.\n\nThe UK has enjoyed a leading position in the flows of green capital over the past decade as a result of world-leading policy making and a stable investment climate. Others are now seeking to overtake, with the US Inflation Reduction Act and the EU's Net Zero Industrial Plan.\n\nThe UK Review of Electricity Markets Arrangement (REMA) and other policy interventions offer an opportunity to put the UK back at the leading edge and ensure investment can be accelerated throughout the value chain. SSE stands ready to assist in that development.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\n## Leaving no-one behind\n\nA truly just transition to net zero will leave no-one behind and that means bringing our stakeholders with us. SSE was an early adopter of the principles of a just transition and we recognise that continued consensus in favour of net zero will, in part, depend on the fairness, perceived and experienced, of the way in which the costs and benefits of climate action are distributed.\n\nIt will require actions as well as words and we will continue to take tangible steps, for example, by recruiting people from high-carbon industries as part of the expected intake of the 1,000-plus new jobs we expect to create each year.\n\nBusinesses like SSE do not operate in isolation. We create value for society and provide the critical infrastructure needed for a prosperous economy. And by doing this in a sustainable way, we secure the right to earn a profit.\n\nIt forms a social contract that underpins a culture of 'doing the right thing' and inspires a leadership position on transparency and disclosure that makes us accountable to all of our stakeholders for our decision-making and actions.\n\nA key objective of this Strategic Report and the associated Section 172 Statement (See page 26 \uf150 ) is to build on disclosures we have provided in recent years and reflect on the work being done to promote SSE's long-term success. Both reports are approved by the Board in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and we welcome comments on the matters covered within the following pages.\n\nSir John Manzoni Chair, SSE plc 23 May 2023\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Chief Executive's review\n\n## Raising the bar on net zero.\n\nThe first full year of SSE's Net Zero Acceleration Programme will be remembered as a period of strategic gains and financial and operational progress in a shifting and uncertain energy landscape.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOver the past year we have continued to create value for our shareholders and society by investing more than we make in profits in the crucial renewables, networks and flexible energy assets needed to unlock a cleaner, more secure and more affordable energy system. We delivered record capital investment, exceeding \u00a32.8bn including acquisitions. I am proud of what has been achieved in a shifting and uncertain energy landscape, with the strength of our balanced business mix and the quality of our people and assets shining through.\n\nThere is no doubt that the year also brought its challenges. But progress made in the face of exceptional macro-economic conditions, government intervention in energy markets and the continued impact of the war in Ukraine gives us immense confidence in our strategic direction and optimism about meeting our ambitious 2030 Goals. (See pages 22 to 23 \uf150 ).\n\nWe have always said our Net Zero Acceleration Programme (NZAP) represents the floor, not the ceiling, of our ambitions. Backed by excellent growth options and strong financial performance, we are well placed to explore further investments to support an accelerated transition to net zero with the revised 'NZAP Plus' we announced in May 2023.\n\n## Commitment and resilience\n\nIn volatile times SSE continues to be resilient thanks to our very deliberate mix of market-based and economically regulated businesses, world class assets, natural hedges, balance sheet strength and, above everything else, the quality of our people.\n\nThe nature of our business means everyone at SSE has been keenly aware of, but not immune to, the inflationary pressure of high energy prices in the past year. With this in mind we introduced a number of measures, including bringing forward a proportion of the 2023 pay settlement, to ease the burden on employees over winter. We also know difficult times bring emotional pressures too, and I'm pleased that we have taken what we learned from Covid-19 and continued to improve the mental health and wellbeing support we offer colleagues.\n\nOn behalf of the executive team, I would like to thank all SSE's direct employees and contractors - not just for their achievements in 2022/23 - but for their unremitting passion, commitment and dedication to our purpose of building a better world of energy.\n\nNo matter their role, getting everyone who works for SSE home safe at the end of each day remains our number one priority and that focus is all the keener following the\n\nDirectors' Report\n\n'Backed by excellent growth options and strong financial performance, we are well placed to explore further investments to support an accelerated transition to net zero with the revised 'NZAP Plus' we announced in May 2023.'\n\ntragic death of Liam Macdonald on Shetland in June 2022. As our operational activities increase so too does our focus on delivering industry leading safety programmes with our partners. (See pages 63 and 162 \uf150 ).\n\n## Clean, secure, affordable energy\n\nIn 2019, we took the decision to align to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with four core associated 2030 Goals. The NZAP Plus sets the pathway for SSE to meet those broad goals in 2030. Recognising that decarbonisation represents a radical economic transformation affecting all sectors of society, we continue to advance the case for a just energy transition.\n\nAs events of the last year have shown, accelerating the energy transition is not only a moral imperative in the context of the climate emergency, but is also central to securing a reliable and affordable energy supply. For the electricity system, there is no trade-off between our climate ambitions and consumer costs or maintaining security of supply. And, by investing in energy independence, SSE is simultaneously tackling the crises of energy affordability and security, as well as climate change.\n\nAs a business, we remain committed to further reducing the system's reliance on imported fossil fuels by reinvesting additional profits in the accelerated deployment of crucial renewable, flexibility and network infrastructure. By doing so, we are creating lasting value for SSE's stakeholders, and society as a whole.\n\n## Delivering record investment\n\nThe NZAP Plus is the platform to achieve these aims, giving us a pathway to invest \u00a338bn in GB and Ireland by the end of the decade. SSE is on course to deliver 20% of both the electricity networks and offshore wind needed to meet the UK's net zero targets for 2030. And opportunities associated with net zero continue to accelerate across the value chain, not least in SSE's networks businesses.\n\nOfgem's Accelerated Strategic Transmission Investment (ASTI) framework announcement clears the way for SSEN Transmission to build the assets required to support 50GW of offshore wind by 2030 and SSEN Distribution is set to implement a \u00a33.6bn RIIO-ED2 business plan agreed with Ofgem.\n\nThe final RIIO-ED2 determination sees baseline allowances for SSEN Distribution increasing by \u00a3300m from draft determinations, representing a 22% increase in allowed expenditure compared to an equivalent period in RIIO-ED1.\n\nWhile the original NZAP assumed a 25% minority stake sale in SSEN Distribution, we consistently review our options and direction and the NZAP Plus plan now reflects the decision that retaining 100% of the business is the right strategy at this time.\n\n## A year of milestones\n\nThe first full year of the NZAP was packed full of milestones on our flagship projects whilst the size and diversity of our development pipeline continues to grow.\n\nSSE Renewables achieved first power at the 1,075MW Seagreen offshore wind project and made significant progress on Dogger Bank, the world's largest offshore wind farm, including the opening of the O&M base in Tyneside. The UK's most productive onshore wind farm by output, Viking, remains on track for operation in 2024. The pipleline grew and further diversified too, with the acquisition of SGRE's onshore development platform in Southern Europe.\n\nIt was also a particularly strong year for our thermal business, which officially welcomed Keadby 2 into the fleet with commercial operations at Europe's most efficient CCGT commencing in March 2023. SSE Thermal's portfolio was further bolstered by the acquisition of 1.3GW Triton Power with Equinor, which holds significant CCS and hydrogen potential and has already created value for the Group.\n\nIn networks, SSEN Transmission oversaw the laying of the Shetland HVDC link, which is on course to connect the islands to the GB energy system for the first time in 2024, while our distribution business delivered against a vast range of projects in both the north and south network regions during the final year of RIIO-ED1.\n\nSSEN Distribution continued to embed learnings from our Storm Arwen review and action plan, rolling out new processes and procedures in the Shetland ice storm in December 2022 and Storm Otto in February 2023. An improvement in storm\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nresponses, and consistent 'above and beyond' levels of service, received plaudits from the government, customers and other stakeholders.\n\n## Options for strategic growth\n\nEnabled by record levels of investment in 2022/23 and the sale of a minority stake in our transmission business, we have confidence in our ability to go even further, faster. With renewables opportunities such as Coire Glas, Berwick Bank and Ossian (ScotWind), Regulated Asset Value growth in our networks businesses, alongside developments in CCS, hydrogen, solar and battery technologies, we are creating substantial growth options in the near and medium term.\n\nAnd as we explore opportunities to grow at home, we are also building our capabilities abroad, by exporting our renewables expertise to Southern Europe and Japan. Completion of the Southern European development acquisition this year helped drive SSE's secured pipeline up from 10GW to nearly 14GW with significant future prospects even before upcoming auction processes.\n\n## An optimistic future\n\nTo close, our strategy looks even better one year on than it did at the end of 2021/22. It is our platform for delivery and growth, underpinned by a socially responsible purpose and a value-creating strategy, investing record amounts in clean, green energy infrastructure.\n\nHaving navigated the choppy waters of market and policy uncertainty this year, SSE has emerged with an even clearer vision of the role we must continue to play in developing and building the energy system of the future.\n\nFor there is no doubt that, in our people, businesses and assets, we hold an important part of the long-term solution to the energy crisis in our hands. And, as we enter 2023/24, we do so emboldened in our pursuit of an energy system that is cleaner, more secure and more affordable.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlistair Phillips-Davies Chief Executive, SSE plc 23 May 2023",

        "page_content": "## Sector review\n\n## Navigating through instability\n\n2022/23 saw deepening economic uncertainty around the world as the post-pandemic energy crisis was exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Soaring energy prices principally driven by the cost of international gas contributed to high inflation in economies throughout the world. The following pages set out how SSE has responded to the opportunities and risks emerging from a rapidly shifting energy sector landscape.\n\n## Households squeezed as impact of war reverberates across Europe\n\nThe cost of living crisis in 2022/23 further underlined the importance of continued investment in homegrown sources of energy to reduce national exposure to external global forces.\n\nSimultaneously, governments across Europe and the world looked to recalibrate and expedite their renewable energy ambitions. In tandem with government policy, SSE continues to take direct aim at the long-term causes of the current crisis by investing billions in domestic low-carbon infrastructure.\n\nA prudent approach to hedging throughout the year also helped insulate the Group from the worst short-term commercial impacts of the market volatility.\n\nIn response to the cost pressures facing its customers, SSE spent much of the year working closely with policymakers to develop and embed government support schemes. SSE Airtricity established the largest customer support fund in Ireland, with provision for up to \u20ac25m in affordability funding, before later giving each customer a \u20ac35 rebate to honour its commitment to not making a profit in 2022/23. Meanwhile, SSE Business Energy applied customer discounts to the value of \u00a3721m in the year under the UK Government's Energy Bill Relief Scheme.\n\nThe cost of living is directly linked to SSE's exposure to the Principal Risk of Energy Affordability - details of how this is mitigated are on page 73 \uf150 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Energy security tops the political agenda\n\nThe year saw bold targets and aggressive policy action to bolster domestic energy security as governments set their sights on tackling the energy crisis. The last 12 months put on stark display the importance of clean, affordable, homegrown energy as the solution to countries' reliance on volatile and expensive international gas markets. Wholesale prices at times in 2022 were up to ten times higher than they were in 2021.\n\nCross-party political consensus crystalised around the importance of rapidly rolling out low-carbon technologies such as wind, CCS, hydrogen, solar, battery and hydro, while urgently accelerating the buildout of enabling networks. Ofgem's Accelerated Strategic Transmission Investment framework announcement in December 2022 saw SSEN Transmission given the green light to take forward four further subsea HVDC links; a number of new 400kV reinforcement projects and a 400kV upgrade to the existing BeaulyDenny line to unlock the rapid growth of power generation in the North of Scotland.\n\nConcurrently, the year saw political attention in the UK and further afield focus even more acutely on the need to accelerate low-carbon infrastructure deployment; not only to increase energy security, but as a force for social and economic good to bring jobs, skills, and growth to regional heartlands that need it most.\n\nAnalysis from SSE Thermal shows its Keadby Carbon Capture project, which in December 2022 became the first and only consented CCS plant in the UK, has the potential to bring \u00a3470m regional Gross Value Added and 7,300 years of combined work by all employees over the lifetime of the asset.\n\nEnergy Infrastructure Failure is one of SSE's Group Principal Risks, for further details on how this is managed please see page 74 \uf150 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Market intervention in unprecedented times\n\nWith the cost of electricity rising substantially in 2022/23, governments faced exceptional fiscal pressures to address high energy bills and the impact of the broader cost of living crisis. In response to the crisis, a raft of proposals to intervene in energy markets were considered with the aim of tackling bills in the immediate term. Throughout the year industry worked constructively with policymakers to navigate the crisis and engage on the range of potential options under consideration.\n\nAs a Fair Tax Mark accredited company, SSE supported the principle of the Electricity Generator Levy (EGL) in the UK and the wholesale electricity revenue cap in the EU to ensure that an appropriate amount of additional tax is paid where extraordinary earnings are realised in the midst of a crisis. Collectively, the industry worked closely with UK, Irish and EU officials through the consultative process with a view to ensuring that the design of\n\nthe mechanisms achieved these aims whilst protecting against unintended consequences for security of supply and investor confidence.\n\nOngoing dialogue continues to focus on the need to ensure the impacts of intervention do not interfere with the industry's ability to deliver record levels of investment to address the underlying causes of the energy crisis. The European Union's strong signal on the time-limited nature of the revenue cap was therefore welcomed by industry, while the UK Government has recognised the future of the EGL must be considered in the context of protecting investor confidence.\n\nSSE's Principal Risks of Energy Affordability and Political and Regulatory Change are interconnected. See pages 73 and 76 \uf150 for details of how SSE's manages its exposure to these risks.",

        "page_content": "## International competition heats up\n\nThe momentum behind efforts to decarbonise is fuelling international competition for flows of green capital. Governments around the world have joined the race to attract inward green investment, including the US's Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Passed by Congress in 2022, it introduces generous and unlimited tax credits for clean energy investments. The scope and scale of the legislation is beyond anything seen before, amounting to over $250bn in public support for new energy projects in the coming years.\n\nIn response, other jurisdictions raced to send unambiguously positive messages to investors, with the European Commission instituting a wide-ranging scheme of its own. The REPowerEU programme seeks to ramp up the bloc's domestic renewable energy generation capacity to 1,236GW by 2030. This was positive news for SSE's recently acquired Southern European development platform which already offers a secured pipeline of 2.2GW with additional future prospects.\n\nGreater choice for investors, combined with attractive support packages around the world, put the onus on the UK to respond, keep capital flowing and retain its leadership position on low-carbon energy. March's Powering up Britain plan set out an initial slew of policy pledges and green funding, with the Chancellor earmarking a further announcement in the Autumn Statement to maintain the country's relative attractiveness in an increasingly competitive global investment climate.\n\nFor more details on how SSE mitigates its exposures to its Principal Risks of Climate Change and Speed of Change please see pages 72 and 77 \uf150 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supply chains tested as costs climb\n\nAs global demand for low-carbon projects exponentially grows, so too must the supply chain to deliver it. In the next seven years, the UK alone is targeting more than 100GW of renewables capacity. Like other industries that have experienced high growth, the massive expansion of projects to date is already putting pressure on supply chains - with significant demand growth still to come.\n\nOver the last 12 months, capital costs for low-carbon generation projects have risen on average between 20% and 30%, with asset costs in some cases exceeding 50%. These cost increases are due to several factors linked to the supply chain as well as inflation in construction costs, commodity price increases and interest rate hikes.\n\nAfter decades of driving down costs, in the case of offshore wind from \u00a3140/MWh to less than \u00a340/MWh, a clear inflection point was reached in 2022/23. Industry and government are beginning to think differently about procuring renewables with a focus on value and deliverability, not simply cost. The UK, like other countries, will need to build all its projects\n\nif it is to meet its energy security and net zero targets; a race to the bottom on costs risks projects not being built and supply chain investments going elsewhere.\n\nAt the same time, history shows that the costs and benefits of such radical transitions are not distributed fairly without careful planning and there is an important role for government working alongside the private sector.\n\nA joined-up, collaborative approach between government, industry and society is required in 2023/24 and beyond to build sustainable homegrown supply chains to service growth in demand and unlock economic opportunity in all regions.\n\nSupply chain pressures influence SSE's exposure to its Principal Risk of Large Capital Projects Management. See page 75 \uf150 .\n\n## Global opportunities emerge as net zero resolve hardens\n\nCOP27 may have concluded with the target of 1.5\u00b0C in critical condition, but the global commitment to renewable energy is stronger than ever.\n\nThe message from Sharm el Sheikh was clear: the energy sector must lead the way this decade to keep 1.5\u00b0C alive. As it did in Glasgow, SSE played its part on the world stage, once again making the case for the decarbonisation of the energy system to go further, faster.\n\nMeeting the objectives of the Paris Agreement calls for us to halve global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 just seven years to replace swathes of high-emission technologies with low-\n\ncarbon alternatives. In terms of energy, this means leaving behind a traditional system designed around fossil fuels and installing a new one - as fast as we can.\n\nAiming for 61% of total electricity generation to come from renewables by 2030, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that renewable energy capacity will have to triple, with a huge chunk of this growth to come from wind, solar and hydro. Beyond the installation of renewable power, this also means installing transmission lines, building local smart grids and electricity storage, and rolling out technologies that enable system flexibility.\n\nClimate Change remains a Principal Risk for SSE. For further details on how this is managed, see page 72 \uf150 .\n\n## SSE's place in the future energy world\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more detail on the work SSE is doing to meet the challenges of the energy sector of tomorrow, go to www.sse.com/annualreport2023/ \uf295 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Adapting to extreme weather events\n\nAs the world adapts to more extreme weather patterns associated with climate change the energy sector finds itself on the front line. Changes in rainfall and wind patterns are felt right across the SSE Group, with lower levels of wind impacting SSE Renewables' output for the second year running in 2022/23.\n\nProlonged spells of still, dry weather conditions in winter tested the resilience of Europe's energy system to the full, while several weather events this year caused significant damage to parts of SSEN's network in the North of Scotland. SSE has established crisis management measures to mitigate against the impact of severe weather events on critical national infrastructure and employs meteorological expertise to forecast weather events.\n\nSSE's forecasting allows it to mobilise operational teams in advance of major events, while informing trading positions taken by the Energy Portfolio Management business and purchasing decisions made by SSE's Procurement team. Climate adaptation strategies have become an increasingly important aspect of government and business decisionmaking. For SSE, boosting weather resilience and assessing climate adaptation requirements are essential to the ongoing resilience of all its operational businesses.\n\nExtreme weather influences SSE's exposure to its Principal Risks of Energy Infrastructure Failure and Portfolio Exposure.

The world's deepest fixedbottom offshore wind farm, it achieved first power in August 2022 and is due for completion in summer 2023.\n\nOnshore, Viking wind farm (443MW) on Shetland passed a number of milestones in the past year, with 70km of access tracks completed, all 103 bases installed and the first of the turbines installed in April 2023.\n\nFlexible thermal generation plant like SSE's Keadby 2 power combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT) station in North Lincolnshire will also be needed to meet net zero ambitions.\n\nAfter four-and-a-half years in construction, Keadby 2 entered commercial operation in March 2023. Fitted with a Siemens Energy 9000HL 50Hz turbine, Keadby 2 is the most efficient CCGT plant of its type in Europe and work is already under way exploring the potential for hydrogen blending at the plant.\n\nThe wellbeing of those working on SSE's large capital projects continues to be a key focus, with measures taken at Group level in early 2023 to improve the support given to contracting partners and monitor safety on construction sites.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Pursuing opportunities at home and abroad\n\nThe UK is currently one of the world's leading offshore wind markets, but international momentum behind net zero means favourable policy environments exist in other jurisdictions where SSE Renewables can deploy its developer capability.\n\nThe acquisition of a Southern European development platform in 2022 increased SSE's secured pipeline from 11GW to around 14GW.\n\nThe platform has 3.8GW of onshore wind pipeline and prospects and a further 1.4GW of hybridisation potential in co-located solar across Spain, France, Italy and Greece. Around 2.4GW is secured pipeline in Southern Europe, with material land or permitting rights and construction scheduled to get under way on projects in France and Spain in Summer 2023.\n\n## A framework for transmission growth\n\nSSEN Transmission operates one of the fastest growing regulated electricity networks in Europe. The second year of RIIO-T2 saw delivery milestones on the Shetland HVDC (see separate case study) and SF 6 -free Kintore substation projects.\n\nProgress was also made through Ofgem's Uncertainty Mechanism on additional investments in an East Coast HVDC link, Argyll reinforcement works and a Skye link.\n\nLooking further out, and subject to the right generator commitments and planning and Ofgem approvals, the business expects gross Regulated Asset Value to exceed \u00a315bn by FY31.\n\nThis projection is based on confidence provided by Ofgem's Accelerated Strategic Transmission Investment framework and its updated Holistic Network Design, which recognise the need for significant networks investment to meet the UK's ambition for 50GW of offshore wind by 2030.\n\nIn Japan, the SSE-Pacifico platform is preparing projects for offshore auctions in a market with huge potential whilst in Northern Europe and the US, SSE is working with local partners to gear up for future auctions.\n\nCloser to home, Coire Glas, a pumped storage hydro project that has long been on the drawing board awaiting a supportive policy environment for long-duration electricity storage, moved a step closer to reality in March 2022 with a commitment by SSE to \u00a3100m of exploratory work. The project, which received planning consent from the Scottish Government in 2020, would more than double Britain's total current electricity storage capacity. Subject to good development progress and prevailing policy, SSE hopes to make a final investment decision in 2024.\n\nThe ASTI announcement in December 2022 means SSEN Transmission can now take forward four further subsea HVDC links; a number of new 400kV reinforcement projects and a 400kV upgrade to the existing Beauly-Denny line.\n\nAt the same time, it is vital to recognise the importance of effective engagement with communities as this transformational infrastructure roll-out progresses.\n\nSSEN Transmission is therefore working closely with impacted communities and other local stakeholders to ensure their views are heard and factored into decision making.\n\nThis growth trajectory is underpinned by the proceeds of a minority 25% stake sale in SSEN Transmission in November 2022, which unlocked the premium value in the business and helped rebalance SSE's mix of regulated and market-based revenue streams.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The project also requires a 320/132kV substation and HVDC convertor station at Upper Kergord and an HVDC switching station at Noss Head in Caithness to connect to the mainland.\n\nThe first 100km of cable was successfully installed in July 2022 by a specialist vessel, the NKT Victoria. A further 60km was laid in March 2023 and the remainder will be in place in the North Sea later this year, completing the full subsea link.\n\nOn track for completion by Summer 2024, the link will enable 600MW of clean, renewable electricity generation to connect - including Viking Energy Wind Farm.\n\nThe proposal for Orkney would enable the connection of up to 220MW of new renewables and consists of a new substation at Finstown and around 57km of subsea cable connecting at Dounreay in Caithness.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Powering communities through RIIO-ED2\n\nThe RIIO-ED2 regulatory price control for 2023-2028 is an important step on the road to net zero and throughout the past year SSEN Distribution worked to reach a settlement that balances the needs of customers and the environment.\n\nThe Final Determination published by Ofgem on 30 November 2022 quantified the outputs that need to be delivered and the funding (allowances) SSEN Distribution is provided to do so.\n\nThe resulting \u00a33.6bn RIIO-ED2 business plan sees baseline allowances increasing by \u00a3300m from the Draft Determinations, representing a 22% increase in allowed expenditure compared to an equivalent period in RIIO-ED1.\n\nThe business plan was stakeholder-led, with more than 25,000 people having a say in its development. It opens the way for significant investment in the local\n\nnetwork infrastructure that will accelerate decarbonisation of streets and homes; improve reliability and services for customers; and build the smart, flexible network of the future.\n\nWhile the original plan contained 64 outputs, the Final Determination reduced the funding in the core plan by around 12%. This required a recalibration of what the business can deliver and further extensive engagement with affected stakeholders on the likely impacts.\n\nThis follow-up engagement included detail of Uncertainty Mechanisms (UMs) that will enable SSEN Distribution to further invest in the network to facilitate growing net zero ambitions.\n\n## Backing up the energy system of tomorrow\n\nSSE recognises that more than just renewables will be needed in the transition to net zero. It is pursuing carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and battery technologies to provide much-needed system flexibility.\n\nSSE Thermal is working with partners in low-carbon industrial clusters in the Humber and the northeast of Scotland to bring forward a range of projects that can provide crucial system back up.\n\nKeadby 3 Carbon Capture Power Station in the Humber was the first CCS power plant project in the country to receive planning permission. At the same site, development work is under way on Keadby Hydrogen Power Station, the world's first major 100% hydrogen-fired power station.\n\nThe neighbouring Aldbrough Hydrogen Pathfinder project will unite hydrogen production, storage and power generation in one location by the middle of the decade. The project moved a step closer to fruition when it secured UK Government backing through its Net Zero Hydrogen Fund.\n\nAnd the proposed Aldbrough Hydrogen Storage Facility, one of the largest of its kind, could be in operation by early 2028. In Aberdeenshire, SSE Thermal is working\n\nwith Equinor to develop the low-carbon power station at Peterhead, with the plant potentially becoming Scotland's first flexible power station equipped with carbon capture technology.\n\nAlthough no power CCS projects in the Humber or Scotland were taken forward in the first phase of the UK's cluster sequencing process, in March the Government launched processes for both a track one expansion and track two, meaning there will be further opportunities ahead.\n\nSSE will also energise its first 50MW battery storage facility at Salisbury in September 2023 with construction also due to commence in July at its first 30MW solar project at Littleton.\n\nBoth projects in England are part of a near-2GW pipeline of solar and battery projects.

The imperative to accelerate action to deliver net zero was further heightened in 2023, as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published its 'final warning' on the climate crisis and the urgent action that needs to be taken in order to avoid irreversible damage from climate change.\n\nWith updated 2030 Goals in early 2022 reflecting an accelerated decarbonisation pathway, financial year 2022/23 was marked as a year of delivery. SSE continued to deliver on its net zero ambitions at pace, investing a record \u00a32.8bn in the first full year of its original 2021 to 2026 \u00a312.5bn Net Zero Acceleration Programme (NZAP).\n\n## Measures of progress\n\nReinforcing SSE's commitment to the achievement of its 2030 Goals, performance against them is linked to the long-term incentive element of executive remuneration. 2022/23 is the first year progress is measured against SSE's new, more stretching 2030 Goals announced in February 2022. A summary of this progress is outlined opposite, with more detail available in the Remuneration Committee's Report from page 166 \uf150 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore on page 35 \uf150\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cut carbon intensity by 80%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Increase renewable energy output fivefold\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChampion a fair and just energy transition\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Reduce Scope 1 carbon intensity by 80% by 2030, compared to 2017/18 levels, to 61gCO\u2082e/kWh.\n\nThe scope 1 GHG intensity of electricity generated remained relatively stable, falling by 2% between 2021/22 and 2022/23. Progress was made in renewables growth and in developing lower-carbon thermal generation options. While SSE Thermal's Keadby 3 Carbon Capture Power Station project was not progressed to the final stages of the UK Government's Cluster Sequencing Process, a similar development at Peterhead attracted the Government's 'Tier 2' status. Keadby 2 began commercial operations in March 2023, which is Europe's most efficient CCGT. SSE Thermal also secured 10-year capacity contracts - subject to planning permission and final investment decisions - for two new low-carbon power stations fuelled by sustainable biofuel in Ireland.\n\n## Build a renewable energy portfolio that generates at least 50TWh of renewable electricity a year by 2030.\n\nHaving experienced exceptionally still and dry conditions in the prior year, SSE's renewable generation volumes in 2022/23 rose by 7% but were 13% behind plan due to Seagreen project delays and unfavourable weather. SSE Renewables made progress with its key flagship projects. First power was achieved at the 1,075MW Seagreen offshore wind project (49% SSE stake) and progress was made on Dogger Bank offshore wind farm (3,600MW, 40% SSE stake). Onshore, the 443MW Viking wind farm was successful in securing a Contract for Difference (CfD) in July 2022 and construction has progressed well, with the first turbine successfully installed in April 2023.\n\nEnable at least 20GW of renewable generation and facilitate around 2 million EVs and 1 million heat pumps on SSEN's electricity networks by 2030.\n\nAt the end of 2022/23, there was just over 9GW of renewable capacity connected to SSEN Transmission's network, up from 7.9GW the previous year. In the same period, SSEN Distribution had around 208,500 pure electric vehicles or plug-in hybrid vehicles registered in its licence areas and had connected around 52,500 heat pumps to its networks. SSEN Distribution continued to progress several key innovation projects with partners to support flexible markets and future infrastructure provision for the mass adoption of electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nBe a global leader for the just transition to net zero, with a guarantee of fair work and commitment to paying fair tax and sharing economic value.\n\nOver 2022/23, SSE continued to drive action towards a just transition, publishing two new reports detailing its progress and thought leadership around the topic. SSE's commitment to fair tax was reaffirmed as it became the first company to transition from the Fair Tax Foundation's UK HQ Multinational accreditation to the Foundation's new Global Multinational Business Standard. SSE implemented the annual increase in the real Living Wage, which was brought forward by two months in recognition of the cost-of-living crisis, and continued to work towards rolling out its Living Hours commitment across its supply chain.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\n## 254gCO 2 e/ kWh\n\nScope 1 GHG intensity of electricity generated\n\n17%\n\nDecrease in Scope 1 GHG intensity of generated electricity from the 2017/18 baseline\n\n10.2TWh\n\nRenewable generation output 2022/23*\n\n2.6GW\n\nRenewable energy capacity in construction at 31 March 2023\n\n*  Includes pumped storage, biomass and constrained off wind in GB.\n\n>9GW\n\nRenewable generation capacity connected to SSEN Transmission network\n\nc.52,500\n\nHeat pumps connected to SSEN Distribution's network\n\nc.208,500\n\nPure electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles registered in SSEN Distribution's licence areas\n\n1 st year\n\nAccredited with the Fair Tax Foundation's new Global Multinational Business Standard\n\n10 th year\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUN SDG\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUN SDG\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOf being a real Living Wage accredited employer",

Through delivery of its strategy SSE fulfils an unwritten social contract, under which society provides human capital and the right to earn a profit and in return the Company safely and reliably provides energy, invests in critical infrastructure, creates jobs and contributes to GDP.\n\nCentral to this contract are SSE's key stakeholders; identified as the people, communities and organisations with an interest in its purpose, strategy, operations and actions and who may be affected by them. The relationship with key stakeholders is two-way and an overview of the reciprocal nature is set out in SSE's business model and across the pages 28 to 33 \uf150 .\n\nStrategic stakeholder engagement underpins the understanding of issues material to each group and includes a combination of business-led and Boardlevel interaction. This approach is reflective of legislative and regulatory requirements and is designed to ensure all views are heard. The result is stakeholder influence within, and validity of, business plans and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsupporting objectives. Situations will exist where not every stakeholder interest can be addressed in full, however stakeholder regard continues to the greatest extent possible in decision-making at every level. The framework set by the Board in which decision-making takes place is explained on page 124 \uf150 .\n\nThis statement, and the following stakeholder pages, summarise how the Board has upheld SSE's social contract through the discharge of its duties under Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006. In doing so, it promotes the long-term success of the Company for the benefit of SSE's six key stakeholder groups by considering:\n\n- (a) The likely consequences of any decision in the long term.\n- (b) The interests of the Company's employees.\n- (c) The need to foster the Company's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others.\n- (d) The impact of the Company's operations on the community and the environment.\n- (e) The desirability of the Company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct.\n- (f)  The need to act fairly between members of the Company.\n\nDetail of how s172 and stakeholder factors have influenced Board decisionmaking in the year can be found on pages 127 to 129 \uf150 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Considering long-term consequences s172 link (a)\n\nAs a long-term business, SSE's actions have far-reaching impact which is recognised in SSE's strategic approach of creating value for shareholders and society. Four 2030 Goals and a clear net zero-focused strategy frame decision-making, and provide important interim milestones to 2050. These parameters, set by the Board, are reflected within strategy work and objectives, which extends to: capital investment; the Group budget; dividend plans; and future resourcing requirements. SSE's Risk Management Framework, including the Group's Principal Risks, the identification of emerging risks and the Group's Risk Appetite statement further shape long-term perspectives.\n\n## Relevant S172(a) disclosures\n\nPages 8 to 9 \uf150 Board-agreed purpose, vision and strategy.

But it is possible to tackle climate change in a way that is unsustainable for people and nature. That is why, while SSE is wholly focused on finding the profitable solutions to the problem of climate change, it is seeking to do so in a way that adds value to communities and the wider environment too.'\n\n## Rachel McEwen\n\nChief Sustainability Officer\n\nSSE's approach to sustainability\n\n35 \uf150\n\nAccelerating climate action\n\nClimate-related financial disclosures and GHG emissions performance\n\n36 to 51 \uf150\n\nProtecting the natural environment Responsible resource use and managing impacts on nature and biodiversity\n\n52 to 55 \uf150\n\n## Ensuring a just transition\n\nWorkforce disclosures, including inclusion and diversity, and how SSE creates and shares value with customers, communities and supply chain\n\n56 to 66 \uf150\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SSE's approach to sustainability reporting\n\nSSE integrates the principles of long-term sustainability within its business strategy. Factoring in environmental and social considerations to business activities is central to creating and sharing value with stakeholders, and for ensuring the continued success of the Company. Stakeholders are vested in SSE's sustainability impacts, and SSE is committed to providing comprehensive and transparent nonfinancial disclosures.\n\nSSE's most material environmental and social disclosures, including climate-related issues - specifically, reporting against Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations nature and ensuring a fair and just energy transition, are integrated into this Annual Report. SSE's Sustainability Report 2023 is the sister document to the Annual Report 2023, providing enhanced disclosure of SSE's policies, practices and performance against key economic, social and environmental impacts and goals.\n\nFurther disclosures can be found at sse.com/sustainability \uf295 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategic Report\n\nDirectors' Report\n\n## A sustainable business strategy\n\nThe UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are the global blueprint for a sustainable future and provide a powerful framework to align SSE's strategic business objectives with societal ones.\n\nSince 2019, SSE has aligned its business strategy to the SDGs most material to its business. The schematic below depicts the flow of sustainability from SSE's objective set in its strategy statement to 'create value for shareholders and society', with UN SDGs providing the framework to guide the creation of that shared value. Within this framework SSE has identified four SDGs which are highly material to the business, and to which it has linked its four core 2030 Goals, and a further three material SDGs, which are focused on the environment and guide the pillars of SSE's environment strategy. More information on SSE's sustainability framework can be found in the Sustainability Report 2023 \uf223 .\n\n## Focusing on the most material issues\n\nSSE's stakeholders expect meaningful information relating to its social and environmental impacts. That means disclosures must be focused on the issues most material to its business activities. This principle is further reinforced through\n\nrecent developments in standardised sustainability reporting frameworks which require disclosures against material sustainability-related issues.\n\nOver 2022/23, SSE undertook a double materiality assessment, supported by a third-party, with the objective of confirming the environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues most material to its business activities. Following a process of stakeholder consultation and analysis, the assessment identified 21 sustainability issues material to SSE. The top five of these material issues are outlined below, alongside where further detail can be found.\n\n- 1.  Carbon emissions (see pages 49 to 51 \uf150 ).\n- 2.  Sustainable energy generation\n- (see pages 100 to 102 \uf150 ).\n- 3.  Affordable and reliable energy (see pages 64 and 65 \uf150 ).\n- 4.  Supply chain management (see page 66 \uf150 ).\n- 5.  Skilled workforce (see page 58 \uf150 ).\n\nThe results confirm that SSE's approach to sustainability remains focused on the most material issues from both an internal and external perspective. Carbon emissions align to the SDG 13, sustainable energy generation and affordable and reliable energy align to the SDG 7 and SDG 9. The issues arising from supply chain management and a skilled workforce predominantly align to SDG 8.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nFull detail of both the process and the results of the double materiality assessment can be found in SSE's Sustainability Report 2023 \uf223 .\n\n## Aligning with external frameworks\n\nSSE is a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), incorporating the Ten Principles of the UNGC into its approach to business, and aligns disclosures and KPIs in its Sustainability Report to international non-financial reporting standards, including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the SASB Standards. SSE also actively engages with key investor ESG ratings agencies and investor-led initiatives. Detail of SSE's performance in these ratings can be found at sse.com/sustainability \uf295 .\n\nDevelopments in standardised sustainability disclosures have continued at pace over 2022/23, including the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) consultation on its first two frameworks, expected to be finalised in summer 2023, and the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) coming into force in January 2023. While these frameworks will not impact SSE this year, SSE continues to monitor developments and remains mindful of these frameworks in its 2022/23 reporting, working towards preparedness for upcoming disclosure requirements.\n\nDriven by SSE's strategy '...creating value for shareholders and society...'\n\nAligned to shared value global framework United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\nFour highly material SDGs linked to SSE's 2030 Goals\n\n## SSE's 2030 Goals\n\nCut carbon intensity by 80%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIncrease renewable energy output fivefold\n\nEnable low-carbon generation and demand\n\nChampion a fair and just energy transition\n\n## Three further material SDGs linked to SSE's Environmental Strategy\n\nResource use\n\nNatural environment",

That is why, since 2018, SSE structures its climate disclosures against the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. Climate disclosures provide a channel to elevate climate challenges informing decisions and driving change to deliver a net zero economy.\n\n## Mandated climate-related financial disclosure in the UK\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) listing rule LR 9.8.6 R(8) requires organisations to report against the TCFD recommendations, recommended disclosures and the Annex and guidance (published 2021) in annual reports.\n\nSSE believes that whilst it is compliant with the listing rule there is still opportunity for increasing maturity across all TCFD disclosure requirements.

Board sessions considered both transitional and physical climate-related opportunities and risks and took this into account in the decisions it made (see page 131 \uf150 ).\n\nThe Board is supported by a series of Board-level and Executive-level governance committees in carrying out its role to oversee climate-related opportunities and risks. This is set out in the governance pathways below.\n\nSSE has a set of 19 Group Policies applicable across its entire organisation, of which Climate Change and Sustainability are two. Policies are reviewed and endorsed by the Group Executive Committee and approved by the Board annually.\n\n## Structured governance pathways\n\nCompliance with Group policies is also considered as part of the annual review of the effectiveness of the System of Internal Control (see page 159 \uf150 ).\n\nThe Board's Schedule of Reserved Matters; the Terms of Reference of the Board Committees and the Group Executive Committee; and the role profiles for key Board roles present the division of responsibilities across SSE relating to climate matters ( sse.com \uf295 and pages 114 to 141 \uf150 ).\n\n## Board climate expertise and training\n\nCollectively, and individually, members of the Board possess a depth of longstanding energy sector experience. The specific expertise required to lead SSE's net-zero aligned strategy within the external operating context, including considering of the impact of climate change, is set out in the SSE's skills matrix on page 115 \uf150 . Amongst other matters, knowledge deemed material to the Board's role includes clean energy technologies and climate science, alongside understanding of the policy framework required to support society transition to a net zero world. The skills\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nmatrix details the individual non-Executive Directors who support these attributes.

        "page_content": "## A sustainable approach continued\n\nAccelerating climate action\n\ncontinued\n\nIn 2022/23, SSE's Board alongside members of the executive team received updates on climate reporting (including the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)), as well as deep dives on technical topics including the future of hydrogen, the role of carbon capture and storage and distribution networks and net zero. These are detailed in the discussion of how the Board sets SSE's strategy on page 125 \uf150 .\n\n## Role of senior management\n\nStrategy is implemented by the Group Executive Committee through SSE's Business Units. This includes ensuring that business decisions are aligned with SSE's strategy and objectives, such as its 2030 Goals and science-based targets.\n\nThe Group Risk Committee (GRC) monitors all Group risks on a regular basis and ensures that the Business Units are managing the risks for which they are responsible. The GRC has overall responsibility for ensuring the right mechanisms are in place for managing all risks, including climate-related risk and opportunities.\n\nReporting to the GRC is a TCFD Steering Group, comprising representatives from Group Finance, Group Risk, Investor Relations, Company Secretary, Corporate Affairs and Sustainability, focused on advising, steering and governing the development of fair, balanced and understandable climate-related financial disclosures. The TCFD Working Group supports the TCFD Steering Group to produce SSE's TCFD disclosures.\n\nAs Chair of the Group Executive Committee the Chief Executive is responsible for climate-related initiatives. The Chief Executive agrees the annual objectives for the Chief Sustainability Officer who is a direct report. The Chief Sustainability Officer advises the Board, Group Executive Committee, Group Risk Committee and Business Units on climate-related matters and progress against SSE's Net Zero Transition Plan.\n\n## Aligning incentives to climate outcomes\n\nSSE's approach to Executive Director remuneration reflects the role of sustainability and climate-related considerations within SSE's purpose and strategy, with sustainabilitylinked metrics and targets forming an element of performance-related pay. The framework of SSE's 2030 Goals has been used since 2019 to assess performance, which was linked to the performance based Annual Incentive Plan until 2021/22. The updated Directors' Remuneration Policy, approved by shareholders at the 2022 AGM, has seen performance against these Goals now linked to the longer-term Performance Share Plan, which will vest for the first time in 2025. More information can be found in the Remuneration Committee Report on pages 173 and 183 \uf150 .\n\n## Climate governance activity in 2022/23\n\nSome of the key governance-based decisions taken in the year are presented in the timeline below. Further detail of net zero-linked strategic decisions made during the year can be found on pages 126 to 129 \uf150 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## A strategy to support net zero\n\n## Providing profitable solutions to climate change\n\nSSE's purpose is to build a better world of energy for tomorrow and, by doing this, SSE is helping directly to address the energy transition to net zero. It achieves this through its strategy of developing, building, operating and investing in the electricity infrastructure and businesses needed to decarbonise the power sector.\n\nSSE's goal is to achieve net zero GHG emissions across its scope 1 and scope 2 emissions by 2040 (subject to security of supply requirements) and for remaining scope 3 emissions by 2050. These longterm net zero ambitions are supported by interim science-based targets aligned to a 1.5\u00b0C pathway.\n\n## A plan for a net zero transition\n\nSSE's Net Zero Transition Plan, available at sse.com/sustainability \uf295 , sets out for stakeholders the key actions SSE will take to drive progress towards its net zero ambitions and its interim science-based targets aligned to a 1.5\u00b0C pathway. SSE's first Net Zero Transition Report, published June 2022, presented SSE's progress against its plan and was received by shareholders through its climate resolution at its Annual General Meeting with 98.92% of votes in favour.\n\nEngagement in action Government and regulators\n\nThe Plan was updated in November 2022 to take account of feedback from shareholders and other stakeholders. Changes involved the inclusion of SSE's joint acquisition of Triton Power (see more information on pages 103 to 105 \uf150 ); the addition of cross-cutting issues to recognise the importance that climate adaptation and resilience and the just transition play in the transition to net zero; and, an enhanced definition of net zero to SSE and further explanations on the role of neutralisation technologies in achieving net zero.\n\nTo ensure its Plan remains relevant and comprehensive, SSE develops and iterates its content and its active involvement in the UK's Transition Plan Taskforce, ensuring it can both influence and learn from emerging best practice.\n\nWith climate-related disclosure provided within SSE's Annual Report and Sustainability Report, its annual Net Zero Transition Report provides a summary and navigation tool from which shareholders vote each year. SSE's Net Zero Transition Report can be found at sse.com/sustainability \uf295 . Progress in 2022/23 is disclosed across this Annual Report and SSE's Sustainability Report 2023 \uf223 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Engaging on policy interventions\n\nThroughout the year SSE worked constructively with policymakers to navigate the energy crisis and engage on the range of potential political interventions under consideration.\n\nAs a responsible business, SSE believes that electricity generators have a role to play in bringing down energy prices, but in a way that protects investor confidence in the energy sector and energy security more broadly. As a Fair Tax Mark accredited company SSE also believes in paying its fair share of tax.\n\nSSE supported the principle of the Electricity Generator Levy (EGL) in the UK\n\nand the wholesale electricity revenue cap in the EU to ensure that an appropriate amount of additional tax on extraordinary earnings - where they materialise are paid at a time when consumers are experiencing abnormally high prices.\n\nAlongside other industry participants and stakeholders, SSE worked closely with the UK and Irish government officials through their consultative process with a view to ensuring that the design of the mechanisms achieved these aims whilst protecting against unintended consequences for security of supply or investor confidence.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEngagement was well received and helped inform practical implementation of the policy in a number of important aspects.\n\nSSE will continue to work constructively with all parties to respond to the energy crisis, without impacting industry's ability and appetite to deliver the unprecedented levels of private capital needed to address the main cause of the energy crisis - our dependence on imported fossil fuels. Addressing the causes of the crisis, rather than the short-term symptoms, will ultimately require policy frameworks that support long-term investment.",

        "page_content": "## A sustainable approach continued\n\n## Accelerating climate action continued\n\n## Advocating for climate action\n\nSSE actively and positively advocates for more ambitious climate change policy to achieve net zero and conducts its advocacy in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement and its own net zero strategy.\n\nIn 2022/23 SSE's climate advocacy was focused on the acceleration of renewables deployment to deliver net zero and avoid future cost-of-living crises. The importance of progress on decarbonising thermal generation, heat, and transport has also been an advocacy priority for the Group in 2022/23.\n\nTo maintain momentum towards achieving net zero ambitions in the UK SSE engaged the UK's Department for Environment and Rural Affairs on matters relating to climate adaptation and resilience planning, and responded to UK government consultations on the Electricity Networks Strategic Framework and the Review of Electricity Market Arrangements (REMA). In Ireland, SSE successfully advocated for an increase to the 2030 offshore wind target from 5GW to 7GW and responded to the Government's hydrogen strategy for Ireland.\n\nSSE also supported the Transition Plan Taskforce preparers and users working group to develop guidance on Transition Plans and is now a member of the TPT's Delivery Group after involvement with the TPT sandbox (testing) exercise.\n\nDetail of advocacy activities undertaken across 2022/23 can be found throughout the Strategic Report of this Annual Report ( pages 2 to 109 \uf150 ) and in SSE's Sustainability Report 2023 \uf223 available on sse.com/sustainability \uf295 .\n\n## Aligning capital deployment to a 1.5\u00b0C pathway\n\nSSE supports the integration of standardised and robust sustainability considerations into all of its investment decisions. This is achieved through internal investment criteria which tests capital investment decisions against SSE's commitment to its core 2030 Goals, including the targeted reductions in GHG emissions consistent with a 1.5\u00b0C Paris-aligned pathway as verified by the Science Based Targets initiative.\n\nIn November 2021, SSE announced its Net Zero Acceleration Programme which committed to enhanced investment in renewables, networks and flexibility, whilst beginning to export SSE's renewables capabilities overseas. With rising ambitions in key markets, combined with an increasing focus on energy security, SSE has upgraded this strategic programme for the period 2022 to 2027, referred to as 'NZAP Plus', to invest more capital into the low-carbon electricity infrastructure needed by society.\n\nWith around 90% of the NZAP Plus expected to be invested in either renewables or networks, the substantial majority of the investment plan is directly focussed on climate solutions to achieve SSE's 2030 Goals, the four material UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which underpin them and is aligned to the Technical Screening Criteria of the EU Taxonomy. The remaining 10% includes investment in low-carbon flexible service technologies, such as the two recently announced Biofuel projects in Ireland, as well as other capital investment such as maintenance spend and investment in Group IT infrastructure.\n\n## Net Zero Transition Plan pathway\n\n## 2025\n\nTarget\n\nShort term (to 2025)\n\nMedium term (2025-2035)\n\nLong term (2035-2050)\n\nEngage with 50% of suppliers by spend to set an SBT by 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReduce the carbon intensity of scope 1 GHG emissions by 80% by 2030, from 2017/18 baseline.\n\nReduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 72.5% by 2030 from a 2017/18 base year.\n\nReduce absolute GHG emissions from use of products sold by 50% by 2034 from a 2017/18 base year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote: for definitions of scopes 1, 2 and 3 SSE follows the GHG Protocol.

To support both its own developments and the growth of green finance, SSE also has pursued a strategy of issuing green bonds, when appropriate, to fund its investments.\n\nIn July 2022, SSE issued a \u20ac650m sevenyear Green Bond, the proceeds of which were allocated to help fund SSE Renewables' flagship onshore and offshore wind projects which are currently under construction or recently completed. This marks SSE's fifth Green Bond in six years and reaffirms its status as one of the largest issuer of Green Bonds from the UK corporate sector. It remains the only UK corporate to offer multiple Green Bonds and this latest issuance brings SSE's total outstanding green bonds to over \u00a32.5bn. More information can be found at sse.com/ greenbond \uf295 .\n\n## Material climate impacts\n\nThe most material climate-related opportunities and risks are described in detail on pages 42 to 45 \uf150 and have the potential to significantly impact SSE's business, strategy and financial planning.\n\nThe opportunities ( pages 42 and 43 \uf150 ) relate to the role that renewables, transmission and distribution electricity networks, and thermal generation play in supporting the transition to net zero. The material risks ( pages 44 and 45 \uf150 ) are associated with the physical impacts of extreme or changing weather conditions on renewable and network operations; alongside transition risks related to renewable wholesale prices and resilience of thermal power generators to changing policy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScope 2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information on each climaterelated opportunity and risk is also presented in SSE's CDP Climate Change Programme submission, available at sse.com/sustainability \uf295 .\n\n## Conducting climate scenario analysis\n\nIn 2022/23, SSE conducted scenario analysis of its material climate-related opportunities and risks. SSE introduced 'impact pathways' to map each potential climate event and its effect on SSE's business activities. To calculate the potential financial impact a combination of data sources were used involving historical internal business data, external independent climate-related scenario data alongside current and approved forecast financial data.\n\n## Transition risk scenario frameworks: to\n\nquantify the potential financial impact of the climate transition opportunities or risks two external independent climaterelated scenarios were drawn from to inform scenario analysis:\n\n- 1.  International Energy Association's (IEA) Net Zero Emissions by 2050 scenario shows a pathway to limit global temperature to 1.5\u00b0C and aligns with the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) sixth assessment report; and IEA\n\nStated Policies Scenario (STEPS) which reflects current policy settings based on 'sector by sector' and 'country by country' assessments of the specific policies that are in place, as well as those that have been announced by governments around the world and is consistent with a global temperature rise of 2.5\u00b0C.\n\n- 2.  National Grid Future Energy Scenarios which involve four different, credible pathways for the future of energy between now and 2050. SSE uses the 'Leading the Way' and 'Consumer transformation' pathways, which are aligned to the UK Net Zero emissions by 2050 target that aims to keep global temperature rise to below 1.5\u00b0C, for its 1.5\u00b0C scenario. SSE uses the National Grid Future Energy Scenario 'Falling short' pathway for its 2.5\u00b0C scenario, this does not achieve the UK net zero emissions by 2050 target and is therefore assumed to represent a pathway that leads to a warmer global temperature outcome of 2.5\u00b0C.\n\n## Physical risk scenario frameworks: to\n\nquantify the potential financial impact of the physical risk of climate change, SSE used the UK Met Office's climate projections (UK CP18) tool. The UK CP18 data aligns to the International Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Sixth Assessment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReport Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). For the 1.5\u00b0C scenario, SSE used the Met Office Climate Projections 1.6\u00b0C temperature pathway which is consistent with the IPCC RCP 2.6 pathway. The 4\u00b0C scenario draws from the UK Met Office 4.3\u00b0C temperature pathway which is consistent with the IPCC RCP 8.5 pathway.\n\nGeneral climate change trends project an increased chance of warmer, wetter winters and hotter, drier summers along with an increase in the frequency and intensity of extremes. These trends are projected to occur from the middle of the century onwards. As a result, SSE has modelled the physical risks of climate change in 2050 and 2080 to reflect the longer term nature of changes in climate. In addition, for these physical risks SSE has used climate projection data associated with a 1.5\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C temperature change to assess the impact of a more extreme warming scenario.",

        "page_content": "## Understanding climate-related opportunities and risks\n\nThe purpose of TCFD disclosures is to demonstrate the resilience of a company to climate change. An important way to consider that resilience, is to define climate-related opportunities and risks and subject them to different climate outcomes. The next four pages are dedicated to helping stakeholders understand SSE's resilience under varying scenarios and timeframes. This analysis does not represent a prediction of the future, simply a tool to understand a plausible spectrum of outcomes.\n\nPages 42 and 43 \uf150 assesses SSE's climate opportunities and pages 44 and 45 \uf150 considers SSE's identified climate risks.\n\n## Potential financial impact of assessed climate opportunities\n\n| Opportunities                            | 2030 ( EBIT \u00a3bn)   | 2030 ( EBIT \u00a3bn)   | 2050 (EBIT \u00a3bn)   | 2050 (EBIT \u00a3bn)   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                          | 1.5\u00b0C              | 2.5\u00b0C              | 1.5\u00b0C             | 2.5\u00b0C             |\n| 1.

For each opportunity, the annualised EBIT is adjusted for the capacity or other growth assumptions from the noted scenarios. Further adjustments for price changes based on increased system capacity were made for opportunities 1 and 3.\n\n- 1 The 1.5\u00b0C scenario draws from the IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 pathway and from the IEA STEPS pathway for the 2.5\u00b0C scenario.\n- 2 The 1.5\u00b0C scenario draws from the National Grid Future Energy Scenario 'Leading the way' pathway and from the National Grid Future Energy Scenario 'Falling short' pathway for the 2.5\u00b0C scenario.\n- 3 The 1.5\u00b0C scenario draws from the National Grid Future Energy Scenario 'Consumer transformation' pathway and from the National Grid Future Energy Scenario 'Falling short' pathway for the 2.5\u00b0C scenario.\n\n## Resilience after scenario analysis\n\nClimate change scenarios present different possible futures and are based on independent projections from external scenario providers including the International Energy Agency (IEA), National Grid Future Energy Scenarios and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Scenarios are not forecasts and should not be relied upon for decision making. The scenarios are designed for SSE to test its resilience against a range of different future states and inform strategic decision making.\n\nThe scenario analysis completed by SSE on its material climate opportunities indicates that SSE, its strategy and financial plans are resilient under a range of climate-related scenarios, including a 1.5\u00b0C and 2.5\u00b0C temperature pathway. Due to SSE's strategy to focus on the transition to a net zero world, opportunities under a 1.5\u00b0C scenario represent greater growth than those under a 2.5\u00b0C temperature pathway.\n\n## Climate opportunity impacts\n\nWith five relevant material climate opportunities identified, each is defined with its impact on strategy described below:\n\n## 1. Accelerated wind investment\n\n## Context\n\nUK and international binding net zero targets supported by renewable capacity growth plans and targets provide an opportunity to invest in the growth of SSE's installed onshore and offshore wind generation capacity.\n\nKey assumptions included the wind capacity projections from the IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 and STEPS scenarios, SSE's current and pipeline wind investment projections and internal wind capture price factors.\n\n## Impact to SSE\n\nAs part of the scenario analysis, SSE assessed its current and pipeline wind portfolio to understand the potential opportunity of accelerated wind investment to the business in 2030 and 2050. The 1.5\u00b0C scenario indicated a significantly greater opportunity in 2030, with a range of \u00a30.48bn to \u00a30.66bn and an opportunity of more than double that in 2050 with a range of \u00a31.09bn to \u00a31.50bn, when compared to a warmer 2.5\u00b0C scenario for the same time horizons.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategic alignment\n\nUnder the NZAP Plus, SSE anticipates that around 5GW of additional net capacity will be added across the five-year plan, with net installed capacity exceeding 9GW by March 2027. This investment strategy aligns to the opportunities arising from a 1.5\u00b0C scenario.\n\n## Link to strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2. Accelerated transmission growth\n\n## Context\n\nAll net zero pathways for the UK require new sources of renewable wind generation, at scale, in the north of Scotland. This energy must be transported to the regions of demand, requiring significant expansion of the north of Scotland electricity transmission network.\n\nProjected renewables generation capacity for Scotland from the National Grid Future Energy Scenarios 'Leading the way' and 'Falling short' and SSE's investment in the north of Scotland\n\n## 3. Valuable flexible hydro\n\n## Context\n\nA renewables-led electricity system will require support from flexible generators that provide system services, such as short-term reserve, frequency and long-duration storage services. The opportunity exists to use low-carbon flexible hydro capacity and invest in pumped storage capacity to support the GB electricity system.\n\nKey assumptions included the projected hydro generation capacity from the IEA Net Zero\n\n## 4. Valuable flexible thermal\n\n## Context\n\nA renewables-led electricity system requires support from flexible generators that provide system services, such as short-term reserve, frequency, security of supply and price stability. There is the opportunity to repurpose SSE's existing gas-powered electricity generators, as well as invest in new low-carbon thermal generation assets.\n\nNatural gas with carbon capture and storage generation projections from the IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 and STEPS scenarios and SSE's current and future investment plans in low-\n\nelectricity transmission network assumptions have been used in the scenario analysis.\n\n## Impact to SSE\n\nAs part of the scenario analysis, SSE assessed the current and future capital investment plans for its SSEN Transmission business. The National Grid 'Leading the way' Future Energy Scenario indicated a significantly greater opportunity in 2030 and 2050, with ranges of \u00a30.46bn to \u00a30.62bn and \u00a31.10bn to \u00a31.50bn respectively, when compared to the 'Falling short' scenario.\n\nEmissions and STEPS scenarios, SSE's renewable investment projections and internal price factors to take account of market volatility.\n\n## Impact to SSE\n\nThe scenario analysis assessed the optimisation of SSE's existing hydro assets and the development of Coire Glas a large scale, long-duration pumped storage project. The 1.5\u00b0C scenario indicated a greater opportunity for SSE's hydro assets in 2050 reflecting the impact of investing in Coire Glas,\n\ncarbon thermal generation assumptions have been used in the scenario analysis.\n\n## Impact to SSE\n\nThe scenario analysis assessed current and future capital investment plans for SSE's Thermal business. The 1.5\u00b0C scenario indicated a significantly greater opportunity in 2050, with a range of \u00a30.66bn and \u00a30.99bn, when compared to a warmer 2.5\u00b0C scenario. The opportunity highlights that investment in low-carbon thermal technologies in the short and medium term present greater growth in the long term.\n\n## 5. Driving distribution transformation\n\n## Context\n\nTo deliver net zero targets across all sectors and countries requires a shift to zero emission vehicles and electric heating. In the UK this requires the transformation of the distribution system to ensure the system is fit to manage the potential five to ten-fold increase in annual load expected between now and 2038.\n\nProjected electricity consumer demand from the National Grid Future Energy Scenarios 'Consumer\n\ntransformation' and 'Falling short' and SSEN Distribution's investment plans to support the electrification of the energy system have been used in the scenario analysis.\n\n## Impact to SSE\n\nAs part of the scenario analysis, SSE assessed the current capital investment plans for its SSEN Distribution business. The National Grid 'Consumer transformation' Future Energy Scenario indicated a significantly greater\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategic alignment\n\nWhile SSEN Transmission has completed the first year of its five-year RIIO-T2 investment plan, making progress with key strategic investments under the Ofgem uncertainty mechanism, the scale of growth to 2030 has become clear. Ofgem's 'Pathway to 2030' identified \u00a37bn of further investment required in the north of Scotland establishing confidence that both national climate targets can be met, and that SSEN Transmission's growth will more closely align with the 'Leading the way' climate scenario.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwith a range of \u00a30.15bn to \u00a30.20bn, when compared to the warmer 2.5\u00b0C scenario.\n\n## Strategic alignment\n\nSSE seeks to invest in its existing 1.5GW of hydro capacity as well as develop pumped storage capacity at Coire Glas as part of its current five-year investment programme. This investment strategy is therefore aligned to the opportunities arising from a 1.5\u00b0C scenario.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strategic alignment\n\nSSE is actively developing options to decarbonise its fleet, most notably in carbon capture and storage and hydrogen technologies. Projects include carbon capture and storage projects as part of the UK cluster sequencing programme at Keadby in the Humber and Peterhead in the North of Scotland alongside hydrogen projects at Keadby and Saltend and the repurposing of SSE's Aldbrough Gas Storage site for the safe storage of hydrogen. These plans are therefore aligned to the opportunities arising from a 1.5\u00b0C scenario.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nopportunity in 2030 and 2050, with ranges of \u00a30.09bn to \u00a30.12bn and \u00a30.31bn to \u00a30.42bn respectively, when compared to the 'Falling short' scenario.\n\n## Strategic alignment\n\nSSEN Distribution's current RIIO-ED2 business plan for 2023 to 2028 sets out the flexibility and network investment required to accelerate net zero and therefore is aligned to the opportunities arising from a 1.5\u00b0C scenario.",

The tables presented on pages 44 and 45 \uf150 present SSE's material climaterelated risks alongside the potential financial impact against a series of climate scenarios. The impacts described are designed to aid understanding of SSE's climate risks and are not intended to be forward looking guidance.\n\n## Physical climate risks from a changed climate\n\n| Risks                                                    | 2050 (EBIT \u00a3bn)   | 2050 (EBIT \u00a3bn)   | 2080 (EBIT \u00a3bn)   | 2080 (EBIT \u00a3bn)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                                          | 1.5\u00b0C             | 4\u00b0C               | 1.5\u00b0C             | 4\u00b0C               |\n| 1.

Storm, wind and heat damage to networks assets risk is stated in GBP billion (\u00a3bn) based on one year annualised storm costs. External climate models have inherent limitations, with a lack of data on extreme climate events, and lower confidence levels on certain climate variables such as wind. SSE's assessments account for uncertainties by extracting average wind speed data to assess the impact.\n\n- 1 The 1.5\u00b0C scenario draws from the  IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 pathway and the UK Met Office Climate Projections (UK CP18) 1.6\u00b0C temperature pathway which is consistent with the IPCC RCP 2.6 pathway. The 4\u00b0C scenario draws the IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 pathway and the UK Met Office CP18 4.3\u00b0C temperature pathway which is consistent with the IPCC RCP 8.5 pathway.\n- 2 The 1.5\u00b0C scenario draws from the National Grid Future Energy Scenario 'Consumer transformation' pathway and the UK Met Office Climate Projections (UK CP18) 1.6\u00b0C temperature pathway which is consistent with the IPCC RCP 2.6 pathway. The 4\u00b0C scenario draws the National Grid Future Energy Scenario 'Falling short' pathway and the UK Met Office CP18 4.3\u00b0C temperature pathway which is consistent with the IPCC RCP 8.5 pathway.\n\n## Resilience after scenario analysis\n\nThe scenario analysis completed by SSE on its material climate physical risks indicates that SSE is reasonably resilient to identified climaterelated scenarios including 1.5\u00b0C and 4\u00b0C pathways. For SSE, the potential financial impact at a 1.5\u00b0C pathway presents a lower risk in the scenarios than a 4\u00b0C pathway. This reflects the potential impact of greater global warming and the associated weather impacts of sustained higher temperatures and extreme weather events (including storms, heat waves and flooding) associated with a warming world.\n\nDue to SSE's strategy and the key controls that it employs to manage and mitigate the climate risks, SSE is positioned well to respond to the risks presented in both a 1.5\u00b0C pathway and 4\u00b0C pathway.\n\n## Physical climate risk impacts\n\n## 1. Variable renewable generation\n\n## Context\n\nLonger term changes in climate patterns cause sustained higher temperatures that may result in lower rainfall and reduced wind levels. These changes may impact SSE's renewable output and associated earnings in the short, medium and long term.\n\nKey assumptions included the IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 wind generation projections and the Met Office UK Climate projections for average wind speed times.\n\n## Impact to SSE\n\nThis is a perennial risk that impacts SSE. For instance, in the first half of 2021/22 SSE experienced one of the driest and calmest summer periods (April to September) on record which reduced adjusted operating profit through the summer period and impacted financial plans for the year. For the future, with a five-fold increase in renewables capacity by 2031 and prospects beyond 2031, this risk will continue to impact SSE.\n\nThe 4\u00b0C scenario indicated a greater risk in 2050, with a range of \u00a30.13bn and \u00a30.17bn and a more significant risk in 2080 with a range of \u00a30.20bn to\n\n## 2. Storm, wind and heat damage to networks assets\n\n## Context\n\nIncreased severity of extreme weather events, such as storms, floods and heat waves bring prolonged extreme temperatures, wind or rainfall. This may damage or stress network assets and result in additional costs to repair and maintain the network and the loss of incentive revenue for distribution operators.\n\nProjected electricity consumer demand from National Grid Future Energy Scenarios 'Consumer transformation' and 'Falling short', Met Office UK Climate projections for average wind speed times and internal assumptions on the projected\n\nfrequency of extreme storms and heat waves have been used in the scenario analysis.\n\n## Impact to SSE\n\nThis risk has the potential to impact SSE's networks assets in the medium and long term. For example, in the 2021/22 winter season, SSE experienced five storms named by the Met Office that became Red Alert events and impacted over 100,000 customers with many impacted for a multi-day period.\n\nThe 4\u00b0C scenario indicated a more significant risk in the longer term, with a range of \u00a30.15bn to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00a30.27bn, when compared to a 1.5\u00b0C scenario for the same time horizons.\n\n## Strategic alignment\n\nThe technical and geographical nature of SSE's renewable capacity alongside meteorological monitoring, crisis management and business continuity plans are some of the ways that SSE manages and mitigates its business against this risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00a30.20bn when compared to a 1.5\u00b0C scenario for the same time horizons.\n\n## Strategic alignment\n\nA programme of investment into the strengthening and improvement of SSE's networks alongside meteorological modelling, crisis management and business continuity plans are some of the ways that SSE manages and mitigates its business against this risk.\n\n## Link to strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Potential financial impact of assessed transition risks\n\n## Transition risks arising from policy and market change\n\n| Risks                             | 2030 (EBIT \u00a3bn)   | 2030 (EBIT \u00a3bn)   | 2050 (EBIT \u00a3bn)   | 2050 (EBIT \u00a3bn)   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                   | 1.5\u00b0C             | 2.5\u00b0C             | 1.5\u00b0C             | 2.5\u00b0C             |\n| 3.

All scenarios are presented as a range to reflect sensitivities applied to each climate scenario. Further adjustments for price changes based on increased system capacity were made for risk 4.\n\n- 1 The 1.5\u00b0C scenario draws from the National Grid Future Energy Scenario 'Leading the way' pathway and from the National Grid Future Energy Scenario 'Falling short' pathway for the 2.5\u00b0C scenario.\n- 2 The 1.5\u00b0C scenario draws from the IEA Net Zero Emissions by 2050 pathway and from the IEA STEPS pathway for the 2.5\u00b0C scenario.\n\n## Resilience after scenario analysis\n\nThe scenario analysis completed by SSE on its material climate transition risks indicates that SSE is resilient to identified climate-related scenarios including 1.5\u00b0C and 2.5\u00b0C pathways. For SSE, the potential financial impact at a 1.5\u00b0C pathway presents a greater risk than the 2.5\u00b0C pathway in these climate scenarios. This reflects the potential impact of climate policy in the 1.5\u00b0C scenario which may bring forward the closure of unabated thermal generation to 2030 or earlier and potentially impact future earnings. Whilst the wind capture market risk has the potential in the 1.5\u00b0C scenario to have a greater impact on SSE's current renewable capacity and future new renewable capacity and potential future earnings. Due to SSE's strategy and the key controls that SSE employs to manage and mitigate the climate risks, SSE is positioned well to respond to the risks presented in both a 1.5\u00b0C pathway and 2.5\u00b0C pathway.\n\n## Climate transition risk impacts\n\n## 3. Accelerated gas closure\n\n## Context\n\nMore aggressive climate change policy may bring forward the closure of unabated gas generation from 2030.\n\nKey assumptions included the National Grid Future Energy Scenarios 'Leading the way' and 'Falling short' for installed unabated natural gas generation capacity decline projections in 2030 and 2035 and the net present value of existing gas-fired power stations with a life expectancy post 2030.\n\n## 4. Wind capture market\n\n## Context\n\nAll credible pathways to net zero in the UK and beyond assume the dramatic scaling up of wind (especially offshore) generated electricity. As wind generation capacity increases, it is expected that the average electricity price wind power ('wind capture price') achieves will be less than the average price for electricity ('baseload price'). There is a risk that this lower average price for wind output is more extreme than expected by the market or SSE.\n\nKey assumptions included wind capacity projections from the IEA Net Zero Emissions by\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nremaining power stations to close by 2035. The 1.5\u00b0C scenario indicated a greater risk in 2030, with a range of \u00a30.34bn and \u00a30.51bn when compared to a warmer 2.5\u00b0C scenario for the same time horizon.\n\n## Strategic alignment\n\nTo mitigate this risk, SSE is in the process of repurposing existing thermal assets and developing low-carbon thermal technologies and in addition has a strong pipeline of new renewables projects that provide a natural hedge against this risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nprojections for both pathways. The 1.5\u00b0C scenario indicated a greater risk in 2030, with a range of \u00a30.11bn and \u00a30.15bn and a more significant risk in 2050 with a range of \u00a30.38bn to \u00a30.52bn, when compared to a warmer 2.5\u00b0C scenario for the same time horizons.\n\n## Strategic alignment\n\nSSE's balanced portfolio of generation capacity, power hedging strategies and the fact that SSE factors wind capture price into its long term price forecasts are some of the ways that SSE manages and mitigates its business against this risk.\n\n## Impact to SSE\n\nSSE's existing 5.3GW fleet of installed gas- and oil-fired generation will be nearing the end of its expected life by the end of the 2020s. However, 2.3GW of Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) capacity will still be in operation in 2030. The climate scenario analysis assessed the impact of this capacity not being able to generate beyond 2030 without low-carbon abatement technology.\n\nUnder the 1.5\u00b0C scenario all remaining gas-fired capacity closes by 2030 whilst the 2.5\u00b0C scenario assumes some gas-fired power stations are still able to operate beyond 2030 but expects any\n\n2050 and STEPS scenarios, internal nonsubsidised wind output and internal wind capture price factors.\n\n## Impact to SSE\n\nThe wind capture market risk has the potential to be greater in a 1.5\u00b0C scenario than in the 2.5\u00b0C scenario due to the expectation that the 1.5\u00b0C scenario expects new renewable capacity to be built at a greater pace to meet the net zero by 2050 goal.\n\nThe climate scenario assessed SSE's current and future renewables capacity against the future IEA",

        "page_content": "## A sustainable approach continued\n\nAccelerating climate action\n\ncontinued\n\n## Classifying sustainable investments\n\n## Progressing towards a UK Green Taxonomy\n\nSSE is an advocate of the development of sustainable finance beyond green and sustainable debt markets. SSE supports the integration of standardised sustainability criteria into investment decisions. Its own internal investment criteria ensures alignment of capital investment plans to its core 2030 Goals which includes targeted reductions in GHG emissions consistent with a 1.5\u00b0C Paris Agreement pathway.\n\nThe announcement by the UK Government in March 2023 that it would consult on a UK Green Taxonomy in Autumn 2023 was therefore a welcome step, and SSE looks forward to engaging in the consultation process. SSE continues to make the case that a UK-appropriate taxonomy consistent with the broad principles established by the EU Taxonomy but with a focus on being simpler, more transparent and auditable - would help support the quality of standards, labels and disclosures required to define green finance activity. SSE's Sustainability Report 2023 \uf223 discusses the opportunities to enhance the UK Green Taxonomy, available at sse.com/sustainability \uf295 .\n\n## Assessing SSE's eligible activities\n\nTo provide stakeholders with an indication of the scale of SSE's green economic activities, SSE has taken a best efforts approach to consider its alignment to the EU Taxonomy. Key strategic activities (ie onshore wind, offshore wind, transmission, distribution) from SSE's Reporting Segments were assessed against the technical screening criteria. While an internal assessment against the Do No Significant Harm and minimum safeguards criteria was undertaken, a second party opinion has not yet been sought.\n\nThe financial metrics disclosed continue to be classified based on SSE's reportable segments. Table 1 on page 47 \uf150 provides the output from this principle-based assessment of SSE's taxonomy aligned activities.\n\nTaxonomy eligible activities in 2022/23 are from SSE's onshore and offshore wind generation, hydro (run of river and pumped storage) as well as its networks transmission and distribution activities. In 2022/23, the proportion of SSE's taxonomy-eligible activities across the different measures were: adjusted operating profit, 55%; adjusted investment and capital expenditure, 81%; and, revenue, 26%.\n\nThe reason that SSE's taxonomy-eligible revenue appears low in relation to its total revenue is primarily due to Energy Portfolio Management (EPM) trading activity and the sale of power to end customers, both of which are high volumes, with pass-through costs and lower margins than in larger businesses such as renewables generation and networks. SSE believes that revenue is a poor measure in assessing its economic activity and that the most appropriate measures of its taxonomyeligible economic activity are in relation to its capital investment and its operating profit.\n\nThe taxonomy non-eligible activities are associated with SSE's thermal generation and gas storage businesses. As these businesses continue their decarbonisation pathways, it is expected that emerging activities such as low-carbon flexible generation or hydrogen storage will qualify in the future.\n\nFinally, activities that have not been identified in the taxonomy as they either do not significantly contribute to climate change mitigation or could yet be integrated into the Taxonomy at a later date comprise SSE's Business Energy, Airtricity, Distributed Energy, EPM and Corporate businesses. These activities either operate as customer focussed businesses, a route to market for generation, or do not contain material activities at this time.\n\nProviding the UK Green Taxonomy does not deviate significantly from the EU model, SSE expects its assessment of its taxonomy eligible activities disclosed on page 47 \uf150 to be consistent with a future UK framework.\n\n## Taxonomy eligible activities at a glance\n\n## Assumptions\n\nSSE's accounting policies for these calculations are based on the current EU Taxonomy Regulation 2020/852, and delegated acts.\n\n## Linkage principle\n\nIn calculating each taxonomy-eligible proportion, a 'linkage principle' has been applied, stipulating that any revenue, operating profit/loss or capital expenditure that can be justifiably linked to an identified taxonomy economic activity can be classified as taxonomy-eligible. Using this principle, revenue and operating profits from SSE's balancing activities, hedging, and trading can be linked to the EU taxonomy eligible activities when the activity is undertaken to directly support the eligible activities.\n\n## Proxies\n\nWhere financial results are not appropriately split into Taxonomy eligible activities (namely Energy Portfolio Management trading and power sale activities), revenue has been allocated based on purchased power volumes from renewable versus non-renewable assets, and operating profit/loss has been apportioned based on internal contractual trading agreements.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe analysis has been prepared by applying a top-down review of SSE's activities and the alignment with existing segmental reporting within taxonomy eligible activities. There are some activities that fall below specified thresholds which are not taxonomy eligible. As SSE's reporting processes and controls will be refined ahead of implementation of the UK Green Taxonomy, it is expected that some reclassification of activities may occur due to changes in materiality thresholds or clarification on eligible activity criteria.\n\nTable 1: Assessment of SSE's taxonomy aligned activities\n\n| SSE's reported segments (a)                     | Taxonomy eligible activity (a)                  | Revenue (b)   | Revenue (b)   | Adjusted operating   profit (c)   | Adjusted operating   profit (c)   | Adjusted investment and  capital expenditure (d)   | Adjusted investment and  capital expenditure (d)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                 |                                                 | \u00a3m            | %             | \u00a3m                                | %                                 | \u00a3m                                                 | %                                                  |\n| SSEN Transmission                               | Transmission of electricity                     | 656.1         | 5.3           | 372.7                             | 14.7                              | 495.5                                              | 22.9                                               |\n| SSEN Distribution                               | Distribution of electricity                     | 1,102.7       | 8.8           | 382.4                             | 15.1                              | 421.0                                              | 19.5                                               |\n| SSE Renewables                                  | Electricity generation                          | 334.8         | 2.7           | 580.0                             | 22.9                              | 837.5                                              | 38.7                                               |\n| EPM                                             | As route to market for   SSE Renewables         | 1,150.2       | 9.2           | 62.3                              | 2.5                               | 1.2                                                | 0.1                                                |\n| Total taxonomy eligible activities              | Total taxonomy eligible activities              | 3,243.8       | 26.0          | 1,397.4                           | 55.2                              | 1,755.2                                            | 81.2                                               |\n| SSE Thermal                                     | Thermal Generation                              | 740.4         | 5.9           | 1,031.9                           | 40.8                              | 153.2                                              | 7. 1                                               |\n| Gas Storage                                     | Supply of energy                                | 12.2          | 0.1           | 212.5                             | 8.4                               | 6.3                                                | 0.3                                                |\n| EPM                                             | As route to market for   SSE Thermal            | 3,198.6       | 25.6          | (3.0)                             | (0.1)                             | 1.2                                                | 0.1                                                |\n| Taxonomy non-eligible activities                | Taxonomy non-eligible activities                | 3,951.2       | 31.6          | 1,241.4                           | 49.1                              | 160.7                                              | 7.5                                                |\n| Business Energy                                 | Business Energy                                 | 3,313.5       | 26.6          | 17.9                              | 0.8                               | 38.9                                               | 1.8                                                |\n| SSE Airtricity                                  | SSE Airtricity                                  | 1,776.9       | 14.2          | 5.6                               | 0.2                               | 10.5                                               | 0.5                                                |\n| EPM                                             | EPM                                             | -

A materiality test is completed, and a final list of significant climate opportunities and risks defined.\n\nSSE identifies the climate impact on its operations over the short (up to three years), medium (four to 10 years) and long term (up to 30 years) from the perspective of market, policy or regulatory transition opportunities and risks. Climate impacts to SSE's operations from the physical risks of climate change are assessed over the short (up to three years), medium (four to 10 years) and long term (up to 80 years). SSE's time horizons for assessing climaterelated opportunities and risks are aligned with other business practice time horizons. The three climate-related time horizons mirror the investment, capital and regulatory time horizons that govern SSE's financial, operational and capital plans.\n\nMateriality is tested for each climate opportunity or risk based on its ability to have a substantive potential financial impact on SSE's strategy or significant impact on SSE's stakeholders.\n\nIn 2022/23, the assessment process reconfirmed that the material climaterelated opportunities and risks (on pages 50 to 53 \uf150 of SSE's Annual Report 2022 \uf223 ) remained relevant to SSE with some minor amendments to a few such as, the 'storm damage network risk' was updated to more precisely account for the impact of wind and heat ( page 44 \uf150 ).\n\n## Managing climate opportunities and risks\n\nSSE's System of Internal Control defines the policy, standards and governance for the management of all risks, including those relating to climate. The system involves the critical controls that are in place to manage risk including climate risk. Controls include business continuity plans, crisis management and incident response, large capital project governance and internal and external assurance.\n\nThe climate-related opportunities and risks ( pages 42 to 45 \uf150 ), combined with SSE's Sustainability Report 2022 \uf223 and CDP Climate Change response provides further information on these actions and controls.\n\n## Integrated climate-related risk assessment\n\nSSE's Group Risk Management Framework ( pages 156 and 157 \uf150 ) manages risks that can threaten the achievement of SSE's strategic objectives, including climate change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## TCFD Risk Management recommendations:\n\n## Risk Management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\na) Describe the organisation's processes for identifying and assessing climaterelated risks.\n\nb) Describe the organisation's processes for managing climate-related risks. c) Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organisation's overall risk management.\n\nClimate change is a Group Principal Risk to SSE and has the ability to affect the achievement of agreed strategic objectives and the long term success of SSE (see page 72 \uf150 ). Scenarios related to physical risks associated with climate change form part of SSE's viability assessment ( page 71 \uf150 ). Climate-related influencing factors and key developments are also considered against all relevant Group Principal Risks ( pages 68 to 77 \uf150 ).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate metrics and targets\n\n## GHG emissions preparation\n\nSSE's GHG inventory is prepared in accordance with the UK Government's environmental reporting guidelines (BEIS, March 2019); the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (revised edition) developed by the World Resources Institute and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (2004); and ISO 14064-1:2018 Specification with Guidance at the Organization Level for Quantification and Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Removals .\n\nFor more information on SSE's GHG emissions data and how it is produced, see SSE's GHG and Water reporting criteria available at sse.com/sustainability \uf295 .\n\n## GHG emissions inventory\n\nTable 2, in combination with the energy use data outlined in Table 6 on page 54 \uf150 , represents SSE's disclosures in line with the UK Government Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting requirements. SSE takes an operational control consolidation approach to account for its GHG emissions. Under the operational control approach, SSE includes all joint arrangements that it has operational control in its scope 1 and 2 inventory. For activities SSE does not have operational control, the GHG emissions from the most material joint arrangements (where SSE holds an equity share equal to or greater than 50%) are included in SSE's scope 3 inventory.\n\nSSE's inventory details its direct and indirect GHG emissions (scopes 1, 2 and 3) performance (measured in million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent - MtCO 2 e), provided as total emissions as well as split out by UK and Irish activity. It also provides a carbon intensity measure based on direct GHG emissions released for each unit of electricity SSE produced.\n\nTable 2: SSE's GHG inventory\n\n|                                                           | Unit            | 2022/23               | 2021/22                |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|------------------------|\n| Total GHG emissions 1                                     | MtCO 2 e        | 11.33 (A)             | 9.93 (B)               |\n| Scope 1 GHG emissions 1  - total (UK/Ire)                 | MtCO 2 e        | 6.08 (A) (5.35/0.73)  | 5.75 (B) (4.22/1.53)   |\n| Scope 2 GHG emissions - total (UK/Ire)                    | MtCO 2 e        | 0.44 (A) (0.44/<0.01) | 0.49 (B) (0.49/<0.01)  |\n| Scope 3 GHG emissions - total (UK/Ire) 1,4                | MtCO 2 e        | 4.81 (A) (4.12/0.69)  | 3.69 (B) (2.86/0.83)   |\n| Scope 1 GHG emissions intensity of  electricity generated | gCO 2 e/kWh 254 | (A)                   | 259 (B)                |\n| Total renewable generation output 2 - total (UK/Ire)      | GWh             | 9,665 (8,308/1,357)   | 8,799  (7,602/1,197)   |\n| Total non-renewable generation output 3 - total (UK/Ire)  | GWh             | 14,302 (12,770/1,532) | 13,356  (10,394/2,962) |\n| Total generation output - total (UK/Ire)                  | GWh             | 23,967 (21,078/2,889) | 22,155 (17,996/4,159)  |\n\n- 4 Includes GHG emissions associated with gas generation through Joint Venture holdings according to equity share.

In 2022/23, SSE's total GHG emissions consisted of 54% scope 1 emissions, 4% scope 2 emissions and 42% scope 3 emissions. Overall, SSE's total GHG emissions increased by 14% between 2021/22 and 2022/23.\n\nBetween 2021/22 and 2022/23, GHG emissions arising from electricity generation, consisting 99% of SSE's scope 1 emissions, increased by 6%. This was predominantly a result of a rise in output from SSE's thermal generation plant by 7% compared to the previous year due to market conditions and the reinstatement of operations following planned and unplanned outages the previous year. The impact of weather, demand and availability of plant creates variation in the pathway of emissions reduction.\n\nSSE's scope 2 GHG emissions were 0.44MtCO 2 e in 2022/23, representing an 11% reduction from the previous year. This reduction in scope 2 emissions is largely a result of a fall in the greenhouse gas emissions associated with losses on the electricity network, which is a result as a fall in the grid electricity factor by 9% over the same period.\n\nTotal scope 3 emissions increased by 30% between 2021/22 and 2022/23. The two material contributing factors include:\n\n- \u00b7 The inclusion of 0.6MtCO 2 e GHG emissions from Saltend gas-fired power station from September 2022 onwards. This reflects SSE's 50% purchase of Triton which completed in September 2022. The emissions from Triton are defined as scope 3 emissions according to SSE's 50% ownership share.\n- \u00b7 12 months of GHG emissions data from Seabank (50% equity share) contributing 0.9MtCO 2 e following the end of SSE's power purchase agreement in September 2021. It should be noted that, prior to September 2021, 100% of Seabank GHG emissions were accounted in SSE's scope 1 emissions according to the GHG Protocol.\n\nThe increase in scope 3 emissions is partly offset by a reduction of 5.5% in gas sold GHG emissions between 2021/22 and 2022/23.\n\nWith scope 3 emissions increasingly becoming a greater proportion of SSE's GHG emission inventory as a result of the approach it is taking to delivery its strategy, SSE is working with its Joint Venture partners to ensure each put in place their own Net Zero Transition Plans. SSE's scope 3 emissions represent 42% of its total GHG emissions inventory and the emissions associated with Joint Venture thermal generation contributes to 32% of the scope 3 GHG inventory.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRenewables output\n\nCoal output\n\nGas and oil output*\n\nMultifuel output\n\n- Scope 1 GHG emissions\n- * In 2022/23, oil-fired generation output contributed around 2% of gas and oil output.\n\n2\n\n## Scope 1 GHG intensity in 2022/23\n\nSSE's scope 1 GHG emissions intensity fell by 2% to 254gCO 2 e/kWh from 259gCO 2 e/ kWh the previous year, which is a fall of 17% since the 2017/18 base year of 307gCO 2 e/kWh.\n\nSSE's intensity performance is calculated based on two elements - total generation output, comprising thermal and renewables generation sources and total scope 1 GHG emissions (99% of which is from thermal generation).\n\nOutput from SSE's renewable generation portfolio (inc. pumped storage and biomass) increased to 9.7TWh in 2022/23, from 8.8TWh the previous year, a rise of 10% between the same periods. This was driven by increased output having experienced an exceptionally still and dry weather conditions the previous year and output from the operational turbines at Seagreen offshore wind farm.\n\nOutput from SSE's thermal generation also increased, however this was by a lesser extent than for renewables output. This meant that the proportion of total generation output contributed to by renewable generation continued to represent 40% of the total portfolio in 2022/23.\n\nOverall, SSE's scope 1 GHG intensity was slightly lower than the previous year due to a reduction in output from the most carbon intensive generating plant in SSE's portfolio, including from carbon intensive peaking plant in Ireland.\n\n## Performance against targets\n\nTo support improved performance, SSE measures and reports progress against interim science-based targets on a 1.5\u00b0C pathway. This performance is outlined in Table 3.\n\nSSE remains on track to achieve its SBTi-approved target to reduce scope 1 GHG emissions intensity by 80% between 2017/18 and 2030. It is expected that SSE's NZAP Plus will develop and connect the renewables capacity which will contribute to a reduction in the scope 1 GHG intensity by 2030.\n\nSSE's total scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions combined were 6.52MtCO 2 e in 2022/23, this is a reduction of 41% from the 2017/18 base year of SSE's SBTi-approved absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG target. Overall, SSE's scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions have reduced significantly compared to the base year, reflecting lower output from thermal power stations and the closure of SSE's last coal-fired power plant in March 2020. SSE aims to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 72.5% between 2017/18 and 2030.\n\nGHG emissions from gas sold to customers, which contribute around 45% of SSE's scope 3 emissions in 2022/23, decreased by 5.5%. This was a result of lower market demand reflecting increased market prices. This means GHG emissions from gas sold have reduced by 15% from 2017/18. SSE's SBTi-approved target is to reduce GHG emissions from gas sold by 50% between 2017/18 and 2034.\n\nTable 3: SSE's performance against its science-based carbon targets\n\n| Target                                                                                             | Unit        |   2017/18 |   2021/22 |   2022/23 |   Target | Progress against target                                                                                            |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Reduce the GHG intensity of scope 1  GHG emissions by 80% by 2030,  from a 2017/18 base year       | gCO 2 e/kWh |    307    |    259    |    254    |    61    | 17% reduction in GHG intensity  since 2017/18                                                                      |\n| Reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG  emissions by 72.5% by 2030 from a  2017/18 base year            | MtCO 2 e    |     11.06 |      6.24 |      6.52 |     3.04 | 41% reduction in absolute  scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions  since 2017/18                                              |\n| Reduce absolute GHG emissions  from use of products sold by 50%   by 2034 from a 2017/18 base year | MtCO 2 e    |      2.53 |      2.29 |      2.16 |     1.27 | 15% reduction in GHG  emissions from gas sold   since 2017/18                                                      |\n| Engage with 50% of suppliers by  spend to set an SBT by 2024                                       | %           |      0    |     48    |     51    |    50    | 52% of SSE's suppliers (by value)  that set or committed to set  their own science-based  targets through the SBTi |\n\n## Working with supply chain partners to drive climate action\n\nTo support the reduction of emissions associated with the goods and services SSE purchases, SSE seeks to engage with 50% of suppliers (according to financial expenditure) to set their own sciencebased targets by 2024. SSE continued to engage with its supply chain on climate matters through its partnership with the Supply Chain Sustainability School with nearly 27% of suppliers by spend using the resources and training available. In addition, a carbon working group was set up through the Powering Net Zero Pact, that aims to collaborate on a fair and just transition to net zero carbon emissions, with the aim of improving scope 3 emissions reporting.\n\nAt 31 March 2022, 34% of SSE's suppliers by value had set their own science-based targets through the SBTi, with a further 17% committed to setting one. In 2022/23, SSE and CDP Supply Chain collaborated to deliver supplier webinars that aimed at increasing the climate change questionnaire response rate from its suppliers, the engagement led to 237 key suppliers responding to the questionnaire and a supplier response rate of 56%.\n\n## Carbon pricing\n\nAs a generator of electricity, SSE is subject to policies that impact the price of carbon, which means the price of carbon is an explicit consideration in many investment decisions.\n\nSSE's generation activities in the GB are subject to the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS), which is a cap-and-trade emissions scheme. In addition, SSE's generation assets in GB are subject to the Carbon Price Support mechanism which sets a price per tonne of carbon emitted and combined with the UK ETS allowance price, makes up the Total Carbon Price paid by electricity generators. In Ireland SSE's generation assets are subject to the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). At the time of reporting, SSE used carbon prices of \u00a378/tCO 2 in GB and \u20ac86/tCO 2 in the EU. Our future plans include assumptions on low, central and high carbon range forecasts.\n\nSSE is required to report its GHG emissions and energy consumption and this is presented on page 54 \uf150 . For further details on SSE's approach to carbon pricing see SSE's Sustainability Report 2023 \uf223 alongside SSE's CDP climate change submission sse.com/sustainability \uf295 .",

        "page_content": "## Protecting the natural environment\n\nNature has a central role in supporting the achievement of net zero and adapting to a climate changed world, and the nature and climate crises must be addressed hand-in-hand. SSE's Environment Strategy provides a framework for SSE to manage and mitigate impacts to terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems, and build a business that uses resources efficiently and embraces the principles of a circular economy.\n\n## Emerging nature frameworks\n\n2022/23 saw a continued international focus on nature and biodiversity and some significant steps forward for biodiversity were made, including the landmark deal made at the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (UNCBD) in Canada in December 2022, to protect a third of the planet for nature by 2030.\n\nWhile frameworks such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) and the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (EU CSRD) are emerging, there remains room for greater clarity on best practice measurement and disclosure of nature-related information. Increasing meaningful disclosures around naturerelated impacts is a key focus for SSE, and it will monitor how these frameworks and standards develop and work to improve its own disclosures, including against its biodiversity net gain metrics.\n\n## Governing environmental performance\n\nSSE's Chief Executive has overall lead responsibility for environmental performance, including at Board-level. The Safety, Health and Environment Committee (SHEC) advises the Board on matters relating to safety, health and environment (SHE). The work of the SHEC is designed around SSE's eight SHE Enduring Goals, one of which is Environment: Protecting the environment\n\nand operating in a sustainable way. The SHEC is responsible for setting SHE performance targets, which include environmental performance.\n\nThe SHEC reports to the Sustainability, Safety, Environment Advisory Committee (SSHEAC) which is a Board level committee that has specific oversight of environment matters.\n\nAt business level, Managing Directors are accountable for environmental performance and for managing environmental impacts by applying SSE's SHE Management System.\n\nSSE's Group Environment Policy guides decision making within the company and outlines its commitments around protecting the environment, preventing pollution and operating in a sustainable way. This policy is approved by the SSE Board and is available publicly for SSE's stakeholders at sse.com/sustainability \uf295\n\n.\n\n## A strategic approach to environmental protection\n\nWhile SSE's GHG emissions are its most material environmental impact, it also has wider impacts on the natural world that must be carefully managed. Halting the impact of nature loss and providing opportunities to enhance ecosystems and biodiversity will support SSE to meet its net zero ambitions.\n\nSSE's Environment Strategy provides the framework by which SSE considers these wider environmental impacts. It is centred around three UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) focused on the environment: SDG14 Life Below Water; SDG15 Life Above Land; and, SDG12 Responsible Consumption and Production. The Strategy is supported by policies and procedures to guide SSE's day-to-day operations and interactions with the environment.\n\nTo ensure effective environmental management, SSE operates an environmental management system which sets the controls, processes and procedures. In 2022/23, a number of SSE's business units achieved ISO14001 certification - SSEN Distribution, SSE Energy Customer Solutions and SSE Enterprise. All of SSE's businesses are now certified to ISO14001.\n\nFurther detail around SSE's approach to managing environmental impacts, including information on its ISO14001 certification, can be found in SSE's Sustainability Report 2023 \uf223 .\n\n## O U R   T A R G E T\n\n## SSE is committed to delivering Biodiversity Net Gain by 2025 on all onshore Large Capital Projects in the UK and Ireland\n\n## Understanding SSE's nature impacts and dependencies\n\nSSE operates in some of the UK and Ireland's least populated places, home to a wide variety of valuable ecosystems and habitats. It works to manage the impacts of its activities to ensure it protects and, where possible, enhances these environments. Measurable, science-based data as presented in SSE's Sustainability Report 2023 \uf223 are key to ensuring nature impacts and dependencies are understood and considered in decision making with the aim of making progress towards preserving and protecting nature.\n\n## Targeting biodiversity net gain\n\nFor onshore Large Capital Projects, all of SSE's Business Units have committed to delivering no 'net loss' in biodiversity on those consented from 2023 onwards and 'net gain' in biodiversity on those consented from 2025 onwards.\n\nSSE's approach to Biodiversity Net Gain began in 2020, with the development of SSEN Transmission's site optioneering toolkit, which is now in implementation and allows consideration of biodiversity at the earliest stages of development and has been recognised for its pioneering approach. In 2022, SSE Renewables also published optioneering toolkits and project biodiversity net gain metric, which has adapted the SSEN site optioneering toolkit and the Defra Biodiversity Metric 3.1. Biodiversity net gain will also be delivered by SSEN Distribution as part of its ED2 business plan. While SSE has focused on terrestrial habitats it is also exploring the potential for enhanced biodiversity within the marine environment.\n\n## Managing water use\n\nWater plays a significant role in SSE's operations, being used in the energy production process including as a coolant in power stations and a source for power generation in hydroelectric generators. SSE also uses water as an amenity in its buildings.\n\nSSE has policies and processes in place, and works closely with environmental regulators, to ensure that it uses water in a sustainable way in its operations. SSE has an ongoing investment programme within its hydro operations to improve efficiency, enhance water capture and minimise spill from its plant.\n\nNone of SSE's thermal and hydro generation assets impact on water stressed areas, as defined by the relevant environmental regulators in the jurisdictions in which they operate.\n\nIn 2022/23, total water abstracted by SSE fell to 23,354 million m 3 from 23,896 million m 3 the previous year. This was largely due to a reduction in water passing through SSE's hydro generation plant as a result of lower levels of rainfall compared to the previous year. The vast majority (97%) of water abstracted in 2022/23 was used in SSE's hydro generation operations. This water is technically recorded as abstracted, but it passes through turbines to generate electricity and is returned to the environment almost immediately, and therefore has minimal environmental impact.\n\nSSE's total water abstracted excluding hydro operations also fell slightly over this period. This was predominantly due to an unplanned outage at a thermal power station that uses a once through (direct) cooling water system. Such assets have higher abstraction rates than stations with cooling tower systems.\n\nTotal water abstracted by SSE (excluding hydro generation) (million m 3 )\n\n- Fresh water (rivers and groundwater)\n- Brackish and estuarine water\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2022/23\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTotal water consumed increased significantly over this period, by over 70%. This was due to increased output from thermal generation overall, as well as a proportional increase in the output from thermal power plant with cooling towers which have higher evaporative losses of water than once through (direct) cooling systems.\n\nTable 4: SSE's water data\n\n|                                                                            | Unit        | 2022/23    | 2021/22    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------|------------|\n| Water use                                                                  |             |            |            |\n| Total water abstracted                                                     | Million m 3 | 23,354 (A) | 23,896 (B) |\n| Total water abstracted   (exc.

The falling trend across three of these key air emission sources, reflects a reduction in output from oil-fuelled peaking plant in Ireland compared to the previous year.\n\nMercury emissions to air increased almost fivefold, due to an increased level of test running on back-up fuel oil that was required during the year, as dictated by Transmission Operator on the island of Ireland. See Table 5 for full data on air emissions.\n\nSulphur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) is a highly effective insulating gas used for safety in electrical transformers and in 2022/23, SSE's SF 6 emissions increased by almost 40% compared to the previous year. This was due to a combination of factors, including more robust reporting of minor leakages and increasing numbers of assets (to deliver net zero) that still requires SF 6 as an insulating gas. SSE has a number of initiatives to reduce its dependency on SF 6 in its networks, including working with suppliers to install SF 6 -free alternatives across its electricity transmission network. You can read more about what SSE is doing to reduce the impact of SF 6 in its business activities in its Sustainability Report 2023 \uf223 and its Net Zero Transition Plan.\n\n## SSE's energy consumption\n\nBetween 2021/22 and 2022/23, the energy SSE purchased for use in its assets (offices, depots, thermal power stations, gas storage facilities, and data centres) increased by 5%, from 196GWh to 206GWh.\n\nA large contributor to this trend was a 60% increase in energy consumed in SSE's gas storage facilities compared to 2021/22. This was largely due to increased gas storage activities at SSE's Aldbrough facility to ensure security of supply.\n\nEnergy consumed in SSE's offices, depots and data centres reduced by 5% compared to 2021/22. This was due to the continued investment by SSE in 2022/23 in a range of energy efficiency measures including a programme of LED lighting upgrades to depot sites and it continued its 'Better Off' behaviour change campaign.\n\nIn 2022/23, SSE purchased 100% of its electricity for use in its directly managed offices from renewable sources, backed by renewable guarantees. In 2022/23, around 52% of the electricity that SSE purchased for its assets (offices, depots, thermal power stations, gas storage facilities, and\n\n## Table 5: SSE's air emissions data\n\nTable 7: SSE's waste data by end destination\n\n|                                                                                                                 | Unit          | 2022/23       | 2021/22       |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Air emissions                                                                                                   | Air emissions | Air emissions | Air emissions |\n| Sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ) - thermal  generation                                                                   | Tonnes        | 1,336         | 3,021         |\n| Nitrogen oxide (NOx) - thermal  generation                                                                      | Tonnes        | 3,870         | 4,573         |\n| Sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) -   thermal generation and   electricity transmission and  distribution activities | Kg            | 424           | 305           |\n| Particulates emissions (PM10)   from thermal generation assets                                                  | Tonnes        | 116           | 277           |\n| Mercury emissions from   thermal generation assets                                                              | Kg            | 10.6          | 2.2           |\n\n## Table 6: SSE's energy use data\n\n|                                                            | Unit   | 2022/23   | 2021/22   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|-----------|\n| Energy use*                                                |        |           |           |\n| Purchased heat from non- renewable sources - UK/Ire        | GWh    | 3.3/0.06  | 3.3/0.08  |\n| Purchased electricity from  renewable sources - UK/Ire     | GWh    | 103.7/1.1 | 73.3/0.98 |\n| Purchased electricity from non- renewable sources - UK/Ire | GWh    | 97.9/0    | 118.6/0   |\n\n*  This information, taken in conjunction with Table 2 on page 49 \uf150 , represents SSE's disclosures in line with the UK Government Streamlined Energy and Carbon Reporting requirements.\n\ndata centres) was from renewable sources, up from around 39% the previous year.\n\nSSE is a member of the Climate Group's EP100 initiative to encourage businesses to double energy productivity associated with office and depot buildings by 2030 from a 2011 baseline.\n\n## Embedding circular economy principles\n\nCircularity is built on the principles of reducing waste, increasing resource efficiency, and promoting renewable energy sources. By adopting circular strategies, SSE is able to minimise its environmental impact, enhance operational efficiency, strengthen resilience to resource shortages and create new value for stakeholders. SSE is\n\nintroducing the concepts of circularity into its business activities and is collaborating with stakeholders to create solutions for industry-wide challenges and support circular supply chains.\n\nTable 7 outlines SSE's key waste data, including by end destination. In 2022/23, SSE managed 6,063 tonnes of waste, up from 5,287 tonnes in 2021/22. This increase was due to SSE widening the scope and improving the accuracy of its waste data. SSE's target for 2022/23 was to divert 85% of waste by tonnage from landfill and recycle 40% of waste by tonnage. It exceeded these targets, with 65% of SSE's total waste being recycled/composted and only 5% being sent to landfill. The proportion of waste sent to landfill more halved compared to the previous year,\n\n## Data and assurance\n\nSSE takes an integrated approach towards assurance utilising internal audit and external assurance providers to ensure accurate, complete disclosures. Where data has been externally and independently assured, this has been noted in the relevant tables. In all other areas, data is identified and disclosed according to SSE's internal processes, guided by environmental regulations where appropriate.\n\nwith a higher proportion of waste being processed as energy from waste and an increase in recycled waste as well, as a result of improved recycling processes implemented at sites and as the inclusion waste recycling data such as metals.\n\nOver 2023/24, SSE expects to further broaden the coverage of waste performance data to include large capital projects and minor works. SSE's 2023/24 performance target is to divert 95% of waste by tonnage from landfill and recycle 50% of waste by tonnage. It is expected that the planned scope expansion of waste data in 2023/24 will influence performance, in particular recycled waste data. SSE will continue to review its waste target to ensure that it remains stretching.\n\n|                                         |                                         | 2022/23   | 2021/22   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Total waste produced                    | Tonnes                                  | 6,063     | 5,287     |\n| Proportion of total waste:              |                                         |           |           |\n| Sent to landfill                        | %                                       | 5%        | 12%       |\n| Processed as energy from waste          | %                                       | 29%       | 25%       |\n| Recycled                                | %                                       | 62%       | 59%       |\n| Composted/sent to anaerobic digestion % | Composted/sent to anaerobic digestion % | 3%        | 1%        |\n| Treated                                 | %                                       | 2%        | 4%        |\n| Hazardous waste                         | Tonnes                                  | 144.4     | 147.9     |\n\nData excludes waste data from contractors for large capital projects, minor works contracts and some specialised waste streams.\n\n## Engagement in action\n\nSuppliers, contractors and partners\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## A coalition for circularity in the wind sector\n\nSSE Renewables' wind portfolio in the UK and Ireland comprises some of the most productive onshore wind generation assets in Europe. The optimum maintenance of those assets further maximises value to SSE, whilst contributing to climate mitigation solutions. The opportunity to maintain the components of those assets using circular economy principles (reduce, reuse, repair, remanufacture, recycle, and recover) is emerging as an important driver of future commercial, social and environmental value.\n\nSSE Renewables is driving forward a strategy to increase the use of refurbished and remanufactured minor component parts for the maintenance and repair of existing components across its wind portfolio, with particular focus on its onshore portfolio in the immediate term. Through a partnership with Scottish-based SME, Renewable Parts Ltd, rather than replacing broken turbine gears with newly manufactured gears, Renewable Parts refurbish and repair existing components to a high standard, with high-performance outcomes. This practical solution has been\n\ninstructive to establishing a wider circular model throughout the wind industry supply chain.\n\nTo support the acceleration of a circular economy for the wind sector based in the UK, this year SSE Renewables, the University of Strathclyde and Renewable Parts joined forces to launch CWIC, the Coalition for Wind Industry Circularity. CWIC aims to stimulate collaboration between industry peers, suppliers, and government agencies to unlock and deliver economic, social, and environmental opportunities. There are immediate opportunities in the repair and maintenance of existing wind assets, and a longer-term prize through the design of future wind technology both onshore and offshore.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Ensuring a just transition\n\nA sustainable transition to net zero is one that is fair to working people, consumers and communities. SSE seeks to ensure the benefits of net zero are shared widely and unfairness is predicted and preempted. Influencing a fair and just transition to net zero is a strategic objective for SSE.\n\n## Leading on a just transition\n\nSSE published its Just Transition Strategy in November 2020, setting out the 20 principles it will follow to ensure that the impacts from the decisions it takes are fair and that it maximises the opportunities for communities to benefit from net zero. The 20 principles sit under five key themes: good green jobs, consumer fairness, building and operating new assets, looking after people in high-carbon jobs, supporting communities.\n\nWith SSE's Just Transition Strategy, and a subsequent report focused on the worker transition in 2021, SSE continued extensive multi-stakeholder engagement in the pursuit of a net zero transition that is fair to working people, consumers and communities.\n\nThis has taken several different forms including:\n\n- \u00b7 Just transition documentary : A short documentary featuring voices of SSE employees with the lived experience of transitioning from high- to low-carbon work, supplemented by the perspectives\n\nof the Prospect trade union and environmental NGO WWF aimed to bring the notion of a just transition to life. The film explains that a just transition is about protecting workers and communities in the face of substantial industrial change and that people must be at the centre of efforts to tackle climate and nature crises. This documentary has been shared widely with stakeholders including trade unions, investors, and NGOs, and was also shown to over 1,660 employees.\n\n- \u00b7 Multi-stakeholder event: An event in London in April 2023 aimed to normalise the just transition within corporate climate discourse, enhancing accountability and bringing the just transition from concept to action. The objectives included establishing a sense of collaboration and openness around a just transition; showing SSE's good stewardship of its own transition to net zero and highlighting the business benefits that come from establishing the world's first business strategy for a just transition.\n- \u00b7 Measuring progress report: A progress update published in April 2023 in which SSE set out to demonstrate the impact its 20 principles for a just transition have had across the business. These specifically aim to promote a smooth, fair and just transition to net zero by disclosing progress (or otherwise) against the Just Transition Strategy.\n\nMore details on the report and the short documentary can be found at sse.com/ sustainability/just-transition/ \uf295\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SSE's UK and Irish GDP contribution, jobs supported and taxes paid for 2022/23\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sharing the benefits from net zero\n\n## Contributing to jobs and GDP\n\nUnder its revised Net Zero Acceleration Programme Plus, SSE plans to invest \u00a318bn in the five years to March 2027. This scale of investment generates considerable value for the communities in which SSE operates.\n\nEvery year SSE commissions an independent assessment of the value it adds to GDP and the jobs it supports across the UK, Scottish and Irish economies. Over 2022/23, SSE contributed an estimated \u00a36.04bn to UK and \u20ac429m to Irish GDP. This represented a slight increase compared to 2021/22 figures, which were \u00a35.98bn and \u20ac417m respectively (adjusted for current prices). Jobs supported in these countries fell from 47,130 in 2021/22 to 42,370 in 2022/23, due to a reduction in supply chain spend. More detail on SSE's contribution to GDP and jobs supported in 2022/23 can be found in SSE's Sustainability Report 2023 \uf223 .\n\nSSE's economic contribution reports can be found at sse.com/sustainability \uf295 .\n\n## Paying a fair share of tax\n\nSSE considers the responsible payment of tax a core element of how it shares value with society. While SSE was the first FTSE 100 company to be Fair Tax accredited in 2014, in 2022/23, SSE also became the first company to transition from the Fair Tax Foundation's UK HQ Multinational accreditation to the Foundation's new Global Multinational accreditation.\n\nThe purpose is to demonstrate an ongoing commitment to upholding the principles of fair tax as SSE expands internationally.\n\nOver 2022/23, SSE's total tax contribution was \u00a31.3bn, consisting of \u00a3549m taxes paid (including \u00a3217m corporation tax) and \u00a3764m taxes collected. Further information on SSE's tax position can be found on pages 93 and 237 to 239 \uf150 of this report, and in the Sustainability Report 2023 \uf223 .\n\nSSE is committed to the transparency of its tax affairs and publishes an annual Talking Tax report with enhanced country-bycountry tax disclosures alongside detail of SSE's tax strategy. SSE's Talking Tax reports can be found on sse.com/sustainability \uf295 .\n\n## Sharing value directly with local communities\n\nAn integral part of a just transition is being a positive contributor to local communities by sharing the economic value from its assets and its business activities. During 2022/23, SSE invested around \u00a316.5m in communities across the UK and Ireland. This included \u00a310m awarded through SSE Renewables community funds, \u00a31.4m awarded through SSEN's Resilient Communities Fund, and around \u00a35m of donations made directly to charitable groups by SSE Airtricity to support with the cost of living crisis (see page 64 \uf150 ), alongside smaller contributions from employee-led initiatives.\n\nInvested in communities across the UK and Ireland by SSE in 2022/23.\n\n\u00a316.5m\n\nSSE recognises the exceptional challenges faced by communities because of the cost of living crisis and in 2022/23 consulted with a wide range of stakeholders to understand where community funding could make the biggest difference. With stakeholder approval, SSE focused on investing in projects which would directly help improve energy efficiency and reduce fuel poverty. In November 2022, SSE Renewables' Sustainable Development Fund panel awarded its largest-ever single award of \u00a31m to support the Highland Energy Efficiency Programme which provides energy efficiency measures including solar, battery, air source heating and insulation to households in extreme fuel poverty.\n\nMore detailed disclosure on SSE's community investment can be found in SSE's Sustainability Report 2023 \uf223 , available at sse.com/sustainability \uf295 .",

        "page_content": "## A guarantee of fair and decent work\n\n## Jobs for net zero\n\nWith the scale of growth in energy investment over the next decade, it is essential that action is taken to attract more people into STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Maths) careers, whilst training existing talent to ensure the sector has a future-fit workforce with the skills and talent to deliver net zero.\n\nWithin SSE, at least 1,000 new jobs are expected to be created every year to 2025. Opportunities will be created in a range of role types, which will mean adding to existing skills and delivering new skills as SSE moves into new technologies. To fill these roles, SSE's recruitment strategy seeks to bring new talent into the organisation immediately, at the same time as developing a longer-term pipeline to meet the skills needs of the future.\n\n## New jobs expected to be created every year to 2025\n\n## 1,000\n\nFor the jobs of today, SSE focuses on recruiting new talent through its early careers and pipeline programmes, as well as attracting those from sectors like oil and gas as part of the just transition, and reaching those in wider industries with similar skills such as mining, construction, transport and logistics.\n\nTo support a long-term pipeline, SSE works to inspire young people into STEM careers through strategic partnerships with secondary and primary schools (see SSE's Sustainability Report 2023 \uf223 for details), and over 2022/23 has performed a skills gap analysis to understand key training requirements for existing talent (see 'Developing the future skills required for net zero' on this page for more details).\n\nAt 31 March 2023, SSE's headcount was 12,180, up from 10,754 at 31 March 2022. This includes 100 employees in locations outside the UK and Ireland. To meet the demand of its growing Business Units, the total number of people joining SSE rose from 2,290 in 2021/22, to 3,226 for the same time period in 2022/23. This means that SSE filled a total of 4,401 positions across internal and external recruitment over 2022/23, an increase of 38% from 2021/22. For information about SSE's approach to inclusive and diverse hiring, see its Inclusion and Diversity Report 2023 \uf223 .\n\nSSE's employee retention level in 2021/22 was 90.5%, which remained slightly elevated compared to pre-pandemic rates. In 2022/23, retention decreased to 89.5% reflecting a return towards pre-pandemic labour market conditions. SSE's 2022/23 voluntary turnover rate was 7.0%, compared to 7.8% in 2021/22.\n\n## Developing the future skills required for net zero\n\nSSE's investment in learning, training and development increased to \u00a310.4m in 2022/23 from \u00a37.5m in 2021/22. Average training hours per full-time employee was 19.8, a decrease from 20.7 in 2021/22, with 85.5% of SSE's employees receiving some form of training over the year.\n\nCore to SSE's strategy to build its future workforce is consistent investment in its pipeline programmes. These pipeline programmes include apprenticeships, technical skills trainee programmes and graduate programmes. The number of people on one of SSE's pipeline programmes increased to 564, compared to 465 individuals in 2021/22. Investment in pipeline programmes increased to \u00a312.8m in 2022/23 from \u00a39.8m in 2021/22. This brings SSE's total investment in pipeline programmes over the last three years to just over \u00a330m.\n\n## Total investment in learning, training and pipeline programmes in 2022/23\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOver 2022/23, SSE identified the critical skills of its workforce required to deliver its Net Zero Acceleration Programme (NZAP). Actions have been identified to develop the skills of new and existing talent for the key roles it recognises as facing potential skills shortages. This approach to development and training is especially important for skills gaps that recruitment alone will not solve.\n\nTargeted investment and focus was given to a series of specific skills gaps and shortages across the SSE Group, from upskilling existing electrical jointers, to developing new roles in system planning to support smart grids. Simultaneously, SSE is working to understand the skills required for new technologies of the future, for jobs that may not exist today, but which may be required to be implemented at pace to deliver net zero by 2030.\n\nSSE has also continued to develop its graduate offering to ensure that it attracts future talent into this key early career pipeline. SSE has significantly expanded the number of graduate placements, from 60 participants in 2020/21 to 220 graduates enrolled for the September 2023 scheme which covers 13 different programmes.\n\nMore information on SSE's approach to learning and development and its training programmes can be found in its Sustainability Report 2023 \uf223 .\n\n## Paying a fair wage\n\nFair remuneration is a cornerstone of SSE's approach to being a responsible employer and providing good jobs. SSE is actively involved in the living wage movement. Having been a real Living Wage accredited employer in the UK since 2013, it has also paid the Living Wage in Ireland since 2016 and continues to chair the Living Wage Scotland's Leadership Group.\n\nIn September 2022 in response to the cost-of-living crisis, the Living Wage Foundation announced the new real Living Wage for the UK two months earlier than usual. This saw a 10.1% increase from the 2021 UK rate. SSE welcomed the action taken by the Living Wage Foundation and implemented the increase in November 2022, backdated to the 1 October 2022.\n\nSince its accreditation as a Living Hours employer in March 2021, SSE has been working to roll out this enhanced standard across its supply chain.\n\n## The right to freedom of association and collective bargaining\n\nEveryone in SSE has the fundamental right to freedom of association and to join a trade union. SSE has four recognised trade union partners (Prospect, Unite, Unison and the GMB) which it works with through the Joint Negotiating and Consultative Committee and through regular ongoing dialogue. In 2022/23, 50.3% of SSE's total direct workforce were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Broader incorporation of employee voice is recognised by SSE as an important part of decision-making and strategy. See the stakeholder engagement section on employees on page 28 \uf150 of this report.\n\n## A growing package of employee benefits\n\nSSE offers a wide range of employee benefits, including flexible working arrangements, 21 weeks of fully-paid maternity leave, all-employee share plans, a holiday purchase scheme, cycle-to-work schemes, salary sacrifice low emissions car scheme, and technology loans, amongst other initiatives.\n\nIn November 2022, SSE announced significant improvements to its family leave offering, well beyond the statutory minimum specified in UK and Irish employment law. The enhancements aimed to ensure that all new and prospective parents at SSE feel supported, regardless of personal or family circumstances and where they are on the journey to becoming a parent. This includes an additional seven weeks paid leave for partners, two weeks' full pay pregnancy loss leave, and two weeks' full paid leave for fertility treatment. See SSE's Inclusion and Diversity Report 2023 \uf223 for more information.\n\nOver the course of 2022/23, SSE also enhanced its offering around health and wellbeing support. More detail can be found (see page 63 \uf150 ).\n\n## Embedding a healthy business culture\n\nSSE has well established processes and procedures to embed a healthy business culture at all levels of its business, to support people to do the right thing. SSE's 'Doing the right thing' guide to good business ethics applies to direct employees and those that work on SSE's behalf, and covers a wide range of topics, including bribery and corruption, fair competition, engagement with politicians and regulators, and cyber security. It is supported by a number of internal and external documents to help colleagues to do the right thing, which are outlined throughout the guide. The guide is available publicly at sse.com/sustainability \uf295 and is promoted to all employees through SSE's internal communication channels and mandatory e-learning modules, as well as being highlighted to suppliers in SSE's Sustainable Procurement Code.\n\nSSE also has a suite of mandatory ethics and compliance training modules, including modules on fraud awareness, bribery and anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering and financial sanctions, which all employees must complete bi-annually. Additional modules on competition law and REMIT are required for selected employees.\n\nA review of cultural metrics is undertaken twice annually by the Board supported by a cultural dashboard (see pages 137 and 138 \uf150 ).\n\n## Table 8: Reported incidents of suspected wrongdoing by category\n\nTable 9: Outcomes of investigations into reported incidents of suspected wrongdoing\n\n| Category of incident reported                                                    | 2022/23   | 2021/22   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Health and safety                                                                |           |           |\n| (General Safety/Covid-19/Environmental/Product Contamination)                    | 8         | 9         |\n| Dishonest behaviour (Fraud/Theft/Bribery/Integrity/Money laundering/Corruption)  | 16        | 12        |\n| Conduct                                                                          |           |           |\n| (Bullying/Harassment/Victimisation)                                              | 10        | 15        |\n| Inclusion and diversity                                                          |           |           |\n| (Racism/Discrimination/Unfair Treatment)                                         | 2         | 2         |\n| Drugs/alcohol                                                                    | 5         | 0         |\n| Regulatory Compliance                                                            | 1         | 0         |\n| General                                                                          |           |           |\n| (Data Protection/Policy/Reputation/Corporate Governance/ Failure to Investigate) | 8         | 11        |\n| Total                                                                            | 50        | 49        |\n\n| Outcome of investigation                                                                                                       |   2022/23 |   2021/22 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Dismissal/Resignation                                                                                                          |        10 |         1 |\n| Warning issued                                                                                                                 |         1 |         5 |\n| No action taken                                                                                                                |         0 |         4 |\n| Investigated as grievance                                                                                                      |         1 |         3 |\n| Investigated and partly substantiated but with no action taken                                                                 |        16 |        15 |\n| Investigated but case not proven                                                                                               |        12 |        13 |\n| Initial investigation established insufficient evidence to proceed further                                                     |         4 |         4 |\n| Unable to investigate due to insufficient information to establish  the nature, cause, location or otherwise of the allegation |         1 |         4 |\n| Cases Still Under Investigation                                                                                                |         5 |         0 |\n| Total                                                                                                                          |        50 |        49 |\n\n## Reporting and investigating wrongdoing\n\nA healthy business culture is one where everyone feels able to speak up, in the event of wrongdoing. People that work for SSE, or on its behalf, are encouraged to speak up and are protected from retribution. SSE has an independent whistleblowing channel, hosted by SafeCall, with the option to report anonymously, which supplements internal reporting channels.\n\nThe number of reports of suspected wrongdoing has remained stable year-onyear, with 50 reports made through SSE's speak up channels in 2022/23, compared to 49 the previous year. Every report is triaged and considered for investigation. SSE monitors the trends of Speak Up cases closely. The outcomes of reported incidents and investigations for 2021/22 and 2022/23 are outlined in Table 8 and Table 9.\n\n## Supporting whistleblowers\n\nSSE's Speak Up Aftercare Programme has been designed to promote good communication with people who speak up and provide reassurance that there will be no detriment for anyone speaking up in good faith. The programme takes the form of a survey that is issued at the point of initial complaint, at 90 days and then at 180 days. Each survey is slightly different, having been designed to ensure that there is opportunity to highlight detriment in any form, provide an outlet for discussion and resolutions, and also seek feedback for SSE on the user experience, ease of reporting, what went well and to constantly improve the service SSE is offering.\n\nSSE's Group Whistleblowing Policy is available on sse.com/sustainability \uf295 , with the effectiveness of SSE's whistleblowing arrangements reviewed twice yearly by the Group Executive Committee and the Board.",

        "page_content": "Ensuring a just transition\n\ncontinued\n\n## Promoting inclusion and diversity\n\n## SSE's approach to inclusion and diversity\n\nSSE's Inclusion and Diversity Strategy, launched in 2021, builds on the inclusion and diversity initiatives that SSE has been undertaking since 2014. It is framed on four pillars: Ambition; Education and Development; Inclusive Processes; and Employee Voice.\n\nDelivery of the strategy relies on engagement and effort from many in SSE, and has been informed through collaborating with external partners to identify opportunities for further improvement. It focuses on inclusion for all by listening to underrepresented groups and their unique experiences, and invests leadership development to help shape and influence the actions needed to embed positive change across all levels of the business. Learnings from these initiatives will continue to develop the strategy further.\n\n## Developing leadership to drive inclusion from the top\n\nSSE's has a number of leadership programmes in place, which are designed to build leadership confidence and raise awareness for all to create an inclusive workplace. This includes SSE's Igniting Inclusion Programme, which supports managing directors and Business Unit executive committees to learn about key inclusion and diversity themes, and how these can be practically applied in the workplace. Over 2022/23, SSE also embedded inclusivity throughout its existing Leadership Blueprint, ensuring that leaders build proud and inclusive teams.\n\n## Ambition\n\n## Education and development\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Setting measurable goals\n\nSetting ambitions and KPIs, and using external benchmarking.\n\n## Inclusive processes\n\n## Employee voice\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Embedding best practice\n\nEnsuring policies and processes are inclusive and support everyone.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Actively listening\n\nUnderstanding what matters to employees to inform and shape the improvements needed.\n\n## Focusing on behaviours\n\nBuilding leadership confidence and raising awareness for all to create an inclusive workplace.\n\n## Creating an inclusive employee culture\n\nListening to employees enables SSE to focus business priorities and improve initiatives, whilst also ensuring employees feel valued and have increased opportunities for development. SSE gains insight on employee voice through its 'Belonging in SSE' communities, each of which is sponsored by a Managing Director, and which aim to bring people together across the organisation for open and constructive employee-led discussion. Over 2022/23, SSE increased its members in the 'Belonging in SSE' communities to just over 2,000 and continued to listen to, and engage with, employees on subjects such as intersectionality, culture, ethnicity, and neurodiversity. Each Belonging in SSE community has developed an action plan and every two months they meet with SSE's Group Executive sponsors to discuss progress and opportunities to move forward with their action plans.\n\n## Measuring progress\n\nA key part of SSE's Inclusion and Diversity Strategy is the ability to measure the progress being made as a result of the various initiatives in place. SSE has been tracking progress against a wide range of diversity metrics within the business since 2015, including the proportion of women, ethnic minority, disabled, and LGBTQIA+ employees. Setting measurable ambitions that align with best practice enables SSE to work towards stretching ambitions and monitor its progress against these.\n\n## Inclusion and Diversity Report 2023\n\nSSE publishes an annual Inclusion and Diversity Report, which provides comprehensive information around SSE's Inclusion and Diversity Strategy and progress against it.\n\nFurther information around SSE's approach to inclusion and diversity over 2022/23, the actions it is taking to drive improvements and plans for the coming years, see SSE's Inclusion and Diversity Report 2023 \uf223 , available at sse.com/ sustainability \uf295 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SSE's 2023 gender pay gap\n\nBetween 2021/22 and 2022/23, SSE saw a positive trend in its headline UK gender pay gap statistics. SSE's gender pay gap reduced from 18.0% at 5 April 2022 to 15.3% at 5 April 2023.\n\nThe reduction in SSE's UK median gender pay gap between 2021/22 and 2022/23 has been driven by three main contributing factors:\n\n- \u00b7 Interim cost-of-living pay increase: In recognition of the cost-of-living pressures affecting its employees, on 1 October 2022 SSE brought forward part of its trade union negotiated cost of living increase for 2023, by awarding up to a 5% increase to all employees earning less than \u00a3100,000 annually. The structure of this pay award was to prioritise helping those on lower salaries who are most affected by the rise in living costs, therefore employees received either a 5%, 3%, or 0% increase depending on their salary, with those in the lower pay brackets receiving the highest percentage increase. At SSE representation of women is highest in the lower and lower-middle pay quartiles, resulting in a higher percentage of female employees receiving a 5% pay award. However, the full impact of the 2022/23 pay award on SSE's gender pay gap will not be fully understood until the second part of the award is made for full-year in the first quarter of 2023/24 (backdated to 1 April 2023).\n- \u00b7 Salary uplift for employees on Joint Agreement contracts: SSE introduced a new skill-based Pay Progression model in 2021, which saw employees' salaries being mapped according to their skill-level. This resulted in many employees receiving salary uplifts, mainly those in the lower pay quartile. As SSE has higher female representation in this quartile, this meant a high number of women received a pay increase. Over 2022/23, the positive impact of this new pay model on the gender pay gap has continued with a slightly higher proportion of female employees progressing through the pay progression framework.\n\n## SSE's 2023 UK gender pay gap performance\n\nMedian\n\n15.3%\n\n(2022: 18.0%)\n\nMean\n\n12.1%\n\n(2022: 13.2%)\n\n## UK gender pay gap\n\n- \u00b7 Increasing representation of women in high-paid roles: Over 2022/23, female representation in high-paid roles, classed as those earning over \u00a3100,000 per year, has more than doubled from 25 to 53 female employees, compared to a 50% increase for male employees, from 145 to 217. Due to SSE's female population representing 30% of its workforce, changes such as these have an impact on the median pay gap.\n\nMore detail on SSE's UK gender pay gap, including further data, analysis, and disclosure of the wide range of actions taken to reduce the pay gap, is provided in SSE's Inclusion and Diversity Report 2023 \uf223 .\n\nSSE has voluntarily disclosed its Ireland Gender Pay Gap since 2021, calculating it in line with the UK Gender Pay Gap methodology, based on a snapshot date of 5 April. In December 2022, SSE disclosed its first set of Ireland gender pay gap data in line with the Irish Government's new mandatory gender pay gap requirements which launched in May 2022. This data is calculated using a 30 June snapshot and SSE will publish its 2023 Ireland gender pay gap disclosure later in 2023.

These are outlined in Table 10 and are approved by the Group Executive Committee (GEC) and Boardlevel Nomination Committee.\n\nOver 2022/23, progress has been made across the business, moving SSE closer to achieving its medium- and long-term targets. Female representation on the Board is currently 42%, following changes to the Board which took effect post 31 March 2023, which remains above the 40% Board Policy target. Full details of changes across membership and Nomination Committee focus are set out on pages 115 and 142 to 149 \uf150 . The representation of women in the GEC and direct reports has increased from 22.4% at 31 March 2022 to 34% at 31 March 2023, representing maintenance of the progress disclosed in the 2022 Annual Report and offering a strong platform for continued work towards the 2025 ambition of 40%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Table 10: SSE's gender data for senior levels and all employees at 31 March in each year 2022/23\n\nTable 12: Total Recordable Injury Rates for SSE's employees and contractors\n\n|                                                          | Year    | Ambition                                           | % Female (Male/  Female headcount)   | 2021/22 % Female (Male/  Female headcount)   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Board 1                                                  | Ongoing | 50%, with no less  than 40% female  representation | 46% (7/6)                            | 50% (6/6)                                    |\n| Group Executive  Committee (GEC) 2                       | -       | -                                                  | 27% (8/3)                            | 25% (6/2)                                    |\n| GEC 2  and direct  reports (excl.  administrative roles) | 2025    | 40% female                                         | 34% (54/28)                          | 22.4% (45/13)                                |\n| Leadership Group 3                                       | 2030    | 40% female                                         | 25% (812/274)                        | 23.7% (681/212)                              |\n| All employees                                            | 2030    | 33% female                                         | 30%  (8,525/3,655)                   | 28.8%  (7,658/3,096)                         |\n\n- 1 As at 23 May 2023, the Board has 42% female representation (seven men and five women), see page 149 \uf150 for more detail.\n- 2 In the context of gender reporting, the GEC includes all members of the GEC and the Company Secretary. This is the definition of senior managers in SSE for the purposes of s414C(8)(c)(ii).\n- 3 Employees in SSE's senior level pay grades.\n\n## Wider diversity targets\n\nSSE tracks progress against a range of diversity metrics, including the proportion of ethnic minority, disabled, and LGBTQIA+ employees. Senior leaders focus on progress as part of broad internal inclusion and diversity ambitions quarterly, and these metrics are reviewed twice yearly by the GEC and the Board. SSE understands that transparency supports inclusion and diversity progress, and therefore is working to increase the proportion of employees disclosing their diversity data to SSE, so that it can improve external disclosure as it becomes feasible to do so.\n\nOver 2022/23, SSE has developed its ethnicity pay gap analysis, in line with the UK Government guidelines published in April 2023. SSE is using this data for internal analysis and aims to publish its ethnicity pay gap when employee disclosure rates are high enough to ensure anonymity and\n\nprovide meaningful insight. At 31 March 2023, SSE had an employee disclosure rate of 39% of the total employee population for diversity metrics including ethnicity, sexual orientation, and disabilities, an increase from 32% the previous year. SSE's diversity data based on the population of employees disclosing this information is provided in Table 11. Increasing employees' voluntary disclosure of their diversity data, even if they select 'prefer not to say', is essential in order for SSE to set ambitions, develop strategies, and gain learnings that will increase diversity within the business. See SSE's Inclusion and Diversity Report 2023 \uf223 for details about how SSE is working to increase diversity data disclosure rates.\n\nAn ethical business culture alongside inclusion and diversity are directly linked to the Group Principal Risk of People and Culture - full details are available on page 75 \uf150 .\n\n## Table 11: SSE's wider diversity data at 31 March in each year*\n\n| Diversity category   |   Year |   Ambition  (% of employees) |   2022/23 (% of employees) |   2021/22 (% of employees) |\n|----------------------|--------|------------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Disability           |   2030 |                            8 |                        8.9 |                        6.8 |\n| Ethnic Minority      |   2030 |                           15 |                        8.1 |                        6.3 |\n| LGBTQIA+             |   2030 |                            8 |                        3.8 |                        3.6 |\n\n*  Data is collected on SSE's HR data reporting system 'Harmony'. Gender has a 100% completion rate, and is based on biological sex. Disability, Ethnic Minority, and LGBTQIA+ data is voluntarily disclosed by employees, with a 39% disclosure rate at 31 March 2023 and a 32% disclosure rate at 31 March 2023. Data excludes those without facility to share information on Harmony.\n\n.\n\n## Protecting health, safety and wellbeing\n\n## Monitoring health and safety performance\n\nSafety remains SSE's first priority with the objective that 'everyone gets home safe' and that focus is all the keener following the tragic death of Liam Macdonald, a young contractor working on Shetland, in June 2022.\n\nThe Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) for direct employees and contractors combined was 0.19 per 100,000 hours worked, up from 0.17 in 2021/22. This increase reflects a significant surge in investment and construction, and an associated rise in contractor hours worked. Further detail on SSE's TRIR is outlined in Table 12, with additional information on contractor safety outlined on pages 66 and 164 \uf150 .\n\nSSE seeks to embed a strong safety culture and to ensure that all those working on its behalf feel confident to speak up around safety. In SSE's 2022 all-employee survey, which had a 79% response rate, 92% of employees said that their manager sets the right example when it comes to Safety, Health and Environment and 94% said that SSE makes it easy for people to do the right thing on Safety, Health and Environment.\n\nDetailed information on SSE's health and safety performance over 2022/23 is provided in the Safety, Sustainability, Health and Environment Advisory Committee report on pages 162 to 165 \uf150 of this report and in the Sustainability Report 2023 \uf223 .\n\n## Taking a holistic approach to wellbeing\n\nIn 2021/22, SSE undertook a strategic review of occupational benefits which also included recruitment of a dedicated Head of Health and Wellbeing. The review recognised that while a very good range of support was already in place, there were opportunities for some services to be used more and/or expanded upon.\n\nBuilding upon the outcomes of the strategic review and recognising the impact which Covid and the cost of living crisis have had on employees' wellbeing, over 2022/23 SSE developed a holistic range of benefits which support physical, mental and financial wellbeing.\n\nIn addition to providing a wider range of support services, a key focus in 2022 was to make it easier for employees to access the right form of support when they need it. As a result, SSE launched the Health Hub, an online portal with clear signposting to all of\n\n|                                                           | Unit                      |   2022/23 |   2021/22 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Total Recordable Injury Rate  - employees and contractors | Per 100,000  hours worked |      0.19 |      0.17 |\n| Total Recordable Injury   Rate - employees                | Per 100,000  hours worked |      0.1  |      0.09 |\n| Total Recordable Injury  Rate - contractors               | Per 100,000  hours worked |      0.34 |      0.32 |\n\nthe wellbeing support and guidance available to employees.\n\n## Increased investment in employee health\n\nOver 2022/23, SSE made a significant investment to enhance the health support it provides to its employees. One of the key investments it made was the launch of a new service, WeCare, which enables employees in the UK and Northern Ireland to access free online GP appointments within 48 hours and access to a private prescription service, to help colleagues receive the medical care they need. WeCare can be used by all UK and Northern Ireland employees, as well as their immediate family who live in the same home, and it also offers 24/7 support on physical and mental health issues, general wellbeing and financial and legal matters. Employees in Ireland can receive similar support through SSE's partnerships with VHI Healthcare.\n\nIn 2022, SSE also launched a pilot scheme in partnership with the British Heart Foundation providing employees with free health assessments. The service was accessed by over 150 colleagues in 2022/23 and SSE plans to make it more widely available in 2023/24.\n\nThese initiatives build upon a strong foundation of existing support services including Nuffield mental health and musculoskeletal support, comprehensive Employee Assistance Programmes, a suite of toolkits covering mental health, menopause and other health issues, a series of health and wellbeing webinars and Nudge, a financial education resource.\n\nSafety and the Environment remains as a Principal Risk to the Group, further details on how this is mitigated can be found on page 77 \uf150 .\n\n<!-- image -->",

SSE Airtricity responded through a combination of keeping tariffs as low as possible for all consumers through not passing through the full impact of wholesale costs, a price freeze for financially vulnerable consumers and customer support funds. The business also honoured its commitment not to make a profit in the year. Residual profits of \u20ac8.6m were distributed to ROI domestic customers in full, after the yearend in April 2023, amounting to a credit of \u20ac35 per customer.\n\nShort-term measures, however, are not a long-term solution to high energy costs and a reliance on unpredictable sources of energy. Therefore, the need to accelerate the delivery of renewable energy generation\n\nEngagement in action\n\nEnergy customers\n\nand accelerated energy efficiency rollout for homes and businesses is more important now than ever. It is this multi-track approach, supporting customers in the short-term, with industry and government working together in the medium-term for a secure, clean and affordable future energy system.\n\n## Powering greener homes and businesses\n\nSSE Business Energy helps business customers of all sizes across the UK to reduce their carbon emissions through its green electricity offering. All SSE Business Energy green electricity is backed by Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin (REGOs) and is independently verified. In addition to this, SSE Airtricity has a 50% ownership share in Activ8 Solar Energies, which carried out over 1,500 domestic solar installations in 2022/23, with further\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supporting customers through exceptional times\n\nSSE Airtricity provided a holistic range of practical measures up to the value of \u20ac25m, including targeting families who are struggling financially. This has included:\n\n- \u00b7 Price promise: SSE Airtricity held energy costs at June 2022 levels until the end of March 2023, for up to 60,000 financially vulnerable customers.\n- \u00b7 Discretionary fund: a \u20ac1m discretionary fund was created to provide direct support to customers in difficulty.\n- \u00b7 Energy efficiency measures: to help tackle one of the root causes of fuel poverty, SSE Airtricity supported vulnerable households with energy efficiency. This has included delivering home energy upgrades for up to 600\n\nvulnerable households, at no cost, and a \u20ac2.5m donation to not-for-profit organisation EnergyCloud, which will help divert surplus renewable energy to up to 10,000 fuel poor homes across Ireland.\n\n- \u00b7 Working with partners to support households: over 2022/23, SSE Airtricity made donations to trusted charity partners to support households in need of financial assistance across the island of Ireland, regardless of who their supplier is. This included a \u20ac1m donation to St Vincent de Paul (SVP) and donations totalling \u00a32m to Bryson Charitable Group.\n- \u00b7 Energy Bill Relief Scheme: Airtricity also applied discounts to the value of \u00a3116m in the year to customers under the UK Government's Energy Bill Relief Scheme.\n\nplans to deliver up to 40,000 installations over the next 10 years. This activity is also helping to support local jobs, with the creation of 200 highly skilled green jobs over the next two years announced by Activ8 in 2022, supporting a just transition towards net zero.\n\nEnergy Affordability remains a Principal Risk to the Group, for further details please see page 73 \uf150 .\n\nThe number of customers benefiting from Airtricity holding prices at June 2022 levels was\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Providing an inclusive service to network customers\n\nSSEN Distribution's Priority Service Register (PSR) is the mechanism to target support for people in vulnerable situations. The PSR provides support for customers who require adapted services, or who may need additional support, particularly in the event of power cuts. It is therefore critical that the Register is comprehensive, accurate and captures all those in need.\n\nTo achieve that aim, in March 2023 a new website thepsr.co.uk \uf295 was created through a collaborative initiative led by SSEN Distribution and including 10 Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) and Gas Distribution Network Operators (GDNs). This website brings together individual registers from DNOs and GDNs, making it easier to raise awareness of the additional support available nationwide. Furthermore, the website supports external partners such as local and national charities and NHS Trusts to promote the PSR to their customer base through a clear process.\n\n## Unlocking a just transition for network customers\n\nSSEN Distribution is at the forefront of enabling net zero at a local level, operating the electricity distribution network that will facilitate new forms of heating, battery storage and many more electric vehicles. In March 2023, it published a report which explores how net zero can be delivered fairly for consumers, ensuring people can participate in and benefit from the energy transition.\n\nThe report, titled A Fair Energy Future \uf223 , details the partnerships and innovation projects SSEN Distribution has undertaken to explore and understand the new energy challenges that consumers will face in the\n\nnext two decades with technology rapidly advancing and high-carbon heating and transport being phased out.\n\nIn addressing these critical issues, SSEN Distribution has created an action plan for delivering a just transition for energy consumers. With 10 commitments, it will progress alongside further recommendations for the energy industry and policy makers to help unlock the benefits of net zero for all consumers.\n\nSSEN Distribution's commitments cover a range of areas, including: supporting knowledge-sharing and collaboration; addressing emerging vulnerabilities resulting from the transition to net zero; ensuring equal access to electricity infrastructure; and, supporting remote and rural communities, which may be off-grid, to benefit from the electricity system of the future.\n\nThe full report can be found at ssen.co.uk \uf295 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Creating new standards in equal EV access\n\nIn October 2020 SSEN Distribution established 'Equal EV', a collaboration with Disabled Motoring UK (DMUK) to identify the unique enablers and barriers faced by drivers with vulnerabilities adopting electric vehicles (EVs) and the role of technologies and Distribution Network Operators in removing barriers. The insights gained from the work have been instructive and have supported the inclusion of a commitment to improve accessibility at public charge points for disabled users in the UK Government's Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Strategy.\n\nIn 2022, the Equal EV project fed into the creation of the British Standard Institution (BSI) PAS 1899, a new specification on accessible public charge points for EVs covering the design of charge points, including the location spacing and surrounding environment, as well as the appropriate information, signals and indicators to be provided.\n\nIn addition, Disabled Motoring UK (DMUK) launched a parking standard called the Disabled Parking Accreditation (DPA) which signposts off-street car parks that are accessible to disabled people and will soon include a dedicated section on EV charge point provision.",

SSE's contractor TRIR increased slightly compared to 2021/22 performance and there was a contractor fatality on Shetland in June 2022. See the Safety, Sustainability, Health and Environment Advisory Committee report on pages 162 to 165 \uf150 of this report for more information around SSE's response to this incident.\n\nGiven the rise in contractor hours worked in SSE's current growth phase, there is a need for a strategy that builds stronger, more collaborative relationships with supply chain partners to keep everyone safe.\n\nA dedicated, Group-level contractor safety team was established in early 2023 to ensure partners are fully supported and performance is monitored across all of SSE's large capital projects.\n\n## Mitigating modern slavery in the supply chain\n\nOver 2022/23, SSE continued to deliver its Modern Slavery Action Plan. Key developments over the year included the rolling out its updated modern slavery clause and Living Hours clause into supplier contracts, and completion of onsite modern slavery audits.\n\nSSE finalised the programme of onsite modern slavery audits for three of its key sites, which have been undertaken by third party organisation Stronger Together since 2021/22. Findings showed that health, safety, and labour standards were very high on all three sites assessed and that risk of modern slavery was very low. The gap analysis highlighted key improvement areas, including around risk identification, supplier due diligence and training, which have been embedded in SSE's Action Plan.\n\nDeep dive assessments for high risk areas of SSE's business activities continued. Work was undertaken with Slave Free Alliance to identify risk associated with Solar and\n\nEngagement in action Suppliers, contractors and partners\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Supply chain learnings from COP27\n\nSSE participated in climate debates on the fringe of COP27 in Egypt in November 2022. SSE's objective in its attendance was to further the case for net zero through the practical demonstration and example of its investments in low-carbon infrastructure in the UK, Ireland and beyond.\n\nOne further objective was to learn from international experiences in relation to the mining and extraction of metals and minerals critical to the technology required by SSE's investments.\n\nSSE actively participated in discussions and panels on the just transition, considering issues through the lens of indigenous communities, many of whom host the commercial mining of minerals such as cobalt, lithium and silicon.\n\nThe result of the engagement was an understanding of the importance of 'FPIC' principles (free, prior and informed consent) and an imperative to work more closely with the most strategic suppliers on efforts to ensure components contained within the manufactured capital assets SSE procures are sourced from responsible sources.\n\nThe engagement at COP27 was particularly instructive to SSE and has led to the development of a workstream that can deliver a transition to net zero in a responsible and ethical way. This work, directly with suppliers, is in addition to ongoing human rights work with the Sustainability Supply Chain School and industry collaborations including Utilities Against Modern Slavery and Scotland Against Modern Slavery.\n\nBattery projects, and mitigation actions are ongoing. SSE Renewables increased focus on high-risk areas such as vessels which service offshore wind farms to identify key risk areas and ensure additional due diligence is put in place where required.\n\nIn addition, SSE continued to actively participate in a number of industry working groups and initiatives that seek to develop best practice and industry-wide approaches to addressing modern slavery.\n\nMore information on SSE's actions to mitigate the risk of human rights abuses and modern slavery, and the industry collaboration being undertaken, can be found in SSE's Sustainability Report 2023 \uf223 .\n\nHealthy supply chains influence SSE's exposure to the Principal Risks of Large Capital Projects Management and Speed of Change - further details on how these are managed can be found on pages 75 and 77 \uf150 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Non-financial information statement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSSE has reported extensively on its non-financial impacts within its Annual Report for a number of years and welcomes continued increasing focus from regulators, shareholders and other stakeholders.

As highlighted in the Chair's Statement on pages 4 and 5 \uf150 , issues such as safety programmes, affordability, sectoral risks (such as extremely volatile commodity prices and inflationary pressures), extreme weather and climate change have featured heavily in strategic risk discussions.\n\nWhile managing these external challenges, SSE has continued to make substantial progress on the execution and delivery of it's Net Zero Acceleration Programme (NZAP), with in excess of \u00a32.8bn of capital investment including acquisitions delivered during the course of the year. Supporting a just transition through continuing to create options for investment and growth by boosting energy security, supporting communities and creating green jobs, coupled with its balanced mix of businesses, uniquely positions SSE for the transition to net zero and resilience against volatility. These factors along with the ongoing geopolitical crisis in Ukraine having a significant impact on energy affordability and security of supply concerns, formed the basis of the full\n\nreview of SSE's Principal Risks that took place during the financial year.\n\nSSE's risk management process is comprised of four main stages summarised in the diagram below. Continued maturity and refinement of our risk management framework ensures that it remains aligned with SSE's strategy and this year included the review and redrafting of the Group Risk Management Policy which is available to view on sse.com \uf295 .\n\nSSE's sector review on pages 12 to 15 \uf150 provides more detail on the range of external factors that influenced the risk exposures to the Group over the course of the year.\n\n## Board considerations\n\nEffective identification, understanding and mitigation of Principal Risks underpins the Board's approach to setting strategic objectives for SSE and informing strategic decision making (please see page 124 \uf150 for SSE's decision making context). The Board aims to consider all material influencing factors and key external trends in the energy market, including those relating to climate change, technological developments and government policy and aims to do so in a\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nway that reflects the expectations of SSE's key stakeholder groups.\n\nThese material influencing factors also have an impact on the nature and extent of risks the Board is willing to take to meet these objectives, and related mitigation strategies adopted by the Group. Material changes in the nature, proximity and potential impacts of SSE's Group Principal Risks are regularly assessed by the oversight committees and the Business Unit executive committees with appropriate mitigations implemented where necessary.\n\n## Overseeing risk\n\nThe Group Executive Committee and its subcommittees (as detailed on page 122 \uf150 ) have responsibility for overseeing SSE's Principal Risks. During the third quarter of SSE's financial year, an assessment of each Principal Risk is completed by the assigned oversight committee. This assessment requires committee members to provide commentary on contextual changes to the risks, consider whether over the course of the year the risks have become more or less material based on impact and likelihood and to confirm effective mitigations are in place for controlling risks. Consideration is also given to emerging risks and whether any of those identified have the potential to become a Principal Risk to the business in the medium to long-term.\n\nThese responses are then consolidated into reports, one for each Principal Risk, which are presented back to the committees along with the results of provisional viability testing and analysis of relevant, current management information and key information relating to Business Unit Principal Risks and controls. These reports form the basis for the committees to discuss and confirm the risk trend (more, less or equally material), overall effectiveness of the risk control and monitoring environment, and whether any additional control improvement actions are required. This is an inclusive and iterative process that results in considered and objective outputs and a robust assessment of the Principal Risks. The outputs from these committee assessments are then presented to the Group Executive Committee for full review.\n\n## Group Principal Risks\n\n## Risk trend key\n\nAs reflected throughout the Strategic Report, this year exposures to a number of external factors, particularly those driven by macro-economic and geopolitical events, have increased materially. This, in turn, has increased the residual exposures of a number of the Group Principal Risks set out on the following pages, primarily Energy Affordability, Cyber Security and Resilience, Portfolio Exposure and Political and Regulatory Change.\n\nThe graphic below illustrates SSE's 11 Group Principal Risks positioned to highlight the residual risk impact scores against residual likelihood scores following completion of the Principal Risk Self Assessment process.\n\n## Change to individual risk rating Change to individual risk rating\n\n| 1.   | Climate Change                      |\n|------|-------------------------------------|\n| 2.   | Cyber  Security    and Resilience   |\n| 3.   | Energy Affordability                |\n| 4.   | Energy  Infrastructure  Failure     |\n| 5.   | Financial Liabilities               |\n| 6.   | Large Capital Projects  Management  |\n| 7.   | People and Culture                  |\n| 8.   | Political  and    Regulatory Change |\n| 9.   | Portfolio Exposure                  |\n|      | 10.

The output of this was then considered, with any emerging risks or additional material changes resulting from this being proposed to the Board.\n\n## 2022/23 Review Outcome\n\nFollowing the 2022/23 annual review process, the number of Principal Risks to the Group remains at 11 with two revisions of note. The previously named Group Principal Risk of ' Commodity Prices' has\n\nbeen redefined and renamed ' Portfolio Exposure' . The second revision relates to the previously named Group Principal Risk of ' Politics, Regulation and Compliance' which has been redefined and renamed ' Political and Regulatory Change' , both of these revisions have been made in order to better reflect and articulate the risk exposures to the Group.\n\nAn essential tenet of SSE's Risk Management process is the consideration of potential emerging risks and whether any of those identified have the potential to become a Group Principal Risk in the medium to long term. While no new emerging Principal Risks have been identified this year\n\nimportant revisions have been made to the descriptions of each of the Principal Risks to take account of key changes and corresponding mitigations that were introduced during the year.\n\nFull details of the Group Principal Risks are available on pages 72 to 77 \uf150 . Key developments that have influenced the risk exposures to the Group have also been highlighted in detail throughout the Strategic Report.\n\n- Increased in materiality\n- Not changed significantly\n- Reduced in materiality",

        "page_content": "## Risk-informed decision making continued\n\nManaging SSE's risks\n\ncontinued\n\n## Risk Appetite Statement\n\nFundamentally:\n\nThe Group risk appetite remains aligned to the achievement of SSE's strategic objectives. SSE will however only accept risk where it is consistent with its core purpose, strategy and values; is well understood; can be effectively managed; is in line with stakeholder expectations and offers commensurate reward.\n\nThe sectors in which SSE operate are part of a rapidly changing industry subject to a high degree of political, regulatory and legislative change as well as risk arising from other developments including technology, the impact of competition, stakeholders' evolving expectations and climate change. Furthermore, each of SSE's Business Units have differing levels of exposure to additional risks. For example, the Transmission and Distribution businesses are economically regulated and are characterised by relatively stable, inflation linked cash flows while the SSE Renewables business benefits from cash flows linked to government-mandated renewables subsidies. Those Business Units that generate and trade energy are also exposed to significant medium- to longterm energy market and commodity risks in operational and investment decision making.\n\nThe key elements of SSE's Strategic Framework - including SSE's Purpose, Strategy, Goals and Values, as well as the focus of its business model, are fully reflective of its risk appetite (see pages 8 and 9 \uf150 for further details).\n\n- \u00b7 SSE has a clear strategy to create value for shareholders and society in a sustainable way by developing, building, operating, and investing in the electricity infrastructure and businesses needed in the transition to net zero.\n- \u00b7 SSE has a good understanding of the risks and opportunities in the Great Britain and Ireland energy markets and a strong associated knowledge of adjacent EU markets, augmented by its acquisitions. UK and Irish markets, alongside EU markets therefore provide the Group's geographic focus, with expansion into other new international markets being subject to rigorous scrutiny and ensuring the appropriate governance arrangements which are consistent with the Group's values and strategic goals are in place.\n- \u00b7 Safety is SSE's first value and it has no appetite for risks brought on by unsafe actions, nor does it have any appetite for risks brought on by insecure actions including those relating to cyber security. In areas where SSE is exposed to risks for which it has little or no appetite, even though it has implemented high standards of control and mitigation, the nature of these risks mean that they cannot be eliminated completely.\n\nIn determining its appetite for specific risks, the Board is guided by three key principles:\n\n- 1.  Risks should be consistent with SSE's core purpose, financial objectives, strategy and values;\n- 2.  Risks should only be accepted where relevant approvals have been attained through the Governance Framework to confirm appropriate reward is achievable on the basis of objective evidence and in a manner that is consistent with SSE's purpose, strategy and values; and\n- 3.  Risks should be actively controlled and monitored through the appropriate allocation of management and other resources, underpinned by the maintenance of a healthy business culture.\n\nThe Board has overall responsibility for determining the nature and extent of the risk it is willing to take to achieve strategic objectives and for ensuring that risks are managed effectively across the Group.\n\n## Viability Statement\n\nSSE provides the energy needed today while building a better world of energy for tomorrow through creating value for shareholders and society in a stainable way by developing, building, operating and investing in the electricity infrastructure and businesses needed in the transition to net zero. The delivery of SSE's purpose and execution of its strategy depends on the skills and talent of a diverse workforce, the quality of its assets and the effective identification, understanding and mitigation of risk.\n\nAs required within provision 31 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board has formally assessed the prospects of the Company over the next four financial years to the period ending March 2027. The Directors have determined that as this time horizon aligns with the Group's Net Zero Acceleration Programme Plus, which includes a fully funded capital investment programme to 2027, a greater degree of confidence over the forecasting assumptions modelled can be established.\n\nIn making this statement the Directors have considered the resilience of the Group taking into account its current position, the Principal Risks facing the Group and the control measures in place to mitigate each of them. The Directors recognise the significance of the strong balance sheet with total undrawn committed lending facilities as shown above:\n\n|                    |   \u00a3bn | Matures       | Comment                                                                      |\n|--------------------|-------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| SSE plc            |  1.3  | March 2026    |                                                                              |\n| SSE plc            |  0.2  | October 2026  |                                                                              |\n| SSE plc            |  1    | February 2024 | Collateral facility with 1 year  extension option (in favour   of the banks) |\n| SSEN Transmission* |  0.75 | November 2025 | 2, 1 year extension options   (in favour of the Group)                       |\n| SSEN Distribution  |  0.25 | November 2025 | 2, 1 year extension options   (in favour of the Group)                       |\n|                    |  3.5  |               |                                                                              |\n\nThe Group is an owner and operator of critical national infrastructure and has a proven ability to maintain access to capital markets during stressed economic conditions. The Group has demonstrated this through securing \u00a33.0bn of funding since April 2021 including the issuance of a 1bn Euro Hybrid bond in April 2022 and \u20ac650m bond in July 2022. Further detail relating to planned funding is available in A6.3 \uf150 Accompanying Information to the Financial Statements in the Annual Report and Accounts.\n\nThe Group has a number of highly attractive and relatively liquid assets including a regulated asset base which benefits from a strong regulated revenue stream as well as the operational wind portfolio - which provide flexibility of options. This has been demonstrated through the success of the programme of disposals set out by the Group in June 2020 and with the recent sale of a 25% stake in the Transmission business.\n\nTo help support this Statement, over the course of the year a suite of severe but plausible scenarios has been developed for each of SSE's Principal Risks. These scenarios are based on relevant real life\n\nevents that have been observed either in the markets within which the Group operates or related markets globally. Examples include critical asset failure to generation assets (for Energy Infrastructure Failure); changes to key government energy policies (for Political and Regulatory Change); and the physical impacts of climate change on distribution assets through more frequent and increasingly severe storm events (for Climate Change).\n\nScenarios are stress tested against forecast available financial headroom and in addition to considering these in isolation, the Directors also consider the cumulative impact of different combinations of scenarios, including those that individually have the highest impact.\n\nUpon the basis of the analysis undertaken, and on the assumption that the fundamental regulatory and statutory framework of the markets in which the Group operates does not substantively change, and the Group continues to be able to refund its debt at maturity, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due in the period to March 2027.",

As part of the 2022 Directors' Remuneration Policy review, the Remuneration Committee further strengthened the link between sustainability and executive pay by introducing sustainability measures in the long-term incentive (PSP) for the first time. Performance is assessed against SSE's 2030 Goals and also against strategic performance in relation to the implementation of the NZAP strategy. These measures are worth a combined 30% of the overall award.\n\n## Material influencing factors\n\n- \u00b7 The impact of physical risks associated with climate change, such as severe adverse weather that causes damage or interrupts energy supply or generation.\n- \u00b7 The speed of technological developments.\n- \u00b7 Transitional risks relating to developments in political and regulatory requirements related to the products and services that SSE provides.\n- \u00b7 Ensuring the continuation of Large Capital Projects which are fundamental to Group net zero targets.\n- \u00b7 Global and domestic policies including those published by the UK's Committee on Climate Change relating to the 6th carbon budget for the period 2032 and 2037.\n- \u00b7 Political and regulatory engagement.\n- \u00b7 Plans to transition to a decarbonised energy system.\n- \u00b7 Geopolitical events relating to the security of supplies and macroeconomic stress.\n\nStrategic Report\n\nDirectors' Report\n\n## Risk trend key\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIncreased in\n\nmateriality\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNot changed\n\nsignificantly\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cyber Security and Resilience\n\n## Risk trend\n\n## What is the risk?\n\nThe risk that key infrastructure, networks or core systems are compromised or are otherwise rendered unavailable.\n\n## Oversight\n\nGroup Risk Committee\n\n## Link to strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Energy Affordability\n\n## What is the risk?\n\nThe risk that energy customers' ability to meet the costs of providing energy, or their ability to access energy services is limited, giving rise to negative political or regulatory intervention that has an impact on SSE's regulated networks and energy businesses.\n\n## Oversight\n\nGroup Executive Committee\n\n## Link to strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Material influencing factors\n\n- \u00b7 Software or hardware issues, including telecoms networks, connectivity and power supply interruption.\n- \u00b7 Heightened threat of cyber-attacks due to geopolitical events.\n- \u00b7 Increased sophistication and likelihood of ransomware attacks.\n- \u00b7 International expansion.\n- \u00b7 Ineffective operational performance, for example, breach of information security rules or poor management of resilience expertise.\n- \u00b7 Employee and contractor understanding and awareness of information security requirements.\n- \u00b7 Malicious cyber attack.\n\n## Material influencing factors\n\n- \u00b7 Technology changes and innovations to develop sustainable infrastructure and energy solutions.\n- \u00b7 Supply chain cost management.\n- \u00b7 Public policies, including those aimed at reducing carbon emissions and energy consumption.\n- \u00b7 Accessibility to energy and related services for all.\n- \u00b7 Increased focus on energy security in response to current geopolitical events.\n- \u00b7 Required investment in the upgrading of the UK's energy infrastructure to achieve net zero.\n- \u00b7 Political interventions.\n- \u00b7 Fluctuations in the cost of fuels.\n- \u00b7 Supplier and customer failures and related bad debt.\n\n## Link to strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key mitigations\n\n- \u00b7 Policy link: SSE Cyber Security Policy and SSE Data and Information Management Policy.\n- \u00b7 Key technology and infrastructure risks are incorporated into the design of systems and are regularly appraised with risk mitigation plans recommended.\n- \u00b7 SSE conducts regular internal and third-party testing of the security of its information and operational technology networks and systems.\n- \u00b7 Continued strengthening and embedding of the cyber risks and controls framework to continue to identify threats and reduce exposures through, for example, improved use of data analytics and further migration from unsupported systems.\n- \u00b7 Significant longer term Security Programme investment and planning which seeks to strengthen the resilience of the systems on which SSE relies.\n- \u00b7 IT Service Assurance works with individual Business Units to form and agree appropriate service level agreements for business-critical IT services.\n- \u00b7 Business continuity plans are reviewed in response to changes in the threat to the Group and regularly tested.\n- \u00b7 Over the course of the year an updated Cyber Security Culture Strategy was launched.

SSEN Distribution earnings were up year-on-year on higher tariffs and reduced operating and fault costs when compared to the previous year when Storm Arwen had an impact.\n\nWhile market conditions played a part in this year's results, we anticipate a degree of continuing volatility which, combined with\n\nthe rise in variable wind capacity coming onto the system, presents an opportunity for ongoing value creation for our large-scale flexible assets.\n\nSolid strategic progress in the year, including execution of spending plans under the Net Zero Acceleration Programme (NZAP), saw \u00a32.8bn invested in critical national infrastructure - an all-time record level of capex and investment for SSE which represented a 37% increase on 2021/22.\n\nOur balance sheet continues to be underpinned by high-quality assets and credit ratings compare favourably with our peers. In the context of the Group's strong FY23 earnings, net debt to EBITDA fell to 2.7x - well below our 4.5x ceiling.\n\nWe expect to report adjusted EPS of more than 150p for 2023/24, dependent upon market conditions, plant availability and weather conditions. And - as announced in May 2022 - our recent performance, financial strength and growth opportunities give us confidence in the 'NZAP Plus' plans outlined on pages 16 and 17 \uf150 and in the following Financial Review.\n\nOur revised plans mean more value for shareholders and society, more financial strength, more investment, more jobs, and more growth to come over the next decade. The NZAP Plus is the platform for around \u00a318bn of investment in the decarbonising infrastructure needed for a cleaner, more secure and more affordable future energy system.\n\nIn closing, this being my last contribution to an SSE Annual Report, I would like to express my thanks to the many colleagues - past and present - who have so ably supported me throughout my 21 years as Finance Director. It has been an absolute privilege and honour working for 32 years in a company that has such a strong purpose and heritage, driving forward its net zero ambitions.\n\nI leave in the knowledge that the Company's finances are in the safe hands of Barry O'Regan who brings a wealth of energy experience to the role and is ideally placed to help seize the wealth of opportunities coming SSE's way as net zero draws closer.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGregor Alexander Finance Director, SSE plc 23 May 2023\n\n## Financial Review\n\n## Year ended 31 March 2023\n\nThis Group Financial Review sets out the financial performance of the SSE Group for the year ended 31 March 2023.

Nevertheless, the volatile commodity price environment throughout the year combined with the continued higher power price, gas price and inflation rate environment, will have a continued impact on SSE's businesses which can be summarised as follows:\n\n## SSEN Transmission and SSEN Distribution\n\noperate under a regulatory price control framework which is set by Ofgem. Returns under this framework have no direct relationship to power and gas market prices. However, both allowed revenues and Regulated Asset Values are index linked (Transmission to CPI(H) for the RIIO-T2 price control period which lasts from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2026, and Distribution to RPI (for RIIO-ED1 which ended on 31 March 2023) and CPI(H) (for RIIO-ED2 which lasts from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2028).\n\nWithin SSE Renewables , the established hedging approach generally reduces its broad exposure to commodity price variation at least 12 months in advance of delivery. This approach secures value for the business, by reducing exposure to short-term commodity price movements which would drive variable financial performance.\n\nHedges may be achieved either through the forward sale of power or gas and carbon equivalents. This approach aims to reduce the exposure of these wind assets to volatile spot power market outcomes whilst still providing an underlying commodity price hedge. When gas-and-carbon hedges are converted into electricity hedges a 'spark spread' is realised which can lead to changes in the average hedge price expected. This can increase the previously published average hedge price, as has been seen in 2022/23, or decrease it.\n\nWhilst this hedging approach provides relatively stable realised power prices, market volatility in periods where wind volumes are significantly lower than expected can necessitate 'buy-backs' of excess forward sales contracts at higher prices, which would reduce the trading result, as has also been seen in 2022/23.\n\nFor SSE Thermal (as well as the Hydro plant within SSE Renewables), value has come from the ability of the plant to respond to market conditions and provide vital balancing services to support security of supply through flexibility provision in less predictable market conditions.\n\nThe last twelve months has seen the Thermal business navigate extreme volatility in the forward power markets. Whilst some of this volatility is directly attributable to the war in Ukraine and ensuing gas crisis, there are other more fundamental drivers relating to price uncertainty which are longstanding.",

        "page_content": "## Financial Review continued\n\nThese longer-term price drivers include liquidity, carbon price basis risk, regulatory or political interventions, and the availability of risk capital and collateral within the markets. This business therefore aims to reduce earnings volatility by establishing a hedge for the expected economic output in the six months prior to delivery, although this approach is closely monitored for any unexpected changes in exposures as a result of current market conditions, such as the plant availability exposure, counterparty credit risk, and changes to cost of capital for collateral.\n\nHigher power and gas prices are generally more economically favourable for these businesses, driving premiums over forward peak spark prices which includes marketbased income from other sources outside of the simple spark spread such as Balancing Mechanism and ancillary Grid contracts. Income from Capacity Mechanism is known ahead of each delivery year and is unrelated to current market conditions.\n\nHowever, if plant is unavailable at times of system stress then excess forward sales contracts would again need to be 'bought back' in the market which would negatively impact the trading result.\n\nThe Gas Storage assets are operated on a merchant basis, to optimise value arising from changes in the spread between summer and winter prices, market volatility and plant availability. As such, volatile gas prices are generally positive for this business, to the extent that the assets can respond to volatility and capture the positive gas price spreads arising. To the extent that gas remains in storage at the period end, a remeasurement gain or loss may also be recognised with reference to the forward month market price.\n\nEnergy Portfolio Management, as the market-facing commodity trader for each business unit, holds the Group's direct exposure to unsettled commodity contracts and therefore may experience significant unrealised mark-to-market remeasurement gains or losses in periods of volatility. However, these revaluations are unrelated to operating performance with traded volumes backed by SSE's future generation output or expected customer demand. Whilst EPM is permitted to take small positions in the market to manage the Group's trading requirements and execute optimisation opportunities, this is contained within strict Value at Risk ('VAR') limits that limits trading exposure in volatile markets.\n\nDuring the year, market volatility and increased margining requirements resulted in a significant increase in the collateral\n\nrequired for trade with counterparties and on exchanges, this was monitored closely by the Group and effectively managed with more than sufficient levels of liquidity maintained. The level of collateral required has decreased over the second six months of the financial year as older trades have been settled and newer trades have experienced lower levels of volatility.\n\nSSE Business Energy and SSE Airtricity (aside from Northern Ireland, where SSE Airtricity's gas supply business is subject to a regulatory pricing mechanism) are not subject to a regulated price cap and therefore variable tariffs are adjusted dynamically and fixed tariff rates are reset for new customers as wholesale costs increase or decrease. Although the businesses are insulated against gas price rises insofar as they are hedged, there are external circumstances that would result in hedge adjustments such as weather, supplier failures and broader economic conditions. Due to the difficult affordability circumstances created by escalating wholesale prices across the year, a decision was made to protect domestic customers in Ireland from the full impact of these increases; tariff changes therefore did not fully reflect increases in wholesale prices. A dynamic forecasting approach has been implemented to help the business respond quickly to volume changes.\n\nBoth businesses have administered government-backed support schemes during the year, intended to protect domestic and non-domestic customers from the full impact of the heightened power and gas price environment. These schemes provide discounts to customers based on estimated usage and recover amounts from government based on actual customer usage - the most material of these being the Energy Bills Relief Scheme ('EBRS').\n\nIn relation to Airtricity, vertical integration of generation and customer businesses in the Irish market limits commodity exposures with some benefit received through Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariffs ('REFIT') receipts on legacy wind assets.\n\nFinally, SSE Group is well funded with a strong investment grade credit rating; a high proportion of the \u00a38.9bn adjusted net debt (c.92%) is fixed rate and the average maturity of SSE's debt is 6.4 years. The Group has been successful despite challenging debt markets, issuing \u20ac1bn of Hybrid Bonds, a \u00a3350m Private Placement and a \u20ac650m Eurobond earlier in the financial year at well-below current market prices. SSE's balance sheet strength allows the Group to meet additional collateral requirements on higher and more volatile\n\ncommodity contracts, while the high proportion of fixed-rate debt provides robust financing in an inflationary environment.\n\n## Operating profit\n\nAdjusted and reported operating profits/ losses in SSE's business segments for the year to 31 March 2023 are set out below; comparisons are with the same period to 31 March 2022 unless otherwise stated.\n\nSSEN Transmission: Adjusted operating profit decreased by 2% to \u00a3372.7m, which includes a \u00a3(32.8)m minority interest adjustment following completion of the 25% divestment on 30 November 2022. SSEN Transmission's significantly higher allowed revenues in the year were partially offset by a combination of a negative timing impact on lower-than-expected Transmission Network Use of System 'TNUoS' volumes, and increases in operating costs and depreciation charges, as the business continues to grow the asset base and develop its operational capacity.\n\nReported operating profit increased by 7% to \u00a3405.5m, reflecting all of the adjustments above except for the \u00a3(32.8)m minority interest adjustment, as minority interests are fully consolidated for all profit metrics except for Earnings Per Share under IFRS.\n\nSSEN Distribution: Adjusted and reported operating profit increased by 9% to \u00a3382.4m in the period. Higher allowed revenues including previously underrecovered allowances following the impact of coronavirus on Distribution Use of System 'DUoS' volumes in 2020/21, were broadly offset by a negative timing impact on lower-than-expected volumes in 2022/23. In addition, 2022/23 operating costs were lower than prior year mainly driven by a reduction in fault costs, given the impact of severe weather on the network during 2021/22.\n\nSSE Renewables: Adjusted operating profit increased by 2% to \u00a3580.0m in the year. Having experienced exceptionally still and dry weather in he prior year, volumes increased 0.7TWh or 7% in the current year but were still around 1.5TWh or 13% behind planned levels due to less favourable weather than the long-term average and delays to construction of the Seagreen project.\n\nIn line with SSE's hedging approach, SSE Renewables entered the financial year with around 40% of its wind volume hedged in gas and carbon equivalents, rather than electricity. The conversion of those gas and carbon trades into electricity ahead\n\n## Operating profit performance for the year to 31 March 2023\n\n## Business-by-business segmental\n\n|                                                          | Adjusted          | Adjusted          | Reported          | Reported          |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                                          | March   2023   \u00a3m | March   2022   \u00a3m | March   2023   \u00a3m | March   2022   \u00a3m |\n| Operating profit/(loss)                                  |                   |                   |                   |                   |\n| SSEN Transmission                                        | 372.7             | 380.5             | 405.5             | 380.5             |\n| SSEN Distribution                                        | 382.4             | 351.8             | 382.4             | 351.8             |\n| Electricity networks total                               | 755.1             | 732.3             | 787.9             | 732.3             |\n| SSE Renewables                                           | 580.0             | 568.1             | 446.3             | 427.8             |\n| SSE Thermal                                              | 1,031.9           | 300.4             | 1,089.5           | 624.2             |\n| Gas Storage                                              | 212.5             | 30.7              | 249.2             | 125.4             |\n| Thermal total                                            | 1,244.4           | 331.1             | 1,338.7           | 749.6             |\n| SSE Business Energy (GB)                                 | 17.9              | (21.5)            | 17.9              | (21.5)            |\n| SSE Airtricity (NI and Ire)                              | 5.6               | 60.4              | 5.2               | 60.4              |\n| Energy Customer Solutions total                          | 23.5              | 38.9              | 23.1              | 38.9              |\n| Energy Portfolio Management                              | 80.4              | (16.8)            | (2,626.0)         | 2,083.6           |\n| Distributed Energy                                       | (27.4)            | (10.9)            | (33.5)            | (29.2)            |\n| Neos Networks                                            | (39.8)            | (16.1)            | (56.0)            | (140.0)           |\n| Corporate unallocated                                    | (87.0)            | (95.7)            | (26.8)            | (113.5)           |\n| Total operating profit/(loss) from continuing operations | 2,529.2           | 1,530.9           | (146.3)           | 3,749.5           |\n| Net finance (costs)/income                               | (345.6)           | (372.8)           | (59.3)            | (273.2)           |\n| Profit/(loss) before tax from continuing operations      | 2,183.6           | 1,158.1           | (205.6)           | 3,476.3           |\n\nNotes: Table above excludes any result from discontinued operations, being the Group's investment in Scotia Gas Networks Limited which was disposed on 22 March 2022 (2022/23: \u00a3nil; 2021/22: adjusted operating profit of \u00a321.0m) and the Group's Gas Production operations which were disposed on 14 October 2021 (2022/23: adjusted operating profit of \u00a3nil; FY2021/22: adjusted operating profit of \u00a3101.4m).\n\n2021/22 restated to recognise Keadby 2 pre-commissioning revenues and costs in Income Statement following adoption of amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment - Proceeds Before Intended Use.\n\nIn order to present the financial results and performance of the Group in a consistent and meaningful way, SSE applies a number of adjusted accounting measures throughout this financial report. These adjusted measures are used for internal management reporting purposes and are believed to present the underlying performance of the Group in the most useful manner for shareholders and other stakeholders.\n\nFollowing the acquisition in the year of Triton Power Limited (JV with Equinor, SSE's share 50%), the definitions SSE uses for adjusted measures have been refined to consider the treatment of fair value gains arising from acquisition of a business or a joint venture interest. Aside from this refinement, the definitions are consistently applied and a reconciliation of adjusted operating profit by segment to reported operating profit by segment can be found in note 5.1(ii) to the Financial Statements.\n\nSegmental EBITDA results are included in note 5.1(v) to the Financial Statements.\n\nof delivery in the year - combined with an unusually high and volatile electricity price attributable to factors such as the war in Ukraine and French nuclear outages drove a significant uplift in the achieved price on hedged volumes in the year, with approximately \u00a3216m additional benefit captured. This uplift more than offset a \u00a3(143)m net loss from Seagreen which mainly reflected the buy-back costs of undelivered hedged volumes in a higher price environment.\n\nElsewhere, the higher and more volatile price environment was beneficial for flexible hydro and pumped storage, as those assets efficiently responded to capture peak prices in the market. Finally, the adjusted result also includes a net \u00a343m charge relating to the Electricity Generator Levy, which came into effect from 1 January 2023 and is charged on receipts generated from eligible generation sources which are in excess of a \u00a375/MWh benchmark.\n\nReported operating profits have increased by 4% to \u00a3446.3m in the year. In addition to the factors noted above, the reported result also reflects a \u00a318.6m reduction in exceptional charges mainly as a \u00a328.6m exceptional tax charge recognised in the prior year - driven by the impact on Joint Venture deferred tax balances from the substantive enactment of the UK Corporation Tax rate change, which - was non-recurring.",

        "page_content": "## Financial Review continued\n\nHowever, this reduction in exceptional charges was partially offset by a \u00a310.1m increase in Joint Venture share of interest and tax charges driven by higher profitability in these entities.\n\nSSE Thermal Generation: Adjusted operating profit increased 244% to \u00a31,031.9m, compared to \u00a3300.4m in the prior year. SSE has continued to invest in optimising its thermal generation fleet despite many years of low returns and significant write-downs because it believed the inherent value the fleet offers the energy system through its flexibility would eventually be recognised. As noted previously, the last twelve months has seen the Thermal business navigate extreme volatility in the forward power markets through the flexibility it offers. The increase in adjusted operating profit reflects additional capacity in the year from Triton Power (acquired on 1 September 2022, \u00a3220m adjusted operating profit) and Keadby 2 (entered commercial operation on 15 March 2023, \u00a337m adjusted operating profit), and additional generation volumes from SSE Thermal's existing feet together with higher power prices and a strong performance in the balancing market. In addition, capacity market revenues - which are unaffected by market prices - were \u00a333m higher compared to the prior year.\n\nThis was partially offset by \u00a397m of hedge buy-back losses due to unplanned outages - mainly arising from Great Island CCGT but also the reduction in capacity from Tarbert oil-fired station - as well as higher operating costs and increases in depreciation charges due to historic impairment reversals recognised in September 2021 and March 2022.\n\nReported operating profit increased by 75% to \u00a31,089.5m in the year. The acquisition in September 2022 of Triton Power has resulted in a number of exceptional items being recognised: a \u00a3140.7m fair value uplift on acquisition and a \u00a3172.0m fair value remeasurement on operating derivatives (net of tax) were mostly offset by a \u00a3(291.6)m impairment charge reflecting the profitability delivered to date by that business. These movements, combined with a \u00a389.1m gain on disposal of Fiddlers Ferry land, a \u00a317.8m reversal of historic Great Island CCGT impairment and an increase in the Joint Venture share of interest and tax charges of \u00a350.9m account for the majority of the difference. The prior year result included \u00a3333.3m of exceptional items, mainly comprising the reversal of historic impairment charges relating to the Groups' CCGT plants.\n\nGas Storage: Adjusted operating profit increased by 592% to \u00a3212.5m, compared to \u00a330.7m in the prior year. The higher and more volatile gas market price environment during the year benefitted these assets which operated on a merchant basis to capture positive gas price spreads. In normal market conditions, the seasonal price spread occurs between summer and winter which results in minimal profitability for this segment in the first half of the year. However, due to low Russian gas supplies and increased European demand as gas stores were built up for winter, the usual spread was inverted, with summer gas prices higher than winter at points during the period. That inversion led to around \u00a346m of incremental profitability in the first six months of the year. Aside from that one-off benefit, the assets continued to capture the usual summer-winter spread while supporting vital energy security in times of high gas demand across the winter. Again, the strong performance of the Gas Storage business affirms SSE's decision during previous years when earnings were weaker to continue investing in these critical assets.\n\nReported operating profit increased by 99% to \u00a3249.2m in the year. In addition to the movements above, the prior year included an impairment reversal of \u00a397.3m compared to a \u00a345.7m further reversal during 2022/23 as historic impairment charges against these assets were partially reversed. In addition, the reported results include a \u00a3(9.0)m revaluation loss on gas held in storage, compared to a \u00a3(2.6)m loss in the prior year.\n\nSSE Business Energy: Adjusted and reported profitability increased to \u00a317.9m of profit in 2022/23 compared to a \u00a3(21.5)m loss in the prior year. Market volatility since the start of 2022 continues to create a challenging environment for consumers and consumer-facing businesses such as Business Energy and Airtricity. With the prior year loss including around \u00a334m of one-off charges relating to non-recoverable Balancing System use of Service 'BSUoS' costs and additional mutualisation costs, 2022/23 has demonstrated a recovery in underlying profitability as the economy continued to emerge from the impact of coronavirus.\n\nHowever, even with the UK Government's EBRS support scheme, bad debt expenses have increased by \u00a3(89.5)m from prior year reflecting the deterioration of aged debt as consumers' finances are stretched.\n\nSSE Airtricity: Adjusted profitability decreased to \u00a35.6m from \u00a360.4m in the prior year. Airtricity responded to the hugely challenging circumstances faced by its domestic energy customers during the 2022/23 financial year and - through a combination of keeping tariffs as low as possible for all consumers through not passing through the full impact of wholesale costs, a price freeze for financially vulnerable consumers, customer support funds and finally, in April 2023, a \u20ac35 rebate to each customer - honoured its commitment not to make a profit in the year in recognition of the cost-of-living crisis. The cost of the \u20ac35 rebate will be reflected in Airtricity's financial results for 2023/24.\n\nReported profitability has decreased to \u00a35.2m from \u00a360.4m in the prior year reflecting the movements above as well as a \u00a3(0.4)m share of interest and tax in the current year from Joint Ventures.\n\nEnergy Portfolio Management: Adjusted operating profit has increased to \u00a380.4m from a \u00a3(16.8)m loss in the prior year. EPM continues to generate a relatively low level of baseline operating earnings through service provision to those SSE businesses requiring access to the energy markets. However, in addition to this, the business is permitted to take small optimisation opportunities whilst managing liquidity and shape on external trades. As outlined above, these optimisation opportunities are subject to strict internal VAR limits and controls. The increase in profitability is mainly due to the heightened volatility and price of power and gas trades in the market, which has driven higher profits from the trading and optimisation activities for this business.\n\nA reported operating loss of \u00a3(2,626.0)m was recognised in the year, compared to a \u00a32,083.6m profit in the prior year. In addition to the movements above, the reported operating result includes the net remeasurement loss on forward commodity derivatives in the period which are fair valued in accordance with IFRS 9. In line with previous years, this excludes any remeasurement on 'own use' contracts and is unrelated to underlying operating performance.\n\nDistributed Energy: An adjusted operating loss of \u00a3(27.4)m was recognised, compared to a loss of \u00a3(10.9)m in the prior year. The business continues to incur losses as it invests to support business growth, particularly in the solar and battery storage business which will be reported under SSE Renewables from April 2023.\n\nThe reported operating loss of \u00a3(33.5)m has increased from a prior year loss of \u00a329.2m which reflects the above factors partially offset by a smaller \u00a3(6.1)m charge mainly related to the sale of the Contracting and Rail business in June 2021 compared to the \u00a318.3m charge recognised in the prior year.\n\nNeos Networks: SSE's remaining 50% share in the Telecoms business Neos Networks Limited recorded an adjusted operating loss of \u00a3(39.8)m compared to \u00a3(16.1)m in the prior year, and a reported operating loss of \u00a3(56.0)m compared to a loss of \u00a3(140.0)m in the prior year. This result reflects the losses incurred to support future business growth, and includes a \u00a337.7m impairment of the Group's investment in that business of which \u00a331.8m has been treated as non-exceptional.\n\nCorporate unallocated: Adjusted operating loss of \u00a3(87.0)m compares against a loss of \u00a3(95.7)m in the prior year. Whilst there continues to be an unwind of historic transitional service agreements with SSE Energy Services (disposed to Ovo in January 2020), Neos Networks (partdisposed in January 2019) and SSE Contracting (disposed to Aurelius in July 2021), the segment has also benefited from a review of the corporate cost base at the start of the year.\n\nReported operating loss of \u00a3(26.8)m compares against a loss of \u00a3(113.5)m in the prior year which included a \u00a3(13.1)m adverse revaluation adjustment relating to the legacy Gas Production decommissioning provision. In the current year, a \u00a350.5m positive revaluation adjustment was recognised on the same provision.\n\n## Adjusted Earnings Per Share\n\nTo monitor its financial performance over the medium term, SSE reports on its adjusted Earnings Per Share measure. This measure is calculated by excluding the charge for deferred tax, interest costs on net pension liabilities, exceptional items, depreciation on fair value adjustments, revaluation adjustments to the retained 60% Gas Production decommissioning obligation and the impact of certain remeasurements.\n\nSSE's adjusted EPS measure provides an important and meaningful measure of underlying financial performance. In adjusting for depreciation on fair value adjustments, revaluation adjustments to the retained 60% Gas Production decommissioning obligation, exceptional items and certain remeasurements, adjusted EPS reflects SSE's internal performance management, avoids the\n\nvolatility associated with mark-to-market IFRS 9 remeasurements and means that items deemed to be exceptional due to their nature and scale do not distort the presentation of SSE's underlying results. For more detail on these and other adjusted items please refer to the Adjusted Performance Measures section of this statement.\n\nIn the year ended 31 March 2023, SSE's adjusted Earnings Per Share on continuing operations was 166.0p. This compares to 94.8p for the previous year and reflects the movements in adjusted operating profit outlined in the section above.\n\n## Group financial outlook 2023/24 and beyond\n\n## Financial outlook for 2023/24\n\nThe 2022/23 financial year saw SSE's balanced portfolio of market-based and economically-regulated businesses successfully navigate the risks and opportunities arising from the higher and more volatile price environment. In particular, the strong performance from flexible thermal and hydro plant more than offset the impact of the challenges faced by onshore and offshore wind, namely lower than expected windspeeds and construction delays and the associated buy-back costs on Seagreen offshore wind farm.\n\nSSE remains focused on delivering longterm sustainable financial performance. And whilst energy prices and energy price volatility have been reducing from the highs of the last financial year, SSE expects a relatively higher price environment to endure.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, SSE remains confident that its businesses will continue to deliver strong adjusted operating profit in the 2023/24 financial year, specifically:\n\n- \u00b7 For SSEN Transmission, increases to the allowed revenue under RIIO-T2 combined with timing effects from under-recoveries in the prior year are expected to more than offset both increases to the cost base as well as the impact from an additional eight months of earnings attributable to minority interests.\n- \u00b7 For SSEN Distribution, increases to the operational cost base are not expected to be recovered until future periods under the tariff setting process, with allowed revenue therefore expected to be broadly flat.\n- \u00b7 For SSE Renewables, assuming normal weather and plant availability, SSE expects to report around 12.5TWh of generation output during 2023/24,\n\nexcluding any output from the Dogger Bank A wind farm which is expected to achieve first power during the year and remains unhedged.\n\n- \u00b7 For SSE Thermal and Gas Storage, assuming normal plant availability, SSE expects adjusted operating profit to be more than \u00a3750m as the full-year effect from the additional Keadby 2 and Triton Power capacity is combined with a sustained higher price environment in the medium-term.\n\nTaking the above factors into account, SSE currently expects to report full-year 2023/24 adjusted Earnings Per Share of more than 150p.\n\nSSE is fulfilling its commitment to growing the 2022/23 dividend by RPI and is recommending a 96.7p full-year dividend in line with that plan. Also in line with that plan, in 2023/24, the dividend will be rebased to 60p in order to align future dividends with SSE's ambitious growth profile.\n\nCapital expenditure and investment in 2023/24 is expected to exceed the \u00a32.8bn record investment in 2022/23, with the net debt to EBITDA ratio expected to be within the 3.5x - 4.0x target range.\n\n## Net Zero Acceleration Programme Plus\n\nSSE is a purpose-led company, seeking to provide the energy needed today while building a better world of energy for tomorrow. It is a long-term business with a clear strategy aligned with the transition to net zero.\n\nIn November 2021, SSE set out a five-year capex plan that aligned capital allocation with the Group's 2030 Goals and its changing energy mix. This plan, referred to as the Net Zero Acceleration Programme, or NZAP, provided the optimal pathway at that time to maximise total shareholder returns from both earnings and asset value growth, whilst remunerating shareholders through a rebased dividend with attractive growth.\n\nThis plan and the targets contained within it - which were partially updated in May 2022 to reflect the evidence of increasing value creation potential - represented a floor, not a ceiling, and were intended to position SSE to take other opportunities as they emerge.\n\nIn the time since the NZAP was launched, the global green transition has accelerated as countries look towards providing energy security by increasing their renewables and low-carbon generation ambitions.",

SSE has therefore announced an 'NZAP Plus' which rolls the plan forward by 12 months and upgrades the targets, ambitions and investment mix to match the enhanced opportunity.\n\n## Upgraded capital investment plan to 2027\n\nThe NZAP Plus is a five-year \u00a318.0bn capital investment plan to 2026/27 - mainly driven by new growth (c.\u00a32.2bn or c.20%) but also updating for supply chain cost increases (c.\u00a32.0bn or c.15%), removal of the Distribution minority interest assumption (c.\u00a30.6bn or c.5%) and project phasing (c.\u00a30.7bn or c.5%). This increase - which collectively represents an increase of over 40% on the NZAP - is focused on:\n\n- \u00b7 Regulated electricity networks (c.50%) SSEN Transmission (c.30%) will comprise the majority of expected investment in electricity networks, as the RIIO-T2 baseline investment programme has increased through uncertainty mechanism projects such as the Skye and Orkney subsea links. Whilst the majority of Ofgem's Accelerated Strategic Transmission Investment (ASTI) framework will be delivered towards the end of the decade, the five-year plan also includes early construction costs as these projects are progressed. As such, SSEN Transmission investment is expected to increase to over \u00a35bn from over \u00a33bn in the previous plan, net of the 25% Minority Interest share, driving the gross Regulatory Asset Value ('RAV') to between \u00a38-9bn by the end of 2026/27, and deliver expected adjusted operating profits of at least \u00a3400m on average across the five year plan.\n\nWhilst SSEN Distribution (c.20%) has a lower share of networks investment, the absolute amount of investment is\n\nincreasing with around \u00a33.5bn of expected investment compared to around \u00a32bn in the previous plan. This increase reflects 100% ownership of the business over the period, and is driven by the \u00a33.6bn of totex in the RIIO-ED2 Final Determination, which runs from April 2023 to March 2028, with the potential for additional investment in other net zero-aligned projects to meet the increasing electrification demands of consumers. This investment is expected to drive the gross RAV to between \u00a36-7bn by the end of 2026/27, and deliver expected adjusted operating profits of at least \u00a3450m on average across the five year plan.\n\nOverall, as SSEN Transmission and SSEN Distribution continue to form a key part of the low-carbon electricity core in SSE, the total electricity networks RAV is expected to increase from \u00a38.2bn at the start of the plan to between \u00a314-16bn by the end, of which SSE's share after Minority Interest is expected to be between \u00a312-14bn. On a gross basis, this equates to a c.14% compound average growth rate ('CAGR') over the five-year plan.\n\n- \u00b7 Renewable energy generation (c.40%) Since November 2021, SSE Renewables has continued to grow its secured pipeline of projects - which currently stands at c.15GW - and also the quality and diversity of these prospects. With a continued focus on financial discipline through targeting attractive returns on new projects, it is expected that around 5GW of additional net capacity will be added across the five-year plan, with net installed capacity of more than 9GW by March 2027. This growth will be fulfilled through a diverse mix of technologies, with an increasing number of attractive battery and solar projects adding to SSE Renewables' core hydro, onshore and offshore wind projects. The incremental capacity, combined with changing mix\n\nand inflationary impacts, means around \u00a37bn of net investment is expected across the five-year period - a \u00a32bn increase on the expected investment in the previous plan - and is expected to drive a c.20% adjusted operating profit CAGR across the five year plan subject to normal weather and a c.\u00a385/MWh baseload power price in 2026/27.\n\n- \u00b7 Low-carbon flexible thermal generation and other businesses (c.10%)\n\nThe extreme volatility seen in energy markets over the last year has made it clear that investment in flexible, low-carbon thermal generation - such as sustainable biofuels, carbon capture and storage and ultimately hydrogen will be critical to society in the transition to net zero as a counterbalance for increasing intermittent renewables generation. The NZAP Plus expects to invest up to \u00a32.5bn in SSE Thermal's increasing pipeline of low-carbon flexible generation prospects, which currently stands at around 5GW across a range of technologies, and deliver expected adjusted operating profits of around \u00a3500m on average across the remaining four years to 2026/27.\n\nThe remaining capital investment will be spent across SSE's corporate centre, distributed energy and customers businesses, which remain part of a very deliberate business model with each playing its own role in delivering SSE's net zero-focused strategy.\n\nWith around 90% of the NZAP Plus expected to be invested in renewables and networks, the substantial majority of the investment plan is focused on climate solutions to achieve SSE's interim 2030 Goals which are linked to material UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and it is aligned to the Technical Screening Criteria of the EU Taxonomy.\n\n## Maintaining disciplined investment at attractive returns\n\nThe changing investment mix within the NZAP Plus reflects SSE's focus on allocating capital based on clear internal investment criteria intended to maximise total shareholder returns whilst ensuring strategic alignment with SSE's net zero electricity focus. This investment criteria includes:\n\n- \u00b7 Strategic fit - aligned with SSE's commitment to its 1.5-degree sciencebased carbon targets, business mix and capabilities;\n- \u00b7 Optimum mix - balancing risk and returns through a mix of economically regulated and unregulated, marketbased assets; and\n- \u00b7 Targeted returns - focusing investment on high-quality assets where SSE's capabilities can deliver favourable riskadjusted project returns, namely targeting:\n\n- -Onshore wind and solar: returns between 50-300bps over WACC for unlevered projects, depending on the balance of merchant, technology and construction risk for each project;\n- -Offshore wind: more than 11% equity returns (excluding developer profits) for project financed developments;\n- -Networks: between 7-9% return on equity, assuming a level of outperformance, CPIH inflation of 2% p.a. and an average gearing ratio of 60%;\n- -Emerging technologies: between 300-500bps over WACC for unlevered projects, reflecting the expected increased risk on newer, first-of-a-kind technologies including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen-fuelled generation and battery storage.\n\nThese investment criteria - and targeted returns - are applied in both domestic and overseas markets.\n\n## Updating the growth-supporting dividend plan\n\nThe original NZAP set out a five-year dividend plan to support accelerated growth by confirming previous commitments to target dividend increases in line with RPI for 2021/22 and 2022/23, before rebasing to 60 pence in 2023/24 and targeting at least 5% dividend increases in 2024/25 and 2025/26.\n\nThe Board has delivered on this dividend commitment for 2021/22 and 2022/23 and continues to consider that the rebased dividend to 60 pence in 2023/24 supports SSE's ongoing ambitions to accelerate investment in the assets required to reach net zero.\n\nThe capital allocation outlined in the NZAP Plus is expected to drive a 13-16% Group adjusted Earnings Per Share CAGR over the five-year plan - against the 2021/22 baseline of 94.8 pence - with around 50% of adjusted EBITDA expected to be underpinned by index-linked revenue streams.\n\nThe NZAP Plus extends the original NZAP dividend plan to 2027 and, reflecting the SSE Board's confidence in future earnings growth, now sets out a commitment to target dividend increases of between 5 to 10% per year in 2024/25, 2025/26 and 2026/27. This updated dividend plan aims to balance income to shareholders with funding and a strong investment grade credit rating alongside an upgraded investment plan that will ultimately create greater value and total returns for shareholders over the long term. This plan also retains the scrip dividend option for shareholders with the cap on take-up still set at 25% and implemented if necessary by means of a share buyback.\n\n## A fully-funded plan, supported by a strong balance sheet\n\nThrough effective capital allocation, raising debt at highly attractive terms, capital recycling and unlocking value through partnerships, SSE continues to demonstrate that it can take advantage of the accretive opportunities it creates. It has a proven ability to realise value from disposals, create sustainable earnings growth and maintain strong investment grade credit ratings - all whilst aligning with a 1.5-degree pathway.\n\nThe Group's business mix, future capital investment and funding plans are designed to ensure that it retains an investment grade credit rating which provides capacity to reach a 4.5x net debt/EBITDA ratio. The financial strength of the Group means that it expects to be within an average of 3.5-4.0x net debt/EBITDA across the five-year plan.\n\n## More ambitious targets to 2032\n\nThe upgraded targets and ambitions within the NZAP Plus provide the platform for SSE's businesses to grow substantially through the remainder of the decade, and are necessary to deliver the Group's 2030 Goals and associated 1.5 degree aligned carbon targets.\n\nLooking further ahead, SSE is therefore also rolling forward and upgrading key targets for the 10 years to 2032 as set out below:\n\n- \u00b7 A fourfold increase in SSE's owned renewables capacity to over 16GW (net) from c.4GW today;\n- \u00b7 Delivering more than 2GW of net installed low-carbon flexible thermal capacity;\n- \u00b7 An increase to more than \u00a320bn (net) in SSE's electricity networks RAV, from \u00a38.2bn (gross) in March 2022, equivalent to a 14% gross RAV CAGR.\n\n## Disposal of minority stake in networks\n\nThe selected use of partnerships remains a key part of SSE's strategy: to spread risk and financial exposure; to unlock value whilst avoiding non-earning debt; and to enable future investment and growth.\n\nDuring 2022/23, the Group completed a 25% minority interest disposal of the SSEN Transmission business to Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board for consideration of \u00a31,465m at a premium to RAV of around 1.9x at 30 September 2022.\n\n## Supplemental financial information\n\n## Adjusted investment and capex summary\n\n|                                                               | March   2023   Share %   | March   2023   \u00a3m   | March   2022   \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| SSEN Transmission (excluding 25% MI from 1 Dec 2022)          | 23%                      | 495.5               | 614.4               |\n| SSEN Distribution                                             | 19%                      | 421.0               | 364.8               |\n| Regulated networks total                                      | 42%                      | 916.5               | 979.2               |\n| SSE Renewables                                                | 39%                      | 837.5               | 811.0               |\n| SSE Thermal                                                   | 7%                       | 153.2               | 123.4               |\n| Gas Storage                                                   | -                        | 6.3                 | 2.1                 |\n| Thermal Total                                                 | 7%                       | 159.5               | 125.5               |\n| Energy Customer Solutions                                     | 2%                       | 49.4                | 39.8                |\n| Energy Portfolio Management                                   | -                        | 4.7                 | 2.4                 |\n| Distributed Energy                                            | 6%                       | 124.7               | 26.6                |\n| Corporate unallocated                                         | 4%                       | 68.3                | 78.7                |\n| Adjusted investment and capital expenditure,   before refunds | 100%                     | 2,160.6             | 2,063.2             |\n| Project finance development expenditure refunds               |                          | -                   | (136.7)             |\n| Adjusted investment and capital expenditure                   |                          | 2,160.6             | 1,926.5             |\n| Acquisitions                                                  |                          | 642.7               | 141.3               |\n| Adjusted investment, capital and acquisitions                 |                          |                     |                     |\n| expenditure                                                   |                          | 2,803.3             | 2,067.8             |\n\nNotes: 2021/22 restated to recognise Keadby 2 pre-commissioning revenues and costs in Income Statement following adoption of amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment - Proceeds Before Intended Use.",

        "page_content": "## Financial Review continued\n\nThis successful transaction reflected both the current value and significant growth potential of SSEN Transmission as one of Europe's fastest growing transmission networks, with the proceeds released by the sale supporting the significant growth and investment across the Group.\n\nWhile the November 2021 NZAP assumed that a similar 25% minority stake in the SSEN Distribution business would be disposed by the 2025/26 financial year, SSE consistently reviews strategic options and direction and the NZAP Plus plan now reflects retaining 100% of the business. Strategies evolve and a significant strengthening of SSE's balance sheet and an upgraded NZAP Plus investment plan which remains well balanced are the main factors contributing to the Board assessment that continuing to hold 100% of SSEN Distribution is the right strategy at this time.\n\nSSEN Distribution is a high-quality, core business for the Group and will make a significant contribution to delivering sustainable long-term value as it plays a key role in enabling net zero for consumers.\n\n## SSE's capital expenditure programme\n\nDuring the year to 31 March 2023, SSE's adjusted investment, capital and acquisitions expenditure totalled \u00a32,803.3m, representing an increase of 36% versus the prior year. Included within the amount recorded are acquisitions totalling \u00a3642.7m of which \u00a3519.5m is in respect of the Southern European onshore wind development platform acquisition and \u00a3123.2m in respect of SSE's share of the purchase of Triton Power, both transactions completed on 1 September 2022.\n\nThe remaining investment was delivered mainly by SSE's Renewables, Networks and Thermal business units including the highlights discussed below.\n\nIn SSEN Transmission , the second year of RIIO-T2 saw deployment of a further \u00a3495.5m of capex (SSE share, excluding 25% from 1 December 2022 onwards), including \u00a3152m on the Shetland connection with 160km of the total 260km subsea cable which will connect the Shetland islands to the GB Transmission system now installed. In addition, \u00a3144m of spend was invested progressing the East Coast development project which will increase the overhead lines from 132kV to 275kV and ultimately to 400kV, as well as a further \u00a355m on the Argyll project.\n\nIn the final year of RIIO-ED1, SSEN Distribution invested \u00a3178m in the North networks across a broad range of projects, with additional reinforcement spend needed following storm damage in FY22. SSEN Distribution's SHEPD network delivered investment of \u00a310m to upgrade infrastructure at Aultbea-Ullapool and \u00a35m on Islay to maintain and enhance network reliability to these island communities. Both projects are under way and will be complete by 2023/24. Further south, major capital investment continued in the SEPD network with a total spend of \u00a3243m in the period, including upgrades to the network in Bordon and Alton to enhance resilience and future proof it for predicted uptake in consumer led low-carbon-technology.\n\nSignificant expenditure was delivered on SSE Renewables' flagship construction projects, including \u00a3339m of equity drawdown for Seagreen Offshore Windfarm, as the development progresses towards commercial operations over the summer of 2023. Construction of Viking wind farm on the Shetland islands has continued according to plan, with an additional \u00a3202m deployed, the first turbine erected in April 2023 and the project on track to achieve commercial operations in Summer 2024, while all spend on the Dogger Bank wind farm in the year was funded by debt raised at the project level, and therefore not included in SSE's adjusted investment, capital and acquisitions expenditure.\n\nIn SSE Thermal , around \u00a388m was invested on the development of the 50MW Slough Multifuel station, a joint venture with CIP, which is progressing towards handover during 2024/25. As well as around \u00a320m of residual spend on Europe's most efficient gas fired station at Keadby 2, which entered commercial operation on 15 March 2023, limited early development expenditure on Keadby 3 was included within Thermal's reported number.\n\n## SSE's hedging position at 31 March 2023\n\nSSE has an established approach to hedging through which it generally seeks to reduce its broad exposure to commodity price variation at least 12 months in advance of delivery. SSE continues to monitor market developments and conditions and alters its hedging approach in response to changes in its exposure profile, such as the acceleration of hedging by SSE Renewables previously disclosed in May 2022. SSE will continue to provide a summary of its hedging approach, including details of any changes in the period, within its Interim and Full-year Results Statements.\n\nA summary of the hedging position for each of SSE's market-based businesses is set out below.\n\n## SSE Renewables - GB wind and hydro\n\nThe following table provides an update for SSE's GB Wind and Hydro generation hedge positions against the forecast merchant volume exposure as at 31 March 2023.\n\n|       |                                         | 2021/22   | 2022/23   | 2023/24   | 2024/25   | 2025/26   |\n|-------|-----------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Wind  | Expected volume - TWh                   | 4.2       | 5.3       | 6.5       | 6.8       | 6.8       |\n|       | Volume hedged - %                       | 85%       | 91%       | 85%       | 77%       | 17%       |\n|       | Proportion of hedge in  electricity - % | 100%      | 62%       | 68%       | 30%       | 20%       |\n|       | Hedge price - \u00a3MWh                      | \u00a348       | \u00a354       | \u00a375       | \u00a3115      | \u00a3116      |\n| Hydro | Expected volume - TWh                   | 3.6       | 3.5       | 3.5       | 3.6       | 3.6       |\n|       | Volume hedged - %                       | 83%       | 85%       | 85%       | 68%       | 23%       |\n|       | Proportion of hedge in  electricity - % | 100%      | 100%      | 84%       | 31%       | 10%       |\n|       | Hedge price - \u00a3/MWh                     | \u00a350       | \u00a363       | \u00a386       | \u00a3113      | \u00a3113      |\n\nNote: where gas and carbon trades have been used as a proxy for electricity, a constant 1MWh : 69.444 th and 1MWh : 0.3815 te/MWh conversion ratio between commodities has been applied.\n\nThe expected volumes include SSE's equity share of forecast pre-CFD volumes from Seagreen offshore wind farm. No volumes have yet been included for Viking onshore wind farm nor Dogger Bank offshore wind farm as hedging for these assets has not commenced.\n\nThe table excludes additional volumes and income for BM activity, ROCs, ancillary services, capacity mechanism and shape variations and optimisations. It also excludes volumes and income relating to Irish wind output, pumped storage and CfDs.\n\nEnergy output hedges for both wind and hydro are progressively established over the 36 months prior to delivery (although the extent of hedging activity for future periods depends on the level of available market depth and liquidity). Normal target hedge levels continue to be achieved through the forward sale of either electricity, or gas and carbon equivalents. Where the market depth and liquidity significantly differs between gas and carbon, the hedging approach allows for any time period - for the separate forward sale of either commodity where it is believed that it would reduce risk against or secure value for generation assets. This has not been applied to date.\n\nThis approach aims to reduce the exposure of these wind assets to volatile spot power market outcomes whilst still providing an underlying commodity price hedge. When gas-and-carbon hedges are converted into electricity hedges a 'spark spread' is realised which can lead to changes in the average hedge price expected. This can increase the previously published average hedge price, as has been seen in 2022/23, or decrease it.\n\nFor wind energy output, SSE's established approach to hedging seeks to account for the effect of the 'wind capture price' by targeting a hedge of less than 100% of its anticipated wind energy output for the coming 12 months. The targeted hedge percentage is reviewed and adjusted as necessary to reflect any changes in future market and wind capture insights. The last such revision occurred in March 2022, with around 90% of the anticipated energy output from wind for the coming twelve months being hedged from that date.\n\nThe approach to hedging hydro energy output remains unchanged at approximately 85% of its anticipated energy output for the coming twelve months.\n\nGB Thermal: In the six months prior to delivery, SSE aims to hedge all of the expected economic output of its CCGT assets, having progressively established this hedge over the 18 months prior to delivery.\n\nThis hedging approach is adjusted to take into account any changes in exposures as a result of current market conditions, such as the plant availability exposure, counterparty credit risk, and changes to cost of capital for collateral.\n\nHedging activity also depends on the availability of sufficient market depth and liquidity, which can be limited, particularly for periods further into the future.\n\nGas Storage: The assets are being commercially operated to optimise value arising from changes in the spread between summer and winter prices, market volatility and plant availability. At 31 March 2023, 125.6mTh of gas inventory was physically held which represents c.65% of SSE's share of capacity (at 31 March 2022, 0.9mTh of gas inventory representing c.1% of SSE's share of capacity).\n\nUK Business Energy: The business supplies electricity and gas to business and public sector customers. Sales to contract customers are hedged: at point of sale for fixed contract customers; upon instruction for flexi contract customers; and on a rolling hedge basis for tariff customers.\n\n## Energy Portfolio Management (EPM): EPM\n\nprovides the route to market and manages the execution for all of SSE's commodity trading outlined above (spark spread, power, gas, oil and carbon). This includes monitoring market conditions and liquidity and reporting net Group exposures. The business operates under strict position limits and VAR controls. There is some scope for small position-taking to permit EPM to manage around shape and liquidity whilst taking small optimisation opportunities. This is contained within a total VAR limit of \u00a35m.\n\nIreland: Vertical integration of the generation and customer businesses in Ireland limits the Group's commodity exposure in that market.\n\nGiven the pricing and macro-economic context, Business Energy is dynamically monitoring nearer term consumption actuals for any early signs of demand variability and adjusting future volumes hedged accordingly.\n\n## Summarising movements on exceptional items and certain remeasurements\n\n## Exceptional items\n\nIn the year ended 31 March 2023, SSE recognised a net exceptional charge within continuing operations of \u00a3(0.4)m before tax. The following table provides a summary of the key components making up the net charge:\n\n| Exceptional credits/(charges) within continuing operations          | Total   \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Thermal Electricity Generation historic impairment reversal         | 17.8         |\n| Gas Storage historic impairment reversal                            | 45.7         |\n| Fiddlers Ferry land sale                                            | 89.1         |\n| Triton Power Joint Venture bargain purchase gain and impairment     | (150.9)      |\n| Neos Networks impairment                                            | (5.9)        |\n| Reversal of previously recognised exceptional charges or judgements | 3.8          |\n| Total exceptional charge                                            | (0.4)        |\n\nNote: The definition of exceptional items can be found in note 3.2 of the Financial Statements.\n\nIn addition to the above exceptional items from continuing operations, a net exceptional gain within discontinued operations of \u00a335.0m after tax was recognised. This related to the release of a provision following further clearance granted in respect of the Group's disposal of its Gas Production business which completed on 14 October 2021.\n\nFor a full description of exceptional items, see note 7 of the Financial Statements.\n\n## Certain remeasurements\n\nIn the year ended 31 March 2023, SSE recognised an adverse net remeasurement within continuing operations of \u00a3(2,351.5)m before tax. The following table provides a summary of the key components making up the adverse movement:\n\n| Certain remeasurements within continuing operations          | Total   \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Operating derivatives (including Joint Ventures, net of tax) | (2,544.4)    |\n| Commodity stocks held at fair value                          | (9.0)        |\n| Financing derivatives                                        | 201.9        |\n| Total net adverse remeasurement                              | (2,351.5)    |",

        "page_content": "## Operating derivatives\n\nSSE enters into forward purchase contracts (for power, gas and other commodities) to meet the future demands of its energy supply businesses and to optimise the value of its generation assets. Some of these contracts are determined to be derivative financial instruments under IFRS 9 and as such are required to be recorded at their fair value as at the date of the financial statements.\n\nSSE shows the change in the fair value of these forward contracts separately as this mark-to-market movement does not reflect the realised operating performance of the businesses. The underlying value of these contracts is recognised as the relevant commodity is delivered, which for the large majority of the position at 31 March 2023 is expected to be within the next 6 - 12 months.\n\nThe change in the operating derivative mark-to-market valuation was a \u00a3(2,544.4)m adverse movement from the start of the year, reflecting a \u00a3(2,708.2)m adverse movement on fully consolidated operating derivatives offset by a \u00a3163.8m share of positive movement on derivatives in jointly controlled entities (net of tax) which mainly results from commodity hedging within the Triton Power Joint Venture.\n\nThe adverse movement of \u00a3(2,708.2)m on fully consolidated operating derivatives includes:\n\n- \u00b7 Settlement during the year of \u00a3272.0m of previously net 'out-of-the-money' contracts in line with the contracted delivery periods; and\n- \u00b7 An adverse net mark-to-market remeasurement of \u00a3(2,980.2)m on unsettled contracts, largely entered into during the course of 2021/22 and 2022/23 and in line with the Group's stated approach to hedging. This mark-to-market remeasurement which compares to a \u00a33,527.2m positive movement in the prior year - reflects the extreme volatility seen in commodity markets during the period.\n\nAs in prior years, the reported result does not include remeasurement of 'own use' hedging agreements which do not meet the definition of a derivative financial instrument under IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'.\n\n## Commodity stocks held at fair value\n\nGas inventory purchased by the Gas Storage business for secondary trading opportunities is held at fair value with reference to the forward month market price. The \u00a3(9)m adverse movement in the year reflects the increase in the underlying volumes of gas held at year end have been negatively impacted by lower forward market prices.\n\nHowever, whilst this movement reflects the net change in fair value of physical gas inventory held at the year end, it does not take into account any positive or negative mark-to-market movement on forward contracted sales. Therefore, similar to derivative contracts held at fair value, we do not expect that all of this valuation movement will be realised by the business.\n\n## Financing derivatives\n\nIn addition to the movements above, a positive movement of \u00a3201.9m was recognised on financing derivatives in the year ended 31 March 2023, including mark-to-market movements on crosscurrency swaps and floating rate swaps that are classed as hedges under IAS 39. These hedges ensure that any movement in the value of net debt is predominately offset by a movement in the derivative position. The adjustment was primarily driven by higher interest rates driving significant reductions in the 'out of the money' position on SSE's fixed rate swaps, in addition to settlement of previously 'out-of-the-money' contracts in line with the contracted delivery periods.\n\nThese remeasurements are presented separately as they do not represent underlying business performance in the period. The result on financing derivatives will be recognised in adjusted profit before tax when the derivatives are settled.\n\n## Reported profit before tax and Earnings Per Share\n\nTaking all of the above into account, reported results for the year to 31 March 2023 are significantly lower than the previous year. In addition to the \u00a3(2,351.5)m net pre-tax loss on forward commodity, gas inventory and financing derivative fair value remeasurements and the \u00a3(0.4)m net pre-tax exceptional charge noted above - reported results also include \u00a316.2m of interest income on the net pension asset.\n\nReported results in the prior year reflected pre-tax certain re-measurement gains of \u00a32,118.8m mainly driven by the significant volatility in commodity markets in the prior year, as well as pre-tax exceptional items of \u00a3305.0m mainly driven by the reversal of historic SSE Thermal and Gas Storage impairment charges, and \u00a37.6m of interest income on the net pension asset.\n\n## Financial management and balance sheet\n\n## Debt metrics\n\n|                                                                                                    | March   2023   | September   2022   | March   2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------|\n| Net Debt/EBITDA*                                                                                   | 2.7x           | N/A                | 4.0x           |\n| Adjusted net debt and hybrid capital (\u00a3m)                                                          | (8,894.1)      | (9,988.6)          | (8,598.2)      |\n| Average debt maturity (years)                                                                      | 6.4            | 6.5                | 6.8            |\n| Adjusted interest cover                                                                            | 7.6x           | 4.2x               | 4.0x           |\n| Average interest rate for the period (excluding JV/assoc. interest and all hybrid coupon payments) | 3.35%          | 3.25%              | 3.29%          |\n| Average cost of debt at period end (including all hybrid coupon payments)                          | 3.92%          | 3.83%              | 3.81%          |\n\n## Net finance costs reconciliation\n\n|                                                       | March   2023   \u00a3m   | March   2022   \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Adjusted net finance costs                            | 345.6               | 372.8               |\n| Add/(less):                                           |                     |                     |\n| Lease interest charges                                | (29.4)              | (30.4)              |\n| Notional interest arising on discounted provisions    | (22.1)              | (5.7)               |\n| Hybrid equity coupon payment                          | 38.8                | 50.7                |\n| Adjusted finance costs for interest cover calculation | 332.9               | 387.4               |\n\n## SSE principal sources of debt funding\n\n|                                             | March   2023   | September   2022   | September  2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------|\n| Bonds                                       | 54%            | 52%                | 55%               |\n| Hybrid debt and equity securities           | 18%            | 18%                | 21%               |\n| European investment bank loans              | 5%             | 7%                 | 7%                |\n| US private placement                        | 10%            | 10%                | 9%                |\n| Short-term funding                          | 9%             | 10%                | 5%                |\n| Index-linked debt                           | 4%             | 3%                 | 3%                |\n| % Of which has been secured at a fixed rate | 92%            | 92%                | 96%               |\n\n| Rating Agency       | Rating                 | Criteria                                 | Date of Issue   |\n|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Moody's             | Baa1 'stable outlook'  | 'Low teens' Retained Cash Flow/Net Debt  | March 2023      |\n| Standard and Poor's | BBB+ 'positive stable' | About 18% Funds From Operations/Net Debt | December 2022   |\n\n## Maintaining a strong balance sheet\n\nA key objective of SSE's long-term approach to balancing capital investment, debt issuance and securing value and proceeds from disposals is by maintaining a strong net debt/EBITDA ratio. SSE calculates this ratio based on a methodology that it believes best reflects its activities and commercial structure, in particular its strategy to secure value from partnering by using Joint Ventures and non-recourse project financing.\n\nSSE considers it has the capacity to reach a ratio of up to around 4.5x, comparable with private sector utilities across Europe, whilst remaining above the equivalent ratios required for an investment grade credit rating.\n\nWhile there may be short-term fluctuations in leverage as demonstrated by the 2.7 net debt/EBITDA achieved at 31 March 2023 (2022: 4.0x), it is expected that this ratio will generally fall between 3.5 - 4.0x across the five years to 31 March 2027.\n\nSSE's S&P credit rating were updated in December 2022 to at BBB+ 'positive outlook' and its Moody's rating remains at Baa1 with 'stable outlook'.\n\n## Adjusted net debt and hybrid capital\n\nSSE's adjusted net debt and hybrid capital was \u00a38.9bn at 31 March 2023, up from \u00a38.6bn at 31 March 2022. In addition to dividends, capex spend and revaluation of currency debt as well as various working capital movements, this movement includes the completion of two acquisitions and one divestment during the year:\n\n- \u00b7 In September 2022, SSE Renewables completed the acquisition from Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy of an onshore development platform across Spain, France, Italy and Greece for a consideration of \u20ac580m (\u00a3519.5m); and\n- \u00b7 In September 2022, SSE Thermal, alongside Equinor as 50/50 partners, completed the acquisition of the Triton Power portfolio with SSE's share of the purchase being \u00a3123.2m.\n- \u00b7 In December 2022, a 25% Minority Interest stake in SSEN Transmission was disposed of, with \u00a31.46bn of proceeds received from Ontario Teachers Pension Plan.\n\n## Debt summary as at 31 March 2023\n\nThe SSE Group issued \u00a31.7bn of hybrid capital and new medium- long-term debt in the year ended 31 March 2023 whilst also significantly increasing short-term debt capacity in the form of Commercial Paper:\n\n- \u00b7 In March 2022, the SSE Group through its SSEN Transmission entity priced and committed to a \u00a3350m dual tranche private placement, being a \u00a3175m 10-year tranche at 3.13% and \u00a3175m 15-year tranche at 3.24% giving an all-in average rate of 3.19%. The proceeds were received on 30 June 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Financial Review continued\n\n- \u00b7 In April 2022, SSE plc issued a \u20ac1bn NC6 equity accounted hybrid bond at 4% to refinance the dual tranche debt accounted hybrid bonds issued in March 2017. SSE has taken advantage of the 3-month par call option on these 2017 hybrid bonds, meaning they were repaid on 16 June 2022 in advance of the first call date. The \u20ac1bn equity accounted hybrid bond has been kept in Euros and the proceeds were used to cover the portion of the maturing hybrid that was originally swapped to Euros (\u20ac575m) and to finance a portion of SSE Renewables' European onshore development platform acquisition as noted above.\n- \u00b7 In August 2022, SSE plc issued a 7 year \u20ac650m Eurobond at a coupon of 2.875% which was left in Euros as part of our net investment hedge in overseas assets held in that currency. The bond was 8 times oversubscribed which allowed SSE to secure a highly competitive rate for the issuance.\n- \u00b7 Over the course of the year, SSE plc rolled maturing short-term debt in the form of Commercial Paper in addition to raising a further \u00a30.4bn, which takes the total outstanding Commercial Paper at 31 March 2023 to \u20ac1,376m (\u00a31,048m). Commercial Paper has been issued in Euros and swapped back to Sterling at an average cost of debt of 4.53% and matures between April 2023 and June 2023.\n\nIn addition to the March 2017 hybrid bonds which were called in June 2022 as noted above, a further \u00a3613m of medium-tolong-term debt has matured in the year comprising \u00a3163m (US Private Placement) which matured in April 2022, \u00a3300m (Eurobond) which matured in September 2022 and \u00a3150m European Investment Bank fixed rate loan which matured in October 2022. In the next twelve months, there is a further \u00a3719m of medium-tolong-term debt maturing being \u00a350m (European Investment Bank) maturing in\n\nAugust 2023, \u00a335m maturing in April 2023 and \u00a3120m maturing in September 2023 (both US Private Placements) and a \u20ac700m bond maturing in September 2023. Despite this, the Group expects to have minimal long-term debt refinancing requirements to 2024/25, given expected asset disposal proceeds. As noted above, a further \u20ac1,048m (\u00a3929m) of short-term debt in the form of Commercial Paper is also due to mature in the second half of 2023/24, however the current intention is to roll this maturing short-term debt forward throughout the 2023/24 financial year.\n\n## Hybrid bonds summary as at 31 March 2023\n\nHybrid bonds are a valuable part of SSE's capital structure, helping to diversify SSE's investor base and most importantly to support credit rating ratios, with their 50% equity treatment by the rating agencies being positive for SSE's credit metrics.\n\nA summary of SSE's hybrid bonds as at 31 March 2023 can be found below:\n\n| Issued     | Hybrid Bond Value 1   | All in rate 2   | First Call Date   | Accounting Treatment   |\n|------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------------|\n| July 2020  | \u00a3600m                 | 3.74%           | Apr 2026          | Equity accounted       |\n| July 2020  | \u20ac500m (\u00a3453m)         | 3.68%           | July 2027         | Equity accounted       |\n| April 2022 | \u20ac1bn (\u00a3831m)          | 4.00%           | Apr 2028          | Equity accounted       |\n\nFurther details on each hybrid bond can be found in notes 21 and 22 to the Financial Statements and a table noting the amounts, timing and accounting treatment of coupon payments is shown below:\n\n## Hybrid coupon payments\n\n|                                | 2023/24   | 2023/24   | 2022/23   | 2022/23   |\n|--------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n|                                | HYe       | FYe       | HYa       | FYa       |\n| Total equity (cash) accounted  | \u00a374m      | \u00a374m      | \u00a339m      | \u00a339m      |\n| Total debt (accrual) accounted | -         | -         | \u00a321m      | \u00a321m      |\n| Total hybrid coupon            | \u00a374m      | \u00a374m      | \u00a360m      | \u00a360m      |\n\nSSE's July 2020 and April 2022 hybrid bonds are perpetual instruments and are therefore accounted for as part of equity within the Financial Statements but, consistent with previous years, have been included within SSE's 'Adjusted net debt and hybrid capital' to aid comparability. The March 2017 hybrid bonds which were called and settled in 2022/23 had a fixed redemption date and were therefore debt accounted and included within Loans and Other Borrowings; as such they were already part of SSE's adjusted net debt and hybrid capital.\n\nThe coupon payments relating to the equity accounted hybrid bonds are presented as distributions to other equity holders and are reflected within adjusted Earnings Per Share when paid. The coupon payments on debt accounted hybrid bonds are treated as finance costs under IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'.\n\n## Managing net finance income/(costs)\n\nSSE's adjusted net finance costs - which includes interest on debt accounted hybrid bonds but not equity accounted hybrid bonds - were \u00a3345.6m in the year ended 31 March 2023, compared to \u00a3372.8m in the previous year. The lower level of finance costs from year to year mainly reflects lower levels of net debt during the financial year given proceeds from the disposal of Scotia Gas Networks on 22 March 2022 (\u00a31,225m) and a 25% minority interest stake in SSEN Transmission on 30 November 2022 (\u00a31,465m).\n\nReported net finance income was \u00a359.3m compared to a reported net finance cost of \u00a3273.2m in the previous year, reflecting the movements above as well as the \u00a3201.9m positive movement on financial derivatives previously referenced.\n\n## Summarising cash and cash equivalents\n\nAt 31 March 2023, SSE's adjusted net debt included cash and cash equivalents of \u00a30.9bn, down from \u00a31.0bn at March 2022.\n\nThe cash collateral position has increased from \u00a374.7m of cash provided as collateral at 31 March 2022 to \u00a3316.3m of cash provided at 31 March 2023. Cash collateral is only required for forward commodity contracts traded through commodity exchanges, and generally comprises an 'initial margin' element based on the size and period of the trade and a 'variation margin' element which will change from day to day depending on the fair value of that trade each day. The level of cash collateral either provided or received therefore depends on the volume of trading through the exchanges, the periods being traded and the associated price\n\nvolatility. As collateral is only required on a portion of trades, the movement in collateral provided or received will not correlate to the IFRS 9 fair value movement recognised, which also only covers a portion of the total Group trading activity. The cash collateral position had increased at 31 March 2023 due to the continued higher forward power and gas price\n\nenvironment, alongside heightened price volatility in those markets. The collateral position is lower than earlier in the financial year as volatility and risk factors have reduced, although prices do remain heightened when compared to previous years.\n\n## Revolving credit facility/ short-term funding\n\nSSE has \u00a33.5bn of committed bank facilities in place to ensure the Group has sufficient liquidity to allow day-to -day operations and investment programmes to continue in the event of disruption to Capital Markets preventing SSE from issuing new debt for a period of time. These facilities are set out in the table below.\n\n| Date   | Issuer                 | Debt type                                                       |   Term | Value   |\n|--------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|\n| Mar 19 | SSE plc                | Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility with 10 Relationship Banks |   2026 | \u00a31.3bn  |\n| Oct 19 | SSE plc                | Revolving Credit Facility with Bank of China                    |   2026 | \u00a3200m   |\n| Nov 22 | SHET plc               | Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility with 11 Relationship Banks |   2025 | \u00a3750m   |\n| Nov 22 | SHEPD plc and SEPD plc | Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility with 11 Relationship Banks |   2025 | \u00a3250m   |\n| Feb 23 | SSE plc                | Syndicated Revolving Credit Facility with 10 Relationship Banks |   2024 | \u00a31.0bn  |\n\nAhead of the 25% minority interest stake disposal, SSEN Transmission entered a three-year \u00a3750m facility and SSE Distribution entered a similar 3 year \u00a3250m facility, both having two one-year optional extensions. These facilities were entered into to help cover the future long-term funding requirements and the working capital of those businesses as they look to become financially independent of the Group. The facilities will therefore support the ongoing capital expenditure investment programmes that are required to deliver their ambitious future growth plans and will be drawn on a regular basis.\n\nThe new \u00a31bn facility signed in February 2023 was executed to cover potential cash collateral requirements required to cover commodity position on exchanges or via credit support annex's on bilateral contracts.\n\nThe facilities can also be utilised to cover short-term funding requirements; however, the majority remain undrawn for most of the time and at 31 March 2023, \u00a3100m was drawn on the new \u00a3750m Scottish Hydro Electric Transmission plc facility.\n\nThe two SSE plc facilities totalling \u00a31.5bn that mature in 2026 are classified as sustainable facilities with interest rate and fees paid dependant on SSE's performance in environmental, social and governance matters, as assessed independently by Moody's ESG Solutions. The new \u00a3750m Transmission facility is also classified as a sustainable facility with interest rate and fees paid dependant on four ESG KPI's being achieved.\n\nIn addition to the above, a $300m private placement shelf facility exists with NY Life which can be drawn in approximately two equal tranches 12 months apart over the next three years. At 31 March 2023 no drawings have been made on this facility.\n\nIn addition to these committed bank facilities, the Group has access to \u00a350m of uncommitted bank lines and a \u00a315m overdraft facility.\n\n## Maintaining a prudent treasury policy\n\nSSE's treasury policy is designed to be prudent and flexible. In line with that, cash from operations is first used to finance regulatory and maintenance capital expenditure and then dividend payments, with investment and capital expenditure for growth generally financed by a combination of cash from operations, bank borrowings and bond issuance.\n\nAs a matter of policy, a minimum of 50% of SSE's debt is subject to fixed rates of interest. Within this policy framework, SSE borrows as required on different interest bases, with financial instruments being used to achieve the desired out-turn interest rate profile. At 31 March 2023, 92% of SSE's borrowings were at fixed rates.\n\nBorrowings are mainly in Sterling and Euros to reflect the underlying currency denomination of assets and cash flows within SSE. All other foreign currency borrowings are swapped back into either Sterling or Euros.\n\nTransactional foreign exchange risk arises in respect of procurement contracts, fuel and carbon purchasing, commodity hedging and energy portfolio management operations, and long-term service agreements for plant.\n\nSSE's policy is to hedge any material transactional foreign exchange risks through the use of forward currency purchases and/or financial instruments. Translational foreign exchange risk arises in respect of overseas investments; hedging in respect of such exposures is determined as appropriate to the circumstances on a case-by-case basis.\n\n## Ensuring a strong debt structure through medium- and long-term borrowings\n\nThe ability to raise funds at competitive rates is fundamental to investment. SSE's fundraising over the past five years, including senior bonds, hybrid capital and term loans, now totals \u00a39.5bn and SSE's objective is to maintain a reasonable range of debt maturities. Its average debt maturity, excluding hybrid securities, at 31 March 2023 was 6.4 years, down from 6.8 years at 31 March 2022. This movement reflects the \u00a31.7bn of new hybrid capital and long-term debt issued in the last twelve months but has been offset by a higher short-term funding position via Commercial Paper. SSE's average cost of debt is now 3.92%, compared to 3.81% at 31 March 2022.\n\n## Going Concern\n\nThe Directors regularly review the Group's funding structure and have assessed that the Full Year Financial Statements should be prepared on a going concern basis.\n\nIn making their assessment the Directors have considered sensitivities on the forecast future cashflows of the Group for the period to 31 December 2024 resulting from the current volatile market conditions; the Group's credit rating; the success of the Group's disposal programme through 2020/21 to 2022/23; the successful issuance of \u00a31.7bn of hybrid equity, Eurobond and private placement debt issued during the period; and the likelihood of disposal of assets which have been announced as in progress and related debt funding. The Directors have also considered the Group's obligations under its debt covenants, with projections to 31 December 2024 supporting the expectation that there will be no breaches.",

        "page_content": "## Financial Review continued\n\nThe Directors have assessed that the Group remains able to access Capital Markets, as demonstrated by the \u00a33.6bn of debt issued over the last 24 months. There is also an expectation of continued availability of the Commercial Paper market along with future available liquidity in the private placement market in addition to the Group's existing liquidity with \u00a33.5bn of undrawn committed borrowing facilities which has been increased by \u00a32.0bn during the 2022/23 financial year.\n\n## Operating a scrip dividend scheme\n\nSSE's Scrip Dividend Scheme was last renewed for a three-year period at the 2021 AGM and continues to be offered to all shareholders. For the period out to 2026/27, take-up from the Scrip Dividend\n\nScheme will be capped at 25%. SSE plans to implement this cap by means of a share repurchase programme, or 'buyback', in October each year following payment of the final dividend. The scale of any share repurchase program would be determined by shareholder subscription to Scrip Dividend Scheme across the full year, taking into account the interim and final dividend elections.\n\nFollowing approval of the dividend at the Annual General Meeting on 20 July 2023, the scrip reference price will be determined across the period from 27 July to 2 August 2023, with notification of the final scrip reference price issued on 3 August 2023. Following receipt of the final dividend scrip elections on 24 August 2023, the overall\n\n## SSE's principal joint ventures and associates\n\nSSE's financial results include contributions from equity interests in joint ventures ('JVs') and associates, all of which are equity accounted. The details of the most significant of these are included in the table below. This table also highlights SSE's share of off-balance sheet debt associated with its equity interests in JVs which totals around \u00a33bn as at 31 March 2023.\n\n| SSE principal JVs and associates 1   | Asset type                                         | SSE   holding   | SSE share of external debt  as at 31 Mar 2023   | SSE Shareholder loans   as at 31 Mar 2023   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Marchwood Power Ltd                  | 920MW CCGT                                         | 50%             | No external debt                                | \u00a326m                                        |\n| Seabank Power Ltd                    | 1,234MW CCGT                                       | 50%             | No external debt                                | No loans outstanding                        |\n| SSE Slough Multifuel Ltd             | 50MW energy-from-waste facility                    | 50%             | No external debt                                | \u00a3128m                                       |\n| Triton Power Holdings Ltd            | 1,200MW CCGT & 140MW OCGT                          | 50%             | No external debt                                | No loans outstanding                        |\n| Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Ltd       | 588MW offshore wind farm                           | 40%             | \u00a3681m                                           | Project financed                            |\n| Dogger Bank A Wind Farm              | Up to 1,200MW offshore wind farm.  40%             |                 | \u00a3745m                                           | Project financed                            |\n| Dogger Bank B Wind Farm              | Up to 1,200MW offshore wind farm.  40%             |                 | \u00a3616m                                           | Project financed                            |\n| Dogger Bank C Wind Farm              | Up to 1,200MW offshore wind farm.  40%             |                 | \u00a3344m                                           | Project financed                            |\n| North Falls Offshore Wind Farm Ltd   | Offshore wind farm extension                       | 50%             | No external debt                                | No loans outstanding                        |\n| Ossian Offshore Windfarm Ltd         | ScotWind seabed                                    | 40%             | No external debt                                | No loans outstanding                        |\n| Seagreen Offshore Windfarm Ltd       | 1,075MW offshore wind farm                         | 49%             | \u00a3628m                                           | \u00a3816m 2                                     |\n| Seagreen 1a Ltd                      | Offshore wind farm extension                       | 49%             | No external debt                                | \u00a316m                                        |\n| Cloosh Valley Wind Farm              | 105MW onshore windfarm (part of  Galway Wind Park) | 25%             | No external debt                                | \u00a326m                                        |\n| Clyde Windfarm (Scotland) Ltd        | 522MW onshore wind farm                            | 50.1%           | No external debt                                | \u00a3127m                                       |\n| Dunmaglass Windfarm Ltd              | 94MW onshore windfarm                              | 50.1%           | No external debt                                | \u00a346m                                        |\n| Lenalea Wind Energy DAC              | 30MW of onshore windfarm                           | 50%             | No external debt                                | \u00a38m                                         |\n| Stronelairg Windfarm Ltd             | 228MW onshore wind farm                            | 50.1%           | No external debt                                | \u00a388m                                        |\n| Neos Networks Ltd                    | Private telecoms network                           | 50%             | No external debt                                | \u00a356m                                        |\n\n## Notes:\n\n- 1 Greater Gabbard, a 504MW offshore windfarm (SSE share 50%) is proportionally consolidated and is reported as a Joint Operation with no loans outstanding.\n- 2 For accounting purposes, \u00a3223m of the \u00a3816m of SSE Shareholder loans advanced to Seagreen Windfarm Limited as at 31 March 2023 have been classified as equity.\n\nscrip dividend take-up for the financial year will be calculated and any intention to initiate a buy-back will be announced. It is intended that any scrip buy-backs in respect of 2022/23 will be completed before 31 March 2024.\n\nSSE believes limiting the dilutive effect of the Scrip in this way strikes the right balance in terms of giving shareholders choice, potentially securing cash dividend payment savings and managing the number of additional shares issued.\n\n## Taxation\n\nSSE is one of the UK's biggest taxpayers, and in the 2022 PwC Total Tax Contribution survey published in November 2022 was ranked 16th out of the 100 Group of Companies in 2022 in terms of taxes borne (those which represent a cost to the company, and which are reflected in its financial results).\n\nSSE considers being a responsible taxpayer to be a core element of its social contract with the societies in which it operates and seeks to pay the right amount of tax on its profits, in the right place, at the right time. While SSE has an obligation to its shareholders, customers and other stakeholders to efficiently manage its total tax liability, it does not seek to use the tax system in a way it does not consider it was meant to operate or use tax havens to reduce its tax liabilities.\n\nUnder its social contract SSE has an obligation to the society in which it operates, and from which it benefits - for example, tax receipts are vital for the public services SSE relies upon. Therefore, SSE's tax policy is to operate within both the letter and spirit of the law at all times.\n\nSSE was the first FTSE 100 company to be Fair Tax Mark accredited and has now been accredited for nine years. The group's overseas expansion presented the opportunity to move to Fair Tax Foundation's Global Multinational Business Standard Accreditation, which was launched in late 2021, SSE being the first company to transition from the UK headquartered accreditation to the global accreditation.\n\nIn November 2022, SSE published 'Talking Tax 2022: Fair tax in a time of change' report. It did this because it believes building trust with stakeholders on issues relating to tax is important to the long-term sustainability of the business.\n\nAs part of the Spring Finance Bill, released on 23 March 2023, the UK Government published the final draft legislation behind the Electricity Generator Levy ('EGL'). This measure introduces a temporary 45% charge on exceptional receipts generated by specific generation sources which are in excess of a \u00a375/MWh benchmark price (adjusted in line with Consumer Price Index). The levy will be in effect from 1 January 2023 to 31 March 2028, and therefore a net charge of \u00a343m has been recognised in respect of the EGL within the 2022/23 financial year which has been excluded from the Income Tax disclosure in line with current accounting practice.\n\nIn the year to 31 March 2023, SSE paid \u00a3501.7m of profit taxes, property taxes, environmental taxes, and employment taxes in the UK, compared with \u00a3335.3m in the previous year. The increase in total taxes paid in 2022/23 compared with the previous year was primarily due to higher levels of corporation tax being paid on UK profits and higher levels of Climate Change Levy being paid as a result of fewer outages at SSE's gas-fired power stations compared with the previous year.\n\nIn 2022/23 SSE also paid \u20ac53.8m of taxes in Ireland, compared to \u20ac46.4m the previous year, due to increased profits in SSE's Irish businesses. Ireland is the only country\n\noutside the UK in which it currently has significant trading operations. SSE's operations elsewhere are still at an early stage and are not yet paying material amounts of tax.\n\nAs with other key financial indicators, SSE's As with other key financial indicators, SSE's focus is on adjusted profit before tax and, in line with that, SSE believes that the adjusted current tax charge on that profit is the tax measure that best reflects underlying performance. SSE's adjusted current tax rate, based on adjusted profit before tax, was 16.4%, compared with 9.2% in 2021/22 on the same basis. The increase in rate is primarily as a result of higher profit before tax, partly mitigated by increased capital allowances. In addition, a decision finding in SSE's favour was released by the Supreme Court on 17 May 2023 on the group's long-running capital allowances case in relation to Glendoe Hydro Electric Station. The successful outcome has resulted in the release of a \u00a327.9m corporation tax provision, which in turn reduced SSE's adjusted underlying current tax rate for the year by 1.3%.\n\nThe UK Budget in March 2021 introduced a 'super-deduction' for qualifying capital expenditure incurred during the two-year period from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2023. Capital allowances rates of 130% and 50% replace the existing rates of 18% and 6% respectively for qualifying capital expenditure in that period, significantly increasing the amount of capital allowances available on the Group's capital investment programme.",

        "page_content": "## SSEN Transmission\n\nSSEN Transmission owns, operates and develops the high voltage electricity transmission system in the North of Scotland and its islands. Following a minority stake sale completed in November 2022, the business is owned 75% by SSE plc and 25% by Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board. All capex and RAV references in this update relate to 100% of the business unless otherwise stated. The business is well placed to capture significant long-term growth opportunities from investment in enhancing energy security and enabling the development of renewables across the North of Scotland.\n\n## Operational delivery\n\nIn 2022/23, SSEN Transmission delivered another year of exceptional operational performance, achieving the maximum reward available through the Energy Not Supplied Incentive of \u00a30.8m for the third consecutive year, which will be reflected in revenue in 2024/25. This strong operational performance is underpinned by a robust programme of inspection, maintenance, refurbishment and replacement of its transmission assets, keeping the lights on for communities around the North of Scotland and ensuring reliable network access for its electricity generation customers to support security of supply.\n\nSSEN Transmission's capital investment programme remains on track with good progress being made on all major projects. This includes the second phase of the Inveraray-Crossaig overhead line replacement project, with the installation of all steel towers now complete and the project on track for energisation this summer. As well as maintaining and enhancing network reliability to the communities it serves, the InverarayCrossaig project will also enable the growth in renewable electricity generation across the region as part of the wider Argyll and Kintyre 275kV Strategy.\n\nThe Shetland High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission link also continues to make excellent progress with the second phase of the subsea cable installation works, which commenced in March 2023, now\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncomplete. 160km of the total 260km of subsea cable is now installed. Noss Head Switching Station in Caithness, which the Shetland HVDC link will connect to, was successfully energised in April 2023. Upon competition, the Shetland HVDC link will connect to the existing Caithness-Moray HVDC link, becoming the world's first multi-terminal HVDC system outside of China. It is a key innovation to support the future development of integrated HVDC grids, with HVDC links to date largely point-to-point connections. The project remains on track for completion and energisation in 2024.\n\nGood progress continues to be made to increase the capacity of the North East transmission network to 400kV, with this phase of network upgrades remaining on track for energisation by the end of 2023. Work to incrementally increase the east coast transmission network also remains on track, to 275kV by the end of 2023 and then to 400kV by 2026.\n\nThese strategic investments in new and upgraded infrastructure are key to help enable the continued growth in renewable electricity generation across the North of Scotland. These renewable connections includes the completion of the third circuit of the Seagreen offshore wind farm connection to Tealing substation in Angus which completed in November 2022.\n\nAs at 31 March 2023, the total installed capacity of the North of Scotland transmission network was around 10.5GW, of which just over 9GW is from renewable sources. This includes the successful energisation of the Creag Rhiabhach wind farm (92MW) near Lairg in December 2022 and the successful completion of all three phases of the Seagreen (1,075MW) grid connection. Factoring in the forecast growth in renewables in the remaining years of the RIIO-T2 period, SSEN Transmission remains well on track to meeting, and likely exceeding, its goal to transport the renewable electricity that powers 10m homes.\n\nFor financial performance commentary please refer to the Financial Review.\n\n## Who SSEN Transmission serves\n\nElectricity generators, large electricity demand customers and ultimately all electricity customers across the North of Scotland and beyond.\n\n## How it supports SSE's strategy\n\nSSEN Transmission invests in the critical infrastructure needed for a network for net zero that connects sources of renewable electricity to the national grid and transports it to areas of demand.\n\n## How it is remunerated\n\nThrough economically regulated returns recovered from generators and customers that are potentially enhanced through efficient delivery. In addition to Certain View expenditure, Uncertainty Mechanisms permit recovery of additional revenue in a given price control period to reflect additional investment requirements. These Uncertainty Mechanisms fund network upgrades during the price control period.\n\n'Through our ambitious investment programme as one of Europe's fastest growing transmission networks, we are committed to improving network reliability for the communities we serve, alongside supporting climate and energy security targets, as we deliver a network for net zero at an affordable cost to consumers, while providing a fair return to shareholders.'\n\n## Rob McDonald\n\nManaging Director, SSEN Transmission\n\n## SSEN Transmission key performance indicators\n\n|                                                                   | March  2023   | March  2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| SSEN Transmission                                                 |               |               |\n| Transmission adjusted operating profit 1  - \u00a3m                    | 372.7         | 380.5         |\n| Transmission reported operating profit - \u00a3m                       | 405.5         | 380.5         |\n| Gross Regulated Asset Value (RAV) - \u00a3m                            | 4,836         | 4,155         |\n| SSE Share Regulated Asset Value (RAV) 1  - \u00a3m                     | 3,627         | 4,155         |\n| Renewable Capacity connected to SSEN Transmission Network 2  - MW | 9,208         | 7,790         |\n| Transmission adjusted investment and capital expenditure 1  - \u00a3m  | 495.5         | 614.5         |\n\n## Growth opportunities in RIIO-T2\n\nSSEN Transmission continues to make tangible progress in unlocking several investments over and above its baseline investment case secured at the start of RIIO-T2. These additional projects, which are being taken forward through Ofgem's Uncertainty Mechanisms, will be key to delivering a pathway to net zero and helping support energy security.\n\nIn October 2022, SSEN submitted to Scottish Ministers its Section 37 planning application for the replacement and upgrade of the Fort Augustus to Skye transmission line, with Highland Council's Planning Committee unanimously supporting the application in March 2023. The replacement line is required to maintain security of supply and enable the connection of renewable electricity generation along its route. In May 2023, Ofgem published for consultation its response to SSEN Transmission's FNC, setting out its 'minded-to approve' provisional decision. Subject to timely planning and regulatory approvals, the project is on track for completion in 2026.\n\nFollowing Ofgem's approval of SSEN Transmission's Initial Needs Case for the Argyll 275kV Strategy in December 2022, in May 2023, SSEN Transmission submitted its FNC. This followed a direction from Ofgem to allow submission in advance of securing all main planning consents due to the risk of delay and likely increase in cost that would otherwise have been the case, alongside providing certainty to support the project's procurement process. The Argyll and Kintyre 275kV Strategy is required to upgrade the local transmission network from 132kV to 275kV operation, supporting the forecast growth in renewables in the region.\n\nThe decision in October 2022 by Argyll and Bute Council's Planning Committee to raise an objection to SSEN Transmission's proposed overhead line between Creag Dhubh and Dalmally has resulted in a Public Local Inquiry (PLI), which is now under way. SSEN Transmission remains extremely\n\ndisappointed by the decision, which went against the recommendations of the Council's own Planning Officer, with no other statutory stakeholder objections received, and continues to review what this means for its delivery programme and will work with all stakeholders to minimise the impact of this on new renewable generation connections.\n\nIn March 2023, Ofgem provisionally approved long established plans to provide a 220kV subsea transmission link to Orkney, the timing of which remains subject to Ofgem's final decision and ongoing discussions with the supply chain.\n\nFurther expenditure to connect new renewable generation, enable rail electrification and support system security is also expected throughout the RIIO-T2 period and beyond when the need for this investment becomes certain.\n\nSubject to regulatory and planning approvals, SSEN Transmission's expenditure across the price control period could take its RAV to between \u00a38bn to \u00a39bn by 2027.\n\n## Further growth opportunities\n\nIn July 2022, the National Grid Electricity System Operator (ESO) published the Pathway to 2030 Holistic Network Design (HND). It set out the onshore and offshore electricity transmission network infrastructure required to deliver the UK Government's 50GW by 2030 offshore wind target.\n\nIn December 2022, Ofgem published its Accelerated Strategic Transmission Investment (ASTI) framework decision, which provided the regulatory framework under which those investments will be taken forward. Ofgem's ASTI decision is a major step forward in strategic network planning for electricity transmission infrastructure and included 'approval of need' of all investments in SSEN Transmission's network region set out in the HND report as 'required' to enable 2030 targets. The ASTI framework also\n\nunlocks early pre-construction expenditure to help secure the supply chain, alongside allowances to support early construction activities.\n\nIn light of these developments, SSEN Transmission has upgraded its long term RAV target, which is now expected to exceed \u00a315bn by 2032. Subject to timely and positive planning decisions and the outcome of competitive tenders for delivery of these projects, SSEN Transmission is committed to 2030 delivery of these projects.\n\nBeyond these investments, in October 2022, Ofgem published its decision on the onshore and offshore classification of the offshore HND assets. It confirmed that a proposed subsea connection from Fetteresso to a new substation in Lincolnshire will be classed as an onshore electricity transmission asset, which is likely to support further growth.\n\nWith the HND enabling around 11GW of ScotWind's 28GW ambition, a follow-up exercise is now under way which will set out how ScotWind's full offshore wind ambition will be realised, the outcome of which is expected before the end of 2023. The Scottish Government is also consulting on its Draft Energy Strategy and Just Transition Plan, which includes proposals for an additional 8-12GW of onshore wind by 2030.\n\nRecognition by Ofgem and the ESO of these further potential growth and investment opportunities, alongside ever-increasing UK and Scottish Government energy targets and ambitions, underlines the importance of the Transmission network, particularly in the North of Scotland, in transitioning the GB energy system to net zero.\n\nGiven the scale of investment required to deliver net zero, it is crucial that the policy landscape and regulatory framework, particularly financial parameters, continue to attract the investment required to support delivery of the most ambitious investment plan in low-carbon infrastructure for a generation.",

        "page_content": "## SSEN Distribution\n\nSSEN Distribution, operating under licence as Scottish Hydro Electric Power Distribution plc (SHEPD) and Southern Electric Power Distribution plc (SEPD), is responsible for safely and reliably maintaining the electricity distribution networks supplying over 3.9m homes and businesses across central southern England and the North of Scotland. SSEN Distribution's networks cover the greatest land mass of any of the UK's Distribution Network Operators with over 75,000km\u00b2 of extremely diverse terrain. The business has significant growth opportunities as a key enabler of the local and national transition to a net zero future.\n\n## Operational delivery\n\nIn December 2022, Ofgem published its Final Determinations for the RIIO-ED2 price control outlining its response to SSEN's Business Plan 'Powering Communities to Net Zero'. SSEN Distribution accepted Ofgem's Final Determination in March and will continue to work closely with the regulator to ensure the price control has the agility and flexibility required to keep pace with net zero requirements. The price control began in April 2023 and will run until March 2028.\n\n## Major capital investment\n\nThe new price control period will see the acceleration of SSEN Distribution's major capital investment programme across both its networks, delivering significant improvements for customers and supporting future earnings through RAV growth. This builds on continued capital delivery in the final year of RIIO-ED1, where SSEN Distribution invested \u00a3421m, bringing the total investment since the beginning of the price control to \u00a32.7bn.\n\n## Customer interruptions and incentive score\n\nUnder the RIIO regulatory regime and the Interruptions Incentive Scheme (IIS), SSEN Distribution is incentivised on its performance against the loss of electricity supply through the recording of Customer Interruptions (CI) and Customer Minutes Lost (CML), which includes both planned and unplanned supply interruptions. These incentives will typically be collected two years after they are earned.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe SHEPD CI rate increased from 56 in 2021/22 to 60 in 2022/23, with CML increasing from 57 to 59. Whilst performance in response to unplanned network faults improved in comparison to 2021/22, reflecting investment in automation and operational response, a rise in planned interruptions to facilitate new connections has impacted IIS performance. In SEPD, the CI rate increased to 44 up from 42 the previous year and CMLs also increased to 46 from 42 the previous year. Adverse weather which did not qualify as exceptional under IIS provisions and a major transmission fault affecting 55,000 customers were also contributory factors in performance for the period.\n\nIn 2022/23 the SSEN Distribution network was affected by two extreme weather events, an ice storm in Shetland in December 2022 and Storm Otto in February 2023. Power restoration efforts during both weather events were swift and effective as reflected in a motion in the Scottish Parliament praising SSEN Distribution's 'exceptional response' to Storm Otto, citing improvements in restoration, communications and customer service.\n\nIn response to the security of supply concerns across GB and possibility of emergency disconnections, Distribution was the first Distribution Network Operator (DNO) to develop an emergency planning portal for customers and conducted engagement with over 2,500 stakeholders to help ensure preparedness and community resilience.\n\n## Who SSEN Distribution serves\n\nOver 3.9m homes and businesses and generators and service providers that are, or want to be, connected to its distribution networks and customers in its operating areas.\n\n## How it supports SSE's strategy\n\nIt provides timely connection of local renewables and the coordinated delivery of investment and flexible solutions to alleviate network constraints and enable further electrification.\n\n## How it is remunerated\n\nThrough economically regulated returns recovered from customers and connecting parties. Additional earnings come through efficient delivery of investment and performance-related incentives.\n\n'RIIO-ED2 is a critical milestone in the journey to net zero. We have a pivotal role to play in strengthening our network and increasing our resilience, whilst future-proofing our system to enable the greater uptake of low-carbon technologies to allow our customers to meet their net zero goals.'\n\n## Chris Burchell\n\nManaging Director, SSEN Distribution\n\n## SSEN Distribution key performance indicators\n\n|                                                               | March   2023   | March   2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| SSEN Distribution                                             |                |                |\n| Distribution adjusted and reported operating profit - \u00a3m      | 382.4          | 351.8          |\n| Regulated Asset Value (RAV) - \u00a3m                              | 4,720          | 4,054          |\n| Distribution adjusted investment and capital expenditure - \u00a3m | 421.0          | 364.8          |\n| Electricity Distributed - TWh                                 | 36.1           | 37.6           |\n| Customer Minutes Lost (SHEPD) average per customer            | 59             | 57             |\n| Customer Minutes Lost (SEPD) average per customer             | 46             | 42             |\n| Customer Interruptions (SHEPD) per 100 customers              | 60             | 56             |\n| Customer Interruptions (SEPD) per 100 customers               | 44             | 42             |\n\n## Improving customer satisfaction\n\nSSEN Distribution's Broad Measure performance has again improved in 22/23 achieving a total incentive return of \u00a34.4m and continuing the upward trend which has been supported by a comprehensive improvement plan for each Broad Measure category. In 2022/23 SSEN Distribution was the most improved DNO for Customer Satisfaction, with the speed of improvement being five times that of the industry average.\n\nIn 2022/23 SSEN Distribution received its highest ever league table position in the Stakeholder Engagement and Customer Vulnerability (SECV) standings, resulting in an estimated revenue of \u00a31.5m. Support for customers in vulnerable situations also increased with registrations to SSEN's Priority Services Register rising by 11% compared to the previous financial year through targeted communications and partnerships. In addition, over 14,500 households were supported by fuel poverty and energy efficiency measures, an increase of almost 70% on 2021/22.\n\nIn March 2023, SSEN published its Fair Energy Future report, and in doing so became the first DNO to publish a consumer-led just transition action plan aimed at securing a fair and inclusive net zero transition for all.\n\nFor financial performance commentary please refer to the Financial Review.\n\n## Growth opportunities\n\n## Delivering in the new RIIO-ED2 price control period\n\nSSEN Distribution's RIIO-ED2 Business Plan, which was co-created with stakeholders, is a core component of SSE Group's NZAP Plus. The Final Determination from Ofgem provides SSEN Distribution with a proposed total base expenditure of \u00a33.6bn, an uplift of over 22% on the equivalent period in RIIO-ED1, including potential additional investment opportunities of up to \u00a30.7bn over the period through uncertainty mechanisms and reopeners.\n\n## Accelerating connections\n\nWith the transition to net zero gathering pace, SSEN Distribution is seeing a significant rise in the uptake of low-carbon technologies, particularly EV charge points, heat pumps, and battery storage. The business has seen a 75% uplift in the number of electric vehicle charge points connected compared to last year.\n\nThe SEPD network is experiencing rapid growth in both generation and demand requests, with significant large load requests coming from data centres and contracted batteries doubling over the past year. In SHEPD, generation demand has tripled from 3.7GW to 9.5GW over the past 18 months.\n\n## Empowering local investment and growing flexibility\n\nProject LEO, SSEN Distribution's industryleading project established to replicate the future energy system and test flexibility services at the 'grid edge', has concluded.\n\nInsights are now being used to facilitate extensive engagement with local authorities and stakeholders to support local net zero planning. This includes collaborative work with the Isle of Wight Council and local generators to produce a first-of-its-kind local net zero island study, which has identified core network development needed to unlock renewables and meet future demands. This provides a robust case to unlock further investment through uncertainty mechanisms early in the price control.\n\nSSEN Distribution is also increasing tendering its flexibility services in areas where localised high demand can be offset to extend overall network capacity. SSEN's RIIO-ED2 Distribution System Operator Strategy targets delivery of 5GW in flexible services and 3.7GW of flexible connections by 2028. Overall, SSEN will invest around \u00a370m in DSO capabilities in the five-year period, enabling greater consumer take-up of low-carbon technologies while delivering an estimated \u00a3460m of benefits through deferred reinforcement and avoided capital expenditure.\n\n## Building a workforce for the future\n\nDuring the RIIO-ED2 price control period, SSEN Distribution will increase its workforce materially as it delivers the infrastructure required for net zero, safely, efficiently and in line with customers' expectations. In the last year alone, its graduate intake increased by 180% and trainee engineers by 90%, with specific pipelines for digital skills, alignment to and a focus on recruiting for difference, including neurodiversity.",

        "page_content": "## SSE Renewables\n\nSSE Renewables develops and generates zero carbon electricity at scale from wind farms and provides clean flexible power from its hydro schemes. The business comprises existing operational assets and those under development in onshore wind, offshore wind, flexible hydro electricity, run-of-river hydro electricity, pumped storage, as well as solar and battery technology co-located on existing UK and new international markets. In April 2023, the standalone Solar and Battery business, that had previously reported alongside SSE Distributed Energy, was integrated into SSE Renewables to optimise technological, planning and development synergies.\n\n## Operational delivery\n\nSSE Renewables' operational offshore wind installed capacity is 487MW with its onshore wind and hydroelectric installed capacity at 1,969MW and 1,459MW respectively. SSE Renewables is currently leading the construction of more offshore wind than any other company in the world. Whilst availability across all technologies has remained high, the lower-thanexpected wind and rainfall observed over the last three years continued in the last financial year, resulting in lower than normal production.\n\nSSE Renewables' hydro assets play an increasingly critical role in delivering cost-effective, low-carbon flexibility to the system, providing additional diversified revenue streams. Following a very dry summer, autumn rain was above average followed by drier than average conditions over the winter months resulting in output for the year being behind plan. Plant availability, however, was very strong and following an intensive period of summer maintenance outages, which were delivered to plan, winter plant availability was exceptional with the fully flexible plant and the pumped storage asset at Foyers performing particularly well.\n\nSSE Renewables is actively progressing plans to enhance assets across its operational hydro fleet, including the addition of pumping capacity, generation capacity increases and grid services capabilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSSE Renewables is the leading owner, operator and developer of onshore wind farms across the UK and Ireland. Operational onshore wind fleet availability was high throughout the year. Volumes finished at 93% of plan at year end with lower than forecast wind resource in Q4 impacting volumes.\n\nWhile the end of the financial year saw lower wind resource than anticipated, autumn and winter saw an improved performance with Beatrice and Greater Gabbard offshore wind farms achieving 91% of plan overall, reducing to 73% when including Seagreen and the impact of its construction delay. There are now 50 turbines generating at Seagreen producing significant volumes and a new-build Vestas operational service vessel has been mobilised to site.\n\nFor financial performance commentary please refer to the Financial Review.\n\n## Construction programme\n\nAll three phases of the world's largest offshore wind farm at Dogger Bank (each 1,200MW, SSE share 40%) continue to progress. Onshore works are continuing on all three phases, with the three convertor stations at various stages of construction and the onshore HVDC cables already installed on Dogger Bank A and B. The operation and maintenance base at Port of Tyne is complete and was officially opened in March.\n\nOffshore work is well under way for Dogger Bank A with successful installation of the first monopiles and transition pieces and the 175km offshore export cable. In April, Dogger Bank A reached another milestone with the installation of the world's first unmanned HVDC offshore substation, making it the first project in the UK to use this technology to transmit the electricity produced back to shore, ensuring that the electricity is transmitted efficiently over long distances while minimising losses.\n\nDogger Bank A is still expecting to achieve first power during Summer 2023, assuming normal weather. However, due to delays to\n\n## Who SSE Renewables serves\n\nElectricity customers across markets in GB, Ireland and abroad who are increasingly seeking lower-carbon sources of energy.\n\n## How it supports SSE's strategy\n\nSSE Renewables is driving the net zero transition through the development, financing, construction and operation of world-class renewables.\n\n## How it is remunerated\n\nThrough the wholesale electricity market, ancillary services market, Capacity Market, Balancing Mechanism revenue from hydro output, power purchase agreements, and government support schemes for renewable energy.\n\n'We are working to keeping global warming to a 1.5\u00b0C pathway through the development, construction and operation of renewables. We are currently building more offshore wind energy than any other company in the world and we have ambitions to do more, delivering our diverse pipeline of over 11GW across wind, hydro, solar and batteries.'\n\n## Stephen Wheeler\n\nManaging Director, SSE Renewables\n\n## SSE Renewables key performance indicators\n\n|                                                                                   | March   2023   | March   2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| SSE Renewables                                                                    |                |                |\n| Renewables adjusted operating profit - \u00a3m                                         | 580.0          | 568.1          |\n| Renewables reported operating (loss) - \u00a3m                                         | 446.3          | 427.8          |\n| Renewables adjusted investment and capital expenditure   before acquisitions - \u00a3m | 837.5          | 811.0          |\n| Generation capacity - MW                                                          |                |                |\n| Onshore wind capacity (GB) - MW                                                   | 1,285          | 1,285          |\n| Onshore wind capacity (NI) - MW                                                   | 117            | 122            |\n| Onshore wind capacity (ROI) - MW                                                  | 567            | 567            |\n| Total onshore wind capacity - MW                                                  | 1,969          | 1,974          |\n| Offshore wind capacity (GB) - MW                                                  | 487            | 487            |\n| Conventional hydro capacity (GB) - MW                                             | 1,159          | 1,159          |\n| Pumped storage capacity (GB) - MW                                                 | 300            | 300            |\n| Total renewable generation capacity (inc. pumped storage) - MW                    | 3,915          | 3,920          |\n| Contracted capacity                                                               | 2,787          | 2,792          |\n| Generation output - GWh                                                           |                |                |\n| Onshore wind output (GB) - GWh                                                    | 2,770          | 2,502          |\n| Onshore wind output (NI) - GWh                                                    | 286            | 264            |\n| Onshore wind output (ROI) - GWh                                                   | 1,357          | 1,196          |\n| Total onshore wind output - GWh                                                   | 4,413          | 3,962          |\n| Offshore wind output (GB) - GWh                                                   | 1,846          | 1,430          |\n| Conventional hydro output (GB) - GWh                                              | 3,037          | 3,107          |\n| Pumped storage output (GB) - GWh                                                  | 301            | 227            |\n| Total renewable generation (inc. pumped storage) - GWh                            | 9,597          | 8,726          |\n| Total renewable generation (also inc. constrained off) - GWh                      | 10,159         | 9,423          |\n\nNote 2: Contracted capacity includes sites with a CfD, eligible for ROCs, or contracted under REFIT.\n\nthe manufacturing of nacelles for the GE Haliade X turbine, the commercial operations date for Dogger Bank A has been pushed back by a few months to Q3 2024. The project is working with GE to assess whether impacts on Dogger Bank B and C are likely, as well as options to mitigate.\n\nOn Seagreen 1 (1,075MW, SSE share 49%), which will be Scotland's largest and the world's deepest fixed-bottom offshore wind farm once operational, installation of all 114 foundations ('jackets') was completed in April 2023 including the world's deepest jacket at a depth of 58.6m. With 84 turbines installed and 53 turbines exporting power to the grid as of 18 April 2023, the project continues to make significant progress towards its commercial operations date during the summer of 2023.\n\nOnshore, construction is progressing well on Viking (443MW) in Shetland with turbine installation under way and all turbines expected to be up by the end of 2023. Viking is expected to be fully operational by Autumn 2024.\n\nIn Ireland, Lenalea wind farm (30MW, SSE share 50%) construction is progressing and it is due to be completed by the end of 2023. Following a final investment decision in August, Yellow River (101MW) started construction at the beginning of November 2022 and will proceed on a merchant basis.\n\nIn hydro, phase one of the Tummel Bridge power station refurbishment was completed on schedule. The two existing 'camelback' turbines and accompanying machinery were removed in preparation for the installation of two new, bespoke turbines in Q2 2023.\n\n## Growth opportunities Domestic\n\nSSE Renewables' core markets of the UK and Ireland continue to offer considerable growth opportunities.\n\nIn March, the UK Government opened the application window for Allocation Round 5 (AR5). SSE Renewables projects Seagreen 1A Strathy South, Bhlaraidh Extension, Aberarder and Viking are all eligible to bid for the auction, with results expected by September 2023. However, the low administrative strike price (caps) in the auction, particularly for offshore wind, do not reflect the cost increases faced by projects. As a result, SSE Renewables will not be entering Seagreen 1A into the auction. It will continue to seek an alternative route to market to progress this project.\n\nLocated in the North Sea, in the outer Firth of Forth, Berwick Bank wind farm has the potential to deliver 4.1GW of installed capacity, making it one of the largest offshore opportunities in the world.\n\nA consent application was submitted to the Scottish Government in December 2022. The first connection date is in 2027 and the full project could be complete around the end of the decade.\n\nOssian offshore wind farm, owned by the SSE Renewables (3.6GW, share 40%), Marubeni Corporation and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) consortium, is one of the largest floating offshore wind projects in development worldwide and could play a key role in meeting the UK Government's floating wind targets. The project continues to progress through the early stages of development with the Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Report for the Ossian Array submitted to the Scottish Government in March 2023.\n\nNorth Falls offshore wind farm (up to 504MW, SSE Renewables share 50%), an extension to Greater Gabbard off the east coast of England, continues to progress through development ahead of planning submission next year. North Falls could be operational by 2031, depending on the grid connection solution.\n\nIn February, SSE Renewables announced early scoping work to explore options for developing a fourth phase of Dogger Bank wind farm. There are two options being explored for the energy generated: a grid connection and/or green hydrogen production. The project's progression remains subject to agreement with the Crown Estate.\n\nIn March 2023, SSE Renewables' Gordonbush Hydrogen project was shortlisted for funding from the UK Government's Net Zero Hydrogen Fund.\n\nSSE Renewables recently announced additional plans to adapt its existing conventional 152.5MW Sloy hydro power plant with pumping capabilities. Subject to final design, the converted Sloy scheme could be capable of delivering up to 25GWh of long-duration electricity storage capacity, providing vital reserve capacity for an increasingly renewables-led energy system as well as critical energy security back-up.\n\nIn March, SSE Renewables confirmed a \u00a3100m commitment to further develop plans for the Coire Glas pumped hydro storage project (c. 1,300MW). The project, which received planning consent from the Scottish Government in 2020, would more than double Britain's total current electricity storage capacity. Subject to a favourable revenue stabilisation mechanism for long duration electricity storage, Coire Glas could reach a final investment decision by the end of 2024 with the objective of being fully constructed and commissioned by 2031 and therefore play a significant role in the UK Government's 2035 target for a decarbonised power system.",

The planning application for the project, a 21MW solar photovoltaic (PV) array and a 10MW/2hr battery energy storage system, will be submitted in the coming months.\n\n## Growth opportunities International\n\n## Europe\n\nSSE Renewables is progressing its Southern Europe development portfolio with at least three projects (totalling c.100MW) aiming for a final investment decision this year. The first two projects (in France and Spain) are targeting construction commencing in Summer 2023, with at least one further project targeting a final investment decision later in the financial year.\n\nSSE Renewables remains focused on offshore wind in Northern Europe, despite missing out on the Dutch and Polish tender processes. In the Netherlands, SSE Renewables is now focused on the upcoming Ijmuiden Ver zone tenders (2 x 2GW), with bids now expected in Q1 2024 following finalisation of the sites and tender process by the Dutch authorities later this year. SSE Renewables has partnered with APG, acting on behalf of Dutch pension fund ABP (the Netherlands' largest), for the tenders. And in Poland, the business continues to look at offshore partnering opportunities.\n\n## Asia-Pacific\n\nSSE Renewables continues to pursue offshore wind development activities in Japan through its joint venture SSE Pacifico (80% stake). It is assessing participation in the upcoming Round 2 auction whilst also targeting future auctions. The Japanese Government has announced its intention to open up its Exclusive Economic Zone to potential future floating wind projects. SSE Renewables has formed a 50/50 joint venture with Equis to bid for a feasibility licence for an offshore wind farm project in Australia's first Federal Government\n\n## SSE Renewables project pipeline\n\ndeclared offshore wind zone of Gippsland, in waters off the coast of Victoria. The outcome of the bid is expected by the end of 2023.\n\n## North America\n\nSSE Renewables views the United States as an attractive growth market, particularly following the introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act. It continues to actively explore US market entry opportunities across onshore and offshore wind and adjacent technologies.\n\n| Project         | Location   | Technology    | Capacity   (MW)   | SSE Share   (MW)   |\n|-----------------|------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| In construction |            |               |                   |                    |\n| Dogger Bank A   | GB         | Offshore wind | 1,200             | 480                |\n| Dogger Bank B   | GB         | Offshore wind | 1,200             | 480                |\n| Dogger Bank C   | GB         | Offshore wind | 1,200             | 480                |\n| Seagreen 1      | GB         | Offshore wind | 1,075             | 527                |\n| Viking          | GB         | Onshore wind  | 443               | 443                |\n| Yellow River    | Ireland    | Onshore wind  | 101               | 101                |\n| Lenalea         | Ireland    | Onshore wind  | 30                | 15                 |\n| Littleton       | GB         | Solar         | 30                | 30                 |\n| Salisbury       | GB         | Battery       | 50                | 50                 |\n| Ferrybridge     | GB         | Battery       | 150               | 150                |\n\nTotal in construction - GW\n\n2.8GW\n\n## Late-stage development\n\n| Seagreen 1A                       | GB       | Offshore wind   | 500   | 245   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------|-----------------|-------|-------|\n| Bhlaraidh Extension               | GB       | Onshore wind    | 99    | 99    |\n| Strathy South                     | GB       | Onshore wind    | 208   | 208   |\n| Other GB & Ireland                | GB & Ire | Onshore wind    | -     | 137   |\n| Spanish projects                  | Spain    | Onshore wind 1  | 281   | 291   |\n| France, Italy and Greece projects | Various  | Onshore wind 1  | 125   | 125   |\n| Coire Glas                        | GB       | Pumped storage  | 1,300 | 1,300 |\n| ByPass                            | GB       | Solar           | 50    | 50    |\n| Monk Fryston                      | GB       | Battery         | 320   | 320   |\n| Tawnaghmore                       | GB       | Battery         | 100   | 100   |\n\nTotal late-stage development - GW\n\n2.9GW\n\n## Early-stage development\n\n| Berwick Bank                      | GB       | Offshore wind   | 4,100   | 4,100   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------|-----------------|---------|---------|\n| Ossian (ScotWind lease)           | GB       | Offshore wind   | 3,600   | 1,440   |\n| Arklow Bank 2                     | Ireland  | Offshore wind   | 800     | 800     |\n| North Falls                       | GB       | Offshore wind   | 504     | 252     |\n| Cloiche                           | GB       | Onshore wind    | 125     | 125     |\n| Other GB & Ireland                | GB & Ire | Onshore wind    | -       | 311     |\n| Spanish projects                  | Spain    | Onshore wind 1  | 808     | 808     |\n| France, Italy and Greece projects | Various  | Onshore wind 1  | 1,190   | 1,190   |\n| Fiddler's Ferry                   | GB       | Battery         | 150     | 150     |\n| Staythorpe                        | GB       | Battery         | 350     | 350     |\n\nTotal early-stage development - GW\n\n9.5GW\n\nTotal secured pipeline - GW\n\n15.1GW\n\n## Other future prospects\n\n| Dogger Bank D                     | GB      | Offshore wind   | 1,320   | 660     |\n|-----------------------------------|---------|-----------------|---------|---------|\n| Setanta (Braymore Point)          | Ireland | Offshore wind   | 1,000   | 1,000   |\n| Celtic Sea Array                  | ROI     | Offshore wind   | 1,200   | 1,200   |\n| Tarbert                           | Ireland | Offshore wind   | 1,000   | 1,000   |\n| Japanese projects                 | Japan   | Offshore wind   | ~6,000  | ~4,800  |\n| Other GB                          | GB      | Onshore wind    | -       | ~550    |\n| Other Ireland                     | Ire     | Onshore wind    | -       | ~200    |\n| Spanish projects                  | Spain   | Onshore wind 1  | ~1,750  | ~1,750  |\n| France, Italy and Greece projects | Various | Onshore wind 1  | ~700    | ~700    |\n| Other GB Hydro                    | GB      | Hydro           | 75      | 75      |\n| Other Solar                       | GB      | Solar           | ~400    | ~400    |\n| Other Battery                     | GB      | Battery         | ~900    | ~900    |\n| Total future prospects            |         |                 |         | >13,000 |\n\nNotes: All capacities are subject to change as projects refined.

Note 1: Includes solar hybridisation.\n\n## SSE Thermal\n\nSSE Thermal owns and operates conventional flexible thermal generation in GB and Ireland, and around 40% of GB's conventional underground gas storage capacity. These assets provide much-needed system flexibility. SSE Thermal is actively developing options to progressively decarbonise its portfolio, most notably in carbon capture and storage and hydrogen technologies, with biofuel as a bridge into hydrogen.\n\n## Operational delivery\n\n## Who SSE Thermal serves\n\nElectricity suppliers, traders and other generators through the energy market; the national grid, and ultimately electricity customers.\n\n## How it supports SSE's strategy\n\nSSE Thermal is providing critical flexibility to offset renewables variability as the energy system transitions to net zero. The strategic importance of its Gas Storage assets has been highlighted by recent world events and the increasing focus on national energy self-sufficiency.\n\n## How it is remunerated\n\nThe wholesale energy market, Capacity Market and ancillary services market provide the core revenue streams. The fleet also responds to forward market volatility and within day demand, providing flexible generation and storage.\n\n'The performance of our flexible generation and gas storage assets this past year underlines the value that SSE Thermal can create for the Group, the GB energy system and society more broadly. We will continue to optimise these assets while progressing with new, lower-carbon opportunities that will help smooth the transition to net zero.'\n\n## Catherine Raw\n\nManaging Director, SSE Thermal\n\nIn a year of record performance, SSE Thermal's fleet delivered strong availability In the GB market, which increased in the second half. The impact of unplanned outages, most notably at Great Island, more than offset by strong operational availability across the portfolio. This enabled the fleet to use its inherent flexibility to sell output to the market and contract forward ahead of delivery, capturing value through forward spark spreads. The fleet has also been able to optimise in response to market conditions, particularly during periods of low wind. Robust asset management allowed the fleet to meet availability expectations and capture market value through a volatile period, despite outages at Medway, Marchwood and Great Island. Managing availability responsibly is and continues to be a key focus for SSE Thermal, both within year and when taking a view of future system needs.\n\nIn March 2023, Keadby 2, Europe's most efficient CCGT, entered commercial operation following a full commissioning phase which started in October 2021. Keadby 2 includes a first-of-a-kind turbine that displaces older, more carbon intensive plant on the system. Before entering commercial operation, Keadby 2 had been generating intermittently across the year, capturing early value. Keadby 2's 15-year Capacity Market agreement is due to commence in October 2023 and all milestones to secure this agreement have been completed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFollowing an agreement in June, SSE Thermal, alongside Equinor as 50/50 partner, completed the acquisition of the Triton Power portfolio on 1 September in a \u00a3341m transaction, providing additional flexibility and decarbonisation options. The portfolio includes the 1.2GW Saltend power station in the Humber along with two smaller plants, Indian Queens power station, a 140MW OCGT in Cornwall, and Deeside power station in North Wales, a decommissioned CCGT which provides carbon-free inertia to the system. While the Triton portfolio delivered value on an unhedged basis immediately after acquisition, a hedging strategy has since been implemented to reduce ongoing merchant exposure.\n\nIn July, SSE Thermal completed the sale of the closed and decommissioned Fiddlers Ferry power station.\n\nIn March, in line with requirements under the Industrial Emissions Directive, SSE Thermal announced the closure of Tarbert oil-fired power station in Ireland by the end of December 2023. Great Island CCGT and Rhode and Tawnaghmore peaking plant continue to play an important role in a tight system, where increased dispatchable capacity is required to meet system needs.\n\nFor financial performance commentary please refer to the Financial Review.\n\n## Growth opportunities\n\nDeveloping decarbonised alternatives to the existing CCGT fleet will be vital to deliver SSE's goal to cut carbon intensity by 80% by 2030 and achieve its science-based carbon reduction targets, aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C global warming scenario.\n\nIn GB, SSE Thermal is developing projects that include carbon capture and storage (CCS) and hydrogen; technologies that will be critical to the transition to net zero, enabling enhanced renewables deployment by balancing the system. CCS and hydrogen remain at the heart of the UK Government's plans. In the past year, the UK Government has committed to",

Aldbrough Hydrogen Pathfinder seeks to unite hydrogen production, hydrogen storage and a 100% hydrogen-fired open-cycle gas turbine (OCGT) on one site by the middle of the 2020s. This project will enable and inform the scaling up of SSE's, the wider Humber, and the UK's hydrogen ambitions and help de-risk further hydrogen investment. With the role of small-scale peaking plant expected to increase, this integrated concept also delivers expertise and experience in low-carbon OCGTs.\n\nSSE is continuing to develop options for hydrogen blending into Keadby 2, with pre-FEED activity under way. Option assessment and scoping activity for a further 100% hydrogen-fired CCGT at Keadby 3 also continues. Pre-FEED activity is also under way for Aldbrough Hydrogen Storage. The Triton Power portfolio adds to this hydrogen pipeline, with plans to blend up to 30% low-carbon hydrogen by 2027.\n\nIn December Keadby 3 Carbon Capture Power Station became the first power-CCS project to secure planning consent in the UK. Alongside the contract awarded in June for the completion of FEED (Front End Engineering Design), this demonstrates the project's advanced development. In March the UK Government announced the first carbon capture projects to be supported by government-backed contracts - this included projects located in Teesside and the northwest of England. As a Humberbased project, Keadby 3 has not progressed to the final stage of negotiations for a Dispatchable Power Agreement. The UK Government has instead identified the Humber as a region to be supported through subsequent phases of its cluster sequencing process by 2030 at the latest. There are opportunities for Keadby 3 to access CO 2 storage in either the Endurance store (a Track-1 CO 2 transport and storage system) or Viking (identified as a minded-to Track-2 CO 2 transport and storage system\n\nby UK Government). Next steps on cluster sequencing are expected later in 2023, with work progressing to complete FEED for Keadby 3.\n\nThe UK Government also set out further detail for Track-2 clusters. Acorn was identified as a 'minded-to' Track-2 CO 2 transport and storage system, alongside Viking, for deployment by 2030. Acorn would provide CO 2 storage for Peterhead Carbon Capture Power Station. Further expressions of interest for Track-2 clusters are being accepted by the UK Government ahead of next steps being communicated later in 2023. Peterhead Carbon Capture Power Station is continuing to develop with a planning application submitted in March 2022 and announcement of the award of a FEED contract in July. It remains wellplaced to participate in future Dispatchable Power Agreement allocation processes.\n\nSSE Thermal is seeking opportunities to expand its GB low-carbon pipeline. It continues to explore the decarbonisation of the Medway site through hydrogen or CCS. It has identified a potential new location for low-carbon power generation in northwest England, where CCS and\n\n## Gas Storage\n\n## Operational delivery\n\nSSE Gas Storage performed strongly, navigating highly volatile gas markets and optimising assets to help ensure security of gas supply for the UK whilst providing important liquidity to the market. These assets are a significant risk management tool to the portfolio by offering shortnotice flexibility to mitigate exposures from wind speeds and demand variability.\n\nSSE's gas storage assets have made a substantial contribution this year, with high withdrawals and the technical ability to cycle quickly in response to market signals. Over the past three years the equivalent of two caverns of storage have been added through studies into maximum and minimum operating pressures. Aldbrough Caverns 6 and 9 were successfully returned to service ahead of winter 2022/23, adding further capacity. As a result of an increase in future market revenues forecast from these types of assets, the historical impairments have been almost fully reversed on Aldbrough at the year-end.\n\nFor financial performance commentary please refer to the Financial Review.\n\nhydrogen operations are being developed, well-located relative to the HyNet cluster. It is also investigating options to use alternative fuels, such as hydrogen derivatives. Construction activity for Slough Multifuel remains on track to complete in summer 2024.\n\nIn Ireland, SSE Thermal is advancing projects using sustainable biofuel as a lower carbon alternative to fossil-fuels and as a bridge to hydrogen. In March it provisionally secured 10-year Capacity Market agreements for two new lowcarbon power stations to commence in 2026/27 delivery year:\n\n- \u00b7 260MW of de-rated electricity generation at Tarbert (\u20ac129,000/MW)\n- \u00b7 140MW de-rated electricity generation at Platin (\u20ac177,000/MW)\n\nThe proposed low-carbon units at Tarbert in Co. Kerry and Platin in Co. Meath would help to protect security of supply and provide flexible backup to Ireland's growing renewables sector. The proposed units will initially run on Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO), which is produced by processing waste oils to create a fossil-free alternative to diesel in accordance with EU sustainability\n\nstandards. This would provide a bridge to a hydrogen future with both units having the potential to convert to the fuel. As with Aldbrough Hydrogen Pathfinder, these projects reflect the expected role peaking generation will play in the system.\n\nLow-carbon projects in Ireland are progressing alongside activity to deliver a Temporary Emergency Generation unit, at the request of the Irish authorities. Following legislation and a site selection process undertaken by EirGrid, approved by the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, the Tarbert site was selected to host 150MW of generation capacity, to run on distillate oil. It will operate as an emergency plant with a maximum running time of 500 hours per annum. Under the Irish Government's emergency generation legislation, this capacity is to cease operations as soon as the temporary electricity emergency has been addressed, and no later than March 2028. The unit would only be utilised when it is clear that market-sourced generation will not be sufficient to meet system needs.\n\n## SSE Gas Storage key performance indicators\n\n|                                                              | March   2023   | March   2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n| Gas Storage                                                  |                |                |\n| Gas Storage adjusted operating profit - \u00a3m                   | 212.5          | 30.7           |\n| Gas Storage reported operating profit - \u00a3m                   | 249.2          | 125.4          |\n| Gas storage adjusted investment and capital expenditure - \u00a3m | 6.3            | 2.1            |\n| Gas storage level at period end - mTh                        | 123            | 1              |\n| Gas storage level at period end - %                          | 65             | 1              |\n\n## Growth opportunities\n\nUnderlining the clear societal value these assets provide, the UK Government's Powering Up Britain Energy Security Plan, published in March, highlighted that gas storage had operated successfully over the winter helping to meet demand caused by cold weather spells. The UK Government will consider the future role that storage can play in the longer term, considering the need to align with future plans for hydrogen and CO 2 storage. SSE Thermal remains committed to working with UK Government departments and Ofgem to ensure the critical role of UK storage is properly valued, and low-carbon options can be delivered in tandem.\n\nPlans to develop an innovative hydrogen storage project at Aldbrough with Equinor, announced in July 2021, are progressing. Following the commitment in the British Energy Security Strategy to deliver hydrogen transport and storage business models by 2025, the UK Government published a consultation on this at the end of August 2022. This consultation notes the importance of storage as a 'system balancer' and envisages underground hydrogen storage becoming important to the functioning of the hydrogen economy by the end of the decade. As described in the previous section, Aldbrough Hydrogen Pathfinder has progressed to due diligence following a bid into the Net Zero Hydrogen Fund.",

SSE was tested in 2022/23 by unprecedented volatility, and the Board supported decisions and actions that considered the issues of affordability, security, sustainability and fairness.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSupported by the clarity of our purpose and a strong Net Zero Acceleration Programme (NZAP) the objectives of work in the year was clear; to provide sharp focus to the strategic agenda, engage constructively on a fair policy framework for its delivery, and ensure SSE is positioned to deliver for its stakeholders in the long term. This encompasses our responsibility, as a Board, to understand and represent stakeholder views and material issues arising from the current economic backdrop.\n\n## Leading the correct response\n\nThrough the strategic agenda, we have overseen and positively challenged the pace and progress of large capital projects, continuing to assess whether the NZAP pursues the right actions in the changing external context. Our strategy days in Summer 2022 supported in-depth analysis of how the environment has evolved since November 2021, and throughout the year the clear targets we set have been tracked through dialogue with senior leadership, strategic deep dives, and the introduction of an NZAP dashboard. This covers pipelines, project construction and options for further growth. The confidence we have in our growth strategy and the value it will create is reflected in the NZAP Plus plans announced in May 2023. More details are available on page 125 \uf150 .\n\nSignificant progress has been made in the year. We sold a minority stake in SSEN Transmission, and have a clear path for SSEN Distribution to make increased investment under the RIIO-ED2 price control. SSE Renewables progressed flagship projects and continues to pursue opportunities at home and internationally. SSE Thermal enhanced the CCS and hydrogen potential of its portfolio, supported by the partnership acquisition of Triton Power for which we updated our Net Zero Transition Plan. Energy Customer Solutions remains dynamic in its response to cost of living and customer support, and we are providing flexibility for the future through distributed energy, solar and battery technologies. More on Board strategy work is on pages 125 to 129 \uf150 .\n\n## Managing sector impacts\n\nThe risks presented through inflationary pressure, volatile commodity prices, increased competition and the totemic issue of climate change are subject to defined governance through standing Board and Committee work.\n\nOn capital investment, we have reviewed decision-making criteria at regular intervals to ensure opportunities are appraised in line with our view of acceptable returns, an input which is complemented by Audit Committee feedback on our funding and treasury policy.\n\nStrategic Report\n\nOur approach to hedging has provided a baseline to manage portfolio exposures, and we have reviewed the governance and risk metrics overseen by the Energy Markets Risk Committee (EMRC) to ensure controls remain appropriate in the current climate.\n\nSpecific updates have allowed Board and Remuneration Committee input on employee cost of living support and SSE's overall employee value proposition, to ensure actions are considered holistically and support those most deeply impacted.\n\nClimate change and a just transition to net zero sit at the core of SSE's strategy, and focus continues to be provided to our science-based targets, supporting sustainability strategies and transparent reporting of our social, environmental and economic impacts. Accordingly, separate Sustainability and Net Zero Transition Reports accompany this Annual Report.\n\n## Validating our actions\n\nOur analysis of the operating context is not conducted in isolation, and we value additional perspectives to foster unbiased discussion and challenge our view of the long term. Methods to gather insights have included stakeholder soundings of our strategy, guest speaker sessions, and internally facilitated deep dives. Given the speed of change on both a national and international level, a vast array of topics has been covered through external sessions, including the political and economic outlook, policy developments, and the geo-political context.\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I confirm the continued value we place on conversations with shareholders, which take place through investor meetings and events, and questions across the year and around the AGM. We hosted two additional initiatives in 2022/23, an ESG seminar focused on our Net Zero Transition Report, and a two-day session in Inverness which provided the opportunity to meet management teams and visit key sites. Our engagement approach in 2023/24 will continue to support understanding of shareholder opinion and we will respond to the feedback we receive. For the 2023 AGM we again offer inclusive participation through a hybrid meeting and we encourage virtual participation if you cannot attend in person.\n\n## Our people and safety\n\nOur people and their safety are paramount, and I reiterate how saddened we were by the death of Liam Macdonald, a contractor working on Shetland in June 2022. The Board and Safety, Sustainability, Health and Environment Advisory Committee (SSHEAC) apply sharp focus to our safety performance and continue to monitor the\n\nlevel of rigour and support provided. With a rise in contractor hours worked across large capital projects a central Contractor Safety Team is now also in place.\n\nThis was the first year, since Covid-19, where the Board conducted a full schedule of site visits. Virtual large-scale engagement complements this approach, and I am extremely pleased it was a record year for employee participation across SSE with in-person and virtual events attended more than 40,000 times. Collectively we have been able to reach 32 locations across the UK and Ireland, with over 3,500 employees participating in the post-AGM engagement sessions alone.\n\nDame Sue Bruce established the direct link between the Board and employee voice through the Non-Executive Director for Employee Engagement role, and I would like to extend my thanks to Sue for the thoughtful agenda she passes on to Lady Elish Angiolini to lead. We know colleagues value discussing topics of importance with senior leaders and we will support continued and open conversations.\n\nEngagement is supported by the Cultural Dashboard we review twice a year. This has again matured and through purposeful design it prompts thinking of the individual strands which contribute to, or have the potential to influence, our culture. More on employee listening and culture is on pages 134 to 138 \uf150 .\n\n## Assessing performance\n\nIn 2021/22 the external Board evaluation was conducted by Lintstock, following two consecutive internal processes in the preceding years. To provide a measured assessment of progress, we re-engaged Lintstock to complete follow-up reviews in 2022/23 and 2023/24, for which the format will reflect that of our internal evaluation approach. I am pleased the 2022/23 report confirmed our effective operation, and that additional actions have been identified for our plan of Board work. More on the evaluation is on pages 140 to 141 \uf150 .\n\n## Balanced leadership\n\nIn April 2023, we announced the retirement of Gregor Alexander and his stepping down from the Board on 1 December 2023, after what will be 21 years as Finance Director. Gregor has been with SSE since its inception, joining Scottish Hydro-Electric in 1990, and has been instrumental to the transformation of the Group. His financial leadership and counsel are evident in the strong position in which he leaves SSE. Following an external recruitment process, Barry O'Regan, current Finance Director, SSE Renewables, will succeed him as Chief Financial Officer.\n\nWe look forward to working with Barry, who brings depth of financial and energy expertise having been actively involved in SSE's strategic growth.\n\nAs reported previously, and in line with succession plans, Dame Sue Bruce stepped down from the Board on 31 March 2023 and Peter Lynas will not seek re-election at the 2023 AGM. We extend our thanks for the commitment and experience they will have provided to the Board over the last nine years, and Melanie Smith, John Bason and Lady Elish Angiolini bring their own depth of expertise to the Board roles they assume following these non-Executive changes.\n\nStanding Nomination Committee work, in conjunction with 2021/22 evaluation findings, sees one new addition to the Board, with the appointment of Maarten Wetselaar as a non-Executive Director from 1 September 2023. Maarten is a leader in the energy transition and I look forward to welcoming him when he joins.\n\nInclusion and diversity are priority areas for the Board and Nomination Committee, and we commit to reporting transparently on progress. After the above Board changes, membership will comprise 42% women; this is above our 40% ambition and we continue to work within the enduring policy aim of gender parity. In line with the FCA Listing Rule, we explain that the roles of Chair, Senior Independent Director, Chief Executive and Finance Director are all held by men.\n\nWithin senior leadership, we are pleased with the improvement in gender diversity compared to 31 March 2022 but there is more work to do. The reset of our internal ambitions in 2022 sets a minimum standard, not an endpoint, and we continue work to understand the levers for change. We further welcome the Parker Review's recommendation for voluntary ethnicity targets at the same level and will ascertain a challenging yet credible position to work towards for 2027. More on Nomination Committee work is on pages 142 to 149 \uf150 .\n\nI hope you find the Directors' Report which follows a transparent and engaging account of work across 2022/23.\n\nSir John Manzoni Chair, SSE plc 23 May 2023\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Our corporate governance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our corporate governance\n\nCorporate governance in SSE can be explained as the minimum expectations set by the Board surrounding standards, responsible conduct and controls. SSE's Board-led Governance Framework supports this approach by mapping where accountability resides in line with delegated authorities, and as such, is a key part of SSE's System of Internal Control.\n\n## The Board\n\nThe primary role of the Board is to lead SSE in a way that ensures its long-term success, whilst generating value for shareholders and wider stakeholders. This is a broadranging duty and is directed by the cornerstones of SSE's purpose and vision. These guiding statements are considered on an ongoing basis by the Board, and their positioning continues to underpin a strategy focused on clean energy infrastructure and energy security in the transition to net zero.\n\nThe Board agrees and monitors SSE's strategy through a continuing programme of work. In 2021/22, this saw approval and announcement of SSE's Net Zero Acceleration Programme (NZAP), which\n\nwas further updated in May 2023 as explained on page 83 \uf150 . Overseeing execution of the NZAP has been a key Board focus in 2022/23 and complemented by strategic review work to confirm its continued applicability as the optimum pathway for all stakeholders. Details of how SSE's businesses and associated business model provide the best possible balance to deliver this long-term value is set out on pages 2 to 11 \uf150 .\n\n## The Group Executive Committee and Business Units\n\nOnce set by the Board, the implementation of strategy is the responsibility of the Group Executive Committee and management across SSE's Business Units. Oversight of performance is achieved through structured operational and financial reporting from the Executive Directors at each Board meeting, in addition to presentations from each Business Unit across the year. These presentations comprise strategic updates and approvals in line with SSE's Governance Framework. Operational and financial performance for 2022/23 is covered across the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 109 \uf150 .\n\n## Supporting Committees\n\nAreas of importance to the Board and SSE's operations influence the features of the Governance Framework, this is illustrated in part by the Committees which support the Board and the Group Executive Committee. The Board Committees are delegated a specific area of focus by the Board, while the Group Executive Committee establishes and oversees the Committees needed at Group and Business Unit level to achieve strategic delivery. Clarity surrounding the responsibilities of each Committee is ensured through approved Terms of Reference.\n\nMonitoring of delegated matters is supported by formal reporting channels. For Board Committees, this is a personal account from the non-Executive Director who chairs the Committee following each Committee meeting. On executive matters, the Chief Executive, Finance Director and Chief Commercial Officer are responsible for providing full updates at each Board meeting. These mechanisms are in addition to sub-Committee minutes, written reports and agreed KPIs to monitor financial and non-financial performance.\n\n## Board reserved matters\n\nTo safeguard the areas material to the delivery of SSE's purpose, vision and strategy, the Board retains a schedule of matters reserved for its decision. This ensures the necessary framework and resources are in place for the Group to meet its stated objectives and covers the below areas. Examples of how the Board has considered these matters are set out on pages 125 to 131 \uf150 .\n\n## Strategy and performance\n\n- \u00b7 Approval and review of commercial strategy, business development and long-term strategic options.\n- \u00b7 Oversight of performance in line with approved strategy and objectives.\n- \u00b7 Review and approval of priorities surrounding SSE's principal sustainability impacts, including climate change.\n- \u00b7 Major transactions and any material extension or closure of operations.\n\n## Financial management\n\n- \u00b7 Approval of annual operating and capital expenditure budgets.\n- \u00b7 Approval of dividend policy and key financial communications.\n- \u00b7 Changes in SSE's capital structure.\n\n## Risk and control\n\n- \u00b7 Ensuring sound systems of internal control and risk management.\n- \u00b7 Oversight of emerging and principal risks.\n\n## People and culture\n\n- \u00b7 Approach to people, succession, and inclusion and diversity.\n- \u00b7 Agreement and monitoring of a healthy corporate culture including SSE's values and framework of cultural controls.\n\n## Governance\n\n- \u00b7 Changes to Board and Board Committee structure, size and composition.\n- \u00b7 Approval of shareholder communications.\n- \u00b7 Confirmation of stakeholder approach.\n- \u00b7 Approval of Board-level corporate governance matters.\n\n## Regulation\n\n- \u00b7 Approval of the electricity distribution and transmission price control reviews proposed by Ofgem.\n\n## Board Charter\n\nThe Schedule of Reserved Matters is one of a collection of documents which make up SSE's Board Charter. The contents of the Board Charter govern Board operations and pertinent Group-wide matters and is subject to annual Board review and approval. The Board Charter contains:\n\n- \u00b7 SSE plc's Articles of Association.*\n- \u00b7 Board's Schedule of Reserved Matters.*\n- \u00b7 SSE's guide to good business ethics.*\n- \u00b7 SSE's Guide to Governance.\n- \u00b7 Board Committee Terms of Reference.*\n- \u00b7 Non-Audit Services Policy.*\n- \u00b7 Procedure for Taking Independent Advice.\n- \u00b7 Non-Executive Directors' Shareholding Policy.\n- \u00b7 Board Inclusion and Diversity Policy.*\n- \u00b7 Responsibilities of key Board roles.*\n\n* Documents available in full on sse.com \uf295 .\n\n## Board operations\n\nThe Board, led by the Chair, seeks to nurture a culture in which informed and transparent decision-making takes place. This is supported by clearly defined Board roles and constructive dialogue within and outside of meetings. The division of responsibilities across the Board is explained on page 139 \uf150 .\n\nAs one of the key responsibilities of the non-Executive Directors is to challenge and provide counsel, it is deemed appropriate that relationships can be built across SSE. The Board therefore has unfettered access to senior leadership, their teams and\n\nspecialist functions, with individuals from different levels across the organisation invited to present at Board meetings and deep dive sessions. For details of employee engagement and knowledge development in 2022/23 see pages 134 to 136 and 147 \uf150 .\n\nMeeting agendas are developed by the Chair, Chief Executive and Company Secretary. These are structured around a pre-agreed annual plan of Board business and the status of projects, strategic workstreams and the overarching operating context. Adequate time is allocated to support effective and constructive discussion, and guidance is available to authors and presenters of Board materials. An electronic meeting portal allows efficient navigation of papers, information and requests.\n\nBefore or after every Board meeting, the non-Executive Directors meet without the Executive Directors present. This allows any issues surrounding meeting business to be raised separately from full Board discussion.\n\n## Board meetings in 2022/23\n\nIn the period to 31 March 2023, there were six scheduled meetings of the Board with update calls in alternate months to maintain coverage of key business developments, emerging issues and opportunities. Arrangements remain in place should a Board decision or approval be required outside of these times. Where an individual is unable to attend a meeting, feedback is sought in advance by the relevant Board or Committee Chair and Secretary, and a debrief offered thereafter.\n\n|                          | Board   | Nomination  Committee 1   | Audit  Committee   | EMRC   | SSHEAC 2   | Remuneration  Committee 3   |\n|--------------------------|---------|---------------------------|--------------------|--------|------------|-----------------------------|\n| Number of meetings held  | 6       | 8                         | 4                  | 4      | 5          | 4                           |\n| Sir John Manzoni         | 6/6     | 8/8                       | -                  | 4/4    | 3/5        | 4/4                         |\n| Alistair Phillips-Davies | 6/6     | -                         | -                  | -      | -          | -                           |\n| Gregor Alexander         | 6/6     | -                         | -                  | 4/4    | -          | -                           |\n| Martin Pibworth          | 6/6     | -                         | -                  | 4/4    | 5/5        | -                           |\n| Tony Cocker              | 6/6     | 8/8                       | 4/4                | 4/4    | 5/5        | -                           |\n| Lady Elish Angiolini     | 6/6     | 7/8                       | -                  | -      | 5/5        | 4/4                         |\n| John Bason 4             | 5/5     | 5/5                       | 3/3                | -      | -          | -                           |\n| Dame Sue Bruce           | 6/6     | 7/8                       | -                  | -      | -          | 4/4                         |\n| Debbie Crosbie           | 6/6     | 8/8                       | 4/4                | 4/4    | -          | -                           |\n| Peter Lynas              | 6/6     | 7/8                       | 4/4                | -      | -          | 4/4                         |\n| Helen Mahy               | 6/6     | 8/8                       | 4/4                | -      | 5/5        | -                           |\n| Melanie Smith            | 6/6     | 8/8                       | -                  | 4/4    | -          | 3/4                         |\n| Dame Angela Strank       | 6/6     | 7/8                       | -                  | -      | 5/5        | 4/4                         |\n\n- 4 John Bason joined the Board, Nomination and Audit Committee on 1 June 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Considered decision-making\n\n## Decision-making context\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Decision-making context\n\nThe Board has a duty to lead by example and set the correct tone to ensure fair and responsible decision-making across SSE. SSE's Governance Framework represents the backdrop to this, through which the Board confirms ambitions, parameters and expectations to drive long-term success. These expectations are further embodied across SSE's purpose, vision, strategy, and culture, and the belief that stakeholder views should be considered within long-term plans and day-to-day operations.\n\n## Engaging with stakeholders\n\nThe approach to stakeholder engagement is directed by a Board-agreed framework. This confirms SSE's key stakeholder groups; the purpose of meaningful stakeholder relations; and how stakeholder views should be considered at Business Unit and Group level. These principles are explained in the Section 172 Statement on pages 26 to 27 \uf150 .\n\nGiven the societal impact and scale of SSE's business operations, breadth and depth of stakeholder engagement is required, to ensure decisions demonstrate an appropriate degree of stakeholder awareness. A mature executive and business-led stakeholder\n\nnetwork supports this work, with Board oversight and understanding of views achieved through both direct Board engagement and reporting of below-Board activity. This allows the timely recognition of emerging stakeholder considerations, with the Board's own engagement guiding the expectation that senior leadership and SSE's Business Units take demonstrable account of stakeholder opinion in their decisions and longer-term objectives.\n\n## Addressing stakeholder priorities\n\nThe response to stakeholder views across business plans is depicted across the Annual Report, with the pages that follow providing insight surrounding the direct interaction of stakeholder views with Board discussions and decisions in 2022/23.\n\nIt is recognised SSE's purpose, and the issues of energy security and affordability, the climate emergency, and the societal impact of net zero are of wide stakeholder interest. A number of engagement priorities based on these topics have therefore been identified for 2023/24 and are set out opposite.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement priorities\n\nThe following priorities have been identified by the Board for constructive focus and assessment across engagement work in 2023/24:\n\n- \u00b7 Progressing and evolving the Net Zero Acceleration Programme Plus to support stakeholder value creation.\n- \u00b7 Continued leadership and advocacy surrounding a just transition to net zero.\n- \u00b7 Playing a part in addressing the energy related consequences of the ongoing war in Ukraine, with long term energy affordability and energy security being key outputs of Group strategic and Business Unit plans.\n\nRead more on SSE's stakeholders and how the priorities above been identified through supporting engagement on pages 26 to 33 \uf150 .\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## Setting strategy\n\nThe Net Zero Acceleration Programme (NZAP), published in November 2021, set out SSE's fully-funded capex plan to 2026. In the period since then, the NZAP has been the platform for investment in low-carbon assets and electricity infrastructure. A key Board focus across the year was ensuring the NZAP remained the correct pathway for SSE and that its execution was progressing at the correct pace. The growth ambitions and science-based climate targets for achievement by 2031 underpinning it provided a clear framework for decisionmaking and assessment of progress.\n\n## Reviewing external context\n\nThe Board's appraisal and oversight of SSE's situation is supported by an agreed strategic agenda embedded across its annual plan of work. This includes dedicated strategy days, Business Unit-led strategic updates at agreed intervals across the year, and Board-level approvals linked to strategic projects. An NZAP dashboard setting out a holistic view of Group-wide progress was developed at the request of the Board and is reviewed three times a year.\n\n## Board strategy days\n\n## 2022/23\n\nPurpose\n\nAttendees\n\nacross\n\nsessions\n\n## Reviewing the external context\n\n## Confirming\n\n## strategic options\n\nOutcomes\n\nand next\n\nsteps\n\nTo review changes in the external environment since approval of the NZAP and understand the potential impact on long-term direction. Through this assessment, confirm both the risks and opportunities facing SSE and identify key topics which should be considered to continue to maximise shareholder and stakeholder value.\n\n- \u00b7 The Board\n- \u00b7 Group Strategy Team\n- \u00b7 Group Executive Committee\n- \u00b7 Business Unit Leadership Teams\n- \u00b7 Corporate Finance Team\n\nBoard debate was set against the backdrop of unprecedented market volatility driven by macro-economic and geopolitical factors, which have played a role in the energy and affordability crises across 2022/23. Within this context, the Board considered the short-, medium- and long-term actions required to transition to net zero by 2050 and the following influencing external factors material to NZAP execution:\n\n- \u00b7 Policy and regulatory frameworks to deliver energy security and market reform for a fair and just transition to net zero.\n- \u00b7 Economic and inflationary pressures on project delivery, supply chains and wider stakeholder experience.\n- \u00b7 The competitive environment, market share and diversification across geographies.\n- \u00b7 The growth landscape and risk-adjusted returns of the existing pipeline, new projects and technologies.\n- \u00b7 The role of SSE's key stakeholder relationships in NZAP delivery.\n\nThe continued shareholder and societal value of the NZAP and its alignment with SSE's purpose was tested through assessment of the following areas:\n\n- \u00b7 The optimum business mix to support net zero and deliver long-term value in an evolving energy sector.\n- \u00b7 Progress against NZAP targets across each Business Unit and the pathways supporting growth and identification of further opportunities.\n- \u00b7 Financial strategy incorporating the balance of capital allocation and the ways to fund accelerated growth.\n- \u00b7 Investor priorities and views surrounding strategy and NZAP ambitions.\n- \u00b7 The role of SSE's people, the embedded organisational culture, skills and capabilities.\n\nThe following represents the outcomes and next steps which were agreed to shape upcoming Board work:\n\n- \u00b7 Confirmation that SSE's business mix remains optimal for it to focus on NZAP execution.\n- \u00b7 Approval of the strategic priorities for each Business Unit and agreement on the optimal growth areas within them.\n- \u00b7 Setting an ongoing programme of strategic questions and topics for consideration throughout 2022/23.\n\nSupplementing the above are strategic deep dives which examine specific areas of growth or material factors on which future priorities depend. To bolster the Board's approach to challenge and understanding of stakeholder views, objective opinions are sought through soundings on strategy and by inviting external speakers to present views on the external operating environment and future trends. Details of deep dives and external engagements which took place in 2022/23 are set out opposite.\n\nFollowing consideration of SSE's opportunities and recent business performance, as well as the external environment and the acceleration of the global green transition, in May 2023, the Board approved SSE's NZAP Plus. This rolls forward the original NZAP by 12 months to 2027 and upgrades the targets, ambitions and investment mix to reflect the enhanced opportunities SSE has. The Board is clear that the NZAP Plus is still a fully-funded plan, now including expected capital and investment of \u00a318bn over the five year period to 2027. For full details of NZAP Plus see page 83 \uf150 .\n\n## Strategic deep dives\n\n9 sessions held covering:\n\n- \u00b7 Pumped storage and digitalisation\n- \u00b7 Transmission investment drivers\n- \u00b7 Distribution networks and net zero\n- \u00b7 The role of carbon capture and storage\n- \u00b7 The future for hydrogen\n- \u00b7 International energy markets\n- \u00b7 Commodity risk metrics and management\n- \u00b7 Digital innovation\n- \u00b7 Sustainability and climate reporting\n\n## Engaging external opinion\n\n10 external speakers engaged providing diverse perspectives on:\n\n- \u00b7 UK political and economic outlook\n- \u00b7 Domestic policy environment\n- \u00b7 Global politics and economics of the energy transition\n- \u00b7 Time value of new technologies",

The strategic drivers remain the deployment of end-to-end large capital project expertise to address global net zero ambitions and enhance portfolio diversity. At home, as generation is increasingly led by intermittent wind output, the Board confirmed its view of the important role of pumped hydro storage and installed battery capacity to provide system flexibility and integrate renewable energy.\n\n## Section 172 and stakeholder factors\n\n- \u00b7 Delivering long-term energy affordability. Developing and building indigenous renewable energy and storage is part of the solution to long-term security of supply and affordability.\n- \u00b7 Futureproofing market design. Project decisions and bid parameters have been based on an assessment of risk-return profiles within current policy frameworks. A key focus has been constructive engagement with policy makers to ensure the energy system promotes investment in net zero-linked projects, whilst delivering societal benefit and a fair return for investors.\n- \u00b7 Safeguarding supply chains. A Board review considered procurement and commercial activity and engagement, to support supply chain capacity and capability for new and future projects. In addition to the impact of inflation, commodity exposure, material scarcity, and the potential sustainability risks of new technologies.\n\n## Next steps and future opportunities\n\n- \u00b7 Exporting expertise. Continuing to apply financial discipline to international expansion, building diversity, and leveraging SSE's approach to partnering across complementary geographies which align with SSE's culture and values.\n- \u00b7 Promoting system flexibility. Advancing the case for policy and market design frameworks that support investment in long-duration pumped storage hydro technologies which is vital in the transition to net zero.\n\n## Link to NZAP Plus\n\n- \u00b7 Capital expenditure and investment\n- \u00b7 Net installed renewable capacity\n\n## Link to 2030 Goals\n\n## Link to NZAP Plus\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Capital expenditure and investment\n- \u00b7 Net low-carbon flexible capacity\n\n## What did the Board review: 6,7,8,9\n\nThe long-term decarbonisation of the UK power system relies on a pipeline of viable low-carbon projects which can support security of supply and grid stability. The Board has confirmed the platform industrial low-carbon clusters can provide for these projects, and underpinned by the principles of a just transition to net zero, reviewed opportunities to repurpose existing thermal generation sites and partner on the new technologies needed to drive change.\n\n## Section 172 and stakeholder factors\n\n- \u00b7 Security of supply for society. Low-carbon thermal generation is the flexible back-up to a predominantly renewables energy system. The Board commits to deploying SSE's capabilities and partnership expertise to deliver these new technologies, which allow employees to transfer existing skills to transition to net zero.\n- \u00b7 Reducing environmental impact. SSE has a Boardapproved target to achieve net zero emissions across scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2040 at the latest (subject to security of supply requirements) and for remaining scope 3 emissions by 2050 at the latest. This long-term ambition is supported by a series of interim targets approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) and aligned to a 1.5\u00b0C pathway.\n- \u00b7 Stakeholder expectations. The Triton acquisition considered ESG investor views and the long-term priority to decarbonise the sites on which the assets were situated. Transparency surrounding the impact of this decision was ensured through updates to SSE's Net Zero Transition Plan, to confirm the approach to managing and reporting on the GHG emissions associated with investments.\n\n## Next steps and future opportunities\n\n- \u00b7 Advancing low-carbon thermal. New low-carbon flexible generation - using CCS and hydrogen technology - is key to reducing emissions and transitioning away from unabated gas generation.\n- \u00b7 Supporting local economies. Ongoing engagement with local communities will support the creation of low-carbon economies in areas impacted by the decline of carbon intensive activity. The objective is to deliver local benefit and strengthen stakeholder relations through open dialogue.\n\n## Link to 2030 Goals\n\nFinancial Statements",

The Board has reviewed performance against the plan and provided financial approvals for projects within its certain view. To support growth, the sale of a 25% minority stake in the business was approved in November 2022. This was followed by confirmation from Ofgem, within its network-wide Accelerated Strategic Transmission Investment (ASTI) framework, of eight additional investments within SSEN Transmission's network area required to meet the Government's 2030 ambitions.\n\n## Section 172 and stakeholder factors\n\n- \u00b7 Unlocking value. The stake sale was assessed against SSE's strategic partnership criteria and Ontario Teachers' were deemed to be a strong fit for a minority shareholder in SSEN Transmission. The sale parameters were confirmed to have no detrimental impact on stakeholders, and the proceeds directly supported the NZAP and now the NZAP Plus, through net zeroenabling investment in SSEN Transmission and a rebalancing of capex across SSE's Business Units.\n- \u00b7 Framework for growth. The priorities raised through SSEN Transmission's response to the proposed ASTI framework, aligned with the Board's view of certainty over the need for transmission network capacity for 2030 and informed engagement with stakeholders to enable success, including the supply chain.\n- \u00b7 Powered by people. Updates were considered on workforce planning, focusing on critical talent and targeted programmes for diversity, pipelines, and training and development which supporting the pace of required expansion.\n\n## Next steps and future opportunities\n\n- \u00b7 A network for net zero. Delivery of a price control business plan that protects customers' interests and supports the building of national critical infrastructure remains a priority.\n- \u00b7 Supply chain management. Ongoing engagement with supply chain partners to ensure resource capacity and material availability meets SSEN Transmission's needs as it reinforces the network in the North of Scotland.\n\n## Link to NZAP Plus\n\n- \u00b7 Capital expenditure and investment\n- \u00b7 Net networks RAV\n- \u00b7 Net debt/EBITDA consistent with investment grade rating\n\n## Link to 2030 Goals\n\n## Link to NZAP Plus\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Capital expenditure and investment\n- \u00b7 Net installed renewable capacity\n- \u00b7 Net networks RAV\n- \u00b7 Net low-carbon flexible capacity\n\n## What did the Board review: 17\n\nProgress towards net zero requires constructive dialogue with policy makers. In May 2023, the Board reviewed 'From Ambition to Action: A Delivery Plan for Cleaner, Homegrown Energy'; a resource to help frame political engagement over the course of the year as political parties develop their own manifestos ahead of an upcoming General Election. In doing so, it considered the policies which SSE advocates should be adopted, to deliver investment in clean energy infrastructure and achieve cross-party ambitions on decarbonisation, energy security and the green economy. All of which are aligned to and consistent with SSE's NZAP Plus and 2030 Goals.\n\n## Section 172 and stakeholder factors\n\n- \u00b7 Championing progress . With political attention turning towards a likely General Election in 2024 political stakeholders will be increasingly focused on setting out the policy platform which they will present to the electorate. These will ultimately come together in the party manifestos which are published prior to the election.\n- \u00b7 Supporting net zero policy . All political parties have made significant commitments to decarbonise the power sector; increase deployment of renewables; and boost investment in homegrown energy infrastructure.\n- \u00b7 Stakeholder-led advocacy. The SSE manifesto is tailored to the priorities of our stakeholders and is designed to set out tangible policies which could be adopted to help the parties achieve their publicly stated-targets.\n- \u00b7 Maintaining neutrality. As with all of SSE's engagement, the document will be politically neutral and applicable across the parties; focusing on areas where there is broad social consensus on the direction of travel for the energy sector.\n\n## Next steps and future opportunities\n\n- \u00b7 Framework for progressive engagement. SSE's Ambition to Action document will form the basis of policy engagement from its launch in May 2023, through to the General Election. Bi-lateral, party neutral engagement with key stakeholders will be conducted throughout a programme of events including at Party Conferences.\n- \u00b7 Setting a long-term framework. SSE will periodically refresh Ambition to Action to ensure that it has longevity and relevance over this period; including adding public polling data to demonstrate levels of support amongst the electorate for the positions included.\n\n## Link to NZAP Plus\n\n- \u00b7 Capital expenditure and investment\n- \u00b7 Net installed renewable capacity\n- \u00b7 Net networks RAV\n- \u00b7 Net low-carbon flexible capacity\n\n## Link to 2030 Goals\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Increasing investment in local networks\n\n## What did the Board review: 13,14,15\n\nSSEN Distribution's Business Plan for the RIIO-ED2 price control period sets out the investment and targeted improvements for the 3.9m customers in communities across its network. Following initial submission of the Business Plan in November 2022, the Board has remained updated on the structured dialogue between SSEN Distribution and Ofgem across the determination process, which led to final settlement in March 2023.\n\n## Section 172 and stakeholder factors\n\n- \u00b7 Supported by stakeholders. SSEN's RIIO-ED2 Business Plan, co-created through extensive stakeholder engagement, remains committed to significant improvements in reliability, resilience, and services for customers, alongside acceleration of investment in local network infrastructure and flexible systems to power communities to net zero.\n- \u00b7 Fair outcomes. Considering each stage of SSEN Distribution's finalisation of the Business Plan with Ofgem, the Board reviewed the commitment to increase investment and commensurate benefits for end-users.\n- \u00b7 Supporting communities. Following the storms of winter 2021/22, the Board assessed findings from comprehensive reviews which considered the business's response to the exceptional weather events and impact on customers. This informed the view of system reliability covered by RIIO-ED2 proposals and saw endorsement of next steps to shape future approach.\n\n## Next steps and future opportunities\n\n- \u00b7 Minority stake sale. While the November 2021 NZAP assumed a 25% minority stake in the SSEN Distribution business, SSE consistently reviews strategic options and direction and the NZAP Plus plan now reflects retaining 100% of the business. A significant strengthening of SSE's balance sheet and an upgraded NZAP Plus investment plan are the main factors contributing to the Board assessment that continuing to hold 100% of SSEN Distribution is the right strategy at this time.\n- \u00b7 A focus on service. Ongoing monitoring of delivery of the RIIO-ED2 Business Plan, with focus on effectiveness of the system reliability measures within it.\n\n## Link to NZAP Plus\n\n- \u00b7 Capital expenditure and investment\n- \u00b7 Net networks RAV\n- \u00b7 Net debt/EBITDA consistent with investment grade rating\n\n## Link to 2030 Goals\n\nStrategic Report\n\nDirectors' Report\n\n## SSE's 2030 Goals\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCut carbon\n\nintensity by 80%\n\nIncrease renewable energy output fivefold\n\nEnable low-carbon generation and demand\n\nChampion a fair and just energy transition\n\n## Focusing on a fair net zero transition\n\n## What did the Board review: 16\n\nWith SSE's strategy focused on low-carbon investments, the Board is concerned to ensure that the interdependencies of climate action are understood and, where appropriate, managed carefully. Ensuring a fair transition to net zero for working people, consumers and communities is outlined in SSE's Just Transition Strategy, published in 2020. In March 2023, the Board reviewed progress against that strategy and had oversight of the publication of a first-of-a-kind progress report. The Board also considered the priorities for action in the year ahead, including an enhanced focus on attracting former high-carbon workers into SSE.\n\n## Section 172 and stakeholder factors\n\n- \u00b7 Embedding stakeholder dialogue. SSE's principles for a just transition to net zero are underpinned by a commitment to high quality multi-stakeholder dialogue. SSE's Board was represented at an event in London in April 2023 to launch the report, 'Just transition: measuring progress' which provided an opportunity to bring together stakeholders including employees, trade union partners, suppliers, investors, and NGOs, amongst many others.\n- \u00b7 Understanding stakeholder views. Employees and their trade union representatives are concerned that SSE delivers opportunities for the existing workforce as it continues to transition away from high carbon activity. Investors are keen to be able to track SSE's progress and hold it to account. Environmental NGOs want to be certain there is no watering down of climate commitments, and human rights advocates are focused on protecting the rights of working people in SSE's supply chains.\n\n## Next steps and future opportunities\n\n- \u00b7 Supporting people and communities. In the year ahead, SSE will further develop interventions to attract and support former high carbon workers, particularly those from the oil and gas industry. The transition to smart electricity grids at a local level, provides opportunities to deliver benefits to consumers and actions will be taken to ensure the benefits reach as wide a population as possible.\n- \u00b7 Reporting on progress. Achieving, and balancing the multitude of social expectations in the transition to net zero will be supported by maximum transparency. In addition to continuous stakeholder engagement, SSE has committed to provide a biannual dedicated Just Transition Report, alongside its usual annual disclosures.\n\n## Link to 2030 Goals\n\nFinancial Statements",

Engagement by the Chair leads on corporate governance, strategy development, people and wide-ranging ESG matters.\n\nOpen and regular dialogue remains the foundation to the Board's approach, with managed communication channels in place for all to use (see page 345 \uf150 ). Notwithstanding, the Board, executive management and the Investor Relations team proactively engage with investors through an annual programme of activity; and ongoing communication with analysts, proxy advisors, ESG ratings agencies and financial ratings agencies helps improve disclosure and allows stakeholders to better assess SSE's performance.\n\nEngagement in action Shareholders and debt providers\n\n## Institutional investors\n\nCollectively, in 2022/23, the Board engaged directly with institutional investors representing over 45% of issued share capital. The programme of engagement which encompassed 182 one-to-one sessions with investors - was mainly focused across three periods of roadshows: immediately following the preliminary Full-year Results announcement; in advance of the Annual General Meeting; and immediately following the Half-year Results announcement.\n\nMembers of the Executive Team met physically with investors in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Switzerland, and Australia during the year, and virtually met with investors from other locations such as North America and Asia. This complemented a number of physical and virtual investor events which covered specific focus areas as set out below and opposite. The Chair also continued proactive and open dialogue with investors on priorities and views of corporate governance, meeting physically with many of SSE's largest shareholders in advance of the Annual General Meeting.\n\nSupplementing one-to-one engagement, the Executive Directors attended 15 industry conferences, mainly physical, and held 29, mainly virtual, group meetings which were attended by a number of shareholders and prospective investors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Showcasing SSE's Transmission and Renewables businesses\n\nIn September 2022, an in-person event was hosted by the Finance Director in Inverness, for sell-side analysts and large institutional shareholders to delve deeper into SSE's Transmission and Renewables businesses. Each area was discussed on separate days and sessions facilitated by presentations from the senior managers leading on strategic execution within the respective Business Units.\n\nThese materials, and supporting discussions which were made available on sse.com \uf295 shortly after the event, demonstrated the value of each business's\n\nassets and the available investment opportunities. To provide additional context, site visits to Blackhillock HVDC converter station, Glendoe hydroelectric scheme and Stronelairg wind farm formed part of the agenda.\n\nThe event was met with highly positive feedback, with attendees confirming the presentations were educational; the exposure to wider senior management demonstrated their expertise; and the site visits brought the scale and quality of assets to life.\n\n## Retail shareholders\n\nTo allow management of an individual's shareholding, SSE's recently refreshed investor website houses all regulatory news announcements and published financial and non-financial reports. The Investor Relations team and the Company Secretariat, with support from SSE's Registrar, engage directly with retail shareholders in response to private shareholding queries.\n\n## Annual General Meeting (AGM)\n\nThe Board encourages shareholders to participate in the AGM - through casting votes and raising questions on the business of the meeting. A hybrid meeting format allows full remote participation for those who cannot attend in person, and answers to questions and the results of the meeting are published on sse.com \uf295 as soon as practicable after the event. In 2022, all resolutions were passed with in excess of 81.90% votes cast in favour.\n\n## Debt investors\n\nEngagement with solicited credit ratings agencies, being Standard & Poors' and Moody's, takes place throughout the course of the year, with increased dialogue ahead of the annual ratings review process and in line with Company related news flows. Regular dialogue is also maintained between key relationship banks and debt investors with SSE's Treasury team and the Finance Director.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategic Report\n\nEngagement in action Shareholders and debt providers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Continued dialogue on climate\n\nFollowing the publication of SSE's Net Zero Transition Plan, and in support of the first annual shareholder vote on its Net Zero Transition Report (proposed at the 2022 AGM), the Chair hosted a climate-focused investor event with SSE's Chief Commercial Officer and Chief Sustainability Officer in June 2022. This online event set out SSE's progress in relation to its agreed climate targets - covering climate-related strategies, plans and performance as well as touching on SSE's work on the just transition.\n\nThis engagement was set against the backdrop of how SSE strives to balance social, environmental and economic impacts whilst enhancing value for stakeholders. To allow questions and feedback on SSE's approach a Q&A session followed the presentations. Following the session, stakeholders confirmed improved understanding of SSE's decarbonisation plans and Just Transition Strategy; and the resolution to receive SSE's Net Zero Transition Report received 98.9% of votes cast in favour at the AGM.\n\n## Sharing and interpreting feedback\n\nThe Board receives monthly updates on investor and financial market sentiment, providing insight into recent share price movements; a briefing on recent sell-side analyst commentary; and key monthly movements in the share register. This is covered through a combination of written reports and verbal feedback from meetings which have taken place.\n\nThe feedback provided by shareholders during and after Full-year and Half-year Results Roadshows is communicated directly to the full Board in a biannual shareholder feedback paper including updates from SSE's brokers. The Board, through the SSHEAC, receives a full annual review of SSE's performance in investor-led ESG reviews and ratings in addition to, through the Finance Director, updates on credit ratings agency reviews.

These are set out in full below and include face-to-face discussions at meetings, site visits, and attendance at employee events. With 2022/23 being the first year in which in-person engagements could fully resume, the Board-employee programme travelled to 32 sites encompassing all of SSE's Business Units and a number of corporate functions.\n\nVirtual engagement platforms, which evolved during the pandemic, have remained a key part of the engagement strategy providing simultaneous access to a diverse audience of roles and locations.\n\nThe scale at which virtual sessions can be offered amplifies understanding of employee views and material issues.\n\nThe adoption of a diverse range of listening channels continues to support the principle that everyone in SSE should have a voice and is consistent with employee feedback surrounding the benefit of multiple platforms through which to raise areas of interest or concern. In turn, it supports the Board in gathering a fair and representative view of the issues which are important to employees and builds an appreciation of how these may differ by geography, business area, role, and individual circumstances.\n\n## Board listening approach\n\n## Engagement audience and purpose\n\n## All-employees\n\n- \u00b7 Offers Board perspectives which can otherwise be missed from business-led communications.\n- \u00b7 Provides the Board with insight of employee opinion on life at SSE and key areas of interest or concern.\n\n## People leaders\n\n- \u00b7 Provides the opportunity to replay key messages which the Board has heard through listening channels.\n- \u00b7 Supports and challenges management actions in response.\n\n## Engagement format and value created\n\n## Director-employee sessions\n\nProvides employees with access to the Board with direct two-way interaction supporting detailed discussion of specific topics.\n\n## Leadership and business roadshows and conferences\n\nProvides an opportunity to exchange views on SSE's strategy and both Groupwide and business-specific priorities, supporting wider engagement and awareness including the contribution and impact made by employees.\n\n## Focus groups\n\nAllows interaction across diverse geographies and cross-sections of employees, and being smaller in size, provides the opportunity to seek out added context surrounding employee sentiment through true conversation. The impact can be fast and influence decisions which may affect employees.\n\n## All-employee surveys\n\nExists as a long-standing tool with a mature strategy that attracts a strong response rate. The results are viewed as representative of the majority of employee voices and shape the cultural agenda, ensuring that employee sentiment is considered in all key decision making.\n\n## Senior leadership\n\n- \u00b7 Creates a platform for two-way interaction between the Board and senior leaders who lead SSE's teams.\n- \u00b7 Allows the Board to offer views and personal external perspectives.\n\n## Site visits\n\nAllows non-Executive Directors to travel across SSE and feel and understand employees' experience of the operational environment. These visits can be followed by informal roundtables to allow deeper two-way dialogue on matters of importance.\n\n## Digital channels and written communications\n\nReinforces matters of importance and embeds the tone through the Board's written reflections. This can include observations and takeaways from other engagement activities to allow a wider reach.\n\n## Engagement highlights\n\nSites visited\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBoard-led virtual engagement sessions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNon-Executive Director for Employee Engagement sessions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n13\n\nTotal employee attendance at Board calls\n\n23,835\n\nLargest audience size\n\n3,781\n\nAll-employee survey\n\nengagement score 2022/23\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nStrategic Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Non-Executive Director for Employee Engagement\n\nThe Nomination Committee oversees the recommended appointment of the Non-Executive Director for Employee Engagement, which Lady Elish Angiolini assumed from 1 April 2023 in a handover from Dame Sue Bruce. In considering the successor to the role, the Nomination Committee noted Elish's rich experience in assimilating and interpreting views and translating findings into a required course of action. These skills support the core purpose of the employee-Board link and the desire to operate in an empathetic and thoughtful way.\n\nThe creation of the role remains a natural and progressive step in the evolution of SSE's employee voice strategy, providing an enhanced and more interactive understanding of employee sentiment.\n\nEach year, the programme of work for the Non-Executive Director for Employee Engagement is structured and supported in collaboration with SSE's Head of Employee Engagement. The success of the role is measured in action, whereby the employee voice is consistently represented in meetings attended by the Non-Executive Director for Employee Engagement, allowing the views and opinions of colleagues to feature and contribute to discussions and decisions being made.\n\n## Q&A with Lady Elish Angiolini\n\n## What are your reflections on the value of direct Board-employee engagement in SSE?\n\nEngagement is very valuable to the Board as it builds trust, collaboration and aligns the Board and employee approach. I can see how the Board seeks diverse feedback from employees delivering on strategy, and it's essential that direct engagement continues as a core activity.\n\n## Since joining the Board in 2021, what insight have you gained into the employee experience in SSE?\n\nThis is a period of record growth and we must continue investing in face-to-face and virtual engagements to understand how employees and SSE's culture are responding. We should also build on relationships with employee-led groups like the 'Belonging in SSE' communities, who are strong advocates of the employee voice.\n\nEngagement in action Employees\n\nFinancial Statements\n\n## Where do you see opportunities for 2023/24?\n\nI've been able to speak with many colleagues across SSE and have been impressed with the dedicated team spirit and commitment to SSE's purpose. A willingness to share views has given me a good understanding of employee experiences in SSE and I look forward to exploring priorities in conversations to come.\n\n## What skills and perspective would you like to bring to conversations in the year?\n\nI have an inquisitive nature and like to listen to all views to encourage honest and frank discussion, which will help highlight areas for me to bring to the Board. I've also been involved with organisations undergoing intense periods of change and this will support my understanding of employee sentiment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Engaging on net zero\n\nThe successful delivery of SSE's strategy is dependent on employees feeling engaged with the Group's purpose. A key objective over 2022/23 was therefore connecting people's roles with net zero and feeling engaged with senior leaders. Full Board attendance at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) 2022 was seen as an opportunity to deliver this.\n\nThe event was used for both in-person and virtual interaction, with members of the Board taking part in a roundtable discussion with colleagues from a range of businesses, geographies and demographics, alongside leads from the 'Belonging in SSE' communities. The employee group sought advice, opinions and feedback on topics including flexible working patterns, the challenges faced by neuro-diverse colleagues, mental health awareness and career progression.\n\nThe AGM virtual Q&A session was open to all employees and attended by more than 3,500 people from across Great Britain and Ireland. Directors addressed queries on a wide range of issues and of the attendees who provided feedback on the event, 90% said they valued hearing from the Board and 85% found the session helped them to connect their roles to the Group's net zeroaligned strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This context is reflected within the above Board-approved definition of a healthy corporate culture, which supports purpose, vision, strategy and long-term success, by setting a baseline against which cultural guidance can be developed and cultural indicators tested.\n\n## Setting the tone\n\nA healthy corporate culture is a shared deliverable, which starts with the Board setting the correct tone. This is supported through approval of SSE's values, and their translation into accepted attitudes and behaviours within SSE's Group Policies and an employee guide 'Doing the Right Thing; SSE's guide to good business ethics', all of which are supported by mandatory training for everyone in SSE.\n\nLeading by example is through the Board's own conduct and communication to\n\nEngagement in action Employees\n\nemployees of key Board activity.

These visits further enhanced understanding of the cultural tone and sentiment across Business Units.\n\nRenewables. Visits by the Chair, John Bason, Dame Angela Strank and Tony Cocker covered Coire Glas site investigation works, Stronelairg wind farm, and Foyers and Glendoe power stations over a two-day period, gaining insight into the challenges and progress in current and future renewables operations from employees. The Chair visited Dogger Bank wind farm HVDC\n\nstation and engaged with partner and contractor representatives on project scope, approach and progress, and as part of his induction John Bason visited Montrose harbour, the site associated with the Seagreen offshore wind farm, to gain a deeper insight into the industry.\n\nThermal. Helen Mahy visited the Thermal engineering hub in Leeds to meet and discuss areas important to the Team including inclusion and diversity, development and mentoring, the results of the all-employee survey and technical developments including Carbon Capture and Storage.\n\nNetworks. In advance of a Board meeting, engagement took place with employees working on flexible energy trials at the innovation project, Local Energy Oxfordshire (LEO). Insight was gathered surrounding the technical, commercial, social and regulatory challenges and the potential for a community-based approach to local flexibility.\n\nEnergy Customer Solutions. Lady Elish Angiolini visited the team in Belfast to learn more about improvements to the customer experience and compliance, and heard examples of the challenges experienced by customers in vulnerable circumstances and how colleagues support each other when dealing with hardship and difficult customer scenarios.\n\nobserved behaviours and trends. These can be described as a combination of the below reported metrics, standing reports and listening channels.\n\n- \u00b7 Feedback from Board-employee engagement and Non-Executive Director for Employee Engagement insights.\n- \u00b7 Employee survey results.\n- \u00b7 Twice yearly Cultural Dashboard review.\n- \u00b7 Monthly people updates from the Chief Executive covering key developments and employee sentiment.\n- \u00b7 Monthly compliance reporting from the Finance Director.\n- \u00b7 Monthly safety and wellbeing data.\n- \u00b7 Whistleblowing performance reports.\n\nThe Cultural Dashboard (see page 138 \uf150 ) remains a health check, comprising data from Group HR and Group Compliance. A key section aligns employee survey data with people metrics and KPIs under cultural strands. This allows the Board to consider where there are deviations between what is being heard and underlying behaviours.

This is assessed annually through the Board evaluation process.\n\nThe 2022/23 Board and Board Committee\n\nevaluations were facilitated by Lintstock Ltd (Lintstock). This followed Lintstock conducting the 2021/22 external Board and Board Committee performance reviews, with their services re-engaged for a further two years to provide efficient and consistent oversight of the actions and themes identified.\n\nThe methodology of the 2022/23 followup reviews were aligned with that of an internal evaluation and structured to allow identification of new focus areas. Besides the provision of the Board and Board Committee evaluation work, there was no other contractual connection between SSE or the individual Directors and Lintstock.\n\n## Progress against 2021/22 evaluation findings\n\n| Opportunities for refinement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Update on actions                             |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| The Board reviewed proposals for monitoring progress on strategic execution and agreed updates   to further optimise Board oversight.

There was an opportunity for the Board   to complement this, through the use of third-party or external expertise on particular topics.  Accordingly, Board deep dives have been conducted and several external speakers engaged to  provide a diverse perspective on certain subjects (see  page 125 \uf150 ). | Leveraging   external voices                  |\n\n## 2022/23 Board evaluation process\n\n## Stage 1 Re-engaging Lintstock\n\nFollowing a selection process, and in compliance with the UK Corporate Governance Code, Lintstock were engaged to perform an external review of the Board and its Committees in 2021/22. After seeking the opinion of the Board, the Chair with assistance from the Company Secretary and Director of Investor Relations, re-engaged Lintstock to facilitate the Board evaluations in 2022/23 and 2023/24, as it was deemed efficient and appropriate in the cycle of continuous improvement.\n\n## Stage 2 Design of the evaluation\n\nConsidering the findings of the 2021/22 external Board performance review, it was agreed the review of the Board and its Committees in 2022/23 be conducted by Lintstock in the same format as an internal evaluation. This centred on the use of a detailed questionnaire, to be completed by the Board, Committee members, and secretaries.\n\n## Stage 3 Review methodology\n\nThe questionnaire was issued, and to achieve a comprehensive suite of feedback, questions were structured around agreed topics, comprising:\n\n- \u00b7 Board dynamics;\n- \u00b7 Board composition;\n- \u00b7 Board support;\n- \u00b7 management and focus of meetings;\n- \u00b7 stakeholder oversight;\n- \u00b7 strategic oversight;\n- \u00b7 risk management and internal control; and\n- \u00b7 succession planning and people oversight.\n\n## Stage 4 Findings and actions\n\nBased on the information and views garnered from the review responses, Lintstock produced the Board and Board Committee evaluation reports for review. The finalised report of findings was provided to the Board and actions agreed.\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## 2022/23 Board evaluation findings\n\nThe findings of the Board evaluation were positive, with progress thought to have been achieved across a number of evaluation areas. Areas which scored well, relative to an external benchmark, included: the clarity of strategic purpose; the relationship between the nonExecutive Directors and Chief Executive; oversight of strategic implementation;\n\nthe contribution to the development of strategy; and Board support through the Company Secretary and training.\n\nThe findings further affirmed strong Board composition, with discussions cognisant of the attributes which should be considered in future appointments, alongside how these should be balanced and prioritised within succession plans.\n\nWhilst the findings were positive and confirmed the Board to be operating effectively, there remained as with all balanced process, opportunities for improvement and refinement.\n\n| Opportunities for refinement                                                                  | Commentary and actions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Enhancing contact with   SSE's culture, senior teams,  Business Units, and strategic  context | It was acknowledged ongoing activities were enhancing the Board's appreciation of these areas,  notwithstanding, increased structure and planning would maximise the impact of this work.

Specific findings and the agreement of actions was overseen by each Committee Chair, with consideration of the overall findings for the Board.\n\nProgress will continue to be monitored by each Committee, with details set out in the Reports across pages 142 to 187 \uf150 .\n\n## Individual Director performance\n\nIndividual Director performance and contribution was assessed through one-to-one meetings with the Chair. These sessions allowed reflection on personal development and discussion of matters relevant to Boardroom culture and process. The findings, in combination with\n\nindividual skills (see page 115 \uf150 ), the time commitment, and independence assessments (see pages 143 and 146 \uf150 ) confirmed that each Director continues to contribute positively.\n\n## Chair performance\n\nThe performance of the Chair was evaluated by the Senior Independent Director, based on: feedback gathered by an external facilitator; a thorough discussion with non-Executive and Executive Directors; and individual input from non-Executive and Executive Directors and selected senior managers.\n\nThe output of this performance review confirmed that Sir John Manzoni continues to be a effective and energetic Chair. He leads ambitious and constructive challenge, and appropriate support of the Executive\n\nDirectors. He has a high degree of visibility and availability, is inclusive, and always looking to hear views while putting his own experience to appropriate use. He leads and conducts the Board well, both in the formal Board meetings and through regular interactions outside the Boardroom. He engages actively with colleagues at all levels and has continued to engage constructively with investors on strategy, governance, and ESG.\n\nThe priority focus areas for the Chair in the coming year, were agreed and aligned with those identified through the evaluation process for the Board as a whole. It was confirmed that he devoted sufficient time to the role, and in all respects met the requirements of the Code.",

        "page_content": "## Nomination Committee Report\n\n## Role of the Committee\n\nThe Nomination Committee provides dedicated focus to the following people-led matters.\n\n- \u00b7 Board leadership. Identifies the skills, knowledge and experience required for the effective leadership and long-term success of SSE, managing the balance of competencies through succession planning, knowledge development and recruitment.\n- \u00b7 Board Committees. Monitors the size, structure and composition of the Board's Committees to ensure the appropriate Board support now, and going forward.\n- \u00b7 Talent pipeline. Monitors the senior leadership pipeline and initiatives to develop internal capability, engaging in leadership programmes and updates on external recruitment.\n\n## Dear Shareholder,\n\nThe execution of orderly succession plans to support the strength of the Board has been a significant Committee focus, and underpinned by assessment of the Board's skills, knowledge, and tenure, in the context of SSE's long-term growth and operating environment. The skills matrix on page 115 \uf150 confirms the attributes we identify as key in the Board's leadership role.\n\nThe external evaluation in 2021/22, cited an opportunity to monitor Board membership as SSE progressed its Net Zero Acceleration Programme, and this was explored in the candidate specification for a new nonExecutive Director. We are delighted the resultant search sees Maarten Wetselaar join the Board on 1 September 2023. Maarten's appointment enhances existing international and renewables infrastructure capabilities, and brings a global outlook and career of energy leadership expertise to the Board. He will become a member of the Nomination, Audit, and Energy Markets Risk Committees upon appointment.\n\nThe Board has continued to benefit from the long-standing experience of the Executive Directors, and regularly reviews the internal pipeline and external talent pool to confirm optionality for any change. In 2022/23, we progressed the succession plan for the Finance Director, Gregor Alexander, with external support from Korn Ferry. This was a robust process,\n\n- \u00b7 Inclusion and diversity. Under the Board's Policy, considers the perspectives and attributes across the Board and senior leadership, confirming ambitions and work to drive progress, reviewing overall support for Group-wide inclusion and diversity strategy.\n\nThe Committee's Terms of Reference are available on sse.com \uf295 .\n\n## Key activities in 2022/23\n\n- \u00b7 Reviewed Board composition.\n- \u00b7 Recommended the succession plan for both the Finance Director and Company Secretary.\n- \u00b7 Recommended the appointment of a new non-Executive Director.\n- \u00b7 Assessed inclusion and diversity performance.\n\nwith defined parameters, and from a shortlist comprising both internal and external candidates, Barry O'Regan, Finance Director, SSE Renewables, was identified as the strongest fit for the role. This objective outcome confirms the strength of internal talent development, and we will focus on an effective transition for 1 December 2023. Gregor has been instrumental in shaping SSE's investment case and delivering our financial objectives over his 21 years in post, and we look forward to working with Barry in his role as Chief Financial Officer on the opportunities that lie ahead. More on the above processes and detail of how diversity was considered in Board recruitment during the year is on pages 144 to 145 \uf150 .\n\nIn another change, Sally Fairbairn, our Company Secretary and Director of Investor Relations also signalled her intention to retire, which was supported by the recommendation in May 2023 that Liz Tanner become General Counsel and Company Secretary from 1 August 2023.\n\nWe thanked Dame Sue Bruce for her dedication, as she stepped down after just over nine years' service on 31 March 2023. And on 20 July 2023, we will see Peter Lynas complete his final term as a non-Executive Director. A number of changes in Board roles, set out in the 2022 Annual Report and on page 146 \uf150 , take place as a result. Melanie Smith is now Remuneration Committee Chair and Lady Elish Angiolini\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNon-Executive Director for Employee Engagement. Both Melanie and Lady Elish bring their own expertise to these positions.\n\nIn our annual review of Board Committee membership, and in advance of the change in Audit Committee Chair, we agreed John Bason would join the Remuneration Committee from May 2023, retaining the practice that the Audit Committee Chair provide a consistent view of Group performance across relevant Board forums.\n\nInclusion and diversity remains a core area of work, framed by the Board Inclusion and Diversity Policy and the internal ambitions which represent a commitment to progress. The diversity of the Board is on page 115 \uf150 , with membership comprising 42% women and one Director from an ethnic minority background. This will remain the position after the changes described above. Across membership, difference is enhanced through diverse perspectives and backgrounds and we seek to ensure this extends to Board Committees and Chair roles. Per the FCA's Listing Rule, we explain the positions of Chair, Senior Independent Director, Chief Executive and Finance Director are held by men. This will continue to be considered within our agenda, with regard for our policy and stakeholder views.\n\nDiscussions with the Executive Directors and Group HR considers inclusion and diversity action below-Board level. Within senior management women's representation is 34.1% and we continue to work towards a target of 40% for 2025. An area of focus will be agreeing a supplementary ambition for ethnicity across this senior population. More on inclusion and diversity can be found on pages 148 to 149 \uf150 and in the Inclusion and Diversity Report on sse.com \uf295 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSir John Manzoni\n\nChair of the Nomination Committee\n\n23 May 2023\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## Membership and attendance\n\nThe membership of the Committee comprises the non-Executive Directors and the Chair of the Board, who is also Chair of the Committee. The Company Secretary is Secretary, and where appropriate, the Executive Directors are invited to attend meetings. Biographical details of the Committee members can be found on pages 116 to 120 \uf150 . The Committee met eight times in 2022/23 with attendance on page 123 \uf150 .\n\n## Board leadership Composition and succession\n\nThe composition of the Board is informed by plans for orderly succession across Board and Committee roles. This is supported by regular assessment of the skills, experience and diversity the Board needs, in line with strategy and changes in SSE's operating context. The backdrop to these discussions comprises the full breadth of Board work set out across the Directors' Report, and the elements of Board composition and diversity set out on page 115 \uf150 .\n\nResulting from the above, and in line with work to support SSE's Net Zero Programme, an independent non-Executive Director recruitment process was initiated in the year. Following a robust search, this saw the recommendation that Maarten Wetselaar join the Board from 1 September 2023.\n\nThis was followed in April 2023, with the announcement that Gregor Alexander would be stepping down from the Board on 1 December 2023, at which time he will have served as Finance Director for 21 years. In support of a comprehensive process, internal succession plans and the results of an external search, were subject to interview and selection with support from an independent recruitment firm. The resultant recommendation, which was approved by the Board, will see Barry O'Regan, current Finance Director, SSE Renewables, become Chief Financial Officer on 1 December 2023.\n\nDetails of the work which supported each of the above appointments is set out on pages 144 to 145 \uf150 .\n\nAs reported in 2021/22, John Bason joined the Board as Audit Committee Chair designate on 1 June 2022. At which time he became a member of the Nomination Committee and Audit Committee.\n\nFollowing their respective nine year terms, Peter Lynas steps down from the Board on 20 July 2023 and Dame Sue Bruce stepped down on 31 March 2023. The succession plan for their key Board roles is confirmed on page 146 \uf150 .\n\nSally Fairbairn, Company Secretary and Director of Investor Relations will also step down from the role following notification of her retirement. The Committee subsequently recommended the split of her responsibilities, with Liz Tanner, SSE's current General Counsel also to become Company Secretary in support of this change. This transition will take effect from 1 August 2023. The position of Director of Investor Relations will become a separate role within the Investor Relations Team.\n\n## Time commitment\n\nThe expected time commitment of the Chair and non-Executive Directors is agreed and set out in writing in a Letter of Appointment. This is issued following confirmation of an individual's capacity to take on the role and involves an assessment of existing external commitments and demands on time. Any changes, such as additional external appointments which could impair the ability to meet the above, can only be accepted following approval of the Board. The acceptance of an external appointment by an Executive Director also remains subject to prior Board consent. Approved changes across 2022/23 are set out on page 117 \uf150 .\n\n## Committee evaluation\n\nThe annual review of Committee performance was facilitated by Lintstock (see pages 140 to 141 \uf150 ) and the outputs considered by the full Committee. This confirmed the Committee's continued effective operation and agreement of actions for 2023/24.\n\n## Evaluation confirmed\n\nActions for 2023/24\n\n- \u00b7 A robust process supports the review of Board composition and capabilities and has resulted in effective succession planning across non-Executive roles.\n- \u00b7 Work on senior leadership pipelines with Group HR has strengthened and enabled deeper discussion surrounding talent and capability.\n- \u00b7 A clear rhythm of work has been established to review the impact of inclusion and diversity strategy at all levels, creating a platform to drive progress.\n- \u00b7 Board composition. Focus should be maintained on the collective and individual skills of the Board, in the context of tenure and SSE's long-term growth, with support for transitions in membership.\n- \u00b7 Executive succession and talent pipeline. Positive challenge should continue surrounding the depth and breadth of succession plans for senior leadership, alongside work on internal and external talent pools.\n- \u00b7 Inclusion and diversity. The amplification of the inclusion and diversity agenda should be supported; assessing progress and identifying where targeted action is needed to deliver change.",

The latter was to facilitate an orderly handover in the role of Audit Committee Chair. In line with standing practice, each decision was supported by the continuing independence, experience, and contribution that each Director brings to both Board and Committee work.\n\n## Director induction\n\nAll Directors receive a comprehensive induction programme. This is tailored through discussion with the Chair and the Company Secretary and considers existing expertise and any prospective Board or Board Committee roles.\n\nThe agreed plan for John Bason comprised a balance of knowledgebased sessions with internal functions and external advisors, in addition to site visits across locations to provide exposure to SSE's businesses and working environments. Delivery has been in phases with information material to the non-Executive Director role provided in the early stages.\n\nAn induction programme for Maarten Wetselaar and Barry O'Regan will be agreed upon joining the Board.\n\n## Conflicts of interest and independence\n\nEach Director has a duty to disclose any actual or potential conflict of interest situations, as defined by law, for consideration and approval if appropriate by the Board. This requirement is supported by an annual authorisation process, in which the Committee reviews SSE's Conflicts of Interest Register, and seeks confirmation from each Director of any changes or updates to their position.\n\nThis process informs the simultaneous assessment of a non-Executive Director's independence, as following the absence of any conflict, the Committee reflects upon the outcome of each individual Director's performance evaluation (see page 141 \uf150 ) and the circumstances set out in the Code which could compromise an individual's position.\n\nFollowing review in 2022/23, and to the exclusion of the interested Director in each case, the Committee recommended, and Board confirmed: updates to the Conflicts of Interest Register; the continuing independence and objective judgement of each non-Executive Director; and the overall independence of the Board in line with the recommendations of the Code.\n\nAdditional safeguards to support Director independence continue through:\n\n- \u00b7 Meetings between the Chair and the non-Executive Directors, individually and collectively, without the Executive Directors present.\n- \u00b7 Separate and clearly defined roles for the Chair, as head of the Board, and the Chief Executive, as head of executive management (see page 139 \uf150 ). This division of responsibility is supported by a degree of contact outside of Board meetings to ensure an effective ongoing dialogue and channel for the timely escalation of external or internal developments.\n\n## John Bason induction programme\n\n| Areas covered                                                                        | Sessions by                                                                                  |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| SSE's purpose, strategy, operating  context, and business model                      | Chief Executive  Group Strategy  MD of each Business Unit                                    |\n| Financial performance and   strategy, funding, assurance,   and investment community | Finance Director  Senior Finance leaders External Auditor Investor Relations SSE's Brokers   |\n| Energy sector and trends, SSE's energy  portfolio and long-term energy markets       | Chief Commercial Officer                                                                     |\n| Net zero transition, sustainability,   and stakeholder engagement                    | Chief Sustainability Officer Group Corporate Affairs                                         |\n| Safety, health and the environment,   and SSE's people and culture                   | Director of HR  Group Safety, Health and  Environment Manager                                |\n| Corporate governance and                                                             | Company Secretary and                                                                        |\n| Board operations                                                                     | Director of Investor Relations                                                               |\n| Legal and regulatory views of the external  environment and SSE's risk profile       | General Counsel  SSE's Legal Advisors Director of Regulation Group Chief Information Officer |\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## Knowledge and training\n\nAny Director can request further information to support their individual duties or collective Board role. The arrangements are overseen by the Company Secretary and can be internally or externally facilitated, with sessions typically originating from technical Board discussions, an identified training opportunity, or area of general interest relating to SSE. Outside of monthly agenda time, the Board schedule included nine strategic deep dives in 2022/23 in addition to several external speaker sessions - which were often structured to precede Board discussion at meetings. Further details of the topics covered are on page 125 \uf150 .\n\nThrough SSE's mandatory training programme, all Directors are requested to refresh their understanding of current obligations and recent developments in areas pertinent to their role. These modules address, among other matters: Directors' Duties; competition law; anti-money laundering and financial sanctions; data protection; and inclusion and diversity. In 2022/23, a cyber security session was offered to all Board members covering the threat landscape; cyber awareness and defence; and actions to support SSE's security culture.\n\nTo remain abreast of, and connected to, broader societal trends, expectations and issues, the Directors are encouraged to participate in seminars and events hosted by external organisations. Discussion with peers, other sectors, and individuals in different professional and personal situations, is viewed as an opportunity to develop broader perspectives and insights, which can translate into different thinking styles and new debate within Board discussions.\n\n## Board Committees and key roles\n\nBoard Committee composition and the appointment of key Board roles is designed around the following principles: to ensure alignment between skills and specific Committee responsibilities; to prevent undue reliance on the capacity of any Director; and to comply with recognised guidance including the Code. Annually, the Board considers the composition of its Committees to assess the allocation of skills and how the diversity of the Board is carried through, by extension, to its supporting forums. At 23 May 2023, each Committee has at least 40% female membership across nonExecutive positions.\n\nChanges can be recommended to support succession plans, in line with new Board appointments, or in response to the annual review described above. In 2022/23, the Board approved the following membership recommendations.\n\nThe previously agreed succession plan, for the Board roles held by Dame Sue Bruce, saw Melanie Smith assume the role of Remuneration Committee Chair, and Lady Elish Angiolini become SSE's non-Executive Director for Employee Engagement, both with effect from 1 April 2023. The views of the Committee which led to the above recommendations are set out on page 149 of the Annual Report 2022 \uf223 .\n\nSupporting his appointment as Audit Committee Chair designate, John Bason takes on the role of Audit Committee Chair on 21 July 2023. This follows Peter Lynas stepping down from the Board on 20 July 2023. John also joins the Remuneration Committee in advance of this date on 22 May 2023.\n\n## Talent capability and development\n\nSuccession for senior leadership roles, and strategy to support talent development by building capability for the future, is overseen by the Committee with support from Group HR, with formal updates considered at least twice a year.\n\nOn succession, at least annually, the Committee reviews the existing internal pipeline of candidates for immediate and medium- to longer-term movement into key leadership and functional roles. This is subject to routine challenge to ensure understanding of the breadth of internal potential and experience represented by external talent pools.\n\nIn 2022/23 the Committee received updates on Board, Group Executive Committee and Business Unit Executive Committee succession options, which included a review of timing of readiness, and consideration of new talent and succession capability that had been recruited into SSE. The Committee also received updates on the targeted development activity that is taking place across the population, and engaged in a number of discussions with external providers to understand the impact of these key initiatives.\n\nOn investing in broader talent and capability, updates are provided on critical skills investment and performance improvement, which are centred on an agreed set of leadership capabilities and competencies required for SSE's long-term growth.\n\nIn the context of SSE's Net Zero Acceleration Programme, emphasis has been placed on commercial expertise, project delivery, digital, data, and the international context, with these endorsed as key development areas for structured training interventions. The Committee has also had input from external partners on how talent is benchmarking externally, and on a specific focused initiative to encourage more gender diversity into senior leadership talent pipelines.\n\nThe Committee also continued to receive updates on the progress of the Leadership Development Review which has been providing leadership teams with feedback about how they align with SSE's Leadership Blueprint and Enterprise Leadership Model. In providing Board-level support to the Leadership Blueprint, Debbie Crosbie participated in a virtual session with leaders, to explore the refreshed framework and behaviours which define leadership within SSE's culture.\n\nTo provide direct exposure to the talent pool and allow reciprocal sharing of experiences, members of the Committee engage in core talent programmes, with the diversity across training cohorts monitored to encourage and progress difference. Additional engagement with future leaders is facilitated through presentations at meetings, business-led sessions, and attendance at conferences. The open two-way dialogue between the Directors and all levels of the organisation is a key tool for observing and informally coaching emerging talent.",

        "page_content": "## Inclusion and diversity\n\nSSE's Group-wide inclusion and diversity strategy is explained across pages 60 to 62 \uf150 and in SSE's Inclusion and Diversity Report 2023 \uf223 available on sse.com \uf295 .\n\n## Role of the Committee\n\nThe role of the Nomination Committee in relation to inclusion and diversity starts with an assessment of difference across the composition of the Board and its Committees. At senior leadership-level, it sets expectations to nurture an inclusive culture so that diversity is embraced; confirming inclusion and diversity plans and ambitions and seeking assurance surrounding progress. This is enabled through work with Group HR to review the impact of initiatives which are in place. The Committee monitors decisions across the above areas with cognisance for the Group-wide approach.\n\n## Board policy\n\nThe Board operates under a standalone inclusion and diversity policy which can be found on sse.com \uf295 . Its objective is to set a Board-led culture which is inclusive to all views, perspectives and experiences, and which fosters diversity as a norm. Across Board membership, the policy drives balance and alignment with SSE's purpose, strategy and values, through agreed principles and targets which reflect the measures the Board will take when considering its membership and that of its Committees. The Nomination Committee reviews this policy, including targets and progress, at least annually, with diversity permeating all areas of Committee work.\n\nIn setting principles and targets, the Nomination Committee, and Board, acknowledge the external expectations of stakeholders and the opportunities to drive change through succession planning. The FTSE Women Leaders Review and Parker Review are reflected within Board ambitions.\n\nAn overarching priority for the Nomination Committee is that succession plans remain refreshed, and provide options to support an orderly transition should a Board vacancy arise in the short-, medium- and long-term. These succession plans were mobilised in the year to support the handover in role of Finance Director.\n\nMore on SSE's Board Inclusion and Diversity Policy is set out opposite.\n\n## Senior leadership ambitions\n\nBelow Board-level, the Committee provides specific focus to the diversity of SSE's senior leadership and pipelines, including the recommendations of external initiatives and shareholder views. To identify the levers for progress, close work has continued with the Executive Directors and Group HR to develop clear action plans which are underpinned by stretching ambitions. More detail on these ambitions and progress can be found on page 60 \uf150 .\n\nConsistent with next steps agreed through 2021/22 external Board evaluation, and a commitment to providing counsel on SSE's approach, the Nomination Committee has conducted biannual reviews of diversity strategy and scorecards, covering:\n\n- \u00b7 accelerating progress across ambitions;\n- \u00b7 empowering inclusive leadership and fluency across inclusion and diversity topics;\n- \u00b7 assessing the effectiveness and continuous improvement of existing processes; and\n- \u00b7 actively listening to the employee voice.\n\nWith strong support for the enhanced and increased frequency of contact with the executive teams, actions were reset through the 2022/23 Board evaluation for further work across the coming year.\n\nFollowing the recommendation of the Parker Review for FTSE 350 companies to set targets for ethnic minority representation across senior management teams. Focus will be provided to improving diversity data disclosure to allow a credible target to be set. This will be reported on in the Annual Report 2023.\n\n## Board engagement on inclusion and diversity\n\nIn addition to desktop work, Committee members have proactively engaged with SSE's employee-led 'Belonging in SSE' communities and responded to requests for Board-level views on inclusion and diversity issues. More detail on these activities can be found on pages 134 to 136 \uf150 .\n\n## Board inclusion and diversity\n\nBoard Policy\n\n## How the policy links to strategy\n\nPeople are at the heart of the transformational change needed to achieve net zero, and SSE believes innovative solutions to climate change require diverse perspectives, different experiences, and new skills. The principles of equality, fairness, inclusion and diversity must be at the heart of everything it does.\n\n## Policy principles\n\n- \u00b7 Identify Board and Committee needs and the balance of diversity characteristics. See page 143 \uf150 .\n- \u00b7 Adopt a formal and inclusive Board recruitment process.\n- \u00b7 Engage firms who are signatories to the enhanced code of conduct and discuss ambitions for diverse candidate lists.\n- \u00b7 Recruit on an objective and shared understanding of merit. See page 144 to 145 \uf150 .\n- \u00b7 Nurture an inclusive Board and Committee culture.\n- \u00b7 Oversee work to develop a diverse talent pipeline.\n- \u00b7 Be aware of stakeholder expectations and challenge targets in wider strategy. See pages 137, 147 and 148 \uf150 .\n\n## Policy targets\n\n- \u00b7 An ultimate goal of enduring gender parity, whereby the Board commits to female representation of not less than 40%, with the aim to maintain as close to 50% male and female representation as possible on a rolling basis.\n\nTarget met. 42% women on the Board at 23 May 2023. 42.8% rolling three-year female representation at 31 March 2023.\n\n- \u00b7 Consider female representation across the roles of Chair, Senior Independent Director, Chief Executive and Finance Director.\n\nSee explanation opposite.\n\n- \u00b7 The Board should have at least one Director from an ethnic minority background.\n\nTarget met. 1 ethnic minority represented across Board membership.\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## Explanation against LR 9.8.6(9)\n\nAs at the Company's chosen reference date, 31 March 2023, and in line with FCA Listing Rule 9.8.6(9), SSE confirms it has met the targets for at least 40% female membership on the Board and for one Director to be from an ethnic minority background. It has not met the target for one of the positions of Chair, Senior Independent Director, Chief Executive or Finance Director to be held by a woman. The reasons for this are set out below.\n\n## Executive Directors\n\nThe roles of Chief Executive and Finance Director have been held by Alistair Phillips-Davies and Gregor Alexander for 9 and 20 years respectively. These positions support the long-term strategic delivery of the SSE Group and remain subject to considered succession planning to ensure this strength of leadership continues.\n\nThe announcement in April 2023, that Barry O'Regan would succeed Gregor Alexander in the role of Chief Financial Officer from December 2023, was the result of a rigorous external process and objective assessment of internal\n\nsuccession plans. Assisted by purposeful design, diversity was considered at each stage and details of the recommendation made by the Nomination Committee is set out on page 145 \uf150 . The overriding priority across all Board appointments remains identification of the strongest candidate for the role, based on clear search criteria and the need for an orderly transition.\n\nFurther detail of the challenge applied by the Nomination Committee on the continued development of a diverse internal pipeline, and the work to oversee external benchmarking to ensure SSE has the diversity and capabilities needed for future growth, is set out on page 147 \uf150 .\n\n## Chair and Senior Independent Director\n\nSSE's Chair, Sir John Manzoni, has held the position since April 2021 following appointment to the Board in September 2020. This resulted from a robust and inclusive appointment process and details of how diversity was challenged at each stage can be found in the Annual Report 2021 \uf223 .\n\nSSE's Senior Independent Director, Tony Cocker, has held the position since October 2020 following appointment to the Board in May 2018. Tony was appointed in line with the internal succession plan for the role and continues to effectively support the Board and Chair in this position.\n\nFull details of the skills and attributes which support each of the above appointments can be found in the individual Director biographies set out on pages 116 to 120 \uf150 .\n\nWork continues to ensure that gender and ethnicity, alongside broader diversity characteristics are present across the Board and targeted action would be taken should the overall diversity of membership be deemed insufficient at any time.\n\nIn support of transparent disclosure, SSE will continue to report on its progress in the Annual Report in advance of the FTSE Women Leaders target date of December 2025, and welcomes feedback and engagement from shareholders and wider stakeholders on this topic.\n\n## Data under LR 9.8.6(10)\n\nIn line with LR 9.8.6(10), as at the reference date of 31 March 2023, the composition of the Board and Executive Management was as follows.\n\n## Gender (sex)\n\n|       |   Number   of Board  members | Percentage   of the Board   |   Number of   senior positions on the Board   (CEO, CFO, SID and Chair) |   Number   in Executive   Management 1 | Percentage   of Executive  Management 1   |\n|-------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Man   |                            7 | 54%                         |                                                                       4 |                                      8 | 73%                                       |\n| Woman |                            6 | 46%                         |                                                                       0 |                                      3 | 27%                                       |\n\n## Ethnic background\n\n|                                                                | Number   of Board   members   | Percentage   of the Board   | Number of   senior positions on the Board   (CEO, CFO, SID and Chair)   | Number   in Executive   Management 1   | Percentage   of Executive  Management 1   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| White British or other White (including minority-white groups) | 12                            | 92%                         | 4                                                                       | 11                                     | 100%                                      |\n| Mixed/Multiple Ethnic Groups                                   | -                             | -                           | -                                                                       | -                                      |                                           |\n| Asian/Asian British                                            | -                             | -                           | -                                                                       | -                                      |                                           |\n| Black/African/Caribbean/Black British                          | -                             | -                           | -                                                                       | -                                      |                                           |\n| Other ethnic group,   including Arab                           | 1                             | 8%                          | -                                                                       | -                                      |                                           |\n| Not specified/ prefer not to say                               | -                             | -                           | -                                                                       | -                                      |                                           |\n\n- 1 Per the definition within the Listing Rules, executive management within SSE is the Group Executive Committee including the Company Secretary.\n\nGender is captured as sex for all employees at the onboarding stage and held on the Company's secure people data system, Harmony. SSE has 100% completion of sex data and that is what is used when reporting the gender diversity of the Board and executive management. Recognising that for some, gender identity can differ from that assigned at birth, all employees are offered the opportunity to volunteer their gender identity directly within Harmony, or by completing a diversity data form that is electronically uploaded onto the system. Ethnicity data is also provided voluntarily and can be offered in the same was as gender identity. SSE has 100% voluntary completion of ethnicity data at Board and executive management level. All diversity data reporting is done securely and in a way that protects anonymity so that no one person can be identifiable. All information is strictly confidential in accordance with SSE's Privacy Notice in line with the UK and ROI General Data Protection Regulations (UK GDPR and GDPR 2018 and DPA 2018).",

The approach adopted this year builds on the strong\n\n- \u00b7 Review and monitor the effectiveness of the Internal Audit function, including the adequacy of the overall Internal Audit resource.\n\n## Internal control and risk management\n\n- \u00b7 Review and monitor the effectiveness of the management of risk and overall System of Internal Control.\n- \u00b7 Review the framework and analysis to support both the Going Concern and the long-term Viability Statement.\n\nThe Committee's Terms of Reference were reviewed during the year, and are available on sse.com \uf295 .\n\n## Key activities in 2022/23\n\nThe key areas of focus in the year included:\n\n- \u00b7 Ensuring the business performance is fairly presented in financial reporting.\n- \u00b7 Assessing the output of an external quality assessment of the Internal Audit function carried out by PwC.\n- \u00b7 Overseeing the project to enhance the internal control framework for financial reporting.\n- \u00b7 Orderly transition of Audit Committee Chair.\n- \u00b7 Consideration of accounting for new matters in the year including the Energy Bill Relief Scheme and the Electricity Generator Levy.\n\nfoundations that were established last year and I am pleased to report that SSE is now fully compliant with the TCFD recommendations and recommended disclosures. SSE believes there is an opportunity to further enhance its reporting in this area and will actively seek feedback from shareholders and stakeholders on best practice.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee engaged PwC to carry out a detailed External Quality Assessment (EQA) of the Internal Audit function. The findings and key recommendations were presented to the Committee in February 2023. Overall, the Internal Audit function was found to be well established and highly valued across the organisation. A summary of the scope,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\napproach and key findings are covered in more detail in the report that follows. The Committee continued to receive regular updates on the status of the BEIS consultation on 'Restoring Trust in Audit and Corporate Governance'. Whilst there remains areas of uncertainty in the measures to be implemented, SSE has made significant progress in developing the internal control framework for financial reporting. At each Committee meeting, an update on progress is provided by the project team covering legislative and regulatory developments, progress on implementation and validation of Finance and IT controls, and the change programme to support the organisation adopt the new framework from 1 April 2024. These regular briefings allow the Committee to ensure that necessary preparations are being considered and progressed in line with or ahead of regulatory change.\n\nOn 16 December 2022, I received a letter from the FRC following their review of the SSE's 2022 Annual Report and Accounts. The FRC stated that there were 'no questions or queries' in relation to those Annual Report and Accounts 1 . The FRC did highlight certain matters which SSE were invited to consider in relation to preparation of the 2023 Annual Report and Accounts, and these matters have been dealt within our approach to disclosure this year.\n\nAfter 9 years as Audit Committee Chair, I will be standing down following the AGM in 2023. Over the last year, I have worked with my successor, John Bason, to ensure a smooth and orderly transition. I hope you find this report informative and take assurance from the work undertaken by the Committee during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPeter Lynas Chair of the Audit Committee\n\n23 May 2023\n\n- 1 In line with FRC requirements, the letter provides no assurance that the Annual Report and Accounts are correct in all material respects. The FRC's role is not to verify the information provided but to consider compliance with reporting requirements.\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## Committee membership\n\nThe composition of the Committee is compliant with the Code and currently comprises five independent non-Executive Directors as Committee members. Peter Lynas has chaired the Committee since 2014 and is considered by the Board to have recent and relevant financial experience. He was Group Finance Director of BAE Systems plc until 31 March 2020 and is a Fellow of the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants. Peter Lynas will stand down after the AGM on 20 July 2023 and John Bason, who joined the Board on 1 June 2022, and became a member of the Audit Committee on appointment will take over the role as Chair. John Bason was Group Finance Director of Associated British Foods plc until 28 April 2023 and is a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Both John Bason and Debbie Crosbie are also considered by the Board to have recent and relevant financial experience. The Board considers that the Audit Committee as a whole has competence relevant to the sector, with two members having had significant executive roles in the energy sector, and all members possessing an appropriate level of experience in corporate financial matters. Biographical details of the Audit Committee members can be found on pages 116 to 120 \uf150 and details of meeting attendance are set out on page 123 \uf150 .\n\nGregor Alexander, who joined SSE at its inception in 1998 and has been Finance Director since 2002, will step down from the Board on 1 December 2023. Following a competitive recruitment process supported by an external executive search firm, Barry O'Regan will be appointed as Chief Financial Officer and as an Executive Director of SSE plc with effect from 1 December 2023.\n\nBarry trained as a chartered accountant with PwC in Dublin before joining Airtricity in 2005, and subsequently the SSE Group in 2008. With nearly 20 years' experience working in the energy sector, Barry has a wealth of knowledge across financial control, corporate finance and M&A, treasury, reporting and operational finance. He is currently Finance Director of SSE Renewables as well as having responsibility for corporate finance across the whole of SSE.\n\n## Meetings\n\nThe Committee has a structured forwardlooking planner to reflect the Group's annual financial reporting cycle. The planner informs the business considered at each meeting and is regularly reviewed and updated to reflect areas identified for additional focus. Much of the work of the Committee is necessarily targeted around\n\nthe key areas of financial reporting, external audit, internal audit, internal control and risk management. The practice of effective governance and quality reporting underpin all aspects of the work of the Committee. The Committee met on four occasions during the year and has met once since the end of the financial year. Before each meeting, the Committee Chair meets with the Finance Director and External Auditor to ensure there is a shared understanding of the key issues to be discussed. Committee meetings are held in advance of Board meetings to facilitate an effective and timely reporting process. The Committee Chair provides a report to the Board following each meeting.\n\nMeetings are routinely attended by: the Chair of the Board; the Finance Director; the Director of Group Risk and Audit; Partners from the External Auditor; and the Deputy Company Secretary (who is Secretary to the Committee). Senior finance and business managers are invited to attend certain meetings to enable the Committee to gain a deeper level of insight on particular items of business. The Committee meets with the External Auditor privately at least twice each year in line with the financial reporting calendar and also with the Director of Group Risk and Audit.\n\n## Annual financial reporting cycle\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThese engagements provide an additional opportunity for open dialogue and feedback without management being present.\n\nIn addition to the scheduled meetings, the Committee Chair meets separately with the Finance Director, Director of Group Risk and Audit, External Auditor and Committee Secretary to ensure the work of the Committee is focused on key and emerging issues.\n\n## Committee evaluation\n\nThe actions identified from the 2021/22 evaluation relating to Audit Committee Chair transition and developing the approach to risk management have made good progress in the year, and will continue to feature on the Committee agenda in the year ahead. The annual review of Committee performance in 2022/23 was facilitated by Lintstock (see pages 140 to 141 \uf150 ), with the output considered and follow-up actions agreed by the Committee. The evaluation confirmed the effective operation of the Committee, and the Board endorsed the view that the Audit Committee continued to effectively discharge its responsibilities.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nconfirmed\n\n## Actions to progress during 2023/24\n\n- \u00b7 Meetings were well managed and effectively chaired.\n- \u00b7 The relationships between the Audit Committee and the Finance Director, Director of Risk and Audit and other members of senior management were open and honest and benefitted from a high degree of constructive challenge.\n- \u00b7 The key accounting judgements were given an appropriate degree of focus and challenge.\n- \u00b7 Support to the new Audit Committee Chair.\n- \u00b7 Arrange briefings to gain an external perspective on how other organisations are dealing with matters such as risk and audit reform.\n- \u00b7 Focus in further developing the approach to risk management and integrated assurance, underpinned by the Audit and Assurance Policy.\n- \u00b7 Continue to oversee the project to enhance the internal controls over financial reporting, including the developments to enhance the level of automation, process and standards.",

The Finance team worked closely with the External Auditor to ensure SSE provides the required level of disclosure, including the appropriateness of alternative performance measures (APMs) and their consistency with IFRS financial information. In preparing the Financial Statements for 2023 there are several areas requiring the exercise of judgement or a high degree of estimation. This section outlines the significant areas of judgement that have been considered by the Committee - through discussion and detailed reporting by both management and the External Auditor - to ensure appropriate rigour has been applied. Other key accounting judgements and areas of estimation uncertainty applied in the preparation of the Financial Statements for 2023 are provided in notes 4.2 and 4.3 \uf150 .\n\nThe Independent Auditor's Report on pages 326 to 336 \uf150 sets out the audit approach to Key Audit Matters. In addition, EY drew other audit matters to the attention of the Audit Committee. These areas of audit focus include: customer debtor recoverability; going concern; accounting for Renewables' acquisition of the Siemens Gamesa platform and the Thermal acquisition of a 50% stake in Triton Power; recoverability of Ovo loan note; goodwill valuation for Renewables acquisitions in Europe and Japan; Seagreen Contract for Difference; Generation own use volume breach; change in Renewables cash generating units; taxation judgements; exceptional items and APMs; accounting for the sale of a 25% stake in SSEN Transmission; climate considerations; and decommissioning provisions. In addition, the current volatility in the energy sector has led to a number of new matters that require consideration by management, and through the audit, including: Electricity Generator Levy (EGL); and the accounting for Government Support Schemes.\n\n## Significant financial judgements and estimates\n\nIn the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, management necessarily makes judgements and estimates that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements. Throughout the year, management presents its up-to-date view of the key accounting issues and its resulting judgements to the Committee.\n\nIn consultation with the External Auditor, the Committee reviewed the significant financial judgement areas and identified\n\nfive specific areas for 2022/23. The accounting for the Group's disposal programme, which was completed in the prior financial year, was no longer considered by the Committee to be a significant financial judgement.\n\nThe Group's most significant financial judgement areas, some of which are also areas of estimation uncertainty, are explained on page 155 \uf150 . For each of these areas the Committee considered the key facts and judgements outlined by management, and requested the External Auditor to provide a professional view on whether the judgements were appropriate. The Committee specifically discussed with the External Auditor how management's judgement and assertions were challenged and how professional scepticism was demonstrated during their audit of these areas. This also included the adequacy of the disclosures within the Financial Statements.\n\nIn the year ahead, the Committee will continue to respond to energy market reform and will consider any new and emerging judgements and estimates.\n\n## Going Concern and Viability Statement\n\nThe Committee reviewed the information to support the assessment and disclosure of the Going Concern Statement prior to Board approval (see A6.3 \uf150 Accompanying Information to the Financial Statements). Given the cash surplus of \u00a30.9bn at 31 March 2023; the committed borrowing facilities of \u00a33.5bn maintained by the Group with \u00a33.4bn of these facilities undrawn at 31 March 2023; the current commercial paper market conditions, with \u00a30.9bn outstanding at 31 March 2023; and the assumption the Group will be able to refinance maturing debt, the Directors have concluded that both the Group and SSE plc as Parent Company have sufficient headroom to continue as a going concern. In coming to this conclusion, the Directors have considered sensitivities on future cashflow projections. In the very unlikely event of not being able to access the revolving credit facility or otherwise refinance as may be required, the Group's options include deferring uncommitted capex, delaying or deferring dividend payments and implementing further cost reductions. The Financial Statements are therefore prepared on a going concern basis.\n\nThe Committee agreed the parameters and reviewed the supporting report for the Board's assessment of the prospects of the Company which is covered in the Viability Statement on page 71 \uf150 .\n\n## Fair, balanced and understandable assurance framework\n\nThe assurance framework used in the preparation of the 2023 Annual Report and Accounts to assist the Directors in the discharge of their requirement to state that, taken as a whole, it is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company's performance, business model and strategy is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 a verification process dealing with the factual content;\n- \u00b7 comprehensive reviews undertaken independently by senior management to consider messaging and balance;\n- \u00b7 comprehensive reviews undertaken by the Company's Brokers to ensure consistency and balance;\n- \u00b7 reporting by the External Auditor of any material inconsistencies; and\n- \u00b7 comprehensive review by the Directors and the senior management team during the drafting process to ensure that the key messages being followed in the annual report were aligned with the company's performance and strategy and that the narrative sections of the annual report were consistent with the financial statements.\n\nThe Committee and Board received confirmation from management that the assurance framework had been adhered to for the preparation of the 2023 Annual Report.\n\nStrategic Report\n\n| Significant financial judgements and   estimates for the year ended 31 March 2023                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | How those were addressed by the Audit Committee                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Retirement benefit obligations (Estimation uncertainty)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Retirement benefit obligations (Estimation uncertainty)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| The assumptions in relation to the cost of providing post-retirement  benefits during the period are based on the Group's best estimates   and are set after consultation with qualified actuaries.

Advice is taken from independent actuaries on the  IAS 19R valuation of the schemes. The Committee was updated on the  schemes' valuation and considered the findings of the External Auditor   in relation to the scheme's key assumptions relative to market practice.  Following this review, the Committee supported the judgements made.  Further details of the calculation basis and key assumptions used, the |\n\n## Impairment testing and valuation of certain non-current assets (Financial judgement and estimation uncertainty)\n\nThe Group reviews the carrying amounts of its goodwill, other intangible assets and specific property, plant, equipment and investment assets to determine whether any impairment or reversal of impairment of the carrying value of those assets requires to be recorded. As well as its goodwill balances, the specific assets under review in the year ended 31 March 2023 are intangible development assets and specific property, plant and equipment assets related to gas storage and thermal power generation. In addition, the Group performed an impairment review over the carrying value of its equity investments in Neos Networks Limited and Triton Power Holdings Limited. In conducting its reviews, the Group makes judgements and estimates in considering both the level of cash generating unit (CGU) at which common assets such as goodwill are assessed against, as well as the estimates and assumptions behind the calculation of recoverable amount of the respective assets or CGUs. Changes to the estimates and assumptions arising from factors such as regulation and legislation changes (including the Electricity Generator Levy and climate change related regulation), power, gas, carbon and other commodity prices, volatility of gas prices, plant running regimes and load factors, discount rates and other inputs could impact the assessed recoverable value of assets and CGUs and consequently impact the Group's income statement and balance sheet.\n\nAn annual valuation/impairment exercise is carried out, and the basis and outcome of this review is presented to the Committee by management and includes a description of the assumptions applied in deriving the recoverable values. The Committee reviewed and challenged the assumptions and projections presented in the management paper and considered the detailed reporting from, and findings by, the External Auditor. Further detail of the calculation basis and key assumptions used in the impairment review, the resulting impairment charges and reversals, and the sensitivity of this assessment to key assumptions is disclosed at note 15 \uf150 . Detail on the accounting policies applied is included in the Accompanying Information section A1 \uf150 . Following this review, the Committee supported the recommendation to recognise impairment reversals in the financial year of \u00a363.5m in relation to gas storage assets and the Great Island CCGT. During the year the Group acquired a 50% stake in Triton Power and due to significant movements in short term-power prices recognised a bargain purchase gain in its Interim Reporting to 30 September 2022. During the second half of the year, the Group had realised a significant proportion of the short term benefit, which resulted in an impairment in the second half of the financial year. Over the whole year the Group recorded net impairment and remeasurement of operating derivatives (net of tax) of \u00a321.1m. In addition, the Committee considered the significant judgement and related disclosure, and supported the recommendation to recognise impairments of \u00a337.9m in relation to its retailed interest in Neos Networks Limited.\n\n## Revenue recognition - customers unbilled supply of energy (Financial judgement and estimation uncertainty)\n\nRevenue from energy supply activities undertaken by the Business Energy and Airtricity businesses includes an estimate of the value of electricity or gas supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end. This estimation comprises both billed revenue (disclosed as trade receivables) and unbilled revenue (disclosed as accrued income) and is calculated based on applying the tariffs and contract rates applicable to customers against estimated customer consumption and taking account of various factors including usage patterns, weather trends and externally notified aggregated volumes supplied to customers from national settlements bodies. During the year both of the Group's Supply businesses have administered government backed customer support schemes, where the Group provides discounts to customers based on estimated usage and recovers amounts from government based on actual customer usage. The administration of these support schemes has increased the complexity and level of estimation uncertainty of the Group's unbilled calculations. The most material support scheme administered by the Group in the year was the Energy Bills Relief Scheme ('EBRS') within the GB Business Energy business (which is recorded as other income). The accounting policy for customer support schemes and the balances claimed from government is explained at A1.2 \uf150 . A change in the assumptions underpinning the calculation would have an impact on the amount of other income recognised in any given period.\n\nThis estimation is subject to a process which compares calculated unbilled volumes to a theoretical 'perfect billing' benchmark measure of unbilled volumes (in GWh and millions of therms) derived from historical weather-adjusted consumption patterns and aggregated metering data used in industry reconciliation processes. Furthermore, actual meter readings and billings continue to be compared to unbilled estimates between the balance sheet date and the finalisation of the Financial Statements. The estimation of the government receivable included within the Group's unbilled revenue accrual is based on claimed and unclaimed values based on the same customer consumption detail and derived from consideration of tariffs applied to customers, metered and estimated volumes and other factors. The EBRS claims submitted by SSE will be audited by the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero and are subject to volumetric risk as estimated consumption data is replaced by actual metered data over the 14 month electricity industry reconciliation period. The value of outstanding EBRS claims included within the Group's unbilled accrual at 31 March 2023 was \u00a3253m, which includes a risk provision of \u00a315.1m related to amounts where the Group has provided the discount to the customer but has assessed that it will be unable to recover the amount from the government during the open claim window. Given the non-routine process, the number and the extent of differing inputs and the requirement of management to apply judgement noted above, the estimated revenue is considered a significant estimate made by management in preparing the financial statements. A change in the assumptions underpinning the unbilled calculation would have an impact on the amount of revenue recognised in any given period. The Committee reviewed the practical process issues and assumptions applied in determining the estimation uncertainty and considered the findings of the External Auditor. Following this review, the Committee considered the significant judgement and related disclosure, and supported the estimate for revenue recognition from energy supply activities. Further details of the sensitivity associated with this judgement is disclosed at note 18 \uf150 .",

The Group has a clearly articulated Net Zero Acceleration Plus Programme set out on pages 16 to 17 \uf150 to lead in the UK's transition to net zero and aligns its investment plans and business activities to that strategy. These plans are supported by the Group's Green Bond framework under which the fifth green bond was issued in July 2022 (see note 21 \uf150 ). The proceeds of the fifth green bond were allocated to fund Renewables' wind projects. The impact of future climate change regulation could have a material impact on the currently reported amounts of the Group's assets and liabilities. In preparing these financial statements, the following climate change related risks have been considered:\n\n- \u00b7 Valuation of property, plant and equipment, and impairment assessment of goodwill;\n- \u00b7 Valuations of decommissioning provisions;\n- \u00b7 Defined Benefit scheme assets; and\n- \u00b7 Going concern and viability statement.\n\nClimate change continues to be a key focus. The Committee reviewed and challenged the implications of climate and the Net Zero Acceleration Plus Programme for significant accounting judgements and ensured that the disclosures were reflective. The process which the Group adopted in relation to identification and quantification of its climate-related risks and opportunities is explained at pages 36 to 51 \uf150 along with the governance processes established to oversee and approve the associated reporting. The Audit Committee reviewed the approach adopted by the TCFD Steering Group in relation to this matter and was also briefed by the External Auditor on the audit requirements associated with the adoption of the TCFD including the need for consistency of disclosure throughout the Annual Report and the technical basis for those disclosures. Following presentation of the proposed disclosures and the report of the External Auditor on SSE's approach, the Committee approved the basis of reporting and the related financial judgement disclosures included throughout the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023. Further details of the sensitivity associated with this judgement is disclosed at note 4.1 \uf150 .\n\n## Valuation of other receivables (Financial judgement and estimation uncertainty)\n\nThe Group holds a \u00a3100m loan note due from Ovo Energy Limited following the disposal of SSE Energy Services on 15 January 2020. The loan is repayable in full by 31 December 2029, carries interest at 13.25% and is presented cumulative of accrued interest payments, discounted at 13.25%. At 31 March 2023, the carrying value (net of expected credit loss provision of \u00a31.5m (2022: \u00a31.8m) is \u00a3149.5m (2022: \u00a3131.0m). The Group has assessed recoverability of the loan note receivable and has recognised a provision for expected credit loss in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9. Due to previous energy supplier failures and recent market volatility, the Group's assessment of the recoverability of the loan note is considered a significant financial judgement.\n\nThe Committee considered the steps applied by management in making its assessment of the significant financial judgements associated with the Ovo loan note. Management has assessed the recoverability of the loan based on publicly available and recent financial information, including Government support schemes and discussions with Ovo Energy Limited management. The External Auditor explained the work carried out to corroborate and challenge the position taken by management. While the carrying value is considered to be appropriate, changes in economic conditions could lead to a change in the expected credit loss incurred by the Group in future periods.\n\n## External audit\n\n## External Auditor\n\nFollowing a competitive tender process, EY were appointed by shareholders as SSE's External Auditor for the financial year commencing 1 April 2019. EY were re-appointed by shareholders at the 2022 AGM and have continued to serve as SSE's External Auditor. Hywel Ball is the Senior Advisory Partner and Annie Graham is the Lead Audit Partner with responsibility for signing the SSE plc Audit Opinion on behalf of EY. Annie Graham leads the engagement team and has been in post since EY were appointed and will be required to rotate after five years.\n\nEY presented the strategy and scope of the audit for 2022/23 at the Committee meeting held in September 2022, highlighting key areas of audit focus (included within the Auditor's Report on pages 326 to 336 \uf150 ). EY reported against their audit scope at subsequent Committee meetings, providing an opportunity for the Committee to monitor progress and raise questions, and challenge both EY and management. EY shared an independent perspective on certain aspects of the Group's financial control and IT systems arising from its work, and reported findings to the Committee in February 2023.\n\nDuring the course of the year, EY shared insights and feedback with management, and held debriefs to refine the planned audit approach for the financial year ended 31 March 2023.\n\n## External Auditor and audit process effectiveness\n\nAn important part of the Committee's work consists of overseeing the Group's relationship with the External Auditor to ensure the independence, quality, rigour and challenge of the external audit process is maintained. The Committee reviews the effectiveness of the audit throughout the year taking into account:\n\n- \u00b7 the detailed audit strategy for the year and coverage of the highlighted risks, scope, and level of fees for the audit;\n- \u00b7 the quality, knowledge and expertise of the engagement team;\n- \u00b7 insight around the key accounting and audit judgements and the competence with which the External Auditor has applied constructive challenge and professional scepticism in dealing with management; and\n- \u00b7 the outcome of the review of effectiveness of the External Auditor and audit process discussed on page 157 \uf150 .\n\n## Independence and objectivity\n\nIn addition to the annual review of effectiveness, the Committee considered the independence and objectivity of the External Auditor through: a combination of assurances provided by the External Auditor on the safeguards in place to maintain independence; oversight of the Non-Audit Services Policy and fees paid; and oversight of SSE's policy on employing former auditors. The External Auditor confirmed that all its partners and staff complied with their ethics and independence policies and procedures including that none of its employees working on the audit hold any shares in SSE plc.\n\n## External Auditor fees\n\nThe Committee considered the audit fee proposal for the year to 31 March 2023 at its meeting in September 2022. The factors driving the increase in the level of fees over the last three years were discussed with the External Auditor. The impact of increasing regulatory requirements, changes in the business and composition of the Group and the level of complexity requiring an increased proportion of specialist resource were amongst some of the factors taken into consideration by the Committee when agreeing fair commercial arrangements with the External Auditor. Audit fees in the current year include scope changes and\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## Effectiveness of External Audit\n\n## Feedback to inform the review of the effectiveness of External Audit\n\n## External Auditor\n\nAssurance from the External Auditor covering independence (relationships, services and related threats and safeguards) and the matters raised in the FRC's Annual Quality Review inspection reports and remedial actions taken (if any).\n\n## Management\n\nAssess output from a survey of those subject to the external audit process.\n\nAssurance on the disclosure process for the provision of information to the auditors.\n\n## Audit Process\n\nAssess delivery of the audit strategy and Independent Auditors' Report.\n\nAssess output from survey of Audit Partners on the external audit process.\n\nAssurance on the operation of audit quality process at audit firm.\n\n## Outcome\n\nFollowing consideration of all elements of the audit effectiveness review process, in addition to taking account of the engagement and communication between the Audit Committee, management and External Auditor, the Committee confirmed it was satisfied that the external audit process provided by EY had been delivered effectively. The Committee concluded that EY had demonstrated a depth of knowledge, as well as an appreciation of complex issues, whilst providing constructive, independent and objective challenge to management. The Committee requested that debrief sessions be held between the External Auditor and the finance management teams across the organisation to consider any areas to enhance the audit process control environment going forward.\n\n## External Auditor Fees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAudit and Audit-Related Services\n\nNon-Audit Services\n\noverruns of \u00a30.4m related to the prior year audit. Assurance and Tax service fees incurred in the year were \u00a30.5m (2022: \u00a30.5m). Non-Audit Services amounted to \u00a30.1m and principally related to regulatory accounts and returns required by Ofgem and comfort letters in connection with funding and debt issuance. The Committee was satisfied that the work was best handled by the External Auditor because of its knowledge of the Group and the services provided did not give rise to threats to independence. All Non-Audit Services were approved in accordance with the Non-Audit Services Policy and adhere to the FRC Ethical Standard. Fees paid to EY during the year are made in note 6 \uf150 to the Financial Statements.\n\n## Non-Audit Services Policy\n\nThe Committee oversees the Non-Audit Services Policy which governs the process for approving certain Non-Audit Services provided by the External Auditor. The Policy was updated by the Committee during the year to ensure that it remained fit for purpose and aligned to the application of pre-concurrence on non-audit services as required by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants. In addition, SSE is required to cap the level of non-audit fees paid to its External Auditor at 70% of the average audit fees paid in the previous three consecutive financial years.\n\nServices provided by the External Auditor are split into two categories for the purposes of approval:\n\n- \u00b7 Audit-Related Services. These services are largely carried out by members of the audit engagement team. The work involved is closely related to the work performed in the audit and the threats to auditor independence are 'clearly insignificant'. Such engagements are routinely pre-approved by the Audit Committee as part of their approval of the total annual audit fee. Before engaging in any other work of this type, approval is required from the Audit Committee.\n- \u00b7 Non-Audit Services. These are services other than 'Audit-Related Services' for which the External Auditor is an appropriate provider. The threats to independence arising from such services are not necessarily 'clearly insignificant' and the Committee and External Auditor must consider the threats to independence and whether any safeguards should be applied. In the absence of any apparent threat to auditor independence, approval for the provision of any Non-Audit Service must be obtained from the Audit Committee.\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nAssess output from annual Audit Committee evaluation.\n\nAssess output from survey of Audit Committee members, regular attendees and Group Finance.",

The Committee confirms ongoing compliance with the Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Tender Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014.\n\nThe Committee concluded that it is satisfied with the objectivity and independence of the External Auditor, and that the effectiveness of the external audit process delivered by EY was robust. The Committee proposed to the Board that it seeks shareholder approval for the re-appointment of EY as the External Auditor for the financial year ending 31 March 2024.\n\n## Internal audit\n\n## Role of Internal Audit\n\nInternal Audit plays an important role in helping the organisation deliver its vision and objectives by providing independent and objective assurance to management, the Committee and Board on the effectiveness of SSE's risk management activities, internal controls and corporate governance framework. Internal Audit, led by the Director of Group Risk and Audit, reports to the Committee and functionally to the Finance Director. The purpose, scope and authority of Internal Audit is defined within its charter which is approved annually by the Committee.\n\nIn fulfilling its role, Internal Audit seeks to add value by encouraging continual improvement in the effectiveness of business planning, operations and systems, promoting wherever possible enhancements to internal control processes, and seeking to embed 'best practice' throughout the SSE Group.\n\nAt each Committee meeting, an update on Internal Audit is provided covering an overview of the work undertaken in the period, actions arising from audits conducted, the tracking of remedial actions, and progress against the Internal Audit Plan. The Committee routinely meets independently with the Director of Group Risk and Audit to discuss the results of the audits performed and any additional insights obtained on the risk management and control environment across the organisation.\n\n## Internal Audit Plan\n\nThe Internal Audit Plan is structured to align with SSE's operating model, risk profile, control environment and assurance arrangements. The Internal Audit Plan is split between a one-year plan and a three-year strategy setting out the broader areas of Internal Audit focus, together with the vision and resource for the function. External providers may be engaged to support delivery of the Internal Audit plan where specific skills and expertise require to be co-sourced. An integrated assurance mapping and planning process is undertaken to ensure that Internal Audit work is appropriately aligned to, and coordinated with, the activities of other relevant assurance providers across the Group.\n\n## Internal Audit effectiveness\n\nThe Committee keeps under review and assesses the independence and effectiveness of Internal Audit. This year, the Committee engaged PwC to carry out a detailed External Quality Assessment (EQA) of the Internal Audit function. The process, approach and recommendations were presented and discussed by the Committee at its meeting in February 2023, and an overview is set out below.\n\n## Internal control and risk management\n\n## Internal control\n\nThe Board has delegated to the Committee responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of SSE's System of Internal Control. This covers all material controls including financial, operational and compliance controls, in addition to the financial reporting process. Internal control and risk management in relation to SSE's energy market related exposures are overseen by the Energy Markets Risk Committee and further information can be found on pages 160 to 161 \uf150 .\n\nDuring the year, the Committee received an update at each meeting from the project team established to assess and strengthen the financial reporting control environment in anticipation or ahead of regulatory reform in the UK. In addition, the Committee received a presentation from KPMG with a status update on their engagement to support the project. The timing of the implementation legislation remains unclear, however, management has continued to monitor regulatory developments and provide regular updates to the Committee.\n\nTo assist the Committee's review of the System of Internal Control, the different elements are evaluated by relevant key stakeholders. These evaluations are then holistically assessed by the Finance Director and a letter is provided to the Committee summarising the work conducted in the year to improve the control environment and making a recommendation on the overall effectiveness of the System of Internal Control. In addition, when undertaking the review of the effectiveness of the System of Internal Control, the Committee considers the assurance evaluations undertaken annually by the Managing Directors of each of SSE's seven Business Units. These assurance evaluations consider each framework of the system of internal control from a Business Unit perspective and include any planned improvements to enhance controls. These improvements are tracked, with updates reported to the executive-level Group Risk Committee on a regular basis.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe Group's Risk Management Framework is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. It can only therefore provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.\n\nIn addition to the ongoing review of emerging risks, the Board carried out a robust assessment of the Principal Risks facing the Group, being those that have the potential to threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity. Further details of the Group Principal Risks are set out on pages 68 to 77 \uf150 and also in the Group Risk Report.\n\n## Internal control and risk management effectiveness\n\nFollowing the Committee's review and recommendation, the Board agreed that SSE's System of Internal Control (including risk management) continues to be effective. This was in accordance with the requirements of the FRC Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Control and related Financial and Business Reporting. The Board also confirms that no significant failings or weaknesses have been identified during the financial year. Processes are in place to ensure that necessary action is taken, and progress is monitored where areas for improvement are identified.\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## Effectiveness of Internal Audit\n\n## Process\n\nAssessed against:\n\n- \u00b7 The Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors' (CIIA) Code of Ethics and International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, including the Internal Audit Code issued in January 2020;\n- \u00b7 PwC's Five Principles of Internal Audit Excellence Framework; and\n- \u00b7 A benchmark peer group of 8-10 relevant Internal Audit functions.\n\n## Approach\n\n## Work included:\n\n- \u00b7 Interviews with 16 key stakeholders, including: Audit Committee Chair; non-Executive Directors; Executive Directors; and Managing Directors across the business divisions;\n- \u00b7 Meetings with five Internal Audit team members;\n- \u00b7 Review of survey sent to all members of the Internal Audit Team;\n- \u00b7 Review of Internal Audit's structure and remit, audit approach and resource; and\n- \u00b7 Review of Internal Audit documentation over the preceding 12 months across the areas of planning, auditing and reporting.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nFindings included:\n\n- \u00b7 Develop the approach and methodology to derive more data driven analysis and insights;\n- \u00b7 Enhance executive and Audit Committee reporting to provide more insight;\n- \u00b7 Continue to develop the approach to innovation through areas such as digital capability and adopting agile delivery methods;\n- \u00b7 Develop further the strategic resourcing model to accommodate SSE's international footprint as well as leveraging internal and external co-sourcing; and\n- \u00b7 Enhancing the approach to monitoring and driving performance and productivity.\n\n## Outcome\n\nOverall, the Internal Audit function was found to be well established and valued across the organisation. The Committee recognised the progress made during the year and confirmed it was satisfied with the overall performance and effectiveness of the Internal Audit function.

This report details the role we play throughout the year to oversee SSE's energy markets risk exposures and ensure an effective system of risk management controls and related processes relevant to energy market risks.\n\nWe have continued to play a key role in overseeing the governance arrangements in relation to SSE's approach to managing portfolio exposures during a year of high prices and significant market volatility. At each meeting, we examine and discuss reports of these exposures, consider any proposals from the Executive Team, and recommend any changes to SSE's hedging approach to the Board as required. In addition, the EMRC reviews and endorses the hedging approach statement which is updated for material changes and published as part of SSE's interim and preliminary results statements.  SSE's latest hedging approach statement (as at 31 March 2023) is also set out on page 86 \uf150 of this Annual Report. The EMRC will continue to monitor and oversee these exposures and, should circumstances lead to any change in approach being required, these will be fully discussed, challenged, and appropriately reported.\n\nAs a committee, we believe that SSE has been served well by its prudent approach to hedging and has continued to manage successfully the changing credit and collateral requirements. To this end, we also reviewed the governance controls and risk\n\n\u00b7\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDuring 2023/24, as SSE continues to grow internationally, the EMRC will remain focused on providing effective oversight in relation to the Group energy markets risk exposures. We will also focus on the impact, management, and mitigation of relevant macroeconomic and geopolitical events. This will include:\n\n- \u00b7 the continued impact of the prolonged conflict between Ukraine and Russia on energy markets;\n- \u00b7 commodity prices and volatility and inflationary pressures; and\n- \u00b7 changes to regulatory requirements.\n\nI would like to thank the members of the Committee for their continued commitment throughout the year, the open discussions that take place at our meetings, and the contribution they all provide in support of our work.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTony Cocker Chair of the EMRC 23 May 2023\n\n## Key activities in 2022/23\n\n- \u00b7 Oversaw arrangements and recommended actions in relation to SSE's approach to managing portfolio exposures during a year of high prices and significant market volatility.\n- \u00b7 Reviewed and recommended changes to the risk and controls monitoring metrics, ensuring continued effective oversight of operational effectiveness against the backdrop of high prices and significant market volatility.\n\nmetrics overseen by us to ensure they remained appropriate in the current climate, and recommended to the Board changes to ensure operational effectiveness and that the correct oversight and reporting are in place.\n\nThe EMRC is assisted in its role by the following two Group-level committees:\n\n- \u00b7 Group Energy Markets Exposure Committee which meets monthly and provides a forum for SSE's senior management to discuss and consider energy market risks and exposures.\n- \u00b7 For the Customers Business Unit, Demand Management Committee (DMC) which meets monthly. The DMC was originally created to monitor the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the Business Unit's demand profile but continues in operation to monitor demand in relation to market volatility.\n\nThe minutes of these committees are provided to the EMRC for review and comment.\n\nIn line with standing practice, the annual Board evaluation is an assessment of our performance as a committee. I am pleased this concluded that we operate effectively and that the Board takes assurance from the quality of our work. Furthermore, the EMRC members are seen to bring a wide range and depth of recent and relevant experience across various industries, which will be bolstered further by Maarten Wetselaar, who will join the EMRC on 1 September 2023, with extensive knowledge from his career in the energy industry.\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## Committee membership and attendance\n\nFour non-Executive Directors and two Executive Directors make up the composition of the EMRC. Full details of membership and meeting attendance are set out on page 123 \uf150 . The Chief Executive and the Managing Director of Energy Portfolio Management also routinely attend meetings, with an Assistant Company Secretary acting as Secretary to the EMRC. To assist the EMRC in carrying out its responsibilities, relevant senior managers can be invited to attend to present certain items of business and provide additional levels of insight.\n\nThe EMRC membership is approved by the Board following recommendation of the Nomination Committee. No changes were made to the EMRC membership during the year. Maarten Wetselaar, who joins the Board on 1 September 2023, will join the EMRC. Maarten's experience from his career in the energy industry will further ensure that the EMRC has the sufficient skills and expertise to discharge its duties.\n\nThe composition of the EMRC further facilitates the sharing of relevant experience held by the non-Executive Directors. As EMRC Chair, Tony Cocker brings extensive knowledge from his career in the energy industry. Debbie Crosbie, Melanie Smith and Sir John Manzoni,\n\n## SSE approach to hedging\n\nSSE has an established approach to hedging through which it generally seeks to reduce its broad exposure to commodity price variation in relation to electricity generation and supply at least 12 months in advance of delivery. As market conditions change, SSE may be required to vary its hedging approach to take account of any resultant new or\n\nadditional exposures. SSE will continue to provide a summary of its current hedging approach, including details of any changes in the period, within its Half and Full-year Results Statements. Details of SSE's latest hedging approach and hedging position are set out on page 86 \uf150 .\n\nprovide invaluable insights and a wealth of knowledge from various senior roles in the private and public sectors. Biographical information of the EMRC members' backgrounds and experience is contained on pages 116 to 120 \uf150 .\n\n## Committee evaluation\n\nThe EMRC performance was assessed as part of the annual Board evaluation (see pages 140 to 141 \uf150 ). The results of the evaluation indicated that the EMRC is operating effectively, and that it continues to provide an appropriate level of challenge and oversight of the areas within its remit. No specific actions were identified.\n\n## Meetings and focus areas in 2022/23\n\nThe EMRC held four meetings during the year and reported to the Board on its work following each meeting.

This incident made us re-think, re-energise and be more determined than ever to deliver on our Safety Family approach with robust support for our employees.\n\nThis report explains the work of the SSHEAC during the year, alongside the progress that has been made in relation to safety, sustainability, health and wellbeing, and the environment. A more in-depth review of these areas, can be found on pages 34 to 67 \uf150 and in SSE's Sustainability Report 2023 \uf223 which is available on sse.com \uf295 .\n\nOur Safety Family is an important and distinctive part of SSE's culture. Through continuous development, we are looking to strike the balance between adding more energy to SSE's approach whilst reinforcing our existing Safety Family language and principles for our employees and\n\n- \u00b7 Maintains access to a range of both internal and external stakeholder perspectives to better achieve the creation of shared value for society.\n- \u00b7 Supports SSE's commitment to being a sustainable company that makes a positive contribution to the communities in which it operates.\n- \u00b7 Actively ensures the maintenance of a healthy corporate culture in respect of safety, sustainability, health and environmental matters based on a combination of values, attitudes and behaviours.\n\nThe Committee's Terms of Reference are available on sse.com \uf295 .\n\n## Key activities in 2022/23\n\n- \u00b7 Considered safety performance and targets\n- \u00b7 Enhanced oversight of employee wellbeing initiatives\n- \u00b7 Continued visits across sites\n- \u00b7 Reviewed an ESG gap analysis and materiality assessment\n\ncontractors. Our commitment - that we all get home safe - is the top priority for us.\n\nThe Committee has reviewed continued efforts to enhance employees' health and wellbeing in the year. A focus has been targeting areas in which we can make a difference and ensuring it is easy for people to access the help they need. In addition to the employee benefits already offered, last autumn saw the launch of SSE's Health Hub and 'We Care' for employees, which offer fast access to different health and wellbeing services. Whilst we have made great progress in this area in the last few years, there remain areas we would like to continue to develop.\n\nWe recognise that SSE is part of the natural world and want to support the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of the world's land and water resources; and promote the integration of amenity, ecosystem and biodiversity improvement into business activities. As noted in the report that follows, SSE's Business Units signed up to achieve no net loss in biodiversity by 2023 and net gain in biodiversity by 2025 on onshore large\n\nfigure for 2020/21 has been restated to align with the current definition of a Safe Day within SSE and the removal of Minor Environmental Incidents from the measure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncapital projects. We maintain focus on developing SSE's Environment Strategy, strengthening our local SHE communities and sharing SSE's 2022+ SHE vision 'making it easier to do the right thing'.\n\nFollowing on from last year, SSE's Sustainability Team presented two significant pieces of work: an ESG gap analysis and a materiality assessment. The ESG gap analysis supported identification of where improvements can and should be made, not only in ESG disclosures, but in practices and performance as well. The in-depth materiality assessment reconfirmed the most salient sustainability issues to both the Company and its stakeholders, identifying areas of opportunity to develop.\n\nAn increased number of Committee site visits were conducted in 2022/23, supporting oversight of SSE's safety culture in operation. Positive impressions were reported back to the SSHEAC alongside opportunities to enhance working environments.\n\nOn behalf of the SSHEAC, I would like to thank all employees and those that work with SSE for their sustained effort, hard work and commitment. I hope you find the report a useful explanation of our work and of SHE performance during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHelen Mahy CBE Chair of the SSHEAC 23 May 2023\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## Membership\n\nThe membership of the SSHEAC comprises four non-Executive Directors; the Chair of the Board; the Chief Commercial Officer; the Chief Sustainability Officer; the Managing Director, SSEN Distribution; the Managing Director, SSE Distributed Energy; and the Safety, Health and Environment Director. An Assistant Company Secretary is Secretary to the Committee and the Chief Executive routinely attends meetings. The Committee invites operational managers and specialists to attend certain meetings to gain a deeper level of insight on particular items of business. Biographical details of the non-Executive members can be found on pages 116 to 120 \uf150 .\n\n## Meetings and focus in 2022/23\n\nThe SSHEAC met five times in 2022/23 and details of non-Executive meeting attendance are set out on page 123 \uf150 .\n\nOne meeting provided specific consideration to an ESG gap analysis to allow identification of additional areas of focus (see page 165 \uf150 ). With this being a new piece of work for the Committee, Sir John Manzoni received a separate briefing outside of the meeting, due to being unable to attend the short-notice session because of a prior commitment.\n\nWorking closely with the Group Safety, Health and Environment Committee which reports to the Group Executive Committee, the SSHEAC has an annual work plan to review SHE performance at Group-level and in each of SSE's seven business areas. The Committee considers a wide range of SHE performance and governance issues as it shapes SSE's SHE strategy. This year it has had a specific focus on contractor safety and health and wellbeing, recognising the performance challenges of contract partners and the need to take care of colleagues' health and wellbeing in challenging times.\n\nOther matters which the SSHEAC focused on were:\n\n- \u00b7 SHE engagement and culture\n- \u00b7 SHE risks\n- \u00b7 Fatigue management\n- \u00b7 Climate adaptation and resilience\n- \u00b7 ESG performance\n\n\u00b7\n\nSign-off of the plan for SSE's\n\nSustainability Report 2023\n\n\uf223\n\n.\n\n## SHE strategy\n\nThe SSHEAC reviewed the safety, health and wellbeing, and environmental strategies, priorities and plans for 2023/24, underpinned by the SHE Risk Matrix and SHE Assurance Plan. It is recognised that the work being undertaken by contractors, on SSE's large capital projects can represent a higher-risk environment than\n\n## Committee evaluation\n\nThe actions identified from the evaluation of the SSHEAC in 2021/22 as reported on last year were monitored through to completion.\n\nThe annual review of Committee performance was facilitated by Lintstock (see pages 140 to 141 \uf150 ) and the outputs considered by the full Committee. This saw confirmation by the Board of the Committee's continued effective operation and agreement by the Committee of a number of actions for progression across 2023/24.\n\n## Evaluation themes\n\n## Actions for 2023/24\n\n- \u00b7 Good coverage of the key aspects of safety, sustainability and environmental issues. Continue to define SSE's Environment Strategy and monitor environmental performance.\n- \u00b7 Good recognition of the steps taken to improve SSE's Health offer to colleagues.\n- \u00b7 The SSHEAC's contribution has supported and encouraged the ambition and direction taken on safety, sustainability, health and environmental matters.\n- \u00b7 Safety. Communication with contractors is a top priority.\n- \u00b7 Meetings . Lengthen meetings and continue to undertake deep dives on specific topics.\n- \u00b7 Environment. Continue to define SSE's Environment Strategy and monitor environmental performance. Continue to promote interactions with 3rd parties NGOs and regulators.\n- \u00b7 Sustainability. Teachings on specific sustainability topics.\n\nnormal operations. For this reason, SSE is focusing on building strong relationships with contract partners to align behind a common goal to get everyone home safe.\n\nSSE's SHE Team also looked at SSE's business continuity and crisis management approach and set out a strategy for operational resilience and an accompanying three-year plan. Across 2022/23, organised campaigns supported SHE strategy implementation and communication, with a digital enablement project helping to develop more insights into SHE performance reporting.\n\nMaintaining SSE's Safety Family approach in the face of growth, new joiners and an increased contractor workload is high priority, and efforts to reinforce existing Safety Family language and update the tools already in place will remain key.\n\n## SHE performance Safety\n\nThe SSHEAC oversees safety performance using a number of different measures. SSE uses the concept of 'Safe Days' to monitor and track its safety progress and performance. On a 'Safe Day', for SSE or contractors, there are no minor, serious, or major safety incidents; serious or major environmental incidents; or any incident with high potential for harm to people or the environment. 255 Safe Days were achieved during 2022/23, compared to 276 in the previous year. The comparative\n\nIn addition to Safe Days, SSE continues to measure safety performance using the rolling Total Recordable Injury Rate (TRIR) for employees and contractors. This measure is used for benchmarking and trend analysis, and in 2022/23, it increased to 0.19 per 100,000 hours worked, compared to 0.17 in the previous year. This increase reflects a significant surge in investment and construction, and the associated rise in contractor hours worked. There will be a separate target TRIR for 2023/24 for SSE of 0.11, and contractors of 0.31, which, considering the increased activities and workload within all Business Units, will be a challenging task, but is believed to be achievable.\n\nTo enhance the safety of colleagues, immersive training programmes are being established at various locations in the UK. This involves deep immersion in an interactive environment that simulates real-world scenarios. The programme will be tailored to SSE's needs and attempts to change employees' perspective when working onsite. This will equip new starters as well as other colleagues with tools to support the overall goal of getting home safe.",

        "page_content": "## Safety, Sustainability, Health and Environment Advisory Committee Report continued\n\n## Health and wellbeing\n\nThe SSHEAC has encouraged and endorsed a significant focus on health and wellbeing across SSE over 2022/23. The Committee reviewed employee absence data and trends to ensure that common reasons for absence and wellbeing in the workplace were considered and understood. Following this, a new Health Hub was developed to allow easy access to employee support services. A new feature of the Health Hub was the launch of the 'We Care' health app. Through this free of charge service, employees and their immediate families can access 24/7 GP consultations and other health related advice. A programme in partnership with the British Heart Foundation on cardiovascular assessments was also introduced and will continue into 2023/24.\n\nIn addition, in response to employee listening, a series of webinars has also broached sensitive subjects such as suicide, menopause and more, setting the wellbeing objectives and values to build a strategy that adapts to business needs. Initiatives to support employees' physical and mental health continue to be provided through Nuffield, SSE's Employee Assistance Programme and Thrive.\n\n## Environment\n\nSSE's Environment Strategy is underpinned by an ethos of compliance. It provides a pathway to engage internal and external stakeholders by holding SSE accountable for performance against targets and indicators as a measurement of success. Following a review of the environmental vision, a set of targets were agreed for 2022/23. Further details of these targets and performance against them in the year can be found in SSE's Sustainability Report 2023 \uf223 and on pages 53 to 55 \uf150 .\n\n## Contractor safety\n\nWith the very sad news of the fatality of one of SSE's contractor's employees, and contractor incidents and contractor TRIR being higher than SSE's, the Committee discussed how SSE can provide more rigour and support, especially as the level of SSE's delivery through contract partners will increase.\n\nSSE has formed a new central Contractor Safety Team supported by dedicated Contractor SHE Managers and Assurance Auditors to improve contractor safety performance. In SSE's plan for the next financial year, key actions have been captured in the following three categories: 1. Collaborate - how SSE aligns all parties to deliver; 2. Support - how to provide direct support; and 3. Check - conduct a comprehensive audit across all businesses and directly with contract partners to identify and address any issues systematically.\n\nSSE has been working to continually improve SHE Specification for contractors and provide guidance for project management teams. In addition to the Contractor Safety Community, local SHE Communities are embedded across all SSE Business Units and the Committee saw good examples of their work on different sites during visits.\n\nEngagement in action Suppliers, contractors and partners\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Partnering for safety and wellbeing\n\nSSE's current growth phase, and the resulting increase in contractor hours worked, has sharpened focus on keeping the employees of our partners safe.\n\nAn example of this in action is an initiative within SSE Thermal to introduce on-site paramedics on large capital projects.\n\nIn partnership with SSE's principal contractors, it was decided paramedics should not just treat injuries but should also put a strong emphasis on prevention and awareness when it comes to safety, health and wellbeing.\n\nBy creating a positive safety culture, they are responsible for tasks such as setting up medical facilities, treatment and\n\nwellness rooms, offering defibrillator and CPR training, administering medication and providing mental first aid services. This approach has already been put into action treating potential incidents across sites. A recent survey of SSE Thermal colleagues showed that on-site paramedics were one of the top three factors helping to create a positive Safety, Health and Environment culture on location.\n\nThe operational focus of SSE's Environmental Strategy is across three priority pillars: 1. Environmental Management and Governance; 2. Responsible Consumption and Production; and 3. Natural Environment.\n\nIn 2022/23, the total number of environmental incidents as a result of SSE's activities totaled 109 compared to 84 the previous year, the majority of which were minor. SSE's 2021/22 total environmental incident measure has been restated, attributed to: enhanced governance checks that have increased the accuracy of reporting; and implementing a new SEARS system which has helped in improving the visibility of incidents and ensuring their correct categorisation. This improved reporting has also supported enhanced oversight of environmental performance.\n\nFollowing relatively stable performance over the past three years, there was a slight increase in serious environmental incidents in 2022/23, increasing to 31 from 24 the previous year. Of these incidents SSE saw an increase in the number of silt-related issues associated with the scale up of construction activities, offset by a reduction in the number and scale of fluid filled cable leaks of its assets. In order to address these issues and take into account the increased project activity, SSE has put in place deep dives in four areas: silt, fluid filled cables, SF 6 and waste.\n\nThe number of environmental permit breaches increased to nine in 2022/23 from seven the previous year, the majority of which were self-reported to the relevant environmental agencies. All incidents were dealt with quickly when identified.\n\nStrategic Report\n\nEngagement in action Employees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Visit to Peterhead\n\nMark Patterson, the Safety, Health and Environment Director, and Helen Mahy, Chair of the SSHEAC, visited Peterhead Power Station in September 2022 to gain insight into SSE's Safety Family language in action. Below is a summary of the takeaways from the visit.\n\n## If it's not safe, we don't do it\n\nThe station's team demonstrated openess, a deep sense of trust, and were supportive of each other and the environment. Safety was embedded across plant processes and Safety Family language was evident across discussions.\n\n## We take pride in our work and our environment\n\nThe overall impression was that the station team are making good strides towards building a positive SHE culture and ensuring an engaged team.\n\n## Sustainability and ESG focus\n\nSignificant progress was made across the most material areas of sustainability in 2022/23, with the SSHEAC reviewing SSE's performance in key investor environment, social and governance (ESG) ratings, and the results of an ESG gap analysis of SSE's performance in two key ratings, approving areas for development and improvement in the next financial year. The Committee also approved the undertaking of a sustainability materiality assessment, with the objective of confirming the ESG issues most material to SSE. The focus areas from the materiality assessment and the ESG gap analysis align with the UN Sustainable Development Goals that SSE has previously identified as being material, and around which it has based its sustainability approach. The recommendations from the two exercises informed next steps, for example, at a multi-stakeholder event in April 2023, a first-of-a-kind, disclosure report was published and designed to establish a framework for measuring and disclosing progress against SSE's 20 Just Transition Principles to SSE's stakeholders.\n\nIn terms of SSE's approach to the disclosure of its sustainability impacts, the aim is to bring about continuous improvement in both the quality and quantity of information disclosed. The objective for the Sustainability Report 2023 \uf223 is to provide clarity around SSE's most material sustainability issues, including those which represent key areas of opportunity for the business, reinforcing SSE's sustainability\n\n## We take care of ourselves and each other\n\nOverall housekeeping and station planning, control and permit work was positive and well ordered. Communication between operational teams, including apprentices, was strong and responsive.\n\n## We plan, scan and adapt\n\nThere was a clear focus on building capability and skills across the existing team and getting the station in a position to support any future developments. It was positive to see new employees joining the station from other industries such as oil and gas.\n\nhierarchy. SSE will use the Sustainability Report 2023 \uf223 to communicate enhanced disclosures recommended by our materiality assessment and ESG gap analysis.\n\nMore information can be found on pages 34 to 67 \uf150 and in the Sustainability Report \uf223 which is available at sse.com/ sustainability \uf295 .\n\n## Site visits\n\nThe SSHEAC completes an annual programme of site visits with the main objective of providing support to, and engaging with, colleagues working on different sites. Physical visits resumed in 2022/23, with Committee members looking at different sites in late summer and early autumn. Locations visited included Reading, Slough, Peterhead, Ridgeway (Oxford), Perth Training School, Chalvey, Canal Street in Willesden, SSE's joint venture Activ8, Leanamore wind farm, Galway wind park and Tarbert power station.\n\nThe feedback from visits was encouraging with teams working hard to have positive impacts on the environment and local communities and ensuring that a thorough safety briefing is in place. A report of the visit to Peterhead is provided above.\n\nA structured approach to site visits ensures that feedback is collected and acted upon. This is facilitated by a dedicated feedback template which is completed following each site visit. The site visits agreed for 2023/24 will be reported on next year.\n\n## What would make it easier for people to do the right thing?\n\nCovid-19 has presented some real challenges for SSE's sites. At the time of this visit, some controls at Peterhead were still in place to protect the control room operators from Covid-19, such as all visitors to the control room wearing masks. The site induction was also completed online to ensure the process was efficient and safe.\n\n<!-- image -->",

On behalf of the Board, my thanks go to Dame Sue Bruce for her extraordinary contribution both as a member of the Committee from December 2017 and as its Chair from May 2018.\n\nThe Directors' Remuneration Report sets out the detail and rationale for Directors' remuneration and covers:\n\n- \u00b7 Linking remuneration to strategy\n- \u00b7 Delivery and performance\n- - 2022/23 AIP outcomes\n- - Vesting of 2020 PSP award\n- - Wider workforce pay\n- - Salary changes\n- \u00b7 Changes to the Board\n- \u00b7 Pension arrangements\n\n## Linking remuneration to strategy\n\nThe current Directors' Remuneration Policy was approved at the July 2022 Annual General Meeting with over 91% support. Sue Bruce led an extensive consultation exercise with our largest shareholders and the Remuneration Committee is extremely grateful for their support. The policy is built on a set of enduring core reward principles:\n\n- 1.  Sustainability: reinforcing SSE's commitment to being a responsible employer.\n- 2.  Simplicity: maximising transparency and avoiding unnecessary complexity.\n- 3.  Stewardship: encouraging and fairly rewarding good decision-making for the long term.\n\n- 4.  Stakeholders: reflecting SSE's strategic goal of creating value for shareholders and society.\n\nOur approach to pay is designed to support SSE's purpose to provide energy needed today while building a better world of energy for tomorrow. The performance measures and targets on which the Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) and the longer-term performance share awards are directly linked to execution of SSE's strategy - the Net Zero Acceleration Programme (NZAP).\n\nSustainability is at the heart of SSE's strategy. Progress is measured by science-based business goals for 2030 that align with four specific UN Sustainable Development Goals. Progress against these goals, which are detailed on page 183 \uf150 , was linked last year to the vesting of awards made under the Performance Share Plan (PSP). Shareholders also approved new 'strategic' measures which assesses progress towards the successful delivery of the NZAP. This means that 30% of the shares awarded under the new PSP are linked to sustainability, either directly through sustainability measures or through strategic measures by virtue of SSE's NZAP. The in-year focus on sustainability continues through measures which have a weighting of 40% within the 2023/24 AIP, with 10% assessed against sustainability indices and 30% relating to operational performance linked to the NZAP.\n\nOur remuneration policy is structured to ensure that we have enough flexibility to attract world-class talent. This is particularly important as SSE is increasingly exposed to new markets and technologies.\n\nOur operating model and portfolio remain highly complementary and balanced. Our efficient operation of flexible thermal generation and gas storage assets (see page 78 \uf150 ) contributed in a large part, to strong 2022/23 financial performance. We have historically tolerated weaker thermal returns given our long-term belief that the underlying value of thermal flexibility would be key to transitioning to net zero. That value was accentuated by the extreme levels of market volatility we saw this year.\n\nStrategic delivery in the year was strong, with critical milestones delivered in SSE's flagship large capital projects (see page 18 \uf150 ). In light of 2022/23 performance, our financial strength and the available opportunity set, we have upgraded our plans and growth targets to the NZAP Plus, details on page 16 \uf150 .\n\n## 2022/23 AIP outcomes\n\nThe AIP is determined against a broad range of financial, operational, personal and sustainability performance targets collectively designed to reflect financial and non-financial business performance each year. The measures were reviewed last year to support the delivery of the NZAP and longer-term goals. Changes included strengthening the cashflow measure, the introduction of operational measures and the addition of new sustainability metrics.\n\nPerformance in the year has been strong. Financial measures exceeded target levels, and good progress has been made in respect of operational performance related to the NZAP. Performance against external sustainability indices, a new measure for 2022/23, has also been strong with upper quintile ranking achieved across all indices. A summary of the detailed AIP scorecard is shown on pages 172 to 173 \uf150 .\n\nEach year, the Committee considers whether there are appropriate reasons to apply discretion to the AIP outturn. The Committee was deeply saddened by the death of Liam Macdonald, a young contractor working on Shetland, in June\n\nStrategic Report\n\n2022. As a result, it used discretion to reduce the outturn of the AIP.\n\nThe outturn for the 2022/23 AIP is 88% of the maximum following the use of downward discretion.\n\n## Vesting of 2020 PSP award\n\nThe PSP awards granted in June 2020 are due to vest following the 2022/23 financial year, subject to financial, operational, and value-creation performance conditions measured over the three-year performance period ending 31 March 2023.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee objectively assessed the vesting outcome against the performance measures and targets. This resulted in an outturn of 76% of the maximum award. The Committee then reviewed the quality of the overall performance and the number of shares awarded in 2020 in comparison with the number of shares awarded in 2019 and in 2018. The number of shares under award in 2020 was 85% of the number of shares awarded in 2019. The Remuneration Committee was satisfied that the Executive Directors have not benefited merely as a result of share price volatility. It agreed that the vesting outcome for these awards was appropriate and no discretion was required. More details on the performance measures, the targets, and the performance outturns are set out on page 174 \uf150 .\n\n## Wider workforce pay\n\nIn setting pay policy and agreeing pay outcomes for Executive Directors, the Committee is mindful of the pay arrangements of the wider workforce. Throughout the year, a number of initiatives were introduced as part of SSE's improved Employee Value Proposition including the introduction of a new skills-based pay system involving considerable investment, increases to salary ranges and car allowances, enhancements to 'family friendly' policies and the introduction of additional health benefits.\n\nIn recognition of SSE's 2021/22 performance employees below senior management level were offered a \u00a3500 one-off payment in May 2022. Later in response to the worsening cost of living crisis part of the annual salary increase was paid early in October 2022 to help people through the winter with the balance of CPI paid at yearend. Further details on the Employee Value Proposition and support offered to employees in response to the cost of living crisis can be found in the case study on page 179 \uf150 .\n\n## Salary changes\n\nIn reviewing the base salaries of Executive Directors, the Committee considered SSE's strong performance and shareholder returns, and NZAP progress. We also considered the increases granted to the\n\nwider employee population which were linked to CPI expected to be in the region of 8%.\n\nSSE's market capitalisation is in the FTSE 20-50 upper quartile (excluding financial services). SSE total pay potential is below the median for this benchmark set. SSE's market capitalisation is within the range of the median of the FTSE 50 (excluding financial services) and total pay potential compared to this group is in the lower quartile. As SSE scales and becomes more international, the Committee will increasingly keep a watching brief on pay trends and pay levels across the FTSE 50.\n\nThe Committee decided that the increase for each of the Executive Directors from 1 April 2023 should be 5% of salary.\n\n## Changes to the Board\n\nGregor Alexander - SSE announced on 21 April 2023 that Gregor Alexander, who has served as Finance Director since 2002, would step down from the Board on 1 December 2023 and retire from SSE at the end of March 2024. Gregor will continue in his current positions as Chair of SSE Transmission's Board and as a Director on the Board of Neos Networks Limited, SSE's joint venture with Infracapital Partners. The Remuneration Committee without hesitation exercised its discretion to treat Gregor Alexander as a 'good leaver' in respect of his retirement, taking in to account his long and distinguished service. He will continue to be paid in the usual way until he steps down from the Board. He will be eligible for a time pro-rated bonus in respect of his service in the financial year 2023/24. One third of his bonus will be deferred into shares in the usual way. He will not receive an award in 2023 under the PSP. His outstanding share awards under the PSP will be time pro-rated to reflect the elapsed time between the start of the performance period and the date of cessation of employment, and the awards will vest in accordance with the usual timetable. He will be required to retain a shareholding for at least two years following the date of cessation of employment in accordance with the Directors' Remuneration Policy.\n\nBarry O'Regan - It was announced on 21 April 2023 that Barry would take up the appointment of Chief Financial Officer from 1 December 2023. Barry will join the Board on the same date. As his home base will remain in Ireland, he will be paid a Euro base salary of the equivalent of \u00a3600,000 a year. It is planned that the base salary will increase by 8.3% to the equivalent of \u00a3650,000 with effect from 1 April 2024 and to the Euro equivalent of \u00a3700,000 (an increase of 7.7% of salary) with effect from 1 April 2025. The Committee believes that the planned phased increases set out are appropriate to achieve a competitive total\n\npay position and will be subject to review at each point to ensure they reflect Barry's development in the role. His maximum bonus under the AIP will be 130% of salary and his annual award under the PSP will be 225% of salary. It is expected that an award will be made under the PSP on 1 April 2024. He will be required over time to build up a shareholding to the value of 225% of salary and to retain this holding for two years after he leaves employment with SSE. His existing incentive arrangements, including in-flight share awards, will continue to run on their original terms.\n\n## Pension arrangements\n\nThe Directors' Remuneration Policy is clear that any individual appointed to the Board will receive pension arrangements which are aligned, in terms of annual percentage contribution, to those of the majority of SSE employees.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee considered the pension allowance of 15% of salary payable to the Chief Commercial Officer, Martin Pibworth, with effect from 1 January 2023 in the light of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the views of many investors and representative bodies on the alignment of executive pension arrangements with those for all employees. It has made no further changes to Martin's pension allowance of 15%, which is in line with the average employer cost for employees with similar service.\n\nAs Chief Financial Officer, Barry O'Regan will receive a cash allowance in lieu of contribution to his pension equivalent to 12% of salary aligned to the policy for new appointments and the contribution for the majority of employees in the UK and Ireland irrespective of length of service.\n\nThe defined benefit arrangements for the Chief Executive and the Finance Director reflect their long service with the business and, in terms of the benefits provided, are in line with the arrangements for other employees recruited at the same time.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Remuneration Committee plans to continue to apply SSE's core principles of transparency of decision-making and clarity of reporting and to be fully cognisant of the perspectives of SSE's stakeholder groups. I very much welcome any comments on the 2022 Directors' Remuneration Report or on any remuneration matters.

The estimated value shown in the table for 2022/23 is based on the average share price in the three months to 31 March 2023 of \u00a317.26, as required by the reporting regulations. The value generated through share price appreciation is \u00a3849,657 (full details shown on page 175 \uf150 ). The award remains subject to service until May 2023 and so the prior year comparative will be restated in next year's report to show the actual value on vesting, as is required by the regulations.\n- 6 Directors have not received any other items in the nature of remuneration other than as disclosed in the table.\n\n## Rationale for 2022/23 single total figure of remuneration\n\nThere has been very little year-on-year change in the single total figure of remuneration with just a 0.5% reduction. For the Executive Directors, total remuneration has either stayed the same or reduced by up to 0.9%. There have however, been changes in the individual elements of pay. Executive Directors received a base salary increase lower than the wider workforce and AIP outcomes were increased following a year of strong financial, operational and strategic performance. The single total figures reflect the Committee's decision to exercise discretion in relation to the AIP outturn. PSP outcomes also increased however, share price appreciation reduced from 52% in 2022 to 24% over the three years to the end of March 2023.\n\nValues for pensions have all reduced during the year. Martin Pibworth's pension allowance was subject to a phased reduction to bring it in to line with the wider employee population from 1 January 2023. Alistair Phillips-Davies and Gregor Alexander participate in defined benefit pension arrangements and there has been a reduction in the pension service cost which is a function of the valuation regulations rather than any change in approach.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the single total figure of remuneration for each Executive Director is appropriate.\n\n## Base salary\n\nIn line with the average base salary increase for the wider employee population, Executive Directors' salaries were increased on 1 April 2022 by 3% from \u00a3923,924 to \u00a3951,642 for the Chief Executive, from \u00a3714,117 to \u00a3735,541 for the Finance Director and from \u00a3636,300 to \u00a3655,389 for the Chief Commercial Officer.\n\n## Benefits\n\nBenefits are provided at an appropriate level taking into account market practice at similarly sized companies and the level of benefits provided for other employees in the Company. Core benefits include car allowance, private medical insurance and health screening. The Executive Directors also participate in the Company's all-employee share schemes on the same terms as other employees.\n\n## Pension\n\nThe Chief Executive and Finance Director are members of the Southern Electric Pension Scheme and the Scottish Hydro Electric Pension Scheme respectively, and their plan membership predates their Board appointments. They participate in the same defined benefit pension arrangements that were available to all employees recruited at that time. The schemes were closed in 1999 and the service costs are 32.5% of salary. These are both funded final salary pension schemes and the terms of these schemes apply equally to all members. The Executive Directors' service contracts provide for a possible maximum pension of two thirds final salary from the age of 60.\n\nIn relation to Executive Directors who are subject to the scheme-specific salary cap (which mirrors the provisions of the previous HMRC cap arrangements) the Company provides top-up (unfunded) arrangements which are designed to provide an equivalent pension on retirement from the age of 60 to that which they would have earned had they not been subject to the salary cap. From 1 April 2017 pensionable earnings increases were capped at RPI +1%. These are legacy arrangements and will not be used for any new external appointments.\n\nStrategic Report\n\nThe Chief Executive and Finance Director, in common with all other employees who joined at the same time (26 and 32 years ago respectively), have the following pension provisions relating to leaving the Company:\n\n- \u00b7 for retirement through ill-health an unreduced pension based on service to expected retirement is paid;\n- \u00b7 in the event of any reorganisation or redundancy an unreduced accrued pension is paid to a member who is aged 50 or above, with at least five years' service or, for a member who has not yet reached that age, it will be payable with effect from 50;\n- \u00b7 and from the age of 55, a scheme member is entitled to leave the Company and receive a pension, reduced for early payment, unless the Company gives consent and funds this pension on an unreduced basis.\n\nDependent on the circumstances surrounding the departure of the Executive Director and financial health of the Company at the time, the Committee's policy is to give consideration to a cash commutation of the unfunded unapproved retirement benefit (UURB) pension at the time of leaving. Any cash commutation will limit SSE's liability, taking into account valuations provided by independent actuarial advisors, and will be calculated on what was judged to be a cost neutral basis to SSE.\n\nThe Finance Director will stop accruing pension under the scheme with effect from his 60th birthday in April 2023.\n\nThe Chief Commercial Officer, who has been with SSE since 1998, was already in receipt of a pension allowance of 30% of salary prior to his appointment as an Executive Director. While the arrangement was consistent with the approach used for all other members who have elected to receive a cash allowance in lieu of accruing future pension benefits, the Committee agreed that his future pension arrangements would be aligned with the level of contributions available to the wider workforce at 15% of salary on a phased basis over five years. Following confirmation of his expanded role from 1 November 2020, it was agreed that the phased reduction would be accelerated by two years. From 1 January 2023, his pension allowance has been in line with the employer contribution for the majority of SSE's employees, taking into account length of service, at 15% of salary.\n\nThe table below details pension accrued for each of the Executive Directors as at 31 March 2023 and 2022.\n\n|                          |   Accrued  pension as at  31 March 2023 \u00a3000s |   Accrued   pension as at  31 March 2022 \u00a3000s |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Alistair Phillips-Davies |                                           549 |                                            513 |\n| Gregor Alexander         |                                           490 |                                            461 |\n| Martin Pibworth 1        |                                             0 |                                              0 |\n\n## Annual Incentive Plan and Performance Share Plan\n\nIn setting targets and assessing performance, the Committee followed the process below for both the AIP and PSP:\n\n1.\n\nSet  performance\n\nmeasures aligned\n\nwith strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 2022/23 Annual Incentive Plan\n\n## 1. Set performance measures aligned with strategy\n\nAIP requires broad performance across financial metrics (Adjusted EPS and Cashflow) and strategic metrics (Personal, Operational and Sustainability). The performance measures and their weightings are shown below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Financial  (50%)    | Financial  (50%)   | Personal  (10%)        |         | Operational  (30%)   | Operational  (30%)   | Operational  (30%)          | Sustainability (10%)   | Sustainability (10%)   | Sustainability (10%)   |\n|---------------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Adjusted  EPS (30%) | Cashflow (20%)     | Individual  Objectives | People  | Renewables           | Distribution         | Transmission                | Moody's                | Sustainalytics         |                        |\n| Adjusted  EPS (30%) | Cashflow (20%)     | (10%)                  | Thermal | Customer             |                      | Other Growth & Transactions | Moody's                | Sustainalytics         |                        |\n\n## 2. Set stretching performance targets\n\nThe financial performance targets were set at the start of the financial year taking into account internal financial plans, external consensus where it exists and the expected impact of identified opportunities and threats to the business in the context of wider economic conditions. The performance target range is set on a realistic basis but requires true outperformance for Executive Directors to achieve the maximum. The Remuneration Committee has a history of setting challenging targets, evidenced by the average AIP payout of 60% since 2013/14 as shown on page 178 \uf150 .\n\nThe Committee had originally intended to use four ESG ratings agencies as the basis for assessing performance in relation to Sustainability (as set out in the 2022 Annual Report). However, the provision of detailed comparative data for the MSCI ESG rating was not possible in 2022/23, and therefore, average performance over three indices rather than four has been used. SSE's performance against the MSCI ESG rating was in the upper quintile and as such, the Committee is satisfied that this issue has not made a material difference to the outturn of this performance measure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Take account of wider environment\n\nThe Remuneration Committee believes that the range of measures used in the AIP ensures that performance is assessed using a balanced approach, without undue focus on a single metric which could be achieved at the expense of wider initiatives. AIP outturns for the wider employee population were also taken into account by the Committee.\n\n## 5. Apply discretion if required\n\nConsideration is given to performance outcomes in light of SSE's performance in the round and against our pay principles. The Committee is clear that no matter their role, getting everyone who works for SSE home safe at the end of each day remains our priority. That focus is all the keener following the tragic death of Liam Macdonald, a young contractor working on Shetland, in June 2022. More information on this including SSE's wider safety performance and response to this tragedy can be found on page 162 \uf150 onwards.\n\nWhile safety performance is measured in the formulaic assessment of AIP, the Committee also considered the extent to which a discretionary adjustment should be applied. After careful consideration, the Committee decided to reduce the award outturn to 88%. The discount is greater than the impact of reducing to zero any bonus under the people (and safety) element of the AIP.\n\nAIP earned for each of the Executive Directors is shown in the table below. The total award is made up of 67% cash and 33% which is deferred into shares and vests after three years.\n\n|                           | Maximum (% of salary)   | AIP earned 1   | AIP cash   | AIP deferred   |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------|----------------|------------|----------------|\n| Alistair Phillips-Davies  | 150%                    | 1,256,167      | 841,632    | 414,535        |\n| Gregor Alexander          | 130%                    | 841,459        | 563,777    | 277,681        |\n| Martin Pibworth/thinspace | 130%                    | 749,765        | 502,343    | 247,422        |\n\n## 2020 - 2023 Performance Share Plan\n\n## 1. Set performance measures aligned with strategy\n\nPSP performance measures are designed to encourage sustainable value creation, consistent with effective stewardship, encouraging good decision-making for the long term. The measures and their weightings are shown below:\n\n| Value Creation  (40%)                                 | Value Creation  (40%)                                         | Financial  (40%)           |                  | Operational  (20%)             | Operational  (20%)                   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Total Shareholder Return relative to FTSE 100   (20%) | Total Shareholder Return relative to MSCI Europe Index  (20%) | Adjusted EPS growth  (20%) | DPS growth (20%) | Customer:  Distribution  (10%) | Customer:  Business   Energy   (10%) |\n\n## 2. Set stretching performance targets\n\nThe performance target ranges for PSP are set each year to ensure they are stretching and represent value creation for shareholders.\n\n## 3. Assess performance against targets\n\nThe vesting of shares under the PSP is subject to the performance measures and targets shown in the table below which also details the actual outturn for the 2020 PSP award vesting this year.\n\n|                    | Performance measure                     | Performance measure                          | Performance measure                            | Performance measure                                   | Performance measure                                    | Performance measure                                   | Performance measure               |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| PSP                | TSR v FTSE 100                          | TSR v MSCI Europe EPS growth                 | TSR v MSCI Europe EPS growth                   | DPS growth                                            | Customer  (Distribution)                               | Customer (Business  Energy) Total                     | Customer (Business  Energy) Total |\n| Link to strategy   | Simple  Stewardship  Stakeholders       | Simple  Stewardship  Stakeholders            | Simple  Stewardship  Stakeholders              | Simple  Sustainable  Stakeholders                     | Simple  Stewardship  Stakeholders                      | Simple   Stewardship  Stakeholders                    |                                   |\n| Rationale          | Relative   measure of  performance      | Relative   measure of  performance           | Underlying  measure of  financial  performance | Return on  investment  through  payment of  dividends | Meeting  customers  needs is at  core of our  business | Meeting  customers  needs is at core  of our business |                                   |\n| Weighting          | 20%                                     | 20%                                          | 20%                                            | 20%                                                   | 10%                                                    | 10%                                                   |                                   |\n| Threshold          | 50th percentile                         | 50th percentile                              | RPI                                            | RPI                                                   | Median ranking Median ranking                          |                                                       |                                   |\n| Max                | 75th percentile                         | 75th percentile                              | RPI +10%                                       | RPI +5%                                               | Rank 1                                                 | Rank 1                                                |                                   |\n| Outcome            | Rank 24 of 95  (above 75th  percentile) | Rank 7 of 24  (just below   75th percentile) | In excess of   RPI + 10%                       | RPI                                                   | Below   median                                         | Average rank  4 of 16                                 |                                   |\n| Performance        | 100%                                    | 94%                                          | 100%                                           | 50%                                                   | 0                                                      | 68%                                                   |                                   |\n| Outturn (% of max) | 20%                                     | 19%                                          | 20%                                            | 10%                                                   | 0                                                      | 7%                                                    | 76%                               |\n\n## 4. Take account of the wider environment\n\nSSE's TSR has performed at the maximum level relative to the FTSE 100 and just below upper quartile against the MSCI European Utilities Index, and performance in relation to Business Energy customer service ranking is also above median. EPS growth over the performance period has exceeded the level for maximum vesting. SSE's dividend commitment has been met over the three-year period and therefore, threshold performance at RPI has been achieved.\n\nWhile the PSP applies to Executive Directors only, the Committee is mindful of the outturns of the long-term incentive arrangement, the Leadership Share Plan (LSP), which applies to senior managers.\n\n## 5. Apply discretion if required\n\nThe Committee believes that the formulaic outcome is a fair reflection of wider performance over this three-year period, in particular the value created for shareholders and taking account of shareholders' interests.\n\nThe Committee reviewed the quality of the overall performance and the number of shares awarded in 2020 in comparison with the number of shares awarded in 2019 and in 2018. The number of shares under award in 2020 was 85% of the number of shares awarded in 2019. The Remuneration Committee was satisfied that the Executive Directors have not benefited merely as a result of share price volatility.\n\nThe table below shows the maximum number of shares available, the dividends accrued over the three-year performance period, the total number of shares vesting based on the performance outturn, the estimated value of these shares, and the value of any share price appreciation.\n\n|                           | Awards available  (% of salary)   | Awards available  (number of  shares)   | Additional  awards in  respect of  accrued  dividends   | Total number of  shares vesting   | Estimated value  of awards  vesting 1   | Share price  appreciation 2   |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Alistair Phillips-Davies  | 200%                              | 131,244                                 | 23,143                                                  | 117,334                           | \u00a32,024,952                              | \u00a3389,315                      |\n| Gregor Alexander          | 175%                              | 88,761                                  | 15,651                                                  | 79,353                            | \u00a31,369,476                              | \u00a3263,294                      |\n| Martin Pibworth/thinspace | 175%                              | 66,430                                  | 11,712                                                  | 59,388                            | \u00a31,024,917                              | \u00a3197,049                      |\n\n## Other remuneration disclosures\n\nFees paid to the Chair and the other non-Executive Directors during 2022/23 were as follows:\n\n|                         | Fees \u00a3000s   | Fees \u00a3000s   |\n|-------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Non-Executive Directors | 2022/23      | 2021/22      |\n| Elish Angiolini 1       | 75           | 42           |\n| John Bason 2            | 62           | 0            |\n| Sue Bruce 3             | 104          | 101          |\n| Tony Cocker             | 109          | 105          |\n| Debbie Crosbie 4        | 75           | 42           |\n| Peter Lynas             | 94           | 91           |\n| Helen Mahy              | 90           | 87           |\n| John Manzoni            | 412          | 400          |\n| Melanie Smith           | 75           | 73           |\n| Angela Strank           | 75           | 73           |\n| Total                   | 1,171        | 1,014        |",

For a number of years, a Chief Executive pay ratio was disclosed voluntarily. In 2018/19, the methodology was revised to meet the new reporting requirements. The methodology used is a hybrid approach combining Gender Pay Gap (GPG) data (see page 61 \uf150 ) with additional elements of pay which are important components of SSE employees' pay such as overtime, employer's contribution to pension and excluding salary sacrifice arrangements. This is believed to allow the most appropriate and consistent comparison.\n\nAs shown in the table on the following page, the pay ratio has changed from 102:1 at median in 2021/22 to 97:1 in 2022/23 even though the Chief Executive's remuneration has remained broadly unchanged. This is because employee remuneration at median has increased by almost 10% which can be attributed to a number of initiatives relating to wider employee pay during the year. A skills based pay system was introduced during 2021/22 for around 6,000 employees below senior management level, representing a significant investment in employee pay. In addition, over the course of the year steps have been taken to enhance employee terms and conditions through an improved Employee Value Proposition (EVP), and in response to the cost of living crisis. Further details can be found in the case study on the following page. Some of these initiatives will not impact on employee remuneration until next year's reporting on the CEO pay ratio.\n\nStrategic Report\n\n|         |                          | 25th percentile    | 25th percentile   | Median             | Median   | 75th percentile    | 75th percentile   | Total employee earnings  (m) 1   |\n|---------|--------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------|----------|--------------------|-------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Year    | Calculation  Methodology | Total Remuneration | Ratio             | Total Remuneration | Ratio    | Total Remuneration | Ratio             |                                  |\n| 2022/23 | C                        | \u00a334,881            | 133:1             | \u00a347,864            | 97:1     | \u00a365,199            | 71:1              | \u00a3543.5                           |\n| 2021/22 | C                        | \u00a333,046            | 136:1             | \u00a343,793            | 102:1    | \u00a361,195            | 73:1              | \u00a3591.0                           |\n| 2020/21 | C                        | \u00a332,268            | 93:1              | \u00a342,295            | 71:1     | \u00a359,454            | 51:1              | \u00a3543.1                           |\n| 2019/20 | C                        | \u00a329,234            | 83:1              | \u00a340,908            | 59:1     | \u00a354,863            | 44:1              | \u00a3510.0                           |\n| 2018/19 | C                        | \u00a328,611            | 57:1              | \u00a339,010            | 41:1     | \u00a354,066            | 30:1              | \u00a3495.3                           |\n\n- 1 The reduction in total employee earnings in 2022/23 is due to a reduction in the number of employees at the snapshot date used for capturing this data.\n\nSSE is committed to being a responsible employer, and the remuneration policy is designed with fairness in mind - fairness to Executive Directors in recognition of the extent of their responsibilities and fairness relative to the rest of the SSE team. More information on SSE's commitment to decent work and economic growth can be found within the Sustainability Report \uf223 which includes information on our ambition to be a global leader for the just transition to net zero, with a guarantee of fair work and commitment to paying fair tax and sharing economic value.\n\nOver the course of the year, the Remuneration Committee has had the opportunity to review the remuneration arrangements for the wider employee population. The impact of the cost of living crisis on employees was a key focus in the year and the Committee was given the opportunity to input on employee cost of living support and SSE's overall Employee Value Proposition.\n\nEngagement in action Employees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## SSE's Employee Value Proposition and response to the cost of living crisis\n\nAn internal working group was set up to tackle the challenge of improving SSE's Employee Value Proposition (EVP), making it fit-for-purpose to support the growth, attraction and retention challenges we face on our NZAP journey. As the year unfolded and the cost of living crisis took hold, the scope of the group expanded to also cover additional support for employees in light of this.\n\nEVP is wide-ranging and covers areas such as terms and conditions, culture, policies and employee communication. Some of the activity carried out during the year has included:\n\n- \u00b7 Salary ranges were increased by 12% for grades covering around 5,500 employees.\n- \u00b7 In response to high levels of inflation and the cost of living crisis, an interim advance of the annual pay award of up to 5% was paid in October 2022. The remaining balance of year 3 of the pay deal was payable from 1 April 2023 and is expected to be in the region of 8% of salary.\n- \u00b7 Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) was extended to include the lowest graded personal contract employees.\n- \u00b7 Payment of a \u00a3500 'thank you' award was made to all employees below\n- senior management level in recognition of strong business performance.\n- \u00b7 Car cash allowances were reviewed and subsequently increased.\n- \u00b7 Electric vehicle business mileage rates were improved beyond HMRC levels to cushion varying fuel rates during the cost of living crisis.\n- \u00b7 Improvements were made to family friendly policies, including:\n- - Introduction of Partner's Leave an additional 7 weeks' paid leave for partners on top of Paternity Leave.\n- - Introduction of up to 2 weeks' full pay for pregnancy loss or fertility treatment.\n- - Enhancement to the statutory allowance of 2 days' unpaid leave for partners to attend antenatal and adoption appointments, to paid leave and extended to fostering appointments.\n- - Extension to our Gradual Return from Maternity and Adoption Leave to other types of leave for new parents for continuous leave of 3 months or more.\n- \u00b7 Launch of 'My SSE Week' - a week of daily live Teams sessions showcasing existing benefits with themes around cost of living, wellbeing and career\n- development, attended by 7,600 employees with over 1,000 questions submitted.\n- \u00b7 A comprehensive benefits review was carried out by an independent 3rd party and gaps were identified with a plan for implementation in 2023 and beyond.\n- \u00b7 Agreement was made to introduce an Employee Recognition Platform.\n- \u00b7 Enhanced default pension award for those in the Defined Contribution scheme was agreed.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For every \u00a31 spent on Executive Directors' earnings by SSE in 2022/23, \u00a348 was paid in tax, \u00a374 was spent on employee costs and \u00a3270 was spent on capital and investment expenditure. In addition, \u00a392 was made in dividend payments to shareholders for every \u00a31 spent on Executive Directors' earnings.\n\n|                                               | 2017/18  \u00a3m   | 2018/19 \u00a3m   | 2019/20 \u00a3m   | 2020/21 \u00a3m   | 2021/22 \u00a3m   | 2022/23  \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|\n| Executive Directors' earnings /thinspace1     | 5.3           | 3.6          | 5.1          | 6.8          | 10.4         | 10.4          |\n| Dividends to shareholders                     | 926.1         | 973.0        | 948.5        | 836.4        | 862.3        | 955.8         |\n| Adjusted investment, capital and              |               |              |              |              |              |               |\n| acquisition expenditure                       | 1,503.0       | 1,422.9      | 1,371.9      | 912.0        | 2,067.8      | 2,803.3       |\n| Total UK taxes paid (profits, property,       |               |              |              |              |              |               |\n| environment and employment taxes)/thinspace 2 | 484.1         | 403.7        | 421.6        | 379.0        | 335.3        | 501.7         |\n| Staff costs/thinspace 3                       | 665.6         | 653.5        | 684.7        | 700.4        | 688.7        | 771.8         |\n\n- 1 Calculated on the same basis as the 'single total figure of remuneration' table on page 170 \uf150\n\n.\n\n- 2 Includes corporation tax, employers' National Insurance contributions and business rates.\n- 3 Staff costs for all employees, as per note 8.1 of the accounts, excluding Executive Directors.\n\n## 3. Governance\n\n## External appointments\n\nExecutive Directors are able to accept a non-Executive appointment outside SSE with the consent of the Board, as such appointments can enhance their experience and value to SSE. Any fees received are retained by the Director. Gregor Alexander was a non-Executive Director of Stagecoach Group plc during 2022 and received \u00a361,000 in fees. Alistair Phillips-Davies joined the Board of Anglian Water Services Ltd as a non-Executive Director in November 2022 with an annual fee of \u00a355,000.\n\n## Payments for loss of office and payments to past Directors\n\nThere were no payments for loss of office or to former Directors during the year.\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## Advice to the Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Chief Executive, the Director of Human Resources and Head of Reward advised the Committee on certain remuneration matters for the Executive Directors and senior executives although they were not present for any discussions related to their own remuneration.\n\nThe Director of Human Resources and Head of Reward advised on HR strategy and the application of HR policies across the wider organisation.\n\nFIT Remuneration Consultants LLP (FIT) provided a range of information to the Committee which included market data drawn from published surveys, governance developments and their application to SSE, advice on remuneration disclosures and regulations and comparator group pay. FIT received fees of \u00a376,391 in relation to their work for the Committee, calculated on a time and materials basis. FIT are founding members of, and adhere to, the Remuneration Consultants' Group Code of Conduct. The Code defines the roles of consultants, including the requirement to have due regard to the organisation's strategy, financial situation, pay philosophy, the Board's statutory duties and the views of investors and other stakeholders. The Committee reviews the advisers' performance annually to determine that it is satisfied with the quality, relevance, objectivity and independence of advice being provided. FIT provides no other services and has no other connection to SSE or individual Directors.\n\nFreshfields LLP also provided advice on legal matters, such as share plan rules, during the year.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThe annual review of Committee performance was facilitated by Lintstock (see pages 140 to 141 \uf150 ) and the outputs considered by the full Committee. This confirmed the Committee's continued effective operation and agreement of actions for 2023/24.\n\n## Shareholder voting in 2022\n\nOn 21 July 2022, shareholders approved the Directors' Remuneration Policy and the Annual Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 March 2022. The results of the resolutions are shown below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Terms of Reference for the Committee were reviewed during 2022/23 and are available on SSE's website ( sse.com \uf295 ). In summary, the Committee determines and agrees with the Board, SSE's framework and policy for executive remuneration including setting remuneration for all Executive Directors, the Company Chair, the Group Executive Committee and Company Secretary. No material changes were made to the Terms of Reference during the year.\n\nThe members of the Committee and the meetings attended are set out on page 123 \uf150 .

Relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and EPS account for 50% and 20% respectively of the total and the new sustainability and strategic measures 30% of the total award as follows:\n\n| Performance measure   | Total Shareholder   Return relative to the  FTSE 100   | Total Shareholder   Return relative to the  MSCI European Utilities   | Adjusted   Earnings   Per Share   | Strategic   | Sustainability   |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------|------------------|\n| Weighting             | 20%                                                    | 30%                                                                   | 20%                               | 15%         | 15%              |\n| Threshold performance | 50th percentile (20% outturn)                          | 50th percentile (20% outturn)                                         | 149p  (20% outturn)               | See below   | See below        |\n| Maximum performance   | 80th percentile (100% outturn)                         | 80th percentile (100% outturn)                                        | 178p  (100% outturn)              | See below   | See below        |\n\nThe TSR performance targets were strengthened last year with 20% of that element vesting for median performance (previously 25%) and full vesting of that element only achieved at 80th percentile ranking (increased from 75th percentile).\n\nThe growth targets for EPS have been set based on SSE's plan over the next three years and represents a CAGR between 12% and 17% based off FY22 EPS of 94.8p. The top end of the range exceeds the Board's expectations and is considered stretching. The Committee will assess the growth targets for future awards under the PSP to ensure that they remain challenging and linked to the business plan.\n\n## Strategic measures and targets for the 2023 PSP award\n\nThe measures and targets for this element are linked to the Remuneration Committee's assessment of SSE's performance over the three years to 31 March 2025 in the three main areas of the implementation strategy which have been updated this year to reflect the NZAP Plus.\n\n| Strategic area in NZAP   | Measures and targets                                                                                        |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Renewables               | 8GW pipeline of net installed capacity potential and 0.5GW of international under construction by FY26.     |\n| Networks growth          | Transmission and Distribution to exceed the NZAP Plus RAV growth targets of \u00a37 and \u00a36 billion respectively. |\n| Energy businesses        | Solar and battery installed capacity to meet 1GW by FY26.                                                   |\n| Customer                 | On course to be a leading ppa player in the market by 2026.                                                 |\n\n## Sustainability measures and targets for the 2023 PSP award\n\n| SSE's UN SDG 2030 Goal                                                                                                                                                                              | Measure and Targets                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| SDG 13 Climate Action:  Reduce scope 1 carbon intensity by 80% by 2030, compared   to 2017/18 levels, to 61gCO 2 e/kWh.                                                                             | Scope 1 carbon intensity reduction to 61gCO 2 e/kWh                                                                                                                                           |\n| SDG 7 Affordable and Clean Energy:  Build a renewable energy portfolio that generates at least   50TWh of renewable electricity a year by 2030.                                                     | Renewables output TWh tracked to 2026/27.

It is intended that the Policy will apply for a period of up to three years and will need to be re-approved at the 2025 AGM at the latest. The full Policy is provided in the 2022 Annual Report \uf223 .\n\n## Principles\n\nThe Committee believes it is essential that our overall Remuneration Policy is strongly aligned to SSE's purpose and strategy. It aims to ensure this by focusing on our core principles which are: Sustainable, Simple, Stewardship, Stakeholder-focused. In addition, we believe that SSE's Directors' Remuneration Policy, practice and engagement with employees and shareholders complies fully with the UK Corporate Governance Code which encourages a description of how the policy addresses the following:\n\n## Clarity\n\n- \u00b7 Our Directors' Remuneration Policy is designed to be sustainable and simple and to support and reward diligent and effective stewardship that is vital to the delivery of SSE's core purpose of providing energy needed today while building a better world of energy for tomorrow, and our strategy of creating value for shareholders and all stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 The Policy updates the previous Policy, with minimal structural changes so is already embedded into the business and is well understood by participants and shareholders alike.\n- \u00b7 The Policy clearly sets out the terms under which it can be operated including appropriate limits in terms of quantum, the measures which can be used and discretions which could be applied if appropriate.\n- \u00b7 Transparency in approach has been a cornerstone of our Policy. Detailed disclosure of the relevant performance assessments and outcomes is provided for shareholders to consider.\n\n## Risk\n\n- \u00b7 Appropriate limits are stipulated in the Policy and within the respective plan rules.\n- \u00b7 The Committee also has appropriate discretions to override formulaic outturns under the assessment of the variable incentive plans.\n- \u00b7 The Committee undertakes an annual risk review of the Policy and its operation. Identified risks are considered with appropriate mitigation strategies or tolerance levels agreed.\n- \u00b7 Regular interaction with the Audit Committee and the SSHEA Committee ensures relevant risk factors are considered when setting or assessing performance targets.\n- \u00b7 Clawback and malus provisions are in place across all incentive plans and the 'triggers' have been reviewed and strengthened.\n\n## Proportionality\n\n- \u00b7 Variable incentive pay outcomes are clearly dependent on delivering the strategy.\n- \u00b7 Performance is assessed on a broad basis, including a combination of financial, operational and sustainability which ensures there is no undue focus on a single metric which may be at the detriment of other stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 The Committee also has the discretion - which it has used - to override formulaic outcomes if they are deemed inappropriate in light of the wider performance of the Company and considering the experience of stakeholders.\n\n## Simplicity\n\n- \u00b7 Our pay arrangements include a market standard annual incentive and long-term share plan, each of which is explained in detail in our Policy.\n- \u00b7 No complex or artificial structures are required to operate the plans.\n- \u00b7 We explain our approach to pay clearly and simply.\n\n## Predictability\n\n- \u00b7 The possible reward outcomes can be easily quantified, and these are reviewed by the Committee.\n- \u00b7 The graphical illustrations provided in the Policy clearly show the potential scenarios of performance and pay outcomes which would result.\n- \u00b7 Performance is reviewed regularly so there are no surprises when performance is assessed at the end of the period.\n\n## Alignment to culture\n\n- \u00b7 At the heart of the Policy is a focus on the long-term sustainability of the business.\n- \u00b7 This reflects the whole business culture which is aligned to effective stewardship which creates value for all stakeholders.\n- \u00b7 Our incentive plans and, in particular the approach to measuring performance, reflects our values which means doing the right thing, promoting fairness at work and paying our fair share.",

Under that law they are required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards ('IFRS'), and have elected to prepare the parent Company financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law) including Financial Reporting Standard 101, 'Reduced Disclosure Framework'.\n\nUnder company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent Company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:\n\n- \u00b7 select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors and then apply them consistently;\n- \u00b7 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable, relevant and reliable;\n- \u00b7 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;\n- \u00b7 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs (and in respect of the parent Company financial statements, FRS 101) is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Group and parent Company financial position and financial performance;\n- \u00b7 in respect of the Group financial statements, state whether UK-adopted international accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;\n- \u00b7 in respect of the parent Company financial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards, including FRS 101, have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;\n- \u00b7 assess the Group and parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and\n- \u00b7 use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the Group or the parent Company, or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent Company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent Company and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.\n\nUnder applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors' Report, Directors' Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company's website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\n## Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect of the annual financial report\n\nWe confirm that to the best of our knowledge:\n\n- \u00b7 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and\n- \u00b7 the annual report, including the strategic report, includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the issuer and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\n\nWe consider the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group's position and performance, business model and strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlistair Phillips-Davies\n\nGregor Alexander\n\nChief Executive\n\nFinance Director\n\n23 May 2023\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Alternative performance measures\n\nWhen assessing, discussing and measuring the Group's financial performance, management refer to measures used for internal performance management. These measures are not defined or specified under International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS') and as such are considered to be Alternative Performance Measures ('APMs').\n\nBy their nature, APMs are not uniformly applied by all preparers including other participants in the Group's industry. Accordingly, APMs used by the Group may not be comparable to other companies within the Group's industry.\n\n## Purpose\n\nAPMs are used by management to aid comparison and assess historical performance against internal performance benchmarks and across reporting periods. These measures provide an ongoing and consistent basis to assess performance by excluding items that are materially non-recurring, uncontrollable or exceptional. These measures can be classified in terms of their key financial characteristics:\n\n- \u00b7 Profit measures allow management to assess and benchmark underlying business performance during the year. They are primarily used by operational management to measure operating profit contribution and are also used by the Board to assess performance against business plan. The Group has six profit measures, of which adjusted operating profit and adjusted profit before tax are the main focus of management through the financial year and adjusted Earnings Per Share is the main focus of management on an annual basis. In order to derive adjusted Earnings Per Share, the Group has defined adjusted operating profit, adjusted net finance costs, and adjusted current tax charge as components of the adjusted Earnings Per Share calculation. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management as a proxy for cash derived from ordinary operations of the Group.\n- \u00b7 Capital measures allow management to track and assess the progress of the Group's significant ongoing investment in capital assets and projects against their investment cases, including the expected timing of their operational deployment and also to provide a measure of progress against the Group's strategic Net Zero Acceleration Programme Plus objectives.\n- \u00b7 Debt measures allow management to record and monitor both operating cash generation and the Group's ongoing financing and liquidity position.\n\n## Changes to APMs in the year\n\nIn the year the Group has refined its profit measures for the treatment of fair value gains arising from an acquisition of a business or a joint venture interest, which generates an exceptional opening gain on acquisition. The rationale for including this adjustment to these APMs is set out in adjustment number 6.\n\nThe following section explains the key APMs applied by the Group and referred to in these statements:\n\n## Profit measures\n\n| Group APM                         | Purpose         | Closest equivalent   IFRS measure   | Adjustments to reconcile to primary financial statements

re-measurements')\n\nThis adjustment can be designated between operating and financing derivatives.\n\nOperating derivatives are contracts where the Group's Energy Portfolio Management ('EPM') function enters into forward commitments or options to buy or sell electricity, gas and other commodities to meet the future demand requirements of the Group's Business Energy and SSE Airtricity operating units, to optimise the value of the production from SSE Renewables and Thermal generation assets or to conduct other trading subject to the value at risk limits set out by the Energy Markets Risk Committee. Certain of these contracts (predominately purchase contracts) are determined to be derivative financial instruments under IFRS 9 and as such are required to be recorded at their fair value. Changes in the fair value of those commodity contracts designated as IFRS 9 financial instruments are reflected in the income statement (as part of 'certain re-measurements'). The Group shows the change in the fair value of these forward contracts separately as this mark-to-market movement is not relevant to the underlying performance of its operating segments due to the volatility that can arise on revaluation. The Group will recognise the underlying value of these contracts as the relevant commodity is delivered, which will predominantly be within the subsequent 12 to 24 months. Conversely, commodity contracts that are not financial instruments under IFRS 9 (predominately sales contracts) are accounted for as 'own use' contracts and are consequently not recorded until the commodity is delivered and the contract is settled. Gas inventory purchased by the Group's Gas Storage business for secondary trading opportunities is also held at fair value with gains and losses on re-measurement recognised as part of 'certain re-measurements' in the income statement. Finally, the mark-to-market valuation movements on the Group's contracts for difference contracts entered into by SSE Renewables that are not designated as government grants and which are measured as Level 3 fair value financial instruments are also included within 'certain re-measurements'.\n\nFinancing derivatives include all fair value and cash flow interest rate hedges, non-hedge accounted (mark-to-market) interest rate derivatives, cash flow foreign exchange hedges and non-hedge accounted foreign exchange contracts entered into by the Group to manage its banking and liquidity requirements as well as risk management relating to interest rate and foreign exchange exposures. Changes in the fair value of those financing derivatives are reflected in the income statement (as part of 'certain re-measurements'). The Group shows the change in the fair value of these forward contracts separately as this mark-to-market movement is not relevant to the underlying performance of its operating segments.\n\nThe re-measurements arising from operating and financing derivatives, and the tax effects thereof, are disclosed separately to aid understanding of the underlying performance of the Group.\n\n## 2  Exceptional items\n\nExceptional charges or credits, and the tax effects thereof, are considered unusual by nature or scale and of such significance that separate disclosure is required for the underlying performance of the Group to be properly understood. Further explanation for the classification of an item as exceptional is included in note 3.2.\n\n## 3  Adjustments to retained Gas Production decommissioning provision\n\nThe Group retains an obligation for 60% of the decommissioning liabilities of its former Gas Production business which was disposed in October 2021. The revaluation adjustments relating to these decommissioning liabilities are accounted for through the Group's consolidated income statement and are removed from the Group's adjusted profit measures as the revaluation of the provision is not considered to be part of the Group's core continuing operations.",

        "page_content": "## Alternative performance measures continued\n\n## Rationale for adjustments to profit measure continued\n\n## 4  Share of joint ventures and associates' interest and tax\n\nThis adjustment can be split between the Group's share of interest and the Group's share of tax arising from its investments in equity accounted joint ventures and associates. The Group is required to report profit before interest and tax ('operating profit') including its share of the profit after tax from its equity accounted joint ventures and associates. However, for internal performance management purposes and for consistency of treatment, SSE reports its adjusted operating profit measures before its share of the interest and/or tax on joint ventures and associates.\n\n## 5  Share of joint ventures and associates' depreciation and amortisation\n\nFor management purposes, the Group considers EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) based on a sum-of-the-parts derived metric which includes a share of the EBITDA from equity accounted investments. While this is not equal to adjusted cash generated from operating activities, it is considered useful by management in assessing a proxy for such a measure, given the complexity of the Group structure and the range of investment structures utilised. For the purpose of calculating the 'Net Debt to EBITDA' metric referred at page 89 \uf150 , 'adjusted EBITDA' is further refined to remove the proportion of adjusted EBITDA from equity-accounted joint ventures relating to off-balance sheet debt (see note 5.1(v)).\n\n## 6  Depreciation and amortisation expense on fair value uplifts\n\nThe Group's strategy includes the realisation of value (developer gains) from divestments of stakes in SSE Renewables' offshore and international developments. In addition, for strategic purposes the Group may also decide to bring in equity partners to other businesses and assets. Where SSE's interest in such vehicles changes from full to joint control, and the subsequent arrangement is classified as an equity accounted joint venture, SSE may recognise a fair value uplift on the remeasurement of its retained equity investment. Those non-cash accounting uplifts will be treated as exceptional gains in the year of the relevant transactions completing. Furthermore, SSE may acquire businesses or joint venture interests which are determined to generate an exceptional opening gain on acquisition and accordingly will record an accounting fair value uplift to the opening assets acquired. These uplifts create assets or adjustments to assets, which are depreciated or amortised over the remaining life of the underlying assets or contracts in those businesses with the charge being included in the Group's depreciation and amortisation expense. The Group's adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit before tax and adjusted Earnings Per Share are adjusted to exclude any additional depreciation, amortisation and impairment expense arising from the fair value uplifts given these charges are derived from significant one-off gains, which are treated as exceptional when initially recognised.\n\n## 7  Release of deferred income\n\nThe Group deducts the release of deferred income in the year from its adjusted EBITDA metric as it principally relates to customer contributions against depreciating assets. As the metric adds back depreciation, the income is also deducted.\n\n## 8  Interest on net pension assets/liabilities (IAS 19 'Employee Benefits')\n\nThe Group's interest income relating to defined benefit pension schemes is derived from the net assets of the schemes as valued under IAS 19. This will mean that the credit or charge recognised in any given year will be dependent on the impact of actuarial assumptions such as inflation and discount rates. The Group excludes these from its adjusted profit measures due to the non-cash nature of these charges or credits.\n\n## 9  Deferred tax\n\nThe Group adjusts for deferred tax when arriving at adjusted profit after tax, adjusted Earnings Per Share and its adjusted effective rate of tax. Deferred tax arises as a result of differences in accounting and tax bases that give rise to potential future accounting credits or charges. As the Group remains committed to its ongoing capital programme, the liabilities associated are not expected to reverse and accordingly the Group excludes these from its adjusted profit measures.\n\n## 10  Results attributable to non-controlling interest holders\n\nThe Group's structure includes non-wholly owned but controlled subsidiaries which are consolidated within the financial statements of the Group under IFRS. The most significant of those is SSEN Transmission, a 25% stake in which was divested on 30 November 2022 (see note 12.2 in the financial statements for more details of that transaction). There is no impact to disclosures for prior years but in the current year the Group has removed the share of profit attributable to holders of non-controlling equity stakes in such businesses from the point when the ownership structure changed (i.e. for SSEN Transmission, with effect from 1 December 2022) from all of its profit measures, to report all metrics based on the share of profits items attributable to the ordinary equity holders of the Group. The adjustment has been applied consistently to all of the Group's adjusted profit measures, including removing proportionate non-controlling share of operating profit and depreciation and amortisation from the Group's adjusted EBITDA metric; removing the non-controlling share of operating profit from the Group's adjusted operating profit metric; removing the non-controlling share of net finance costs from the Group's adjusted net finance costs metric; and removing the non-controlling interest share of current tax from the Group's adjusted current tax metric.\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## March 2023\n\n| Continuing  operations                                 | Reported \u00a3m   | Movement  on  derivatives \u00a3m   | Exceptional  items \u00a3m   | Adjustments to  Gas Production  decommissioning  provision \u00a3m   | Depreciation  on FV uplifts \u00a3m   | Joint   venture  interest   and tax \u00a3m   | Interest   on net  pension  asset \u00a3m   | Deferred  tax \u00a3m   | Share of  profit  attributable  to  non-  controlling  interests \u00a3m   | Adjusted \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Operating  (loss)/profit                               | (146.3)       | 2,514.3                        | 0.6                     | (50.5)                                                          | 28.8                             | 213.2                                    | -

Consequently, their coupon payments are presented within equity rather than within finance costs. As a result, the coupon payments are not included in SSE's adjusted profit before tax measure. In order to present total funding provided from sources other than ordinary shareholders, SSE presents its adjusted net debt measure inclusive of hybrid capital to better reflect the Group's funding position.\n\n## 12  Cash posted as collateral\n\nCash posted as collateral are SSE cash balances held by counterparties including trading exchanges. Collateral balances mostly represent initial and variation margin, required as part of the management of the Group's exposures on commodity contracts, that will be received on maturity of the related trades. Loans with a maturity of less than three months are also included in this adjustment. The Group includes this adjustment in order to better reflect the immediate cash resources to which it has access, which in turn better reflects the Group's funding position.\n\n## 13  Lease obligations\n\nSSE's reported loans and borrowings include lease liabilities on contracts within the scope of IFRS 16, which are not directly related to external financing of the Group. The Group excludes these liabilities from its adjusted net debt and hybrid capital measure to better reflect the Group's underlying funding position with its primary sources of capital.\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## 14  Debt and cash attributable to non-controlling interests\n\nThe Group's structure includes non-wholly owned but controlled subsidiaries which are consolidated within the financial statements of the Group under IFRS. The most significant of those is SSEN Transmission, a 25% stake in which was divested on 30 November 2022 (see note 12.2 in the financial statements for more details of that transaction). Following completion of the transaction, the Group has removed the share of external debt and cash in these subsidiaries proportionately attributable to the non-controlling interest holders from its adjusted net debt and hybrid capital metric. While legal entitlement to these items has not changed, the Group makes this adjustment to present net debt attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Group.\n\n|                                                             | March 2023 \u00a3m   | March 2022 \u00a3m   | March 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Unadjusted net debt                                         | (8,168.1)       | (8,015.4)       | (7,810.4)       |\n| Cash posted as collateral                                   | 316.3           | 74.7            | ( 3 7. 1 )      |\n| Lease obligations                                           | 405.9           | 393.5           | 421.0           |\n| External net debt attributable to non-controlling interests | 434.2           | -               | -               |\n| Adjusted Net Debt                                           | ( 7,011.7)      | (7,547.2)       | ( 7, 426. 5)    |\n| Hybrid equity                                               | (1,882.4)       | (1,051.0)       | (1,472.4)       |\n| Adjusted Net Debt and Hybrid Capital                        | (8,894.1)       | (8,598.2)       | (8,898.9)       |\n\n## Capital measures\n\n| Group APM                                                   | Purpose         | Closest equivalent IFRS measure                                            | Adjustments to reconcile to primary financial statements                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Adjusted  Investment and Capital  Expenditure               | Capital measure | Capital additions to intangible  assets and property, plant and  equipment | \u00b7  Customer funded additions \u00b7  Allowances and certificates \u00b7  Additions acquired through business combinations \u00b7  Disposed or impaired additions \u00b7  Joint ventures and associates' additions funding                                 |\n| Adjusted  Investment, Capital  and Acquisition  Expenditure | Capital measure | Capital additions to intangible  assets and property, plant and  equipment | \u00b7  Refinancing proceeds/refunds \u00b7  Customer funded additions \u00b7  Allowances and certificates \u00b7  Additions acquired through business combinations \u00b7  Disposed or impaired additions \u00b7  Joint ventures and associates' additions funding |\n\n## Adjustments to capital measures\n\n## 15  Customer funded additions\n\nCustomer funded additions represents additions to electricity and other networks funded by customer contributions. Given these are directly funded by customers, these additions have been excluded to better reflect the Group's underlying investment position.\n\n## 16  Allowances and certificates\n\nAllowances and certificates consist of purchased carbon emissions allowances and generated or purchased renewable obligations certificates (ROCs) and additions in the year are not included in the Group's 'capital expenditure and investment' APM to better reflect the Group's investment in enduring operational assets.\n\n## 17  Additions acquired through business combinations\n\nWhere the Group acquires an early-stage development company, which is classified as the acquisition of an asset, or group of assets and not the acquisition of a business, the acquisition is treated as an addition to intangible assets or property, plant and equipment and is included within 'adjusted investment and capital expenditure'. Where the Group acquires an established business or interest in an equity-accounted joint venture requiring a fair value assessment in line with the principles of IFRS 3 'Business Combinations', the fair value of acquired consolidated tangible or intangible assets are excluded from the Group's 'adjusted investment and capital expenditure', as they are not direct capital expenditure by the Group. However, the fair valuation of consideration paid for the business or investment is included in the Group's 'adjusted investment, capital and acquisition expenditure' metric, see 23 below. Please refer to note 12 for detail of the Group's acquisitions in the year.\n\n## 18  Additions subsequently disposed or impaired\n\nFor consistency of presentation, any capital additions in the year that are subsequently written-down or disposed are removed from the APM. In the prior year there were capex additions of \u00a313.9m related to the Gas Production business, which was disposed on 14 October 2021. This adjustment also includes any subsequently derecognised development expenditure.",

        "page_content": "## Alternative performance measures continued\n\n## Adjustments to capital measures continued\n\n## 19  Joint ventures and associates' additions funding\n\nJoint ventures and associates' additions included in the Group's capital measures represent the direct loan or equity funding provided by the Group to joint venture and associate arrangements in relation to capital expenditure projects. This has been included to better reflect the Group's use of directly funded equity accounted vehicles to grow the Group's asset base. Asset additions funded by project finance raised within the Group's joint ventures and associates are not included in this adjustment.\n\n## 20  Non-controlling share of capital expenditure\n\nThe Group's structure includes non-wholly owned but controlled subsidiaries which are consolidated within the financial statements of the Group under IFRS. The most significant of those is SSEN Transmission, a 25% stake in which was divested on 30 November 2022 (see note 12.2 in the financial statements for more details of that transaction). In the current year, the Group has removed the share of capital additions attributable proportionately to these equity holders from the point when the ownership structure changed (i.e. for SSEN Transmission, with effect from 1 December 2022) from its 'adjusted investment and capital expenditure' and 'adjusted investment, capital and acquisition expenditure' metrics. This is consistent with the adjustments noted elsewhere related to these non-controlling interests. This has no impact on the prior year metrics.\n\n## 21  Refinancing proceeds/refunds\n\nThe Group's model for developing large scale capital projects within joint ventures and associates involves project finance being raised within those entities. Where the Group funds early-stage capex which is then subsequently reimbursed to SSE following the receipt of project finance within the vehicle, the refinancing proceeds are included in the Group's net adjusted investment and capital expenditure metric. This is consistent with the inclusion of the initial investment in the metric as explained at 17 above. There were no refinancing proceeds in the year ended 31 March 2023. In the year ended 31 March 2022, Doggerbank windfarm reimbursed SSE for previous funding of \u00a3136.7m. In the year ended 31 March 2021, the Group received reimbursed capex of \u00a3246.1m in relation to Seagreen windfarm and \u00a3182.5m in relation to Doggerbank windfarm. These receipts have been deducted from the Group's adjusted investment and capital expenditure metric.\n\n## 22  Lease additions\n\nAdditions of right of use assets under the Group's IFRS 16 compliant policies for lease contracts are excluded from the Group's adjusted capital measures as they do not represent directly funded capital investment. This is consistent with the treatment of lease obligations explained at 13, above.\n\n## 23  Acquisition cash consideration in relation to business combinations\n\nThe Group has outlined a significant investment programme which will partly be achieved through the acquisition of businesses with development opportunities for the Group. The cash consideration paid for these entities is included within the Group's adjusted investment, capital and acquisition expenditure metric as it provides stakeholders an accurate basis of cash investment into the Group's total development pipeline and is consistent with the reporting of the Group's Net Zero Acceleration Programme Plus.\n\n|                                                                          | March 2023 \u00a3m   | March 2022  (restated*) \u00a3m   | March 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Capital additions to intangible assets                                   | 1,688.6         | 921.0                        | 701.3           |\n| Capital additions to property, plant and equipment                       | 1,500.1         | 1,392.9                      | 1,102.5         |\n| Capital additions to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment | 3,188.7         | 2,313.9                      | 1,803.8         |\n| Customer funded additions                                                | (80.9)          | (91.3)                       | (61.8)          |\n| Allowances and certificates                                              | (805.2)         | (544.5)                      | (509.0)         |\n| Additions through business combinations                                  | (515.2)         | ( 1 97. 8)                   | -               |\n| Additions subsequently disposed/impaired                                 | -               | (13.9)                       | (19.7)          |\n| Joint ventures and associates' additions                                 | 498.4           | 682.5                        | 172.7           |\n| Non-controlled interests share of capital expenditure                    | (46.7)          | -                            | -               |\n| Refinancing (proceeds)/refunds                                           | -               | (136.7)                      | (428.6)         |\n| Lease asset additions                                                    | (78.5)          | (85.7)                       | (45.4)          |\n| Adjusted Investment and Capital expenditure                              | 2,160.6         | 1,926.5                      | 912.0           |\n| Acquisition cash consideration                                           | 642.7           | 141.3                        | -               |\n| Adjusted Investment, Capital and Acquisition Expenditure                 | 2,803.3         | 2,067.8                      | 912.0           |\n\n- * The comparative Alternative Performance Measures have been restated.

See note 2.1.\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## For the year ended 31 March 2023\n\n## 1. General Information and basis of preparation\n\n## 1.1. General information\n\nSSE plc (the Company) is a company domiciled in Scotland. The address of the registered office is given on the back cover. The Group's operations and its principal activities are set out in the Strategic Report. The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023 comprise those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group). The Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about the Group, these can be seen on pages 314 to 325 \uf150 .\n\n## 1.2. Basis of preparation\n\n## Statement of compliance\n\nThe financial statements were authorised for issue by the directors on 23 May 2023. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards ('IAS').\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the period to 31 December 2024. The financial statements are therefore prepared on a going concern basis.\n\nIn addition, further details of the Group's liquidity position and going concern review are provided at note 21 and in A6 \uf150 Accompanying Information to the Financial Statements on page 276 \uf150 .\n\n## Basis of measurement\n\nThe financial statements of the Group are prepared on the historical cost basis except for certain gas inventory, derivative financial instruments, financial instruments designated at fair value through profit or loss or other comprehensive income on initial recognition, assets of the Group pension schemes, all of which are measured at their fair value, and liabilities of the Group pension schemes which are measured using the projected unit credit method. The directors believe the financial statements present a true and fair view. The financial statements of the Group are presented in pounds sterling. The basis for including operations and transactions conducted in currencies other than pounds sterling is provided in A1 \uf150 Accompanying Information to the Financial Statements on page 276 \uf150 .\n\n## Use of estimates and judgements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements conforming with adopted IFRS requires the use of certain accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise judgement in the process of applying the accounting policies. The areas involving a higher level of judgement or estimation are summarised at pages 212 to 214 \uf150 .\n\n## Changes to presentation and prior year adjustments\n\nThere have been no material changes to presentation of the financial statements in the current or prior year. The prior year comparatives at 31 March 2022 have been restated following the adoption of the amendment to IAS 16 Proceeds Before Intended Use, as disclosed in the section below 2.1.\n\n## Changes to estimates\n\nThere have been no changes to the basis of accounting estimates during the current and prior year.\n\n## 2. New accounting policies and reporting changes\n\nThe principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below and in the A1 \uf150 Accompanying Information to the Financial Statements on pages 276 to 286 \uf150 .\n\n## 2.1. New standards, amendments and interpretations effective or adopted by the Group\n\nThe Group has retrospectively adopted the amendments to 'IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment - Proceeds Before Intended Use' from the earliest period presented in these financial statements, in line with the requirements of the standard. The Group had pre-commissioning activity in the year ended 31 March 2022 and therefore has restated the comparative information presented.\n\nThe Group's Keadby 2 asset achieved its first fire in October 2021, commenced test operations in February 2022 and entered commercial operations on 15 March 2023. During the period from October 2021 to 15 March 2023 the Group received pre-commissioning revenue within the scope of the amendment to the standard which previously would have been recognised as a cost of the constructed asset. The impact of adoption of the amendment in the prior year was to increase revenue by \u00a389.0m, increase cost of sales by \u00a394.7m, increase operating costs by \u00a30.2m therefore decreasing profit before tax by \u00a35.9m, and decreasing profit after tax by \u00a34.4m. Additionally in the balance sheet, the Group's property, plant and equipment balance has been decreased by \u00a35.9m and deferred tax liability decreased by \u00a31.5m.\n\nIn the current year ended 31 March 2023, the Group has recognised pre-commissioning revenue of \u00a3245.4m and pre-commissioning costs of \u00a3226.8m related to Keadby 2. In addition, the Group holds an equity investment in Seagreen Wind Energy Limited ('Seagreen') which has been undertaking pre-commissioning testing activity during the construction of its offshore windfarm in the current financial year. The Group's share of profit recognised from joint ventures and associates in the current year includes \u00a328.9m of pre-commissioning operating costs from Seagreen.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## For the year ended 31 March 2023\n\n## 2. New accounting policies and reporting changes continued\n\n## 2.1. New standards, amendments and interpretations effective or adopted by the Group continued\n\nThe Group has adopted the amendment to 'IAS 37 Onerous Contracts - Cost of Fulfilling a Contract' in the current year. Adoption of the amendment was reflected in the calculation of the onerous provision of \u00a321.7m recognised by the Group's Business Energy segment at 30 September 2022. This provision has been released in the second half of the financial year following decreases in wholesale energy prices and therefore has no impact on amounts presented at 31 March 2023.\n\nThere were no other standards, amendments to standards or interpretations relevant to the Group's operations which were adopted during the period.\n\n## 2.2. New standards, amendments and interpretations issued, but not yet adopted by the Group\n\nA number of standards, amendments and interpretations have been issued but not yet adopted by the Group within these financial statements, because application is not yet mandatory or because UK adoption remains outstanding at the date the financial statements were authorised for issue.\n\nIFRS 17 'Insurance contracts' is effective from 1 January 2023 (1 April 2023 for the Group) following UK endorsement on 16 May 2022. Adoption of the standard is not anticipated to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group, however the Parent Company, SSE plc, enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee indebtedness of the other companies within the Group and continues to provide guarantees in respect of the disposed Contracting and Rail and Gas Production businesses. The Group is continuing to assess the impact of adoption of the standard for the Parent Company.\n\nAmendments to IAS 12 'Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction' is effective from 1 January 2023 (1 April 2023 for the Group) following UK endorsement on 15 December 2022. Adoption of the amendment is expected to result in a gross up of deferred tax assets and liabilities, but is not anticipated to have a material impact on the net deferred tax balances within the consolidated financial statements of the Group.\n\nThere are a number of other interpretations and amendments issued but not yet effective at 31 March 2023. These are not anticipated to have a material impact on the Group's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 3. Adjusted accounting measures\n\nThe Group applies the use of adjusted accounting measures or alternative performance measures ('APMs') throughout the Annual Report and Financial Statements. These measures enable the Directors to present the underlying performance of the Group and its segments to the users of the statements in a consistent and meaningful manner. The adjustments applied and certain terms such as 'adjusted operating profit', 'adjusted Earnings Per Share', 'adjusted EBITDA', 'adjusted investment and capital expenditure', 'adjusted investment, capital and acquisition expenditure' and 'adjusted net debt and hybrid capital' that are not defined under IFRS and are explained in more detail below. In addition, the section 'Alternative Performance Measures' at page 194 \uf150 provides further context and explanation of these terms.\n\n## 3.1 Adjusted measures\n\nThe Directors assess the performance of the Group and its reportable segments based on 'adjusted measures'. These measures are used for internal performance management and are believed to be appropriate for explaining underlying performance to users of the accounts. These measures are also deemed to be the most useful for ordinary shareholders of the Company and for other stakeholders.\n\nThe performance of the reportable segments is reported based on adjusted profit before interest and tax ('adjusted operating profit'). This is reconciled to reported profit before interest and tax by adding back exceptional items and certain re-measurements (see note 3.2 below), depreciation and amortisation expense on fair value uplifts, the share of operating profit attributable to non-controlling interests, adjustments to the retained Gas Production decommissioning provision and after the removal of interest and taxation on profits from equity-accounted joint ventures and associates.\n\nThe performance of the Group is reported based on adjusted profit before tax which excludes exceptional items and certain remeasurements (see note 3.2 below), depreciation and amortisation expense on fair value uplifts, the share of profit before tax attributable to non-controlling interests, the net interest costs associated with defined benefit schemes, adjustments to the retained Gas Production decommissioning provision and taxation on profits from equity-accounted joint ventures and associates. The interest charges or credits on defined benefit schemes removed are non-cash and are subject to variation based on actuarial valuations of scheme liabilities.\n\nThe Group also uses adjusted earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation ('adjusted EBITDA') as an alternative operating performance measure which acts as a management proxy for cash generated from operating activities. This does not take into account the rights and obligations that SSE has in relation to its equity-accounted joint ventures and associates. This measure excludes exceptional items and certain re-measurements (see note 3.2 below), the depreciation charged on fair value uplifts, the share of EBITDA attributable to non-controlling interests, adjustments to the retained Gas Production decommissioning provision, the net interest costs associated with defined benefit schemes, depreciation and amortisation from equity-accounted joint ventures and associates and interest and taxation on profits from equity-accounted joint ventures and associates. For the purpose of calculating the 'Net Debt to EBITDA' metric referred at page 89 \uf150 , 'adjusted EBITDA' is further adjusted to remove the proportion of adjusted EBITDA from equityaccounted joint ventures relating to off-balance sheet debt (see note 5.1(v)).\n\nThe Group's key performance measure is adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS), which is based on basic Earnings Per Share before exceptional items and certain re-measurements (see note 3.2 below), depreciation and amortisation on fair value uplifts, adjustments to the retained Gas Production decommissioning provision, the net interest costs/income associated with defined benefit schemes and after the removal of deferred taxation and other taxation items. Deferred taxation is excluded from the Group's adjusted EPS because of the Group's significant ongoing capital investment programme, which means that the deferred tax is unlikely to reverse. Adjusted profit after tax is presented on a basis consistent with adjusted EPS except for the non-inclusion of payments to holders of hybrid equity.\n\nStrategic Report\n\nDirectors' Report\n\nThe financial statements also include an 'adjusted net debt and hybrid capital' measure. This presents financing information on the basis used for internal liquidity risk management. This measure excludes obligations due under lease arrangements and the share of net debt attributable to non-controlling interests, and includes cash posted as collateral on commodity trading exchanges, and other short term loans. The measure represents the capital owed to investors, lenders and equity holders other than the ordinary shareholders. As with 'adjusted Earnings Per Share', this measure is considered to be of relevance to the ordinary shareholders of the Group as well as other stakeholders and interested parties.\n\nFinally, the financial statements include an 'adjusted investment and capital expenditure' and an 'adjusted investment, capital and acquisition expenditure' measure. These metrics represent the capital invested by the Group in projects that are anticipated to provide a return on investment over future years or which otherwise support Group operations and are consistent with internally applied metrics. They therefore include capital additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets and also the Group's direct funding of joint venture and associates capital projects. The Group has considered it appropriate to report these values both internally and externally in this manner due to its use of equity-accounted investment vehicles to grow the Group's asset base and to highlight, where the Group is providing funding to the vehicle through either loans or equity. The Group does not include project funded capital additions in these metrics, nor does it include other capital invested in joint ventures and associates. Where initial capital funding of an equity accounted joint venture is refunded, these refunds are deducted from the metrics in the year the refund is received. In addition, the Group excludes from this metric additions to its property, plant and equipment funded by Customer Contributions and additions to intangible assets associated with Allowances and Certificates. The Group also excludes the share of investment and capital expenditure attributable to non-controlling interests in controlled but not wholly owned subsidiaries, disposed or impaired additions and refinancing proceeds and refunds. The 'adjusted investment, capital and acquisition expenditure' measure also includes cash consideration paid by the Group in business combinations which contribute to growth of the Group's capital asset base and is considered to be relevant metric in context of the Group's Net Zero Acceleration Programme Plus. As with 'adjusted Earnings Per Share', these measures are considered to be of relevance to management and to the ordinary shareholders of the Group as well as to other stakeholders and interested parties.\n\nReconciliations from reported measures to adjusted measures along with further description of the rationale for those adjustments are included in the 'Adjusted Performance Measures' section at pages 194 to 201 \uf150 .\n\nAPM Where the Group have referred to an adjusted performance measure in the financial statements the following sign is presented to denote this.\n\n## 3.2 Exceptional items and certain re-measurements\n\nExceptional items are those charges or credits that are considered unusual by nature and/or scale and of such significance that separate disclosure is required for the financial statements to be properly understood. The trigger points for recognition of items as exceptional items will tend to be non-recurring although exceptional charges (or credits) may impact the same asset class or segment over time.\n\nMarket conditions that have deteriorated or improved significantly over time will only be captured to the extent observable at the balance sheet date. Examples of items that may be considered exceptional include material asset or business impairment charges, reversals of historic impairments, business restructuring costs and reorganisation costs, significant realised gains or losses on disposal, unrealised fair value adjustments on part disposal of a subsidiary or on acquisition of an investment, and provisions in relation to significant disputes and claims.\n\nThe Group operates a policy framework for estimating whether items are considered to be exceptional. This framework, which is reviewed annually, estimates the materiality of each broad set of potentially exceptional circumstances, after consideration of strategic impact and likelihood of recurrence, by reference to the Group's key performance measure of adjusted Earnings Per Share. This framework estimates that any qualifying item greater than \u00a340.0m will be considered exceptional, with lower thresholds applied to circumstances that are considered to have a greater strategic impact and are less likely to recur. The \u00a340.0m threshold was increased during the year from the previously applied limit of \u00a330.0m reflecting the increased profitability of the Group and the growth in the scale of its operations. The only exception to this threshold is for gains or losses on disposal, or divestment of early-stage SSE Renewables international or offshore wind farm development projects within SSE Renewables, which are considered non-exceptional in line with the Group's strategy to generate recurring gains from developer divestments. Where a gain arises on a non-cash transaction, the gain is treated as exceptional.\n\nCertain re-measurements are re-measurements arising on: certain commodity, interest rate and currency contracts which are accounted for as held for trading or as fair value hedges in accordance with the Group's policy for such financial instruments; remeasurements on stocks of commodities held at the balance sheet date; or movements in fair valuation of contracts for difference not designated as government grants. The amount shown in the before exceptional items and certain re-measurements results for these contracts is the amount settled in the year as disclosed in note 24.1.\n\nThis excludes commodity contracts not treated as financial instruments under IFRS 9 where held for the Group's own use requirements which are not recorded until the underlying commodity is delivered.\n\nThe impact of changes in Corporation Tax rates on deferred tax balances are also included within certain remeasurements.\n\n## 3.3 Other additional disclosures\n\nAs permitted by IAS 1 'Presentation of financial statements', the Group's income statement discloses additional information in respect of joint ventures and associates, exceptional items and certain re-measurements to aid understanding of the Group's financial performance and to present results clearly and consistently.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## For the year ended 31 March 2023\n\n## 4. Accounting judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nIn the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, management is necessarily required to make judgements and estimates that will have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. Changes in the assumptions underlying the estimates could result in a significant impact to the financial statements. The Group's key accounting judgement and estimation areas are noted below, with the most significant financial judgement areas as specifically considered by the Audit Committee being highlighted separately.\n\nThe Group has made no changes to its significant financial judgement areas since the financial year ended 31 March 2022, however the level of judgement applied in the revenue recognition judgement (see 4.1 (iii) below) has increased as a result of the introduction of customer support schemes during the year.\n\n## 4.1 Significant financial judgements and estimation uncertainties\n\nThe preparation of these financial statements has specifically considered the following significant financial judgements, some of which are also areas of estimation uncertainty as noted below.\n\n## (i) Impairment testing and valuation of certain non-current assets - financial judgement and estimation uncertainty\n\nThe Group reviews the carrying amounts of its goodwill, other intangible assets, specific property, plant and equipment and investment assets to determine whether any impairments or reversal of impairments to the carrying value of those assets requires to be recorded. Where an indicator of impairment or impairment reversal exists, the recoverable amount of those assets is determined by reference to value in use calculations or fair value less cost to sell assessments, if more appropriate. As well as its goodwill balances, the specific assets under review in the year ended 31 March 2023 are intangible development assets and specific property, plant and equipment assets related to gas storage and thermal power generation. In addition, the Group performed an impairment review over the carrying value of its equity investments in Neos Networks Limited and Triton Power Holdings Limited.\n\nIn conducting its reviews, the Group makes judgements and estimates in considering both the level of cash generating unit (CGU) at which common assets such as goodwill are assessed against, as well as the estimates and assumptions behind the calculation of recoverable amount of the respective assets or CGUs.\n\nChanges to the estimates and assumptions on factors such as regulation and legislation changes (including the Electricity Generator Levy and climate change related regulation), power, gas, carbon and other commodity prices, volatility of gas prices, plant running regimes and load factors, discount rates and other inputs could impact the assessed recoverable value of assets and CGUs and consequently impact the Group's income statement and balance sheet.\n\nFurther detail of the calculation basis and key assumptions used in the impairment review, the resulting impairment and the sensitivity of this assessment to key assumptions is disclosed at note 15. Detail on the accounting policies applied is included in the Accompanying Information section A1 \uf150 .\n\n## (ii) Retirement benefit obligations - estimation uncertainty\n\nThe assumptions in relation to the cost of providing post-retirement benefits during the year are based on the Group's best estimates and are set after consultation with qualified actuaries. While these assumptions are believed to be appropriate, a change in these assumptions would impact the level of the retirement benefit obligation recorded and the cost to the Group of administering the schemes.\n\nFurther detail of the calculation basis and key assumptions used, the resulting movements in obligations and the sensitivity of key assumptions to the obligation is disclosed at note 23.\n\n## (iii) Revenue recognition - Customers unbilled supply of energy - financial judgement and estimation uncertainty\n\nRevenue from energy supply activities undertaken by the GB Business Energy and Airtricity businesses includes an estimate of the value of electricity or gas supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end. This estimation comprises both billed revenue and unbilled revenue and is calculated based on applying the tariffs and contract rates applicable to customers against estimated customer consumption, taking account of various factors including usage patterns, tariff changes, changes to the proportion of customers on different contract types, levels of unread meters, weather trends and externally notified aggregated volumes supplied to customers from national settlements bodies. During the year both of the Group's Supply businesses have administered government backed customer support schemes, where the Group provides discounts to customers based on estimated usage and recovers amounts from government based on actual customer usage. The administration of these support schemes has increased the complexity and level of estimation uncertainty of the Group's unbilled calculations. The most material support scheme administered by the Group in the year was the Energy Bills Relief Scheme ('EBRS') within the GB Business Energy business. The accounting policy for customer support schemes and the balances claimed from government is explained at A1.2 \uf150 .\n\nThis unbilled estimation is subject to an internal corroboration process which compares calculated unbilled volumes to a theoretical 'perfect billing' benchmark measure of unbilled volumes (in GWh and millions of therms) derived from historical weather-adjusted consumption patterns and aggregated metering data used in industry reconciliation processes. Furthermore, actual meter readings and billings continue to be compared to unbilled estimates between the balance sheet date and the finalisation of the financial statements. The estimation of the government receivable included within the Group's unbilled revenue accrual is based on claimed and unclaimed values based on the same customer consumption detail and derived from consideration of tariffs applied to customers, metered and estimated volumes and other factors. The EBRS claims submitted by SSE will be audited by the UK government and are subject to volumetric risk as estimated consumption data is replaced by actual metered data over the 14 month electricity industry reconciliation period. The value of outstanding EBRS claims recognised at 31 March 2023 was \u00a3326.6m, which includes a risk provision of \u00a315.1m related to amounts where the Group has provided the discount to the customer but has assessed that it will be unable to recover the amount from the government during the open claim window.\n\nStrategic Report\n\nDirectors' Report\n\nGiven the non-routine process, the number and the extent of differing inputs and the requirement of management to apply judgement noted above, the estimated revenue is considered a significant estimate made by management in preparing the financial statements. A change in the assumptions underpinning the unbilled calculation would have an impact on the amount of revenue recognised in any given period. The sensitivity associated with this judgement factor is disclosed at note 18.\n\n## (iv) Valuation of other receivables - financial judgement and estimation uncertainty\n\nThe Group holds a \u00a3100m loan note due from Ovo Energy Limited following the disposal of SSE Energy Services on 15 January 2020. The loan is repayable in full by 31 December 2029, carries interest at 13.25% and is presented cumulative of accrued interest payments, discounted at 13.25%. At 31 March 2023, the carrying value (net of expected credit loss provision of \u00a31.5m (2022: \u00a31.8m)) is \u00a3149.5m (2022: \u00a3131.0m).\n\nThe Group has assessed recoverability of the loan note receivable and has recognised a provision for expected credit loss in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9. Due to previous energy supplier failures and recent market volatility, the Group's assessment of the recoverability of the loan note is considered a significant financial judgement. The Group has taken appropriate steps to assess all available information in respect of the recoverability of the loan note. Procedures included reviewing recent financial information of Ovo Energy Limited, including the 31 December 2021 statutory financial statements; considering available Government support schemes; and discussions with Ovo management. While the carrying value is considered to be appropriate, changes in economic conditions could lead to a change in the expected credit loss incurred by the Group in future periods.\n\n## (v) Impact of climate change and the transition to net zero - financial judgement and estimation uncertainty\n\nClimate change and the transition to net zero have been considered in the preparation of these financial statements. Where relevant assumptions have been applied that are consistent to a Paris-aligned 1.5\u00b0C 2050 net zero pathway. The Group has a clearly articulated Net Zero Acceleration Programme Plus ('NZAP Plus') set out on pages 16 to 17 \uf150 to lead in the UK's transition to net zero and aligns its investment plans and business activities to that strategy. These plans are supported by the Group's Green Bond framework under which the fifth green bond was issued in July 2022 (see note 21). The proceeds of the fifth green bond were allocated to fund Renewables' wind projects.\n\nThe impact of future climate change regulation could have a material impact on the currently reported amounts of the Group's assets and liabilities. In preparing these financial statements, the following climate change related risks have been considered:\n\n## Valuation of property, plant and equipment, and impairment assessment of goodwill\n\nIn the medium term, the transition to net zero may result in regulation restricting electricity generation from unabated gas fired power stations. The Group's view is that flexible generation capacity, such as the Group's fleet of CCGT power stations, will be an essential part of the net zero transition in order to provide security of supply to a market which is increasingly dependent upon renewable sources, which are inherently intermittent. The majority of the Group's GB CCGT fleet is nearing the end of its economic life and it is not currently expected that regulation to require abatement would be introduced before the planned closure of most of those power stations. Of the net book value held at 31 March 2023, only four assets are forecast to continue to operate beyond 2030 being: Great Island; Keadby 2; Marchwood (which is operated by SSE under a lease); and Saltend Power Station within the Triton joint venture. The Group's view is that Great Island will continue to be essential to providing security of supply in the Irish electricity market. Keadby 2 commenced commercial operation on 15 March 2023 and has an efficiency of around 63% making it the most efficient plant of its type in the UK and Europe. Work is also underway to explore how to decarbonise Keadby 2 further with the potential to blend hydrogen into the plant. Marchwood is a 50% equity accounted joint venture and is considered one of the most efficient CCGTs in the UK. Saltend was acquired as part of Triton Power 50% equity accounted joint venture and supports the long-term decarbonisation of the UK's power system, and also contributes to security of supply and grid stability. Initial steps are underway at Saltend, targeting abatement by 2027 through blending up to 30% of low-carbon hydrogen. Therefore, the Group considers that other assets operating in the market would be more likely to close before Keadby 2, Marchwood and Saltend and the plants will continue to be required to balance the UK electricity market beyond 2030. As a result, the useful economic life of the four assets have not been shortened when preparing the 31 March 2023 financial statements. The Group assesses the useful economic life of its property, plant and equipment assets annually. In the short term, the economic return from the activity provided by the Group's Great Island CCGT asset has increased, resulting in the reversal of historic impairments at 31 March 2023 (see note 15.2).\n\nA significant increase in renewable generation capacity in the Group's core markets in the UK and Ireland could potentially result in an oversupply of renewable electricity at a point in the future, which would lead to a consequential decrease in the power price achievable for the Group's wind generation assets. The Group has not assessed that this constitutes an indicator of impairment at 31 March 2023 as the Group's baseline investment case models assume a centrally approved volume of new build in these markets over the life of the existing assets. The Group's policy is to test the goodwill balances associated with its wind generation portfolio for impairment on an annual basis in line with the requirements of IAS 36. Through this impairment assessment (see note 15.1), a sensitivity to power price, which may arise in a market with significant new build, was modelled. This scenario indicated that, despite a modelled 10% reduction in power price, there remained significant headroom on the carrying value in the Group's wind generation assets.\n\nChanges to weather patterns resulting from global warming have also been considered as a potential risk to future returns from the Group's wind and hydro assets. Changes to weather patterns could result in calmer, drier weather patterns, which would reduce volumes achievable for the Group's wind and hydro generation assets (although noting that this would likely lead to capacity constraints and hence higher prices). This has not been assessed as an indicator of impairment for operating assets in the UK and Ireland at 31 March 2023, as there is no currently observable evidence to support that scenario directly. The Group has performed a sensitivity to its impairment modelling and has assessed that an 8% reduction in achievable volume would result in significant headroom on the carrying value of the UK and Ireland assets at 31 March 2023 (see note 15.1). The TCFD physical risk scenarios modelled a 4% to 8% change in average mean wind speeds in the longer term across the wind portfolio, consistent with the impairment sensitivity performed.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued For the year ended 31 March 2023\n\n## 4. Accounting judgements and estimation uncertainty continued\n\n## 4.1 Significant financial judgements and estimation uncertainties continued\n\n(v) Impact of climate change and the transition to net zero - financial judgement and estimation uncertainty continued Valuations of decommissioning provisions\n\nThe Group holds decommissioning provisions for its Renewable and Thermal generation assets and has retained a 60% share for the decommissioning of its disposed Gas Production business. As noted above, the Group's view at 31 March 2023 is that climate change regulation will not bring forward the closure dates of its CCGT fleet, many of which are expected to close before 2030. Similarly, it is expected that fundamental changes to weather patterns, or the impact of new wind generation capacity will not bring forward the decommissioning of the Group's wind farm portfolio.\n\nThe discounted share of the Gas Production provision is \u00a3201.4m (2022: \u00a3249.4m). At 31 March 2023, the impact of discounting of this retained provision is \u00a364.5m (2022: \u00a333.8m), which is expected to be incurred across the period to 31 March 2037. If the decommissioning activity was accelerated due to changes in legislation, the costs of unwinding the discounting of the provision would be recognised earlier.\n\n## Defined Benefit scheme assets\n\nThe Group holds defined benefit pension scheme assets at the 31 March 2023 which could be impacted by climate-related risks. The Trustees of the schemes have a long term investment strategy that seeks to reduce investment risk as and when appropriate and takes into consideration the impact of climate-related risk.\n\n## Going concern and viability statement\n\nThe implications of near term climate-related risks have been considered in the Group's going concern assessment and viability statement assessment.\n\n## 4.2 Accounting judgements and estimation uncertainties - changes from prior year\n\nThe Group has made no changes to accounting judgements and estimation uncertainties from those presented in the Group's 2022 Annual Report \uf150 .\n\n## 4.3 Other areas of estimation uncertainty\n\n## (i) Tax provisioning\n\nThe Group has open tax disputes with the tax authorities in the UK. Where management makes a judgement that an outflow of funds is probable, and a reliable estimate of the dispute can be made, provision is made for the best estimate of the most likely liability.\n\nIn estimating any such liability, the Group applies a risk-based approach, taking into account the specific circumstances of each dispute based on management's interpretation of tax law and supported, where appropriate, by discussion and analysis by external tax advisors. These estimates are inherently judgemental and could change substantially over time as disputes progress and new facts emerge. Provisions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, however the resolution of tax issues can take a considerable period of time to conclude and it is possible that amounts ultimately paid will be different from the amounts provided.\n\nIn the financial statements to 31 March 2023, the Group has no provision for uncertain tax positions included in current tax liabilities (2022: \u00a327.9m). The provision held by the Group at 31 March 2022 related to the Group's case concerning the availability of capital allowances on Glendoe Hydro Electric Station. This case was heard at the Supreme Court on 23 March 2023 and a final decision on the case was released on 17 May 2023. This decision upheld SSE's position in relation to the dispute and accordingly the provision held has been released as an adjusting post balance sheet event and a related deferred tax liability of \u00a323.4m in relation to the associated capital allowances has been recognised. The Group has no other open tax positions against which a provision has required to be recognised.\n\n## (ii) Decommissioning costs\n\nThe calculation of the Group's decommissioning provisions involves the estimation of quantum and timing of cash flows to settle the obligation. The Group engages independent valuation experts to estimate the cost of decommissioning its Renewable, Thermal and Gas Storage assets every three years based on current technology and prices. The last independent assessment for the majority of the Group's Renewable and Thermal generation assets was performed in the year to 31 March 2022. A formal assessment for Gas Storage assets was performed in the year to 31 March 2023. Retained decommissioning costs in relation to the disposed Gas Production business are periodically agreed with the field operators and reflect the latest expected economic production lives of the fields.\n\nThe dates for settlement of future decommissioning costs are uncertain, particularly for the disposed gas exploration and production business where reassessment of gas and liquids reserves and fluctuations in commodity prices can lengthen or shorten the field life.\n\nDuring the year, the carrying value of the Group's decommissioning provisions have decreased by \u00a3228m due to provision reassessments, increases in discount rate and decreases in inflation assumptions since 31 March 2022. With the exception of the decrease of \u00a348.1m to the provision relating to Gas Production activities, movements on which are recorded in the income statement, all revaluation movements have been matched by an offsetting adjustment to an associated decommissioning asset.\n\nFurther detail on the assumptions applied, including expected decommissioning dates, and movement in decommissioning costs during the year are disclosed at note 20.\n\nStrategic Report\n\nDirectors' Report\n\n## 5.

SSE has retained an obligation for 60% of the decommissioning liabilities of the disposed  business as part of the transaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Gas  Distribution       | SGN                                 | SSE's share of Scotia Gas Networks, which operates two economically regulated gas distribution  networks in Scotland and the South of England. The revenue earned from transportation of natural  gas to customers was recognised based on the volume of gas distributed to those customers and   the set customer tariff. This investment was disposed of in the financial year to 31 March 2022 and  accordingly is noted here in relation to the comparative information for that year.                                                                                                                                                                       |\n\nAs referred to in note 3, the internal measure of profit used by the Board is 'adjusted profit before interest and tax' or 'adjusted operating profit' which is arrived at before exceptional items, the impact of financial instruments measured under IFRS 9, share of profits attributable to non-controlling interests, the net interest costs/income associated with defined benefit pension schemes, adjustments to the retained Gas Production decommissioning and after the removal of taxation and interest on profits from joint ventures and associates.\n\nAnalysis of revenue, operating profit, assets and earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation ('EBITDA') by segment is provided on the following pages. All revenue and profit before taxation arise from operations within the UK and Ireland.\n\n## 5.1 Segmental information disclosure\n\n## (i) Revenue by segment\n\n|                                           | Reported  revenue 2023 \u00a3m   | Inter-segment  revenue (i) 2023 \u00a3m   | Segment  revenue 2023 \u00a3m   | Reported  revenue (restated*) 2022 \u00a3m   | Inter-segment  revenue (i) 2022 \u00a3m   | Segment  revenue (restated*) 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Continuing operations                     |                             |                                      |                            |                                         |                                      |                                        |\n| SSEN Transmission                         | 656.1                       | -

Contract related assets and liabilities principally arose in the Distributed Energy reporting segment with changes during the periods reflecting ongoing contract progress, offset by cash receipts or customer invoicing.\n\nThe Group has not disclosed information related to the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations on the basis that the Group's contracts either have an original expected duration of less than one year, or permit the Group to recognise revenue as invoiced.\n\nRevenue by geographical location on continuing operations is as follows:\n\n|         | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 (restated*) \u00a3m   |\n|---------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| UK      | 10,899.8  | 7, 381.1              |\n| Ireland | 1,590.9   | 1,316.1               |\n|         | 12,490.7  | 8,697.2               |\n\nStrategic Report\n\nDirectors' Report\n\n## (ii) Operating profit/(loss) by segment\n\n|                            | 2023                                                       | 2023                                    | 2023                                         | 2023                                                           | 2023                           | 2023                                                         | 2023                                                | 2023      |\n|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n|                            | Adjusted  operating  profit  reported to  the Board APM \u00a3m | Depreciation  on fair value  uplifts \u00a3m | JV/Associate  share of  interest and  tax \u00a3m | Adjustments  to Gas  Production  decommissioning  provision \u00a3m | Non- controlling  interests \u00a3m | Before  exceptional  items and  certain  re- measurements \u00a3m | Exceptional  items and certain  re- measurements \u00a3m | Total \u00a3m  |\n| Continuing operations      |                                                            |                                         |                                              |                                                                |                                |                                                              |                                                     |           |\n| SSEN Transmission          | 372.7                                                      | -

Capital additions to intangible assets includes the cash purchase of emissions allowances and certificates (2023: \u00a3596.8m; 2022: \u00a3350.8m). These purchases are presented in the cash flow statement within operating activities since they relate to the obligation to surrender the allowances and certificates in line with operating volumes of emissions. Other non-cash additions comprise self-generated renewable obligation certificates.\n\nNo segmental analysis of assets requires to be disclosed as this information is not presented to the Board.",

Exceptional items and certain re-measurements continued\n\n## 7.1 Exceptional items\n\n## Exceptional items in the year ended 31 March 2023\n\nIn the year to 31 March 2023, the Group recognised a net exceptional charge of \u00a30.4m arising from its continuing operations. The net exceptional charge is primarily due to a net impairment of \u00a3150.9m in relation to the Group's 50% investment in Triton Power Holdings Limited (see note 7.1.iv below for further analysis of amounts recognised in relation to Triton), offset by an exceptional gain of \u00a389.1m from the sale of land at Fiddler's Ferry, an impairment reversal of \u00a345.7m related to the Group's Gas Storage operations at Aldbrough and an impairment reversal of \u00a317.8m in relation to the Group's Great Island combine cycle gas turbine ('CCGT') plant in Ireland.\n\nIn discontinued operations, the Group recognised an exceptional gain of \u00a335.0m relating to a provision release associated with the disposal of its Gas Production assets, which completed on 14 October 2021.\n\nThe net exceptional charges/(credits) recognised can be summarised as follows:\n\n|                                                  | Property, plant  and equipment  (note 14) \u00a3m   | Provisions and  other charges \u00a3m   | Investment in  joint ventures  \u00a3m   | Cash and cash  equivalents \u00a3m   | Other  receivables \u00a3m   | Total charges/ (credits) \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Thermal Electricity Generation (i)               | (17.8)                                         | -                                  | -                                   | -                               | -                       | (17.8)                        |\n| Gas storage (ii)                                 | (45.7)                                         | -                                  | -                                   | -                               | -                       | (45.7)                        |\n| Fiddler's Ferry (iii)                            | 24.1                                           | (53.2)                             | -                                   | (60.0)                          | -                       | (89.1)                        |\n| Triton Power 50% joint venture (iv)              | -                                              | -                                  | 150.9                               | -                               | -                       | 150.9                         |\n| Neos Networks (v)                                | -                                              | -                                  | 5.9                                 | -                               | -                       | 5.9                           |\n| Other credits (vi)                               | -                                              | (1.5)                              | -                                   | (2.1)                           | (0.2)                   | (3.8)                         |\n| Total exceptional items continuing  operations   | (39.4)                                         | (54.7)                             | 156.8                               | (62.1)                          | (0.2)                   | 0.4                           |\n| Gas Production (vii)                             | -                                              | (35.0)                             | -                                   | -                               | -                       | (35.0)                        |\n| Total exceptional items discontinued  operations | -                                              | (35.0)                             | -                                   | -                               | -                       | (35.0)                        |\n| Total exceptional items                          | (39.4)                                         | (89.7)                             | 156.8                               | (62.1)                          | (0.2)                   | (34.6)                        |\n\n## (i) Thermal Electricity Generation - impairment reversal\n\nAt 31 March 2023, the Group has carried out a formal impairment review to reassess the carrying value of its GB CCGT power stations and the Group's Great Island CCGT plant in Ireland (see note 15.2). As a result of the review, the Group has recognised an exceptional impairment reversal of \u00a317.8m to the carrying value of the Group's Great Island CCGT plant.\n\n## (ii) Gas Storage - impairment reversal\n\nAt 30 September 2022, the Group recognised an impairment reversal of \u00a3201.1m reflecting future market price assumptions at that time. The Group performed a formal impairment review at 31 March 2023 to reassess the carrying value of its Gas Storage operations at Atwick and Aldbrough (see note 15.2). As a result of the assessment, the Group has recognised an exceptional impairment of \u00a3155.4m to the carrying value of the assets at Aldbrough, resulting in a net impairment reversal of \u00a345.7m. The impairment previously recognised in relation to Atwick was fully reversed in the year ended 31 March 2022, and no impairment is required for the current financial year.\n\n## (iii) Fiddler's Ferry land sale\n\nOn 30 June 2022, the Fiddlers Ferry site was sold to Peel NRE Developments Limited for cash consideration of \u00a360.0m. The Group carried a decommissioning provision for the site of \u00a353.2m and a residual asset of \u00a324.1m, both of which were disposed of as part of the sale. As a result, the Group has recognised an exceptional gain of \u00a389.1m on disposal.\n\n## (iv) Triton Power 50% joint venture acquisition and impairment\n\nOn 1 September 2022, the Group acquired 50% of the share capital of Triton Power Holdings Limited from Energy Capital Partners for total consideration of \u00a3341.0m (see note 12). The purchase price of \u00a3341.0m was agreed based on prices prevalent in the market during the summer, prior to completion of the transaction on 1 September 2022. The Group assessed that, due to movements in near term market observable power prices between the transaction agreement date and the completion date, the fair value of the acquisition was \u00a3140.7m greater than the acquisition price. This bargain purchase was recognised as an exceptional gain in the Group's half year results to 30 September 2022. During the second half of the year, the Group realised a significant proportion of the acquired fair value of the business through trading operations of the joint venture. As a result, the future recoverable value of the business is lower at 31 March 2023 than at 1 September 2022 and the Group has therefore recognised an impairment charge at 31 March 2023 of \u00a3291.6m (see note 15.2).\n\nStrategic Report\n\nDirectors' Report\n\nA summary of exceptional items recognised in relation to Triton since the 50% acquisition on 1 September 2022 is set out below:\n\n|                                                                  | Financial statement line item   charge/(credit) is included within   | Exceptional items  and certain  re-measurements  \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| Recognition of bargain purchase                                  | Joint venture and associates share of profit                         | (140.7)                                               |\n| Impairment of investment                                         | Operating costs                                                      | 291.6                                                 |\n| Total exceptional items                                          |                                                                      | 150.9                                                 |\n| Mark-to-market movement on operating derivatives                 | Joint venture and associates share of  movement on derivatives       | (213.9)                                               |\n| Share of tax on mark-to-market movement on operating derivatives | Joint venture and associates share of tax                            | 41.9                                                  |\n| Total certain remeasurements                                     |                                                                      | (172.0)                                               |\n| Total exceptional items and certain remeasurements               |                                                                      | (21.1)                                                |\n\n## (v) Neos Networks - investment impairment and adjustments to consideration\n\nAt 31 March 2023, the Group has assessed that the recoverable amount of its investment in Neos Networks has been impaired by \u00a337.7m, of which \u00a35.9m has been treated as exceptional. Under the Group's policy, an impairment charge of less than \u00a340m is not considered to be an exceptional item. However, \u00a35.9m of the impairment relates to the fair value gain previously recognised on acquisition of the joint venture investment in March 2019, which had been previously treated as an exceptional item. Therefore, for consistent presentation, this reversal has been recognised separately. The balance of the impairment charge, being \u00a331.8m, has been recognised as part of adjusted operating profit. See note 15 for further details of this impairment.\n\n## (vi) Other credits\n\nAt 31 March 2023, the Group recognised further exceptional credits of \u00a33.8m relating to reversal of previously recognised exceptional charges or judgements. These included i) reassessment of separation cost provisions associated primarily with the disposals of SSE Energy Services and SGN (credit of \u00a39.7m) ii) credit of \u00a30.2m in relation to the unwind of discounting on deferred consideration recognised on the part disposal of SSE Slough Multifuel Limited in the year ending 31 March 2021, iii) reassessment of impairments associated with Heat Networks assets credit of \u00a30.4m, partially offset by iv) \u00a36.5m charge recognised in relation to provisions in connection with the sale of the Contracting and Rail business in June 2021.\n\n## Exceptional items within discontinued operations in the year ended 31 March 2023\n\n## (vii) Gas Production - gain on disposal\n\nOn 4 November 2022, RockRose Energy Limited received HMRC clearance in respect of tax treatment in relation to the Group's disposal of its Gas Production business to Viaro Energy (through its subsidiary RockRose Energy Limited), which completed on 14 October 2021. The Group had indemnified RockRose Energy Limited in relation to certain tax liabilities that it might suffer as a result of the transaction, and this formed part of the provision which was recognised on the disposal of the Gas Production business. The HMRC clearance indicated that no such tax liabilities arise for RockRose Energy Limited and as a result the Group has released \u00a335.0m of provision relating to the indemnity as an adjustment to the loss on disposal recognised. The adjustment is recognised in discontinued operations in the year ended 31 March 2023.\n\n## Exceptional items in the year ended 31 March 2022\n\nIn the year to 31 March 2022, the Group recognised a net exceptional credit of \u00a3305.0m arising from its continuing operations. The net exceptional credit was primarily due to impairment reversals of \u00a3331.5m in relation to the Group's GB CCGT power stations and the Group's Great Island CCGT plant in Ireland and impairment reversals of \u00a397.3m related to the Group's Gas Storage operations at Atwick and Aldbrough. These credits were offset by an impairment loss of \u00a3106.9m recognised in relation to the Group's investment in Neos Networks, a further \u00a318.9m loss was recognised on completion of the disposal of SSE Contracting on 30 June 2021 and \u00a36.2m consideration adjustment associated with the disposal of the Group's 50% stake in Neos Networks, which completed in the year ended 31 March 2019.\n\nIn discontinued operations, the Group recognised an exceptional gain on the disposal of the Group's 33.3% investment in SGN of \u00a3576.5m, offset by an exceptional charge of \u00a3120.8m associated with the disposal of its Gas Production assets, which completed on 14 October 2021.",

This represented a full impairment reversal for the CCGT plants at Peterhead, Marchwood, Keadby and Medway and a partial reversal for Great Island.\n\n## (ii) Gas Storage - impairment reversals\n\nAt 31 March 2022, the Group reversed historic impairments of \u00a397.3m related to its Gas Storage operations at Atwick and Aldbrough (see note 15.2).\n\n## (iii) SSE Contracting - loss on disposal\n\nOn 30 June 2021, the Group recorded a further impairment charge of \u00a318.9m following the completion of the sale of its Contracting and Rail business to the Aurelius Group. This impairment was recognised in addition to the exceptional impairment loss of \u00a351.2m recognised during the year ended 31 March 2021.\n\n## (iv) Neos Networks - investment impairment and adjustments to consideration\n\nAt 31 March 2022, the Group assessed that the value of its investment in Neos Networks was impaired by \u00a3106.9m (see note 15.2). In the year ended 31 March 2022, the Group also reassessed its position relating to the original disposal of a 50% stake in the business on 31 March 2019 with the net impact being the recognition of an exceptional charge of \u00a36.2m.\n\n## (v) Other credits\n\nAt 31 March 2022, the Group recognised further exceptional credits of \u00a38.1m relating to reversal of previously recognised exceptional charges or judgements. These included (i) reassessment of impairments associated with Heat Networks assets credit of \u00a30.6m, (ii) credit of \u00a33.2m in relation the unwind of discounting on deferred consideration recognised on the part disposal of SSE Slough Multifuel Limited in the year ending 31 March 2021, (iii) credit of \u00a34.3m in relation to a gain on disposal of historically impaired land at Seabank.\n\n## Exceptional items within discontinued operations in the year ended 31 March 2022\n\n## (vi) SGN disposal gain\n\nOn 2 August 2021, the Group announced it had agreed to sell its 33.3% investment in SGN to a consortium comprising existing SGN shareholders Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board and Brookfield Super-Core Infrastructure Partners for cash consideration of \u00a31,225m. The transaction completed on 22 March 2022, with the Group recognising an exceptional gain on disposal of \u00a3576.5m. See note 12.2 for further information.\n\n## (vii) Gas Production - impairment loss\n\nThe Group recorded an exceptional impairment of \u00a3120.8m prior to the sale of its Gas Production assets and liabilities to RockRose Energy Limited on 14 October 2021. The impairment was recognised to reduce the carrying value of the assets and liabilities to their fair value less costs to sell.\n\nStrategic Report\n\nDirectors' Report\n\n## Exceptional items in the year ended 31 March 2021\n\nIn the year to 31 March 2021, the Group recognised a net exceptional credit of \u00a3850.3m in its continuing operations. The net exceptional credit was primarily due to gains on disposal of the Group's stakes in Ferrybridge Multifuel (\u00a3669.9m), Walney offshore windfarm (\u00a3188.7m) and Maple SmartMeterCo (\u00a370.4m) investments. In addition, the Group reversed \u00a326.1m of prior year exceptional provisions for bad debt arising from coronavirus and recorded exceptional gains following the fair value uplift of its retained stakes in SSE Slough Multifuel Limited (\u00a321.3m) and Seagreen Holdco 1 Limited (\u00a325.7m). These exceptional credits were offset by an impairment to the Group's Great Island Thermal CCGT plant of \u00a358.1m and a write down of \u00a351.2m to SSE Contracting, which represented the fair value less costs to sell. Finally, the Group incurred \u00a324.2m of further charges related to the disposal of SSE Energy Services which was completed in 2020 and reduced the overall gain on disposal, completed in the year ended 31 March 2019, of Neos Networks Limited by \u00a321.8m.\n\nThe net exceptional charges/(credits) recognised can be summarised as follows:\n\n|                                    | Property, plant  and equipment  \u00a3m   | Intangible assets  \u00a3m   | Provisions and  other charges \u00a3m   | Trade  receivables \u00a3m   | Other  receivables \u00a3m   | Total charges/ (credits) \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Thermal Electricity Generation     | 58.1                                 | -                       | -                                  | -                       | -                       | 58.1                          |\n| Customer bad debt provisioning     | -                                    | -                       | -                                  | (26.1)                  | -                       | (26.1)                        |\n| SSE Contracting                    | -                                    | -                       | 51.2                               | -                       | -                       | 51.2                          |\n| SSE Energy Services disposal costs | 15.1                                 | 5.2                     | 3.9                                | -                       | -                       | 24.2                          |\n| Neos Networks                      | -                                    | -                       | 20.2                               | -                       | 1.6                     | 21.8                          |\n| Other charges                      | (1.9)                                | -                       | -                                  | -                       | (1.6)                   | (3.5)                         |\n| Disposal gains                     | -                                    | -                       | -                                  | -                       | (976.0)                 | (976.0)                       |\n| Total exceptional items            | 71.3                                 | 5.2                     | 75.3                               | (26.1)                  | (976.0)                 | (850.3)                       |\n\n## 7.2 Certain re-measurements\n\nThe Group, through its EPM business, enters into forward commodity purchase (and sales) contracts to meet the future demand requirements of its Business Energy and SSE Airtricity supply businesses, to optimise the value of its SSE Renewables and SSE Thermal power generation assets or to conduct other trading subject to the value at risk limits set out by the Energy Markets Risk Committee. Certain of these contracts (predominately electricity, gas and other commodity purchase contracts) are determined to be derivative financial instruments under IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' and as such are required to be recorded at their fair value. Conversely, commodity contracts that are not financial instruments under IFRS 9 (predominately electricity sales contracts) are accounted for as 'own use' contracts and are not recorded at their fair value. Inventory purchased to utilise excess capacity ahead of an optimised sale in the market by the Gas Storage business is held as trading inventory at fair value with changes in value recognised within 'certain re-measurements'. In addition, the mark-to-market valuation movements on the Group's contracts for difference contracts entered into by SSE Renewables that are not designated as government grants and which are measured as Level 3 fair value financial instruments are also included within 'certain re-measurements'.\n\nChanges in the fair value of those commodity contracts designated as financial instruments and trading inventory are therefore reflected in the income statement. The Group shows the change in the fair value of these forward contracts and trading inventory separately as 'certain re-measurements', as the Group does not believe this mark-to-market movement is relevant to the underlying performance of its businesses.\n\nAt 31 March 2023, volatility in global commodity markets and changes in SSE's contractual positions have resulted in a significantly adverse mark-to-market remeasurement on commodity contracts (predominately power purchases) designated as financial instruments and trading inventory of \u00a32,717.2m (2022: \u00a32,097.8m gain). It should be noted that the net IFRS 9 position on operating derivatives at 31 March 2023 is a liability of \u00a3386.9m (2022: \u00a32,301.8m asset).\n\nIn addition, the Group has executory 'own use' designated commodity contracts which, if classified as financial instruments and remeasured at fair value in accordance with IFRS 9, would significantly increase the total fair value remeasurement and closing liability value. These predominately relate to financial hedges entered into on behalf of the SSE Renewables and SSE Thermal businesses for future sales which were entered into before the subsequent increase in market prices. A significant proportion of 'in the money' mark-to-market contracts recorded at 31 March 2023 and unvalued 'own use' designated commodity contracts are expected to reverse in the next financial year as the relevant commodity is delivered. The remaining settlement of these contracts will predominately be within the subsequent 12 to 24 months. The mark-to-market loss in the year has resulted in a deferred tax credit of \u00a3499.6m (2022: \u00a3408.0m), which has also been classified as exceptional. In addition, the Group has recognised gains of \u00a3201.9m (2022: \u00a321.0m) on the remeasurement of the certain interest rate and foreign exchange contracts through the income statement, gains on the remeasurement of cash flow hedge accounted contracts of \u00a343.3m (2022: \u00a322.9m) in other comprehensive income and gains on the equity share of the remeasurement of cash flow hedge accounted contracts in joint ventures of \u00a3342.4m (2022: \u00a3181.4m).\n\nThe re-measurements arising from IFRS 9 and the associated deferred tax are disclosed separately to aid understanding of the underlying performance of the Group.",

Exceptional items and certain re-measurements continued\n\n## 7.3 Change in UK corporation tax rates\n\nThe Government announced in the Budget on 3 March 2021 that the main rate of corporation tax will increase to 25% for the financial year beginning 1 April 2023. Prior to this date, the rate of corporation tax will remain at 19%. The increase to 25% was substantively enacted at 24 May 2021 and therefore the deferred tax balances were re-measured at 31 March 2022. The rate change resulted in an income statement charge for continuing operations of \u00a3244.7m at 31 March 2022 and an increase to the Group\u203as deferred tax liabilities (including the effect of equity accounted items) of \u00a3279.5m at 31 March 2022. The impact of the rate change on the Group's share of profits of its equity accounted investments was a charge of \u00a333.2m at 31 March 2022 for continuing operations and a charge of \u00a385.5m for discontinued operations at 31 March 2022.\n\nFinance Bill 2021 also included draft legislation in respect of Capital Allowance 'Super-deductions' of 130% in respect of General Pool plant and machinery, alongside First Year Allowances of 50% for Special Rate Pool plant and machinery for the two years commencing 1 April 2021. The Group expects these changes, which were substantively enacted on 24 May 2021, to significantly increase the deduction for Capital Allowances in the financial years ending 31 March 2022 and 31 March 2023. An estimate of the super-deduction has been taken into account when calculating the effective tax for the current year and prior year. Finance Bill 2023 introduced draft legislation, effective from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2026, to allow 'Full Expensing' of 100% General Pool plant and machinery, alongside 50% for Special Rate Pool plant and machinery. The Group expects these changes to significantly increase the deductions for Capital Allowances in the financial years ending 31 March 2024 to 31 March 2026.\n\nFinance Bill 2023 also introduced draft legislation in respect of Multinational Top-up Tax in line with OECD BEPS pillar 2 principles.

As a consequence, these financial statements include a number of areas of enhanced disclosure which have been provided in order to develop stakeholder understanding of the tax the Group pays and the reported total taxation charge along with additional commentary on the main reconciling items.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThese can be seen at section A2 \uf150\n\n.\n\nIn 2022 SSE became the first UK-based multinational business to be accredited under Fair Tax Foundation's new Global Multinational Standard.\n\nThe majority of the Group's profits are earned in the UK, with the standard rate of UK corporation tax being 19% for the year to 31 March 2023 (2022: 19%). The Group's disposed Gas Production business, which was included within discontinued operations for the year ended 31 March 2022, was taxed at a UK corporation tax rate of 30% plus a supplementary charge of 10% (combined 40%). Profits earned by the Group in the Republic of Ireland are taxable at either 12.5% or 25%, depending upon the nature of the income.",

The extent to which capital allowances are available on any single asset is, however, very much dependent upon the fact pattern for the asset involved, and there will often be an element of uncertainty as to how capital allowances legislation applies in those circumstances. Therefore, reaching agreement with tax authorities as to the amount of capital allowances available can take a number of years and sometimes can only be resolved through a formal legal process.\n\nThe calculation of the Group's total tax charge therefore necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement in relation to certain items for which the tax treatment cannot be finally determined until resolution has been reached with the tax authorities or, if required, through a formal legal process. At 31 March 2023, the Group has not recognised provisions in respect of uncertain tax positions (2022: \u00a327.9m).\n\nOn 23 March 2023, the Group's case concerning the availability of capital allowances on Glendoe Hydro Electric Station was heard at the Supreme Court. On 17 Mary 2023, the Supreme Court released its decision, which rejected HMRC's appeal in full. The matter is now concluded and is not subject to further appeal. Accordingly, the release of the Group's provision on its uncertain tax position of \u00a327.9m and the associated recognition of \u00a323.4m deferred tax liabilities in relation to Glendoe's capital allowances is an adjusting post balance sheet event (see note 26).\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## 10.3 Deferred taxation\n\nThe following are the deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting periods: Fair value\n\n|                                                              | Accelerated capital allowances \u00a3m   | gains/ (losses) on  derivatives \u00a3m   | Retirement benefit obligations \u00a3m   | Other (restated*)  \u00a3m   | Total (restated*) \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|\n| At 31 March 2021                                             | 733.8                               | (25.3)                               | 67.8                                | (2.0)                   | 774.3                  |\n| Charge/(credit) to income statement on continuing operations | 407.6                               | 399.4                                | 5.8                                 | (16.9)                  | 795.9                  |\n| Charge to other comprehensive income/(loss)                  | -                                   | 4.4                                  | 72.6                                | -                       | 77.0                   |\n| Credit to equity                                             | -                                   | -                                    | -                                   | (1.9)                   | (1.9)                  |\n| Exchange adjustment                                          | 0.2                                 | -                                    | -                                   | (1.4)                   | (1.2)                  |\n| At 31 March 2022                                             | 1,141.6                             | 378.5                                | 146.2                               | (22.2)                  | 1,644.1                |\n| Charge/(credit) to income statement                          | 112.0                               | (476.7)                              | 8.9                                 | (8.9)                   | (364.7)                |\n| Charge/(credit) to other comprehensive income/(loss)         | -                                   | 8.1                                  | (19.8)                              | -                       | (11.7)                 |\n| Charge to equity                                             | -                                   | -                                    | -                                   | 2.0                     | 2.0                    |\n| Recognised on acquisition (note 12)                          | (0.1)                               | -                                    | -                                   | 27.1                    | 27.0                   |\n| Exchange adjustment                                          | 1.6                                 | -                                    | -                                   | 0.8                     | 2.4                    |\n| At 31 March 2023                                             | 1,255.1                             | (90.1)                               | 135.3                               | (1.2)                   | 1,299.1                |\n\nCertain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset, including the asset balances analysed in the tables above.

The Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset of \u00a35.6m on trading losses of \u00a344.8m (2022: \u00a347.6m) in the Republic of Ireland. The Group has not recognised deferred tax assets of \u00a30.5m (2022: \u00a3nil) in respect of losses of \u00a32.3m (2022: \u00a3nil) in Spain, France, Italy and Greece. These assets have not been recognised as the Group is uncertain that there will be sufficient future profits against which to utilise the assets. There is no time limit for expiry of the losses or allowances to which they relate.\n\nNo deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future. Total unremitted earnings at 31 March 2023 were \u00a3468.8m (2022: \u00a3350.8m).\n\n## 11.

Shareholders were able to elect to receive ordinary shares credited as fully paid instead of the cash dividend under the terms of the Company's scrip dividend scheme.\n\nFor dividends paid in relation to the financial year ended 31 March 2022 and in relation to the subsequent years to 31 March 2026, the Group's policy is to repurchase shares to reduce the scrip's dilutive effects, if the scrip take-up exceeds 25% of the full year dividend in any given year. The overall scrip dividend take-up for the financial year ended 31 March 2022 was 38.3%. Under the share buyback programme 6.9m of shares were repurchased and cancelled during the year ended 31 March 2023 for total consideration of \u00a3107.6m (including stamp duty and commission).\n\nAn interim dividend of 29.0p per ordinary share (2022: 25.5p) was declared and paid on 9 March 2023 to those shareholders on the SSE plc share register on 13 January 2023. Shareholders were able to elect to receive ordinary shares credited as fully paid instead of the interim cash dividend under the terms of the Company's scrip dividend scheme.",

Acquisitions and disposals\n\n## 12.1 Acquisitions\n\n## Current year acquisitions\n\n## European onshore renewables development platform\n\nOn 1 September 2022 the Group completed the 100% acquisition of a European onshore renewable energy development platform from Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy ('SGRE') for cash consideration of \u00a3519.5m. The SGRE portfolio is mainly located in Spain with the remainder across France, Italy and Greece. This acquisition is aligned to the Group's published strategy to pursue overseas renewable opportunities.\n\nAcquisition costs of \u00a36.0m were expensed to operating costs in the year. The acquired business contributed \u00a3nil to revenue and \u00a30.5m of costs to operating profit of the Group for the year. Had the acquisition occurred on 1 April 2022, the acquired business would have contributed nil to revenue and contributed an immaterial loss to operating profit. The intangible development assets acquired are late-stage windfarm development costs. The goodwill recognised represents early-stage intangible development costs that do not qualify for separate recognition as set out in the table below.\n\n|                                         | Fair value at  1 September  2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Assets acquired and liabilities assumed |                                       |\n| Intangible development assets           | 104.4                                 |\n| Inventories                             | 3.0                                   |\n| Trade and other receivables             | 20.3                                  |\n| Cash                                    | 11.5                                  |\n| Trade and other payables                | (3.5)                                 |\n| Deferred tax liability (note 10)        | (27.0)                                |\n| Total net assets acquired               | 108.7                                 |\n| Goodwill                                | 410.8                                 |\n| Cash consideration                      | 519.5                                 |\n\n## Triton Power - 50% joint venture acquisition\n\nOn 1 September 2022, the Group announced that SSE Thermal and Equinor had completed the acquisition of Triton Power Holdings Limited from Energy Capital Partners for headline consideration of \u00a3341m shared equally. The headline consideration included \u00a396m of loans which were settled on completion of the transaction and replaced with shareholder loans of \u00a348.0m each from SSE and Equinor. The Group's share of the cash consideration paid for the equity investment was therefore \u00a3123.2m after completion adjustments. Triton Power operates the 1.2GW Saltend Power Station in the Humber along with two smaller plants, Indian Queens Power Station, a 140MW OCGT in Cornwall, and Deeside Power Station, a decommissioned CCGT in north Wales. The acquisition will strengthen SSE's existing collaboration with Equinor and will support the long-term decarbonisation of the UK's power system and contribute to security of supply and grid stability. An exceptional gain on acquisition of \u00a3140.7m was recognised at 30 September 2022 based on movements in the underlying fair value of assets between agreeing and completing the transaction. During the second half of the financial year a fair value exercise and impairment review have been completed which resulted in an impairment loss of \u00a3291.6m and a \u00a3172.0m gain on financial instruments (net of tax) being recognised.\n\nThe joint venture contributed \u00a3210.2m to operating profit before exceptional items, but including \u00a310.0m charge for fair value adjustments, in the year to 31 March 2023 on an equity accounted basis.\n\n## Other asset acquisitions\n\nDuring the year ended 31 March 2023, the Group made other smaller asset acquisitions (of special purpose vehicles as opposed to businesses) for cash consideration of \u00a319.8m and deferred consideration of \u00a334.9m (2022: \u00a34.0m cash consideration). The total cash consideration for business combinations of \u00a3642.7m (2022: \u00a3141.3m) is included in the Group's Adjusted investment, capital and acquisition metric.",

Acquisitions and disposals continued\n\n## 12.1 Acquisitions\n\n## continued\n\n## Prior year acquisitions\n\n## Acquisition of 80% equity interest in Japanese offshore wind development platform\n\nOn 29 October 2021 the Group completed the acquisition of an 80% equity interest in an offshore wind development platform based in Japan from Pacifico Energy and its affiliates for $193m USD upfront cash consideration and a further $30m USD deferred consideration subject to a number of conditions.\n\nAcquisition costs of \u00a37.2m were expensed to operating costs in the prior year. The subsidiaries acquired had nil revenue and contributed a loss of \u00a30.1m to the consolidated result of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2022. The assets and liabilities acquired largely comprise tangible and intangible assets, being windfarm site development costs and goodwill as set out in the table below. The non-controlling interest acquired was measured at fair value, where fair value represented the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the assets and liabilities acquired through the transaction.\n\n|                               | Fair value at  29 October 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Assets acquired               |                                     |\n| Intangible development assets | 20.5                                |\n| Cash                          | 4.3                                 |\n| Other assets                  | 0.4                                 |\n| Total net assets acquired     | 25.2                                |\n| Non-controlling interest      | (40.6)                              |\n| Goodwill                      | 176.7                               |\n| Cash consideration            | 161.3                               |\n| Deferred consideration        | 141.3                               |\n|                               | 20.0                                |\n|                               | 161.3                               |\n\n## 12.2 Disposals\n\n## (i) Significant disposals\n\n## Current year disposals\n\nDuring the year the Group recognised a gain of \u00a3868.3m within equity from the sale of a 25% non-controlling equity stake in its SSEN Transmission business (being the company Scottish Hydro Electric Transmission plc) and an exceptional income statement gain of \u00a389.1m from the disposal of the Fiddlers Ferry site.\n\n25% non-controlling equity stake in Scottish Hydro Electric Transmission plc: On 25 November 2022, the Group announced it had agreed to sell a 25% non-controlling equity stake in Scottish Hydro Electric Transmission plc ('SHET') to Ontario Teachers Pension Plan ('OTPP') for cash consideration of \u00a31,465.0m, less transactions costs of \u00a316.9m. The transaction completed on 30 November 2022, at which time the consolidated carrying value of SHET's net assets was \u00a32,319.3m. Since the transaction did not result in a loss of control, the Group recognised a gain of \u00a3868.3m within equity attributable to owners of the parent company. The Group considered the rights and obligations and operating protocols arising from the disposal and has determined that the non-controlling interest in SHET has the characteristics of equity and has classified the non-controlling interest as such.\n\n|                                                            | 30 November  2022 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Carrying value of non-controlling interests disposed       | (579.8)                |\n| Cash consideration paid by non-controlling interest holder | 1,465.0                |\n| Transaction costs                                          | (16.9)                 |\n| Excess of consideration received recognised in equity      | 868.3                  |\n\nDetails regarding SHET's principal activity and country of incorporation are included in A3 \uf150 .\n\n## SHET's summary financial information is as follows:\n\n|                         | 31 March  2023 \u00a3m   | 30 November  2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|\n| Non-current assets      | 4,907.1             | 4,717.0                |\n| Current assets          | 16.5                | 2.0                    |\n| Current liabilities     | (370.3)             | (384.3)                |\n| Non-current liabilities | (2,909.4)           | (2,795.4)              |\n|                         | 1,643.9             | 1,539.3                |\n\nStrategic Report\n\nDirectors' Report\n\n|                        | 1 April 2022 to  25 November  2022  \u00a3m   | 26 November  2022 to  31 March 2023 \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Revenue                | 435.4                                    | 220.4                                    | 655.8      |\n| Operating profit       | 274.5                                    | 131.0                                    | 405.5      |\n| Net finance costs      | (31.7)                                   | (14.9)                                   | (46.6)     |\n| Profit before taxation | 242.8                                    | 116.1                                    | 358.9      |\n| Taxation               | (59.1)                                   | (19.6)                                   | (78.7)     |\n| Profit after taxation  | 183.7                                    | 96.5                                     | 280.2      |\n\nThe summary financial information provided above is presented without Group eliminations, including \u00a3780.0m of internal loans and related interest of \u00a36.5m which have been eliminated to calculate the gain on partial disposal and the non-controlling interest for adjusted profit.\n\n|                                                                   | 26 November 2022  to 31 March 2023 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Net profit                                                        | 96.5                                    |\n| add/(less):                                                       |                                         |\n| Interest elimination                                              | 6.5                                     |\n| Current taxation on interest elimination                          | (1.1)                                   |\n| Deferred taxation                                                 | 16.5                                    |\n|                                                                   | 118.4                                   |\n| Adjusted net profit attributable to 25% non-controlling interests | 29.6                                    |\n\nFiddler's Ferry land sale: On 30 June 2022, the Fiddlers Ferry site was sold to Peel NRE Developments Limited for cash proceeds of \u00a360m.

Due to working capital movements in the business subsequent to the transaction agreement, cash consideration received was \u00a30.2m. The Group recorded an exceptional loss on disposal of \u00a318.9m in the year of completion, in addition to the exceptional impairment loss of \u00a351.2m recognised during the year ended 31 March 2021. A further impairment of \u00a36.5m has been recognised in the year ended 31 March 2023 in relation to receivables previously recognised on disposal.\n\nSale of stake in Dogger Bank C: On 10 February 2022, SSE completed the sale of a 10% stake in Dogger Bank C to Eni for consideration of \u00a370.0m and contingent consideration of up to \u00a340m, resulting in a non-exceptional gain on disposal of \u00a364.3m. The gain was recognised within the adjusted profit of the Group in line with the Group's stated policy in relation to developer gains on disposal of divestments in early-stage offshore windfarms (see note 3.2). After the sale the Group's shareholding in Dogger Bank C was 40%.\n\nOther disposals: On 19 August 2021 the Group received a dividend of \u00a34.8m following the sale of Smarter Grid Solutions by the Environmental Energies Fund Limited, resulting in a non-exceptional gain on sale of \u00a32.8m.\n\n## Sale of discontinued operations\n\nSale of investment in SGN: On 2 August 2021, the Group announced it had agreed to sell its 33.3% investment in SGN to a consortium comprising existing SGN shareholders Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board and Brookfield Super-Core Infrastructure Partners for cash consideration of \u00a31,225m. The agreement was conditional on certain regulatory approvals and completed on 22 March 2022, with an exceptional gain on disposal of \u00a3576.5m recognised.\n\nSale of investment in Gas Production: On 14 October 2021, the Group completed the sale of its Gas Production business to Viaro Energy through its subsidiary RockRose Energy Limited. In the period to 14 October 2021, the Gas Production business had an operating profit (recognised in discontinued operations) of \u00a3101.4m. The Group recorded an impairment of \u00a3120.8m to reduce the carrying value of the assets and liabilities to the fair value less costs to sell prior to completion of the disposal. The impairment charge of \u00a3120.8m included a provision for indemnified tax liabilities of \u00a335.0m, which was released in the year to 31 March 2023 as noted at 7.1(vii).",

Certain goodwill valuations have changed in the current year following retranslation. Commentary on the impairment testing of the related CGUs, with the exception of two historic balances totalling \u00a38.2m, is included in note 15.\n\nA summary of the goodwill allocated to CGUs and the Group's operating segments is presented below:\n\n| CGU group                             | Operating Segment                       |   2023 \u00a3m | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Great Britain and Ireland windfarms 1 | SSE Renewables                          |     292.3 | 286.2     |\n| SSE Pacifico 2                        | SSE Renewables                          |     196   | 185.2     |\n| SSE Southern Europe 3                 | SSE Renewables                          |     428.7 | -         |\n| Energy Solutions 4                    | GB Business Energy & Distributed Energy |      32.4 | 32.4      |\n| Ireland Supply 5                      | SSE Airtricity                          |       8.2 | 8.2       |\n|                                       |                                         |     957.6 | 512.0     |\n\n## (ii) Allowances and certificates\n\nAllowances and Certificates consist of purchased carbon emissions allowances and generated or purchased renewable obligations certificates (ROCs). These allowances and certificates will be utilised in settlement of environmental obligations incurred by the Group's Thermal and GB Business Energy supply business and are therefore distinct from allowances and certificates held in excess of the Group's environmental obligations which are recorded within inventories.\n\n## (iii) Development assets\n\nDevelopment costs primarily relate to the design, construction and testing of Thermal, Renewable and Solar and Battery assets, which the Group believes will generate probable future economic benefits. Costs capitalised as development intangibles include options over land rights, planning application costs, environmental impact studies and other costs incurred in bringing windfarms and other development projects to the consented stage. These may be costs incurred directly or at a cost as part of the fair value attribution on acquisition.\n\nAt the point the development reaches the consent stage and is approved for construction, the carrying value is transferred to property, plant and equipment (note 14). At the point a project is no longer expected to reach the consented stage, the carrying amount of the project is impaired.\n\n## (iv) Other intangible assets\n\nIncluded within other intangible assets are brands, customer lists and contracts.\n\nNo exceptional or non-exceptional impairment charges have been recognised in the year (2022: \u00a3nil).\n\n## (v) Software assets\n\nSoftware assets include application software license fees, software development work, software upgrades and purchased PC software packages.",

Impairment testing continued\n\n## 15.1 Goodwill impairment reviews - CGUs testing\n\nFollowing the acquisition of the Southern Europe wind and solar platform from Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, the Group has determined that it has three goodwill balances within its SSE Renewables business (GB and Ireland, SSE Southern Europe and SSE Pacifico) that are subject to annual goodwill impairment reviews. In addition, the Group has a legacy goodwill balance within the SSE Enterprise Energy Solutions business. The recoverable amounts of the CGUs supporting the goodwill balances are determined by reference to value-in-use ('VIU') calculations. The VIU calculations use, as a starting point, pre-tax cash flow projections based on the Group's five year Corporate Model as approved by the Board. The Group's Corporate Model is based both on past experience and reflects the Group's forward view of markets, prices, risks and its strategic objectives. Commodity prices used are based on observable market data and, where this is not available, on internal estimates.\n\nCash flow period\n\nAssets/CGUs\n\nGreat Britain\n\n(GB) and\n\nIreland\n\nwindfarm\n\nCGUs\n\nassumption\n\nOperating and other valuation assumptions\n\nCommentary and impairment conclusions\n\nPeriod to end of life\n\nof portfolio assets\n\nModelling methodology and assumptions\n\nThe VIU assessment is used to test the\n\ncarrying value of \u00a3292.3m of goodwill\n\nrelated to the Group's GB and Ireland\n\nwindfarm CGUs. The assessment is based on\n\nthe discounted pre-tax cash flows expected\n\nto be generated by the specific wind farm\n\nassets included in the CGU across the\n\nremaining useful lives of those assets.\n\nThe GB and Ireland CGU includes cashflows\n\nfor operational assets only, being over 50\n\nindividual windfarms across Great Britain\n\nand the Island of Ireland, given the risk and\n\nuncertainty associated with projects in the\n\ndevelopment stage. Significant developments\n\nat Viking, Seagreen and Doggerbank are\n\ncurrently under construction and continue\n\nto be excluded from the analysis.\n\nCash inflows for the CGUs are based on the expected average annual generation output based on technical assessment and past experience and are valued based on forward power prices. These factors are subject to management review on an annual basis. The prices applied to projected outputs are based either on observable market information during that period, which is deemed to be 3 years, or on internal estimations beyond the observable market period (a Level 3 basis as defined by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement). The projections are also dependent on the UK and Irish government's continuing support for existing qualifying wind assets through CFD subsidies and ROCs or REFIT. Cash outflows are based on planned and expected maintenance profiles and other capital or replacement costs.\n\nThe cash flow projections are based on UK and Irish power prices between \u00a355 - \u00a3169 per MWh and have been discounted applying a pre-tax real discount rate between 6.9% for GB and 5.8% for Ireland (2022: between 5.1% and 6.0%) based on technology and market risks.\n\nImpairment conclusion\n\nThe recoverable amount of the GB and Ireland\n\nCGUs at 31 March 2023 is significantly in excess\n\nof the carrying value of the goodwill and tangible\n\nand intangible assets attributed to the CGUs.\n\nTherefore, no impairment has been recognised.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe principal assumptions impacting the valuation\n\nmodel of the GB and Ireland CGU are discount\n\nrate, generation volume and electricity price.\n\nWhile cash flow projections are subject to inherent uncertainty, a 10% power price decrease and a 15% decrease in projected generation volumes were modelled, both of which indicated significant headroom on the carrying value of the assets. The 8% volume sensitivity is based on the Group's assessment of the climate related risk to future volume reduction, as set out in the Group's TCFD disclosures. A 0.5% increase in the pre-tax real discount rate to 9.8% for GB and 8.74% for Ireland, also indicated significant headroom on the carrying value of the assets.\n\n## TCFD related sensitivity analysis\n\nA significant increase in renewable generation capacity in the Group's core markets could result in an oversupply of renewable electricity at a point in the future, which would lead to a consequential decrease in the power price achievable for the Group's GB and Ireland wind generation assets. A downside power price sensitivity, which may arise in a market with significant new build was modelled. This scenario indicated that, despite a modelled 15% reduction in forecast power price, there remained significant headroom on the carrying value in the Group's GB and Ireland wind generation assets.\n\nChanges to weather patterns resulting from global warming could result in calmer weather patterns, which would reduce volumes achievable for the Group's GB and Ireland wind generation assets (although noting that this would likely lead to capacity constraints and hence higher prices). Despite an 8% reduction in modelled projected volume, there remained significant headroom on the carrying value in the Group's GB and Ireland wind generation assets. The TCFD Variable wind generation risk scenario modelled the physical risk of average wind speed changes of 4% to 8% over the longer term, consistent with the impairment sensitivity performed.\n\nStrategic Report\n\nDirectors' Report\n\n| Assets/CGUs          | Cash flow period  assumption               | Operating and other valuation assumptions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Commentary and impairment conclusions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| SSE Southern  Europe | Period to end of life  of portfolio assets | Modelling methodology and assumptions The VIU assessment is used to test the  carrying value of \u00a3428.7m of goodwill and  \u00a3116.1m of intangible development assets  related to the Group's Southern Europe  windfarms for impairment.

Cash inflows for the CGU are based on | Impairment conclusion  While the assessed VIU of \u00a3316.9m exceeds the  carrying value at 31 March 2023, the early stage   of the development investment means that the  model is sensitive to changes in key assumptions.

The calculations use, as their starting point, pre-tax cash flow projections based on the Group's five year Corporate Model as approved by the Board. The Group's Corporate Model is based on past experience and reflects the Group's forward view of markets, prices, risks and its strategic objectives. Commodity prices used are based on observable market data and, where this is not available, on internal estimates. Fair value less costs to sell valuations are derived from market analysis for similar transactions, adjusted to specific circumstances of the Group's investment to reflect the amount the Group believes will be recoverable in a sale transaction.\n\n## Changes from prior year\n\nThe assets identified for impairment reviews in the prior year (being GB CCGTs and the Great Island CCGTs) remained subject to impairment testing at 31 March 2023. In addition to these assets, the Group's Gas Storage asset at Aldbrough displayed indicators of impairment reversal following improved financial performance during the year. This was mainly due to global gas price volatility during the year, with the asset providing opportunities for the Group to trade within this volatility. At 31 March 2022 the Group fully reversed the historic impairments previously recognised in relation to the Gas Storage asset at Atwick. Following its acquisition and revaluation in September 2022 and a strong financial contribution in the period to March 2023, the Group's 50% joint venture investment in Triton Power displayed indicators of impairment at March 2023. Finally, the Group's 50% joint venture investment in Neos Networks Limited displayed indicators of impairment following the loss of a major contract, subsequent to increases in the Group's investment during the year.\n\n| Assets                                                                                                    | Cash flow period   | Operating and other valuation assumptions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Commentary and impairment conclusions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| GB CCGTs  (Keadby,  Medway,  Peterhead and  Marchwood  (PPA Right   of use lease  asset) power  stations) | assumption of life | Period to end  Modelling methodology and assumptions The VIU of the Group's GB combined cycle  gas turbine ('CCGT') power stations were  based on pre-tax discounted cash flows  expected to be generated by each plant,   based on management's view of operating  prospects and operational flexibility within   the GB wholesale market, including capacity  market clearing prices.

Cash flows are  subject to a pre-tax real discount rate of 12.4%  (2022: 11.0%) reflecting the specific risks in the  Irish market. | Commentary and impairment conclusions Conclusion The VIU assessment performed on the asset indicated  an impairment of \u00a3nil, at 31 March 2023. The Group  recorded an exceptional impairment reversal of  \u00a317.8m at 30 September 2022 on its Great Island  CCGT based on observable power prices at that   date. This reversal represented a final full reversal   of historical impairments. The carrying value of   the Great Island asset at 31 March 2023 is \u00a3269.9m  against an assessed recoverable value of \u00a3280.4m. Sensitivity analysis |\n| Gas Storage  assets   (Atwick and  Aldbrough) | Period to end  of life         | The VIU of the Group's Gas Storage assets   at Aldbrough and Atwick were based on  pre-tax discounted cash flows expected to   be generated by the storage assets based on  management's view of the assets' operating  prospects. Cash flows are subject to a pre-tax  real discount rate of 18.8% for Atwick and  13.8% for Aldbrough reflecting risks specific   to the assets.   | Conclusion The VIU assessment performed on the assets  indicated a net impairment reversal of \u00a345.7m to  Aldbrough. The Group's Atwick site, which has no  remaining historic impairments, indicated significant  headroom on the fair value exercise performed as at  31 March 2023.  At 31 March 2023, the carrying value of Aldbrough is  \u00a392.6m and the carrying value of Atwick is \u00a362.3m.                                                                                                                                                  |\n\nStrategic Report\n\nDirectors' Report\n\n| Assets                                         | Cash flow period  assumption   | Operating and other valuation assumptions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Commentary and impairment conclusions                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Gas Storage  assets   (Atwick and              |                                | The key assumptions applied in the valuation  of the assets are gas price volatility and the  mean reversion rate ('MRR').

Impairment testing continued\n\n## 15.2 Property, plant and equipment, other intangibles and investment impairment reviews - asset testing continued\n\nCash flow period\n\nAssets\n\nInvestment in\n\nTriton Power\n\nHoldings\n\nLimited\n\ncontinued\n\n## Investment in Neos Networks Limited\n\nassumption\n\nOperating and other valuation assumptions\n\nCommentary and impairment conclusions\n\nn/a\n\nThe Group has valued its 50% joint venture investment in Neos Networks Limited ('NNL') based on projected valuations that could be achieved in a market transaction, using earnings multiples observable from recent similar transactions. Due to the nature of the valuation technique, which was performed to approximate an achievable fair value less costs to sell, a wide range of valuations were derived from this exercise. The Group has used a point estimate valuation within the range of possible valuations based on earnings targets and earning multiples that the Group believes are achievable. The Group has assessed that this is a level 3 valuation in the fair value hierarchy, with the key inputs being EBITDA and the transaction multiple.\n\nTCFD related sensitivity analysis - Triton\n\nThe future introduction of legislation restricting power generation from unabated gas fired power stations beyond 2030 has been identified as a potential risk the Group could be exposed to as the UK transitions to a net zero economy. However, this has not been treated as an indicator of impairment at 31 March 2023, as legislation has not been introduced or enacted by the balance sheet date.\n\nTriton is projected to operate beyond this date, and so while legislation has not been introduced requiring the shortening of the economic life to this date, the Group has performed a sensitivity analysis to the impairment test noted above. If legislation was introduced requiring the closure of Triton by 2030, it would result in an impairment of \u00a376.5m at 31 March 2023. Under the TCFD Accelerated Gas Closure risk scenario, the indicative potential lost discounted EBIT from early closure of Saltend by 2030 was less than \u00a30.1bn.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe valuation exercise resulted in a wide range of reasonably probable valuations for the business from an impairment of \u00a374.9m to headroom of \u00a31.2m based on current contracts and probable contract wins. The business fundamentals remain strong and a change to the current client base would have an impact on this assessment.\n\nThe Group has assessed that within this range of valuations, a point valuation resulting in an impairment of \u00a337.7m best represents the recoverable value of the investment.\n\nFollowing the impairment, the Group's carrying value of equity investment, shareholder loans and receivables due from NNL is \u00a3174.8m.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nSensitivity analysis was performed in relation to the EBITDA and the multiple applied in deriving the valuation. A 10% increase in the EBITDA assumption would reduce the impairment to \u00a320.2m, whereas a 12% decrease in the EBITDA assumption would result in an impairment of \u00a358.7m.\n\nA 10% decrease to the multiple assumption would result in an impairment of \u00a356.1m, whereas a 10% increase to the multiple assumption would result in an impairment of \u00a318.3m.\n\nStrategic Report\n\nDirectors' Report\n\n## 16.

Further detail on the Group's acquisitions in the year is provided in note 12.1.\n\nAdditionally the Group has provided equity and loans to its existing joint venture investments of \u00a3141.4m and \u00a3441.7m respectively, primarily in relation to Seagreen Wind Energy Limited, SSE Slough Multifuel Limited and Ossian Offshore Windfarm Limited.\n\n## Disposals of equity in the year\n\nThere were no significant disposals of equity in the current year.\n\n## 16.3 Acquisitions and disposals of equity in the previous year\n\nAdditions in the previous year arising on loss on control\n\nThere were no significant additions of equity in the prior year.\n\n## Disposals of equity in the previous year\n\nSale of stake in Dogger Bank C: On 10 February 2022, SSE completed the sale of a 10% stake in Dogger Bank C to Eni for consideration of \u00a370.0m and contingent consideration of up to \u00a340.0m, resulting in a non-exceptional gain on disposal of \u00a364.3m. The gain was recognised within the adjusted profit of the Group in line with the Group's stated exceptional policy for gains on disposal of divestments in offshore windfarms (see note 3.2). After the sale the Group's shareholding in Dogger Bank C is 40%.\n\nSale of investment in SGN: On 2 August 2021, the Group announced it had agreed to sell its 33.3% investment in SGN to a consortium comprising existing SGN shareholders Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board and Brookfield Super-Core Infrastructure Partners for cash consideration of \u00a31,225m.

Cost estimates are based on the forecast remediation or clean-up costs based on current technology and prices for Renewable, Thermal and Gas Storage assets and are reviewed by independent valuation experts every three years. In the intervening years, management update cost estimates based on factors arising since the last formal valuation date. Retained decommissioning costs in relation to the disposed Gas Production business are periodically agreed with the field operators. The cost estimates include a risk adjustment and are inflated to the projected decommissioning date using a market observable inflation rate. This projection is discounted using a risk-free discount rate based on UK gilt rates with maturity date similar to the expected decommissioning date.\n\nThere is a wide range of assumed decommissioning dates across the obligation due to the number of assets and their varying ages, which is summarised in the table. Decommissioning dates are based on the useful economic lives of the individual assets based on technology and price forecasts at the balance sheet date. It is possible that the forecast decommissioning dates will change due to technology advances or decisions to repower wind farms when the current turbines reach the end of their respective lives. The date of decommissioning of the Gas Production business can vary based on hydrocarbon reserve estimates and market commodity prices, which can shorten or lengthen the economic life of the field.\n\nStrategic Report\n\nDirectors' Report\n\n| Business Unit      |   Value of  Provision  31 March 2023 \u00a3m | Number of  decommissioning  sites   | Forecast  decommissioning  dates   |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Renewables         |                                   218.5 | 55                                  | 2025 - 2049                        |\n| Thermal            |                                   165   | 14                                  | 2023 - 2051                        |\n| Gas Storage        |                                   119.4 | 18 1                                | 2023 - 2050                        |\n| Gas Production     |                                   201.4 | 4 2                                 | 2023 - 2038                        |\n| Distributed Energy |                                     7.8 | 1                                   | 2027                               |\n| Total              |                                   712.1 |                                     |                                    |\n\nThe Group's decommissioning provision has decreased during the year from \u00a3940.1m to \u00a3712.1m, primarily due to the financial assumptions applied in calculating the obligation. A decrease in the long term inflation rate to 3.2% (2022: 3.8%) has not been offset by the increase in the risk free discount rates applied of between 3.5%-3.8% (2022: 1.6%-1.8%) which has had a significant impact on the closing provision. Of the \u00a3196.0m reduction of provision based on revaluation, \u00a3145.5m has been recognised as an opposing reduction to decommissioning assets and \u00a350.5m was recognised in the income statement in relation to the Group's share of gas production decommissioning liabilities. During the year, the Group incurred \u00a312.2m of decommissioning spend, primarily related to the Fiddlers Ferry and Ferrybridge sites, included within Thermal above. Based on work completed to date, provisions accrued for the decommissioning of these power stations are expected to be sufficient for the final cost of the works. The disposed provision in the year related to the Fiddler's Ferry land site.\n\n## Impact of climate change on the Group's decommissioning provisions\n\nThe Group has assessed that the most likely impact of climate change on its decommissioning provisions would be the enactment of legislation that would result in the earlier closure of its unabated gas fired power stations. The decommissioning provision included in the table above for these assets is based on forecast closure dates under legislation enacted at the balance sheet date and therefore forecast closure dates have not been accelerated. In the sensitivity analysis below, a scenario has been included assuming legislation is enacted that would result in closure of these assets from 2030.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nSensitivity analysis reflecting reasonably probable fluctuations to the main assumptions used in the calculation of the decommissioning provisions is set out below:\n\n| Estimated decommissioning provision including:   |   2023 \u00a3m | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Increasing the projected cost estimate by 10%    |     781.4 | 1,027.8   |\n| Increasing the inflation rate by 1.0%            |     793.2 | 1,051.2   |\n| Decreasing the discount rate by 0.5%             |     747.1 | 992.1     |\n| Closure of unabated gas CCGTs from 2030          |     714.5 | 931.7     |\n\n## Legal and restructuring provisions\n\nProvision had been made for costs associated with the restructure of the Group, including the disposal of SSE Energy Services, Neos Networks Limited and the Group's Contracting business. These provisions were utilised or released in the year. In the year the Group released provisions in total of \u00a345.2m, of which \u00a335.0m for a tax indemnity provided to RockRose Energy Limited ('RRE') following the disposal of SSE E&P Limited on 14 October 2021 (see note 7.1) was released. The Group settled provisions relating to restructuring and disposals totalling \u00a351.0m in the year. Legal and restructuring provision utilisation during the year primarily relates to separation costs in relation to the disposals of SSE Energy Services, SGN and the Group's 50% investment in Neos Networks.\n\nProvisions have been made for ongoing legal and regulatory disputes. Where outcomes are unknown, a range of possible scenarios is calculated, with the most likely being reflected in the provision. The timing of settlement for legal provisions is more uncertain as it is dependent upon legal resolution being achieved.\n\n## Employee related provisions\n\nEmployee related provisions include the Group's employer financed retirement benefit provision for certain directors and former directors and employees, which is valued in accordance with IAS 19 using assumptions consistent with the Scottish Hydro Electric Pension Scheme (see note 23 for assumptions applied). In addition, the Group has legal obligations arising from severance payments due to employees, which are measured based on length of service. At 31 March 2023, the provisions for severance are related to the closure of Tarbert Power Station.\n\n## Other provisions\n\nOther provisions include onerous contract provisions, mutualisation obligations and other contractual obligations and are calculated based on a best estimate basis. The timing of settlement of these provisions varies by obligation between 2023 and 2028.",

Sources of finance\n\n## 21.1 Capital management\n\nThe Board's policy is to maintain a strong balance sheet and credit rating to support investor, counterparty and market confidence in the Group and to underpin future development of the business. The Group's credit ratings are also important in maintaining an efficient cost of capital and in determining collateral requirements throughout the Group. As at 31 March 2023, the Group's long-term credit rating was BBB+ positive outlook for Standard & Poor's and Baa1 stable outlook for Moody's.\n\nThe maintenance of a medium-term corporate model is a key control in monitoring the development of the Group's capital structure and allows for detailed scenarios and sensitivity testing. Key ratios drawn from this analysis underpin regular updates to the Board and include the ratios used by the rating agencies in assessing the Group's credit ratings.\n\nThe Group's debt requirements are principally met through issuing bonds denominated in Sterling and Euros as well as private placements and medium-term bank loans including those with the European Investment Bank. On 1 August 2022 SSE plc issued a 7 year \u20ac650m Eurobond at a coupon of 2.875% under the Group's Green Bond Framework and additionally, SSE Group (through Scottish Hydro Electric Transmission plc) also received \u00a3350m of proceeds, on 30 June 2022, from the private placement that was priced and committed to in March 2022. In April 2022 SSE plc issued a \u20ac1bn NC6 equity accounted Hybrid bond at 4% to re-finance the dual tranche debt accounted Hybrid bonds whose first call date occurred on 16 September 2022 with SSE taking advantage of the 3 month par call option on these Hybrid bonds meaning the bonds were repaid on 16 June 2022. Senior debt redeemed in the financial year included $255m (\u00a3162.7m) US Private Placement in April 2022, a \u00a3300m Eurobond in September 2022 and a \u00a3150m loan from the European Investment Bank to Scottish Hydro Electric Transmission plc in October 2022.\n\nSSE's adjusted net debt and hybrid capital was \u00a38.9bn at 31 March 2023, compared with \u00a38.6bn at 31 March 2022.\n\nAdjusted net debt and hybrid capital is stated after removing lease obligations, external debt attributed to non-controlling interests and cash posted as collateral in line with the Group's presentation basis which is explained at note 3(i). Cash posted as collateral refers to amounts deposited on commodity trading exchanges which are reported within 'Trade and other receivables' on the face of the balance sheet.

The Group also has \u00a33.5bn of revolving credit facilities which includes \u00a3750m relating to Scottish Hydro Electric Transmission plc (2022: \u00a31.5bn) (see note 21.3). As at 31 March 2023 there was \u00a3100m of drawings against these committed facilities being less than 3% utilisation (2022: undrawn).\n\nThe Group capital comprises:\n\n|                                                             | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m (restated*)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------|\n| Total borrowings (excluding lease obligations)              | 8,654.0   | 8,671.2               |\n| Less: Cash and cash equivalents                             | (891.8)   | (1,049.3)             |\n| Net debt (excluding hybrid equity)                          | 7,762.2   | 7,621.9               |\n| Hybrid equity                                               | 1,882.4   | 1,051.0               |\n| External debt attributable to non-controlling interests     | (434.2)   | -                     |\n| Cash (posted)/held as collateral and other short term loans | (316.3)   | ( 74.7)               |\n| Adjusted net debt and hybrid capital APM                    | 8,894.1   | 8,598.2               |\n| Equity attributable to shareholders of the parent           | 8,583.9   | 8,077.8               |\n| Total capital excluding lease obligations                   | 17,478.0  | 16,676.0              |\n\nUnder the terms of its major borrowing facilities, the Group is required to comply with the following financial covenant:\n\n- \u00b7 Interest Cover Ratio: The Group shall procure that the ratio of Operating Profit to Net Interest Payable for any relevant period is not less than 2.5 to 1.\n\nThe following definitions apply in the calculation of these financial covenants:\n\n- \u00b7 'Operating Profit' means, in relation to a relevant period, the profit on ordinary activities before taxation (after adding back Net Interest Payable) of the Group for that relevant period but after adjusting this amount to exclude any exceptional profits (or losses) and, for the avoidance of doubt, before taking account of any exceptional profits (or losses) and excluding the effect of IFRS 9 remeasurements.\n- \u00b7 'Net Interest Payable' means, in respect of any relevant period, interest payable during that relevant period less interest receivable during that relevant period.\n\nIn summary, the Group's intent is to balance returns to shareholders between current returns through dividends and long-term capital investment for growth. In doing so, the Group will maintain its capital discipline and will continue to operate within the current economic environment prudently. There were no changes to the Group's capital management approach during the year.\n\nUnder the SSE plc's articles of association, the borrowings of the Company are limited so as to ensure that the aggregate amount of all borrowings by the Group outstanding at any time is not more than three times the capital and reserves of the Group.\n\nStrategic Report\n\nDirectors' Report\n\n## 21.2 Loans and other borrowings\n\n| Current                                                     | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Short-term loans                                            | 1,738.5   | 1,118.7   |\n| Lease obligations                                           | 82.1      | 72.1      |\n|                                                             | 1,820.6   | 1,190.8   |\n| Non-current                                                 |           |           |\n| Loans                                                       | 6,915.5   | 7, 552.5  |\n| Lease obligations                                           | 323.8     | 321.4     |\n|                                                             | 7,239.3   | 7,873.9   |\n| Total loans and borrowings                                  | 9,059.9   | 9,064.7   |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                   | (891.8)   | (1,049.3) |\n| Unadjusted net debt                                         | 8,168.1   | 8,015.4   |\n| Add/(less):                                                 |           |           |\n| Hybrid equity                                               | 1,882.4   | 1,051.0   |\n| External net debt attributable to non-controlling interests | (434.2)   | -         |\n| Lease obligations                                           | (405.9)   | (393.5)   |\n| Cash (posted)/held as collateral and other short term loans | (316.3)   | ( 74.7)   |\n| Adjusted net debt and hybrid capital  APM                   | 8,894.1   | 8,598.2   |\n\nCash and cash equivalents (which are presented as a single class of asset on the face of the balance sheet) comprise cash at bank and short term highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less.

As at 31 March 2023 there was \u00a3100m of drawings against these committed facilities being less than 3% utilisation (2022: undrawn). The details of the five committed facilities as at 31 March 2023 are:\n\n- \u00b7 a \u00a31.3bn revolving credit facility for SSE plc maturing March 2026 (2022: \u00a31.3bn);\n- \u00b7 a \u00a30.2bn bilateral facility for SSE plc maturing October 2026 (2022: \u00a30.2bn);\n- \u00b7 a new \u00a30.75bn facility for Scottish Hydro Electric Transmission plc maturing November 2025 (2022: \u00a3nil);\n- \u00b7 a new \u00a30.25bn facility for Scottish Hydro Electric Distribution plc and Southern Electric Power Distribution plc maturing November 2025 (2022: \u00a3nil); and\n- \u00b7 a new \u00a31.0bn committed facility for SSE plc maturing February 2024 (2022: \u00a3nil).\n\nThe \u00a31.3bn revolving credit facility and \u00a30.2bn bilateral facility are both in place to provide back-up to the commercial paper programme and support the Group's capital expenditure plans. The Transmission and Distribution related facilities, both of which have 1 year extension options at the borrower's discretion, were entered into to help cover the capital expenditure and working capital of those businesses as they look to become financially independent of the Group as part of the 25% divestment process. The new \u00a31bn committed facility at SSE plc has a 1 year extension option at the lender's discretion and was entered into to provide cover for potential cash collateral requirements, if periods of extreme volatility return to the commodity markets. The only facility that was drawn at 31 March 2023 was the \u00a3750m Transmission facility, with \u00a3100m drawn to cover capital expenditure requirements.\n\nDuring the year to 31 March 2023 SSE plc issued a 7 year \u20ac650m Eurobond at a coupon of 2.875% with an all-in cost of funding rate of just below 3% once fees and cost of pre-hedging have been included. The bond will be left in Euros as part of the Group's net investment hedge of Euro denominated businesses. SSE Group (through Scottish Hydro Electric Transmission plc) also received the proceeds from the private placement that was priced and committed to in March 2022. This comprised of a \u00a3350m dual tranche US Private Placement with Pricora Capital being a \u00a3175m 10-year tranche at 3.13% and a \u00a3175m 15-year tranche at 3.24% giving an all-in average rate of 3.185% across both tranches.\n\nIn April 2022 SSE plc issued a \u20ac1bn NC6 equity accounted Hybrid bond at 4% to re-finance the dual tranche debt accounted Hybrid bonds whose first call date occurred on 16 September 2022, with SSE taking advantage of the 3 month par call option on these Hybrid bonds meaning the bonds were repaid on 16 June 2022. The \u20ac1bn equity accounted Hybrid bond was left in Euros with the proceeds used to cover the portion of the maturing Hybrid that was swapped to Euros and a portion of the costs associated with the acquisition of the Southern European onshore renewables development platform from Siemens Gamesa Renewables Energy.",

The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared and are entitled to one vote per share at meetings of the Company.\n\n- (i) Shareholders were able to elect to receive ordinary shares in place of the final dividend of 60.2p per ordinary share (in relation to year ended 31 March 2022) and the interim dividend of 29.0p (in relation to the current year) under the terms of the Company's scrip dividend scheme. This resulted in the issue of 18,241,941 and 9,413,103 new fully paid ordinary shares respectively (2022: 22,201,443 and 1,782,473). In addition, the Company issued 1.9m (2022: 0.6m) shares during the year under the savings-related share option schemes (all of which were settled by shares held in Treasury) for a consideration of \u00a318.0m (2022: \u00a36.3m).\n- (ii) Under the share buyback programme announced on 28 September 2022 6.9m of shares were repurchased and cancelled in the year to 31 March 2023 for a total consideration of \u00a3107.6m (including stamp duty and commission). The nominal value of share capital repurchased and cancelled is transferred out of share capital and into the capital redemption reserve.\n\nOf the 1,093.9m shares in issue, 3.6m are held as treasury shares. These shares will be held by the Group and used to award shares to employees under the Sharesave scheme in the UK.\n\nDuring the year, on behalf of the Company, the employee share trust purchased 1.4m shares for a total consideration of \u00a323.4m (2022: 0.9m shares, consideration of \u00a314.1m) to be held in trust for the benefit of employee share schemes. At 31 March 2023, the trust held 6.5m shares (2022: 6.3m) which had a market value of \u00a3118.0m (2022: \u00a3110.0m).\n\n## 22.2 Capital redemption reserve\n\nThe capital redemption reserve comprises the value of shares redeemed or purchased by the Company from distributable profits.\n\n## 22.3 Hedge reserve\n\nThe hedge reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedge derivative instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.\n\n## 22.4 Translation reserve\n\nComprises exchange translation differences on foreign currency net investments offset by exchange translation differences on borrowings and derivatives classified as net investment hedges under IAS 39.\n\n## 22.5 Hybrid Equity\n\n|                                                                 | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| GBP 600m 3.74% perpetual subordinated capital securities (i)    | 598.0     | 598.0     |\n| EUR 500m 3.125% perpetual subordinated capital securities (i)   | 453.0     | 453.0     |\n| EUR 1,000m 4.00% perpetual subordinated capital securities (ii) | 831.4     | -         |\n|                                                                 | 1,882.4   | 1,051.0   |\n\n## (i) 2 July 2020 \u00a3600m and \u20ac500m Hybrid Capital Bonds\n\nThe hybrid capital bonds issued in July 2020 have no fixed redemption date, but the Company may, at its sole discretion, redeem all but not part of the capital securities at their principal amount. The date for the first potential discretionary redemption of the \u00a3600m hybrid bond is 14 April 2026 and then every 5 years thereafter. The date for the first potential discretionary redemption of the \u20ac500m hybrid capital bond is 14 July 2027 and then every 5 years thereafter. For the \u00a3600m Hybrid the discretionary coupon payments are made annually on 14 April and for the \u20ac500m Hybrid the coupon payments are made annually on 14 July.\n\n## (ii) 12 April 2022 \u20ac1,000m Hybrid Capital Bonds\n\nThe hybrid capital bond issued in April 2022 has no fixed redemption date, but the Company may, at its sole discretion, redeem all but not part of the capital securities at their principal amount. The date for the first potential discretionary redemption is 21 April 2028 and then every 5 years thereafter. The discretionary hybrid coupon payments are made annually on 21 April.\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## (iii) Coupon Payments\n\nIn relation to the \u00a3600m hybrid equity bond a discretionary coupon payment of \u00a322.4m (2022: \u00a316.8m) was made on 14 April 2022 and for the \u20ac500m hybrid equity bond a discretionary coupon payment of \u00a316.4m (2022: \u00a316.4m) was made on 14 July 2022. Additionally, in relation to the \u20ac600m hybrid equity bond (redeemed on 1 April 2021), the final discretionary coupon payment of \u00a317.5m was made on 1 April 2021. The first discretionary coupon payment on the new \u20ac1bn hybrid equity bond will occur on 21 April 2023.\n\nThe coupon payments in the year to 31 March 2023 consequently totalled \u00a338.8m (2022: \u00a350.7m).\n\nThe Company has the option to defer coupon payments on the bonds on any relevant payment date, as long as a dividend on the ordinary shares has not been declared. Deferred coupons shall be satisfied only on redemption; or on a dividend payment on ordinary shares, both of which occur at the sole option of the Company. Interest will accrue on any deferred coupon.\n\n## 22.6 Equity attributable to non-controlling interests\n\nEquity attributable to non-wholly owned but controlled subsidiaries which are consolidated within the financial statements of the Group under IFRS. At 31 March 2023 the amount attributable to non-controlling interests is \u00a3649.1m (2022: \u00a340.6m), which relates to SHET of \u00a3606.5m (2022: \u00a3nil) and SSE Pacifico \u00a342.6m (2022: \u00a340.6m). The SHET's summarised financial information is included in note 12.2(i). The profit and loss attributable to non-controlling interests for the year ended 31 March 2023 is \u00a323.6m gain (2022: \u00a3nil), which relates to SHET \u00a325.5m gain (2022: \u00a3nil) and SSE Pacifico \u00a31.9m loss (2022: \u00a3nil).\n\n## 23. Retirement benefit obligations\n\n## Defined benefit schemes\n\nThe Group has two funded final salary pension schemes which provide defined benefits based on final pensionable pay. The schemes are subject to independent valuations at least every three years. The future benefit obligations are valued by actuarial methods on the basis of an appropriate assessment of the relevant parameters.\n\nThe Group also has an Employer Financed Retirement Benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme, SSE Pensions+ under a master trust with Aviva. The Group matches employee contributions up to a specified limit, in most circumstances this is set at 6%. The Group may also provide additional contributions of 3% after five years and a further 3% after ten years continuous Group service.\n\nThe Group presents its pension scheme valuations under two different measurement bases, an actuarial valuation and an IAS 19 valuation as required by accounting standards. The IAS 19 valuation is used to determine the assets and obligations recognised in the Group's consolidated balance sheet and is calculated annually by scheme actuaries, whereas the formal actuarial valuation is used to determine the contributions the Group makes to each scheme. The actuarial valuation is recalculated for each scheme every three years.\n\n## Actuarial valuations\n\nThe individual pension scheme details based on the latest formal actuarial valuations are as follows:\n\n|                                         | Scottish Hydro Electric   | SSE Southern   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------|\n| Latest formal actuarial valuation       | 31 March 2021             | 31 March 2022  |\n| Valuation carried out by                | Hymans Robertson          | Aon Hewitt     |\n| Value of assets based on valuation      | \u00a32,050.5m                 | \u00a32,395.6m      |\n| Value of liabilities based on valuation | \u00a31,782.2m                 | \u00a32,475.2m      |\n| Valuation method adopted                | Projected Unit            | Projected Unit |\n| Average salary increase                 | RPI+0.5%                  | RPI+0.25%      |\n| Average pension increase                | RPI                       | RPI            |\n| Value of fund assets/accrued benefits   | 115.1%                    | 96.8%          |\n\n## Future contributions\n\n## Scottish Hydro Electric Pension Scheme\n\nThe last triennial actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 31 March 2021 and showed a surplus of \u00a3268.3m on a projected unit basis. Following this valuation, the Group agreed to a new schedule of contributions which does not require contributions to be paid to the scheme, unless there is a deficit on the valuation basis for two successive quarterly valuations. Consequently, the Group has not made contributions to the scheme in the year ending 31 March 2023.\n\nThe next triennial funding valuation will be carried out as at 31 March 2024.\n\n## SSE Southern Group of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme\n\nThe last triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 31 March 2022 was finalised in April 2023, and showed a deficit of \u00a379.6m on a projected unit basis. Following this valuation, the Group agreed to a new schedule of contributions which, along with investment returns from return-seeking assets, are expected to make good this shortfall by 31 March 2027. The next funding valuation will be carried out at 31 March 2025. The Group also pays contributions in respect of current accrual. Total contributions of approximately \u00a329.0m are expected to be paid by the Company during the year ending on 31 March 2024, including deficit repair contributions of \u00a314.2m. The deficit repair contribution will be made annually until March 2027, increasing in line with inflation each year.\n\nDuring the year ending 31 March 2023 the Group continued to pay deficit contributions of \u00a338.0m.",

IFRIC 14 'IAS 19 - The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction' clarifies that future refunds may be recognised if the sponsoring entity has an unconditional right to a refund in certain circumstances.\n\nIn 2016/17 the Group agreed with the trustees to the Scottish Hydro Electric Pension Scheme an amendment to the scheme rules to clarify that the Company has a clear right to any surplus upon final winding up of the scheme. This amendment removes the previous restriction on recognition of any surplus and as such the previously applied restriction is no longer recognised. The net pension asset of the Scottish Hydro Electric Scheme at 31 March 2023 was equal to \u00a3366.6m (2022: \u00a3517.5m).\n\nAt 31 March 2023, the SSE Southern Pension Scheme has a net surplus of \u00a3174.5m (2022: \u00a367.4m), and unrecognised future contributions of \u00a350.9m (2022: \u00a3195.7m), subject to increases in line with inflation. The Group has assessed that it has the right to recognise the current and any future surpluses on the scheme, therefore has not recognised a liability for future unrecoverable contributions.\n\n## 23.1 Pension scheme assumptions\n\nBoth schemes have been updated to 31 March 2023 by qualified independent actuaries. The valuations have been prepared for the purposes of meeting the requirements of IAS 19. The major assumptions used by the actuaries in both schemes were:\n\n|                                          | At 31 March  2023   | At 31 March  2022   |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Rate of increase in pensionable salaries | 3.5%                | 4.2%                |\n| Rate of increase in pension payments     | 3.2%                | 3.7%                |\n| Discount rate                            | 4.8%                | 2.7%                |\n| Inflation rate                           | 3.2%                | 3.7%                |\n\nThe assumptions relating to longevity underlying the pension liabilities at 31 March 2023 are based on standard actuarial mortality tables, and include an allowance for future improvements in longevity. The assumptions, equivalent to future longevity for members in normal health at age 65, are as follows:\n\n## Scottish Hydro Electric\n\n|                   | At 31 March 2023   | At 31 March 2023   | At 31 March 2022   | At 31 March 2022   |\n|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                   | Male               | Female             | Male               | Female             |\n| Currently aged 65 | 22                 | 24                 | 22                 | 24                 |\n| Currently aged 45 | 24                 | 26                 | 24                 | 27                 |\n\n## SSE Southern\n\n|                   | At 31 March 2023   | At 31 March 2023   | At 31 March 2022   | At 31 March 2022   |\n|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n|                   | Male               | Female             | Male               | Female             |\n| Currently aged 65 | 22                 | 24                 | 23                 | 25                 |\n| Currently aged 45 | 24                 | 26                 | 24                 | 26                 |\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## 23.2 Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe impact on the schemes' liabilities of changing certain of the major assumptions is as follows:\n\n## Scottish Hydro Electric\n\n|                                          | At 31 March 2023                  | At 31 March 2023                 | At 31 March 2022                  | At 31 March 2022                 |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                                          | Increase/ decrease in  assumption | Effect on  scheme's  liabilities | Increase/ decrease in  assumption | Effect on  scheme's  liabilities |\n| Rate of increase in pensionable salaries | 0.1%                              | +/-0.1%                          | 0.1%                              | +/-0.1%                          |\n| Rate of increase in pension payments     | 0.1%                              | +/-0.7%                          | 0.1%                              | +/-0.9%                          |\n| Discount rate                            | 0.1%                              | +/-0.7%                          | 0.1%                              | +/-1.0%                          |\n| Longevity                                | 1 year                            | +/-1.9%                          | 1 year                            | +/-2.0%                          |\n\n## SSE Southern\n\n|                                          | At 31 March 2023                  | At 31 March 2023                 | At 31 March 2022                  | At 31 March 2022                 |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|                                          | Increase/ decrease in  assumption | Effect on  scheme's  liabilities | Increase/ decrease in  assumption | Effect on  scheme's  liabilities |\n| Rate of increase in pensionable salaries | 0.1%                              | +/-0.1%                          | 0.1%                              | +/-0.2%                          |\n| Rate of increase in pension payments     | 0.1%                              | +/-1.2%                          | 0.1%                              | +/-1.5%                          |\n| Discount rate                            | 0.1%                              | +/-1.3%                          | 0.1%                              | +/-1.5%                          |\n| Longevity                                | 1 year                            | +/-3.3%                          | 1 year                            | +/-5.8%                          |\n\n## 23.3 Valuation of combined Pension Schemes\n\n|                                             | Quoted \u00a3m   | Unquoted \u00a3m   | Value at  31 March  2023 \u00a3m   | Quoted \u00a3m   | Unquoted \u00a3m   | Value at  31 March  2022 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------|---------------|-------------------------------|-------------|---------------|-------------------------------|\n| Equities                                    | 94.3        | -

This is included in Employee related provisions (note 20).\n\n## Staff costs analysis\n\nThe pension costs in note 8 can be analysed as follows:\n\n|                                      |   2023 \u00a3m |   2022 \u00a3m |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Service costs                        |      33.9 |      36.1 |\n| Defined contribution scheme payments |      60.1 |      57.3 |\n|                                      |      94   |      93.4 |\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## 23.6 Pension scheme risk assessment and mitigation\n\n## Risks to which the Pension Schemes exposes the Group\n\nThe nature of the Group's defined benefit pension schemes expose the Group to the risk of paying unanticipated additional contributions to the schemes in times of adverse experience. The most financially significant risks are likely to be:\n\n## (i) Asset volatility\n\nThe liabilities are calculated using a discount rate set with reference to corporate bond yields; if assets underperform this yield, this will create a deficit. The schemes hold a proportion of growth assets (equities, diversified growth fund and global absolute return fund) which, though expected to outperform corporate bonds in the long-term, create volatility and risk in the short-term. The allocation to growth assets is monitored to ensure it remains appropriate given the schemes' long term objectives. The SHEPS has a much lower proportion of growth assets than the SSE Southern Pension Scheme reflecting the maturity of each scheme.\n\n## (ii) Changes in bond yields\n\nA decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value placed on the schemes' liabilities for accounting purposes. However, this will be partially offset by an increase in the value of the schemes' bond holdings and its interest rate hedging in both schemes.\n\n## (iii) Inflation risk\n\nThe majority of the schemes' benefit obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities (although, in most cases, caps on the level of inflationary increases are in place to protect against extreme inflation). The majority of the assets are either unaffected by or only loosely correlated with inflation, meaning that an increase in inflation will also increase the deficit, although this is further limited by the inflation hedging in both schemes.\n\n## (iv) Life expectancy\n\nThe majority of the schemes' obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the members, so an increase in the life expectancy will result in an increase in the liabilities. The sensitivity analysis disclosed is intended to provide an indication of the impact on the value of the schemes' liabilities of the risks highlighted.\n\n## (v) Liability versus asset risk\n\nThe risk that movement in the value of the schemes' liabilities are not met by corresponding movements in the value of the schemes' assets will expose the Group to movements in the overall funding surplus.\n\n## 23.7 Risk mitigation\n\n## (i) De-risking\n\nThe Trustees have taken a number of steps to control the level of investment risk including reducing the Schemes' exposures to higher risk assets and increasing the level of protection against adverse movements in interest rates and inflation. The Trustees of both schemes continue to review the risk exposures in light of the longer term objectives of the respective schemes, including consideration of the impact of climate-related risk. Detailed below are further details on the hedging of pensioner longevity risk.\n\n## (ii) Asset buy-in\n\nOn 1 October 2019, the Scottish Hydro Electric Pension Scheme entered into an asset buy-in, transferring the risk of volatility in the assumptions used to calculate the obligation for 1,800 pensioners and 567 dependants (covering c.\u00a3800m of the scheme's liabilities) to a third party. The asset buy-in is valued under the accounting principles of IFRS 13 and is considered a Level 3 instrument in the fair value hierarchy. This is in addition to a previous buy-in completed during the year ended 31 March 2018 when c.\u00a3250m of the scheme's assets and liabilities related to 617 pensioners and 190 dependants were transferred to a third party. The Group has now insured against volatility in obligations related to pensioners who retired before 1 October 2019 to third parties (insurer PIC) and is now only exposed to valuation fluctuations related to active and deferred members and any members who retired after 1 October 2019.\n\n## (iii) Asset-liability matching strategies used by the Scheme\n\nThe Company and trustees of the schemes have agreed a long term investment strategy that seeks to reduce investment risk as and when appropriate. The asset-liability matching strategy is part of this approach which aims to reduce the volatility of the funding level of the pension schemes by investing in assets which perform in line with the liabilities of the schemes so as to protect against inflation being higher than expected. This has been adopted for a proportion of the schemes' assets, which is designed to provide partial protection against adverse movements in interest rates and inflation. The trustees of the respective schemes review the schemes' asset allocation on an ongoing basis in light of changes in the funding position and market opportunities.\n\n## 23.8 Risk assessment\n\n## (i) Maturity profile of the defined benefit obligations\n\nThe weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is 17 years (2022: 17 years) for the Scottish Hydro Electric Pension Scheme and 14 years (2022: 16 years) for the SSE Southern Pension Scheme.",

While these have been calculated consistently with the previous financial year, the method applied may change over time with financial conditions and assumptions.\n\n## (iii) Asset recognition\n\nThe Group has recognised net pension assets in relation to the Scottish Hydro Electric and SSE Southern pension schemes due to a surplus existing under IAS 19 accounting. The Group will only recognise a surplus should it have rights to that surplus under the rules of the pension scheme. The company no longer applies the 'asset ceiling' restriction mandated by IFRIC 14. Details on this key accounting consideration are provided above.\n\n## (iv) Fair value assessment of scheme assets\n\nThe Group seeks to assess whether there is a quotable market value (referenced as 'quotable' above) in relation to pension scheme assets held. This assessment is based on regular reviews conducted in conjunction with the trustees of the schemes. For assets where no quotable market value exists, these assets will be valued based on a set methodology agreed by trustees and scheme advisors and then regularly assessed.\n\nCurrently only one unquotable value exists within the two pension schemes of the Group, this being insurance contracts (or 'buy-in') held by the Scottish Hydro Electric Pension Scheme. These assets are currently valued consistently with the scheme's liabilities with the expected return on these assets being set equal to the discount rate.\n\n## 24. Financial instruments\n\nFor financial reporting purposes, the Group has classified derivative financial instruments into two categories, operating derivatives and financing derivatives. Operating derivatives include all qualifying commodity contracts including those for electricity, gas, oil, and carbon and the post-day 1 fair value movements on non-government backed contracts for difference in SSE Renewables. Financing derivatives include all fair value and cash flow interest rate hedges, non-hedge accounted (mark-to-market) interest rate derivatives, cash flow foreign exchange hedges and non-hedge accounted foreign exchange contracts. Non-hedge accounted contracts are treated as held for trading.\n\n## 24.1 Financial instruments - income statement\n\n|                                           | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Operating derivatives                     |           |           |\n| Total result on operating derivatives (i) | (2,980.2) | 3,527.2   |\n| Less: Amounts settled (ii)                | 272.0     | (1,426.8) |\n| Movement in unrealised derivatives        | (2,708.2) | 2,100.4   |\n| Financing derivatives (and hedged items)  |           |           |\n| Total result on financing derivatives (i) | 81.3      | (43.3)    |\n| Less: Amounts settled (ii)                | 120.6     | 64.3      |\n| Movement in unrealised derivatives        | 201.9     | 21.0      |\n| Net income statement impact               | (2,506.3) | 2,121.4   |\n\nStrategic Report\n\nDirectors' Report\n\nThe movement in unrealised operating derivative excludes \u00a316.6m of gains on proprietary trades, which has been recognised in the underlying profit of the Group.\n\n## 24.2 Financial instruments - balance sheet\n\nThe derivative financial assets and (liabilities) are represented as follows:\n\n| Derivative financial assets   | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Non-current                   | 246.0     | 371.7     |\n| Current                       | 759.2     | 2,941.8   |\n| Total derivative assets       | 1,005.2   | 3,313.5   |\n| Derivative liabilities        |           |           |\n| Non-current                   | (1,021.0) | (549.6)   |\n| Current                       | (243.3)   | (701.5)   |\n| Total derivative liabilities  | (1,264.3) | (1,251.1) |\n| Net liability                 | (259.1)   | 2,062.4   |\n\nInformation on the Group's financial risk management and the fair value of financial instruments is available at A6 and A7 \uf150 .\n\n## 25.

In total, contingent consideration receivable is up to \u00a3149.1m (2022: \u00a3187.1m), for which the Group has recognised a net receivable of \u00a34.1m (2022: \u00a34.1m). The payments of the remaining \u00a3145.0m (2022: \u00a3183.0m) are subject to various earn outs or contract and planning milestones, some of which the Group has assessed are unachievable or are out of the Group's control. At 31 March 2023, the Group has assessed that there is neither the required certainty of receipt, nor the ability to accurately assess the amounts receivable for recognition of these amounts.\n\nContingent liabilities for the Group solely relate to SSE plc, and have been disclosed within note 12 to the Company Financial Statements.\n\n## 26. Post balance sheet events\n\n## 26.1 Glendoe Hydro Electric Station announcement\n\nOn 23 March 2023, the Group's case concerning the availability of capital allowances on Glendoe Hydro Electric Station was heard at the Supreme Court. On 17 May 2023, the Supreme Court released its decision, which rejected HMRC's appeal in full. The matter is now concluded and is not subject to further appeal. Accordingly, the release of the Group's provision on its uncertain tax position of \u00a327.9m and the associated recognition of \u00a323.4m deferred tax liabilities in relation to Glendoe's capital allowances is an adjusting post balance sheet event.",

        "page_content": "## Accompanying information\n\n## A1. Basis of consolidation and significant accounting policies\n\n## A1.1 Basis of consolidation\n\nThe financial statements consolidate the results of the Company and its subsidiaries together with the Group's share of the results and net assets of its interests in joint arrangements and associates. Where necessary to ensure consistency, the accounting policies of the subsidiaries, joint arrangements or associates have been adjusted to align to the accounting policies of the Group. Intra-Group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from Intra-Group transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains and losses arising from transactions with joint arrangements and associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group's interest in the entity. Non-controlling interests represent the equity in subsidiaries that is not attributable, either directly or indirectly, to SSE plc shareholders.\n\n## Subsidiaries (Accompanying Information A3)\n\nSubsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group or the Company. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity in order to obtain variable returns from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial statements of subsidiaries acquired are consolidated in the financial statements of the Group from the date that control commences until the date control ceases. Transactions with non-controlling interests that relate to their ownership interests and do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.\n\n## Interests in joint arrangements and associates (note 16 and Accompanying Information A3)\n\nJoint arrangements, as defined by IFRS 11 'Joint Arrangements', are those arrangements that convey to two or more parties 'joint control'. Joint control exists when decisions about the 'relevant activities', being the financial, operational or strategic policies of the arrangement, are made with the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Whilst this assessment is principally focused on any 'reserved matters', being the material activities that typically require all significant shareholders to approve, other contractual agreements such as Power Purchase Agreements and Management Services Agreements are also considered. The Group's investments in joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures depending on the investee's legal form and the investor's contractual rights and obligations over the assets and liabilities of the investee.\n\nAssociates are those investments over which the Group has significant influence but neither control nor joint control.\n\nThe Group's interests in its joint operations are accounted for by recognising its share of the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of the operation. In these arrangements, the Group's share of the revenue will be eliminated as it relates to its purchased share of the output from the arrangement.\n\nThe Group's joint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting where the joint venture and associate net investments (comprising both equity and long term loans) are carried at historical cost plus the Group's share of postacquisition results, less any impairment in value. Where an impairment is recognised against the carrying value of an investment, it is recognised within the operating costs line of the consolidated financial statements. For those investments that were formerly subsidiaries of the Group, this will also include any fair value uplift arising from loss of control. The Group recognises its share of the results of these equity-accounted operations after tax and interest in the income statement.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the parent. Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured accordingly.\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Any gain or loss arising on the restatement of such items is taken to the income statement as a finance cost, with the exception of exchange gains or losses on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against a net investment in a foreign entity or exchange gains or losses incurred as part of a qualifying cash flow hedge. These exchange gains or losses are transferred to the translation reserve to the extent the hedge is effective. Non-monetary assets that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the historic rate at the date of transaction.\n\nFor the purpose of presenting the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group's foreign operations are translated into pounds sterling at the balance sheet closing rate. The results of these operations are translated at the average rate in the relevant period. Exchange differences on retranslation of the opening net assets and the results of foreign operations are transferred to the translation reserve and are reported in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.\n\nThe average and spot rates for the principal functional currencies that the Group's foreign operations are denominated in are shown in the table below.\n\n|           |                    |     2023 |     2022 | Change   |\n|-----------|--------------------|----------|----------|----------|\n| EUR v GBP | Year end spot rate |   1.1374 |   1.1856 | (4.1)%   |\n|           | Average spot rate  |   1.1564 |   1.175  | (1.6)%   |\n| US$ v GBP | Year end spot rate |   1.2337 |   1.3139 | (6.1)%   |\n|           | Average spot rate  |   1.205  |   1.3616 | (11.5)%  |\n| JPY v GBP | Year end spot rate | 163.823  | 159.711  | 2.6%     |\n|           | Average spot rate  | 163.289  | 153.801  | 6.2%     |\n\nStrategic Report\n\nDirectors' Report\n\n## A1.2 Significant accounting policies\n\n## Revenue (notes 2 and 5)\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognised to the extent that it reflects the expected consideration for goods or services provided to the customer under contract, over the performance obligations they are being provided. For each separable performance obligation identified, the Group determines whether it is satisfied at a 'point in time' or 'over time' based upon an evaluation of the receipt and consumption of benefits, control of assets and enforceable payment rights associated with that obligation. If the criteria required for 'over time' recognition are not met, the performance obligation is deemed to be satisfied at a 'point in time'.\n\nRevenue principally arises as a result of the Group's activities in energy production, storage, transmission, distribution, supply and related services in the energy markets in Great Britain and Ireland. The key policies applied by each Business Unit are as follows:\n\n## Transmission\n\n## Use of electricity transmission networks\n\nRevenue from use of electricity transmission networks is derived from the allowed revenue as defined by the parameters in the relevant electricity transmission licence, which informs the tariffs set.\n\nElectricity transmission revenue is determined in accordance with the regulatory licence, based on an Ofgem approved revenue model and is recognised 'over time' as charged to National Grid. Where this revenue differs from the allowed revenue, there may be an overor under-recovery of revenue which will be reflected in future financial years' allowed revenue as set out in the regulatory licence. No accounting adjustments are made for over- or under-recoveries in the year that they arise as they are contingent on future events (being the transmission of electricity in a future period). The over or under recovery adjustment is recognised in the subsequent period when included within the tariffs that form allowed revenue under the regulatory agreement.\n\n## Transmission network contracted services\n\nWhere the Group has an ongoing obligation to provide contracted services (transmission network connections), revenues are recognised 'over time' consistent with the customer receiving and consuming the benefits of that service across the expected contractual service period. Any assets constructed in order to deliver the service are capitalised and depreciated over their useful life. Payments are typically received from customers in advance of providing the contracted service and are deferred on balance sheet. No extended warranty periods are offered.\n\n## Distribution\n\n## Use of electricity distribution networks\n\nRevenue from use of electricity distribution networks is derived from the allowed revenue as defined by the parameters in the relevant electricity distribution licence, which informs the tariffs set.\n\nElectricity distribution revenue recognised is based on the volume of electricity distributed 'over time', as use of distribution service is determined by the customer, and the set customer tariff. As with electricity transmission revenue, any over- or under-recovery of revenue is reflected in future financial years' allowed revenue as set out in the regulatory licence. No accounting adjustments are made for over- or under-recoveries in the year that they arise as they are contingent on future events (being the distribution of electricity in a future period). The over or under recovery adjustment is recognised in the subsequent period when included within the tariffs that form allowed revenue under the regulatory agreement.\n\nThe Distribution business is responsible for recovering industry charges for supplier failures from customers under Ofgem's Supplier of Last Resort scheme. The Group's policy is to recognise revenue for recovered amounts when the Group is entitled to invoice customers through its regulated use of system tariff. The Group recognises its obligation to pay amounts recovered to eligible suppliers when the Group is entitled to invoice customers through its regulated use of system tariff.\n\n## Distribution network contracted services\n\nWhere the Group has an ongoing obligation to provide contracted services (such as for distribution network connections), revenues are recognised 'over time' consistent with the customer receiving and consuming the benefits of that service across the expected contractual service period. Any assets constructed in order to deliver the service are capitalised and depreciated over their useful life. Payments are typically received from customers in advance of providing the contracted service and are deferred on balance sheet. No extended warranty periods are offered.\n\n## Renewables\n\n## Electricity generation\n\nRevenue from the physical generation of electricity is recognised 'point in time' as generated and supplied to the national settlements body. Revenue is measured at either the spot price at the time of delivery, or trade price where that trade is eligible for 'own use' designation.\n\n## Renewables contracted services\n\nRevenue from national support schemes, such as Renewable Obligation Certificates, is recognised at the point the performance obligation has been met. This is typically considered to be either at the point electricity has been physically generated or over the contractual period, depending on the underlying performance obligation. Revenue is measured either at the market rate at the point of generation, or at the fixed contractual consideration, depending on the individual scheme mechanic.\n\nRevenue from other ancillary generation services is recognised 'over time' consistent with the customer receiving and consuming the benefits of those services across the expected contractual service period, and at the contracted consideration.",

Basis of consolidation and significant accounting policies continued\n\n## A1.2 Significant accounting policies\n\ncontinued\n\n## Thermal\n\n## Electricity generation\n\nRevenue from the physical generation of electricity is recognised 'point in time' as generated and supplied to the national settlements body. Revenue is measured at either the spot price at the time of delivery, or trade price where that trade is eligible for 'own use' designation.\n\n## Gas storage\n\nRevenue from gas storage trading activities is recognised 'point in time' as injected back into the gas network. Revenue is measured at either the spot price at the time of delivery, or trade price where that trade is eligible for 'own use' designation.\n\n## Thermal Generation contracted services\n\nRevenue from national support schemes, such as the Capacity Market mechanism, is recognised at the point the performance obligation has been met. This is typically considered to be either at the point electricity has been physically generated or over the contractual period, depending on the underlying performance obligation. Revenue is measured either at the market rate at the point of generation, or at the fixed contractual consideration, depending on the individual scheme mechanic.\n\nRevenue from other ancillary generation services is recognised 'over time' consistent with the customer receiving and consuming the benefits of those services across the expected contractual service period, and at the contracted consideration.\n\n## Customers\n\n## Supply of energy\n\nRevenue on the supply of energy comprises sales to domestic (in Ireland) and business end-user customers (in GB and Ireland) based on actual energy consumption including an estimate of the value of electricity and gas supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the year end. Revenue is recognised 'over time' consistent with the delivery of energy to the customer as we consider the receipt and consumption of the benefits of the energy to be simultaneous. Revenue is measured based on the applicable customer tariff rate and after deduction of any applicable contractual discounts.\n\nDetails of the judgements involved in the estimation process for the value of electricity and gas supplied to customers is given within note 4.1(iii).\n\nPayments from customers may be received in advance of providing the contracted service and are deferred on balance sheet. Amounts received from customers in relation to energy management services provided by Third Party Intermediaries ('TPIs') are offset against payments to those TPIs, reflecting the responsibility for providing the energy management service.\n\n## Energy related services\n\nWhere the Group has an ongoing obligation to provide contracted energy related services, revenues are recognised 'over time' consistent with the customer receiving and consuming the benefits of that service across the expected contractual service period at the fixed contracted rate. Where the Group has an obligation to perform a specific service, revenues are recognised 'point in time', following performance of the service at the fixed contracted consideration. No extended warranty periods are offered.\n\n## Distributed Energy\n\n## Construction related services\n\nConstruction related service revenue related to the Contracting and Rail business, which was disposed on 30 June 2021. For construction related services, revenue was recognised for each identified performance obligation 'over time' by applying an input method to determine the proportion of total contract revenue (being fixed price consideration plus the latest estimate of variable consideration) that should be recognised. The input method applied was calculated by reference to the costs incurred to date on that performance obligation, relative to the total expected costs to satisfy that performance obligation, provided the contract outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty. Revenue from non-contracted agreements or variations to contracted work was only recognised to the extent there is additional supporting evidence to their recoverability and may be subject to constraints on recognition. Revenue on contracts in customer dispute was recognised only to the extent it is considered to be highly probable that the revenue will be recovered.\n\nCommissions in relation to acquisition of construction related contracts were expensed as incurred. No extended warranty periods were offered. Payments from customers were based on agreed billing schedules, with payment milestones typically aligned with delivery of performance obligations.\n\n## EPM & I\n\n## Commodity optimisation and other services\n\nIncome from sales commodity optimisation trading occurring in any business unit is presented net in cost of sales alongside purchase commodity optimisation trades. Revenue on physical power and gas supplies recognised 'point in time' as delivered to the national settlements body or third parties. Revenue is measured at either the spot price at the time of delivery, or trade price where that trade is eligible for 'own use' designation.\n\nRevenue arising on commodities purchased in excess of the Group's requirements and recorded as inventory assets, such as Renewables Obligation Certificates, is recognised 'point in time' on disposal of these inventory assets to third parties.\n\nRevenue from other ancillary services is recognised 'over time' consistent with the customer receiving and consuming the benefits of those services across the expected contractual service period, and at the contracted consideration.\n\nStrategic Report\n\nDirectors' Report\n\n## Physical energy production\n\nThe Group's Gas production business was disposed on 14 October 2021 and was presented as a discontinued operation within the prior year financial statements.\n\nRevenue from the physical production of natural gas, crude oil and condensates arose from the Group's interest in various joint ventures and associates and was based on the entitlement method; whereby the Group's share of interest and production sharing terms were used to determine the allocation of production to each party in the arrangement. Revenue was recognised 'point in time' based on the production delivered to the customer at the specified delivery point and measured based on the applicable market price as specified in the customer contracts.\n\nAside from where specifically noted above, consideration is due when the performance obligation has been satisfied. As the period between satisfaction of the performance obligation and receipt of consideration from the customer is expected to be less than a year, the Group has applied the practical expedient not to adjust revenue for the effect of any financing components.\n\nRevenue from sources other than the Group's contracts with customers principally comprise meter rental income within the Distributed Energy business, and Contract for Difference income within certain Joint Venture arrangements.\n\nIncome on meter rental agreements, which are classified as operating leases, are presented as revenue where they relate to the core operating activities of that business. Lease payments are recognised as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## Other operating income - Government Grants (note 6)\n\nDuring the year ended 31 March 2023, the UK and Irish governments introduced customer support schemes under which licensed energy suppliers are required to provide a discount on gas and electricity prices to customers. The level of discount applied to each customer varied dependent upon energy tariff and support scheme applicable to each customer. Where SSE provided a discount to customer through reduction of energy bill, the cost of applying these discounts was recovered from the Government. The amounts reclaimed under this scheme are recognised as government grant income within Other Operating Income in the consolidated income statement.\n\nThe most significant customer support scheme administered by the Group during the year was the Energy Bill Relief Scheme, applicable to GB commercial gas and electricity customer usage during the period 1 October 2022 to 31 March 2023. This scheme impacts GB Business Energy with discounts made to SSE's billings to customers and unbilled income accrual and a separate asset recognised in respect of claimed or to-be-claimed receipts from the UK government.\n\nContract for Differences ('CfD') are agreements between a low-carbon electricity generator and the Low Carbon Contracts Company ('LCCC'), a UK Government owned entity responsible for delivering support mechanisms for low-carbon electricity generation. These agreements are not considered to be contracts with a customer, as the LCCC does not receive any goods or services from the generator. These arrangements are instead considered to be Government Grants, with income arising from these grants recognised in the income statement in the period in which generation takes place. In the year, the Group recognised no income or expense related to Contracts for Difference with the LCCC within its wholly owned subsidiaries. The Group's joint venture investment, Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Limited, has a CfD with the LCCC which resulted in payments from the LCCC of \u00a325.6m in the year (SSE share of \u00a312.8m recognised within share of profit). The Group's wholly owned Viking windfarm and joint venture investment Seagreen Wind Energy Limited also have a CfD arrangements in place with LCCC, however these agreements have not yet commenced and no income or cost was recognised during the year.\n\nWhere the CfD strike price falls below the spot price of generation and payments are made to the LCCC, these payments are expensed as incurred within operating costs.\n\nThe Group has commercial CfD arrangements in place where the Group has agreed to provide a revenue support contract. Where the Group has entered into these arrangements and there is no relationship with a government entity, the instruments are classified as derivatives and accounted for under IFRS 9. The Group has assessed that due to the valuation complexity of these arrangements, they are Level 3 financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy. On day 1, the Group recognises no gain or loss arising from the instrument, but instead defers this gain or loss and recognises it progressively over the life of the instrument. At each balance sheet date the fair value of the instrument is assessed with any movement in fair value recognised in the income statement in the period it arises. None of these contracts were active at 31 March 2023.\n\n## Cost of sales (note 6)\n\nCost of sales includes fuel and energy purchases, direct employee benefits, and depreciation of property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe net result from sales and purchases of commodity optimisation trades - comprising both realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from optimisation trading activities - is also presented within cost of sales, reflecting the underlying economic purpose of this trading activity.",

        "page_content": "## A1. Basis of consolidation and significant accounting policies continued\n\n## A1.2 Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## Finance income and costs (note 9)\n\nInterest income and costs are recognised in the income statement as they accrue, on an effective interest method. The issue costs and interest payable on bonds and all other interest payable and receivable is reflected in the income statement on the same basis.\n\nInterest on the funding attributable to major capital projects is capitalised during the period of construction and depreciated as part of the total cost over the useful life of the asset.\n\nThe accounting policy for foreign exchange translation of monetary assets and liabilities is described on page 276 \uf150 and for lease liability charges on page 283 \uf150 .\n\n## Taxation (note 10)\n\nTaxation on the profit for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Taxation is recognised in the income statement unless it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.\n\nDeferred tax is calculated using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities other than in business combinations that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset within the same tax authority and where the Group intends to either settle them on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.\n\nDuring the year ended 31 March 2023, the UK government announced draft legislation related to the Electricity Generator Levy ('EGL'), which is effective for periods from 1 January 2023 to 31 March 2028. The Group has assessed that the EGL has the characteristics of a levy rather than an income tax. While the legislation was not enacted by the balance sheet date, legislation was passing through Parliament and the Group expects no significant amendments will be made to the draft legislation through the enactment process. As a result, the Group has recognised an accrual of \u00a343.4m for the period 1 January 2023 to 31 March 2023 within cost of sales (\u00a333.6m) and share of operating profit from joint ventures and associates (\u00a39.8m).\n\n## Business Combinations (note 12)\n\nThe acquisition of subsidiaries, and joint operations that meet the definition of a business, is accounted for under the acquisition method as defined by IFRS 3 'Business Combinations'.\n\nThe cost of acquisition is measured as being the aggregate fair value of consideration to be transferred at the date control is obtained. Goodwill is measured at the acquisition date as the fair value of consideration transferred, plus non-controlling interests, less the net recognised amount (which is generally fair value) of the identifiable assets and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is subject to an annual review for impairment (or more frequently if necessary) in accordance with the Group's impairment accounting policy.\n\nContingent consideration is classified as a liability and subsequently re-measured through the income statement. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nChanges in ownership that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as equity transactions.\n\n## Held for sale assets and liabilities and discontinued operations (note 12)\n\nNon-current assets are classified as held for sale if their recoverable value is likely to be recovered via a sale or distribution as opposed to continued use by the Group. In order to be classified as assets held for sale, assets must meet all of the following conditions: the sale is highly probable; it is available for immediate sale; it is being actively marketed; and the sale is likely to occur within one year.\n\nAssets that qualify as held for sale and related liabilities are disclosed separately from other assets and liabilities in the balance sheet prospectively from the date of classification. Non-current assets determined as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell, no depreciation is charged in respect of these assets after classification as held for sale.\n\nAssets or groups of assets and related liabilities that qualify as held for sale are classified as discontinued operations when they represent a separate major line of business or geographical area, are part of a single plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area or are acquired exclusively with a view to resale. Income and expenses relating to these discontinued operations are disclosed in a single net amount after taxes in the income statement, with comparative amounts re-presented accordingly.\n\nIntra-Group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from trading between continuing and discontinued operations continue to be eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\n\nStrategic Report\n\nDirectors' Report\n\n## Intangible assets (note 13)\n\n## Goodwill and impairment testing\n\nGoodwill arising on a business combination represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group's interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least on an annual basis.\n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated on initial recognition to the cash-generating units (CGUs) or groups of CGUs expected to benefit from the combination's synergies. The CGUs (or groups of CGUs) used for goodwill impairment testing purposes will represent how goodwill was attributed but may not represent reportable business segments.\n\nGoodwill may also arise upon investments in joint arrangements and associates. Goodwill arising on a joint operation is recorded as a separate asset and any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. Goodwill arising on a joint venture or associate is recorded within the carrying amount of the Group's investment and any impairment loss is included within the share of result from joint ventures and associates. On disposal or closure of a previously acquired investment or business, any attributed goodwill will be included in determining the profit or loss on disposal.\n\n## Allowances and certificates\n\nAllowances and certificates consist of purchased carbon emissions allowances and generated or purchased obligations certificates. These allowances and certificates will be utilised in settlement of environmental obligations incurred by the Group's Thermal and Business Energy businesses.\n\nThe EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) has been in operation since 1 January 2005, with the Group operating under the established EU ETS carbon pricing system from that date. Since 1 January 2021, following Brexit, the UK Government has established a UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS) to replace the EU ETS with the Group's UK generation assets now operating under the UK ETS carbon pricing system. The Group continues to hold EU ETS certificates to settle obligations arising through the activities of its Irish Thermal generation assets. Carbon allowances purchased are recorded at cost within intangible assets. Forward carbon contracts are measured at fair value with gains or losses arising on re-measurement being recognised in the income statement. A liability is recognised based on the level of emissions recorded. Up to the level of allowances held, including forward carbon contracts, the liability is measured at the cost of purchase. When the carbon emission liability exceeds the carbon allowances held, the difference is measured at market value selling price. Subsequent movements in market value are prospectively recognised in operating profit.\n\nThe carbon allowance intangible asset is surrendered at the end of the compliance period to the extent requested reflecting the consumption of the economic benefit and is recorded as being utilised. As a result, no amortisation is booked but an impairment charge may be recognised should the carrying value of allowances exceed market or fair value.\n\nUnder the Renewable Obligations Certificates (ROCs) scheme, certificates obtained from own generation are awarded by a third party, Ofgem. ROCs can be traded with third parties and are ultimately used by suppliers to demonstrate to Ofgem that they have met their obligation to source a set proportion of the electricity they supply from renewable sources. The value of a ROC to a supplier comprises two elements: the 'buy-out' price which is set annually in advance of the compliance period by Ofgem; and the 'recycle' price which is determined after the compliance period by Ofgem. The recycle price element is estimated at the balance sheet date based on assumptions at that point in time around likely levels of renewable generation and supply over the remaining compliance period, and is therefore subject to possible future variation.\n\nWhere ROCs are self-generated or purchased to fulfil the Group's liability under the renewable obligation, they are recorded at market value at the point of generation or purchased within intangible assets. The Group can hold ROCs in excess of the Group's renewables obligation, which, due to limited evidence of liquidity or net settlement for ROC trades, are recorded at the lower of cost or net realisable value within inventories. Similarly, the fair value of any forward contracts entered into at the balance sheet date for the purchase or sale of ROCs in future periods are not recognised, as there is insufficient liquidity for net settlement. The Group's liability under the renewable obligation is recognised based on electricity supplied to customers, the obligation level set by Ofgem and the prevailing market price.\n\nThe intangible assets are surrendered at the end of the compliance period reflecting the consumption of economic benefit and release of the associated liability. As a result, no amortisation is recorded during the period.\n\n## Research and development\n\nExpenditure on research activities is charged to the income statement as incurred.\n\nExpenditure on development activities is capitalised as intangible assets if the project or process is considered to be technically and commercially feasible and the Group intends to complete the project or process for use or for sale. Development projects include wind farm developments, battery storage and solar developments, thermal generation projects and other developments relating to proven technologies. Costs incurred in bringing these projects to the consent stage include options over land rights, planning application costs and environmental impact studies and may be costs incurred directly or part of the fair value exercise on acquisition of an interest in a project. At the point that the project reaches the consent stage and is approved by the Board, the carrying value of the project is transferred to property, plant and equipment as assets under construction. Revenue and costs incurred through pre-commissioning testing activities are reflected in the income statement. Once in operation, depreciation will be charged over the expected useful life of the asset. The asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise.",

Basis of consolidation and significant accounting policies continued\n\n## A1.2 Significant accounting policies continued\n\nIntangible assets (note 13) continued\n\nOther intangible assets\n\nOther intangible assets that have been acquired separately by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Expenditure on internally generated brands or customer lists are expensed as incurred. Expenditure on internally developed software assets and application software licences includes contractors' fees and directly attributable labour and overheads. Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of these assets. The amortisation periods utilised are as follows:\n\n|                                                             | Years         |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Brands                                                      | 10            |\n| Customer lists                                              | Contract term |\n| Developed software assets and application software licences | 3 to 15       |\n\nThe useful lives of all the intangible assets are reviewed annually and amended, as required, on a prospective basis. Intangible assets are derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic benefits are expected from their use.\n\n## Cloud computing arrangements\n\nThe Group has contracts for Software as a Service (SaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) Cloud Computing Arrangements. Where the Group does not control the underlying assets in these arrangements, costs are expensed as incurred. Implementation costs in respect of these contracts are capitalised when the definition and recognition criteria of an intangible asset under IAS 38 are met.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment (note 14)\n\n## Owned assets\n\nItems of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairments. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and other directly attributable costs. Where the asset is a qualifying asset, for which a considerable period of time is required to prepare the asset for use or sale, borrowing costs will be capitalised as part of the asset's cost. Where an item of property, plant and equipment comprises major components having different useful lives, the components are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment, and depreciated accordingly. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.\n\n## Right of use assets\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Where a modification to a lease agreement decreases the scope of the lease, the carrying amount of the right of use asset is adjusted and a gain or loss is recognised in proportion to the decrease in scope of the lease. All other modifications to lease agreements are accounted for as a reassessment of the lease liability with a corresponding adjustment to the right of use asset.\n\n## Hydro civil assets\n\nThe Group is obliged under the Reservoirs Act 1975 to maintain its hydro infrastructure network, including its dams, tunnels and other hydro civil engineering structures (hydro civil assets). All items of property, plant and equipment within hydro civil assets, with the exception of land, are subject to depreciation.\n\nIn accordance with the transition provisions of IFRS 1 'First-time Adoption of IFRS', the Group identified the carrying value of these assets at privatisation and has treated this value as deemed cost. Following this assessment, the assets, and all subsequent enhancement and replacement expenditure, has been subject to depreciation over a useful economic life of 75 years. All subsequent maintenance expenditure is chargeable directly to the income statement.\n\n## Depreciation\n\nDepreciation is charged to the income statement to write off cost, less residual values, on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives. Heritable and freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation policy, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at least annually, for all asset classes to ensure that the current method is the most appropriate. Depreciation commences following the asset commissioning period and when the asset is available for commercial operation. The estimated useful lives for assets depreciated on a straight line basis are as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                                                  | Years     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Hydro civil assets (classified within Renewable power generation assets)                                                         | 75 to 100 |\n| Thermal and hydro power stations including electrical and mechanical assets (classified within Thermal power  generation assets) | 20 to 60  |\n| Onshore wind farms (classified within Renewable power generation assets)                                                         | 20 to 25  |\n| Offshore wind farms (classified within Renewable power generation assets)                                                        | 23 to 30  |\n| Gas storage facilities (classified within Other assets)                                                                          | 25 to 50  |\n| Overhead lines, underground cables and other network assets (classified within Distribution or                                   |           |\n| Transmission network assets)                                                                                                     | 5 to 80   |\n| Office buildings (classified within Land and buildings)                                                                          | 30 to 40  |\n| Fixtures, IT assets, vehicles and mobile plant (classified within Other assets)                                                  | 3 to 15   |\n\nStrategic Report\n\nAssets held under leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease agreement.\n\n## Subsequent expenditure\n\nIt is the Group policy to capitalise qualifying replacement expenditure and depreciate it over the expected useful life of the replaced asset. Replaced assets are derecognised at this point and the costs recorded as costs of disposal. Where an item of property, plant and equipment is replaced and it is not practicable to determine the carrying amount of the replaced part, the cost of the replacement adjusted for inflation will be used as an approximation of the cost of the replaced part at the time it was acquired or constructed.\n\nExpenditure incurred to replace a component of an item of property, plant and equipment that is accounted for separately is capitalised. Other subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits of the item of property, plant and equipment to which it relates. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Derecognition\n\nAn item of property, plant or equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds received with the carrying amount of the asset and are included in the income statement. Any gain or loss on derecognition of the asset is included in the income statement in the period of derecognition.\n\n## Lease arrangements (note 21)\n\nLease arrangements are separately distinguished from service contracts based on whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. If the Group is deemed to control the use of an identified asset, a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability are recognised on the balance sheet.\n\nRight of use assets are capitalised and held as part of property, plant and equipment. The accounting policy for such arrangements is described on page 282 \uf150 .\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments discounted using the rate implicit in the lease if that can be readily determined. If the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined the incremental borrowing rate is used. Where the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the Group has applied the intercompany borrowing rate which is based on the Group's external medium-term borrowing rates with premia adjustments for any subsidiary specific risk factors.\n\nIn determining whether any break and/or extension clauses should be included within the lease term, the Group has considered that where an internal decision has been made to break or extend the lease agreement, that decision shall be applied in determining the appropriate lease term. Where an internal decision has not been made, and where the non-cancellable element of the lease term has longer than five years remaining, it is considered that any clauses will not be triggered as any decision beyond that date is not reasonably certain. For all leases with less than five years remaining, an assessment is made at each reporting period on a lease-by-lease basis on whether the clause is reasonably certain to be triggered. Reassessment of break and/or extension judgements made in prior periods could result in recalculation of the lease liability and adjustments to associated balances.\n\nThe lease liability is subsequently adjusted for the unwind of discounting, repayments and other modifications to the underlying agreement. Lease modifications are accounted for as a separate lease where the scope of the lease increases through the right to use one or more underlying assets and where the consideration of the lease increases by an amount that is equivalent to the standalone price of the increase in scope. Where a modification decreases the scope of the lease, the carrying amount of the right of use asset is adjusted and a gain or loss is recognised in proportion to the decrease in scope of the lease. All other modifications are accounted for as a reassessment of the lease liability with a corresponding adjustment to the right of use asset.\n\nLeases with a duration of 12 months or less and leases for assets which are deemed 'low value' are expensed to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## Impairment review (note 15)\n\nThe carrying amounts of the Group's property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets and the Group's investments in joint ventures and associates, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, or where there are indications that a previously recognised impairment loss has reduced. For property, plant and equipment assets that have previously been identified as exhibiting indications of impairment, the review of impairment will be performed annually until there is sufficient evidence to confirm that any potential impairment loss has been appropriately recognised, or until previously recognised impairment losses have been fully written back. For goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite life or which are not yet ready for use, the test for impairment is carried out annually. In addition, financial assets measured at amortised cost are also reviewed for impairment annually.",

        "page_content": "## A1. Basis of consolidation and significant accounting policies continued\n\n## A1.2 Significant accounting policies continued\n\nImpairment review (note 15)\n\ncontinued\n\nFor assets subject to impairment testing, the asset's carrying value is compared to the asset's (or cash-generating unit's, in the case of goodwill), recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is determined to be the higher of the fair value less costs to sell ('FVLCS') and the value-in-use ('VIU') of the asset or cash-generating unit ('CGU'). For financial assets measured at amortised cost the impairment is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate.\n\nIf the carrying amount of the asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment charge will be recognised immediately in the income statement. Reversals of previous impairment charges are recognised if the recoverable amount of the asset or CGU significantly exceeds the carrying amount. Previous impairments of goodwill are not reversed.\n\nValue in use ('VIU') calculations require the estimation of future cash flows to be derived from the respective assets (or CGUs) and the selection of an appropriate discount rate in order to calculate their present value. The VIU methodology is consistent with the approach taken by management to evaluate economic value and is deemed to be the most appropriate for reviews of property, plant and equipment assets and the Group's identified goodwill-related CGUs. The methodology is based on the pre-tax cash flows arising from the specific assets, underlying assets or CGUs, and discounted using a pre-tax discount rate based on the Group's cost of funding and adjusted for any specific risks. The estimation of the timing and value of underlying projected cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates involves management judgement. Subsequent changes to these estimates or judgements may impact the carrying value of the assets.\n\nThe fair value less costs to sell methodology also uses a present value technique, unless there is a quoted price in an active market for that asset. The methodology is based on the post-tax cash flows arising from the specific assets, underlying assets or CGUs, and discounted using a post-tax discount rate determined in the same manner as the rates used in the VIU calculations, adjusted for the relevant taxation rate.\n\nAny impairment charge identified will initially be adjusted against the goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit. Any excess charge will be allocated against the remaining assets of the cash-generating unit. Reversals of previous impairment charges are allocated against the carrying value of assets previously subject to an impairment charge.\n\n## Inventories (note 17)\n\nInventories - aside from inventory purchased by the Gas Storage business for trading activities - are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.\n\nGas inventory purchased by the Gas Storage business for trading activities is held at fair value with reference to the forward month market price. Gains and losses on remeasurement at fair value are recognised within the Income Statement, as a 'certain remeasurement' item.\n\n## Provisions (note 20)\n\nA provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, it can be measured reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.\n\nIf the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.\n\n## Decommissioning\n\nThe Group engages independent experts to estimate the cost to decommission its Renewable, Thermal and Gas Storage assets every three years. In the intervening years, management updates the external valuation based on factors arising since the last formal valuation date. Provision is made for the net present value of the estimated cost of decommissioning gas storage facilities, wind farms and power stations at the end of the useful life of the facilities. This includes development assets, where if a present obligation exists, a provision is recognised during construction and prior to commencement of operations from the site. The estimates are based on technology and prices at the balance sheet date and exclude any salvage value related to those assets. A corresponding decommissioning asset is recognised and is included within property, plant and equipment when it gives access to future economic benefits, and is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the asset. Changes in these provisions are recognised prospectively. The unwind of discounting of the provision is included in finance costs.\n\nThe Group retained a decommissioning obligation following the disposal of its Gas Production business. The decommissioning cost estimates are updated periodically by field operators based on current technology and prices. Field operators also provide estimated end of field life dates for each field, which can change based on market commodity prices.\n\nStrategic Report\n\nDirectors' Report\n\n## Retirement benefit obligations (note 23)\n\n## Defined benefit pension schemes\n\nThe Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes, one of which is operated by the Company. Pension scheme assets are measured using bid market values. Pension scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit credit actuarial method and are discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.\n\nAny increase in the present value of liabilities within the Group's defined benefit pension schemes expected to arise from employee service in the year is charged as service costs to operating profit.\n\nNet interest costs are based on net scheme assets or liabilities, adjusted for minimum funding requirement and pension surplus restrictions under IFRIC 14 'IAS 19-The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction'. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Pension scheme surpluses, to the extent that they are considered recoverable, or deficits are recognised in full and presented on the face of the balance sheet.\n\n## Defined contribution pension schemes\n\nThe Group also operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes. The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds. The amounts charged represent the contributions payable to the schemes in the year and are charged directly to the income statement.\n\n## Equity and equity-related compensation benefits\n\nThe Group operates a number of employee share schemes as described in the Remuneration Report. These schemes enable Group employees to acquire shares of the Company.\n\nThe exercise prices of the sharesave scheme are set at a discount to market price at the date of the grant. The fair value of the sharesave scheme option granted is measured at the grant date by use of a Black-Scholes model. The fair value of the options granted is recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the period that the scheme vests. Estimates are updated for non-market conditions at each balance sheet date with any adjustment in respect of the current and prior years being recognised in the income statement. The costs associated with the other main employee schemes are recognised over the period to which they relate. The charge related to the equity shares in the Company awarded under the share schemes is treated as an increase in the cost of investment held by the Company in the subsidiary companies of the Group. The disclosures on equity and equity-related compensation benefits have been removed on the grounds of materiality in relation to the Group.\n\n## Financial instruments (note 24)\n\nThe Group uses a range of financial instruments to hedge exposures to financial risks, such as interest rate, foreign exchange and energy price fluctuations in its normal course of business and in accordance with the Group's risk management policies. The Group's risk management policies are further explained in A6 \uf150 .\n\nThe Group's review of the IFRS 9 hedge accounting model concluded that, whilst adoption would not change the treatment of existing hedging arrangements, the changes made would not result in any additional hedge designations either. As such, the existing hedge accounting model under IAS 39 appropriately reflects the Group's risk management activities in the financial statements. Therefore, as permitted by IFRS 9, the Group has elected to continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements of IAS 39. This policy choice will be periodically reviewed to consider any changes in our risk management activities.\n\n## Interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives\n\nFinancial derivative instruments are used by the Group to hedge interest rate and currency exposures. All such derivatives are recognised at fair value and are re-measured to fair value each reporting period. Certain derivative financial instruments are designated as being held for hedging purposes. The designation of the hedge relationship is established at the inception of the hedge and procedures are applied to ensure the derivative is highly effective in achieving its objective and that the effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured. The treatment of gains and losses on re-measurement is dependent on the classification of the hedge and whether the hedge relationship is designated as either a 'fair value' or 'cash flow' hedge. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are treated as if held for trading, with all fair value movements being recorded through the income statement.\n\nA derivative classified as a 'fair value' hedge recognises gains and losses from re-measurement immediately in the income statement. Loans and borrowings are measured at cost except where they form the underlying transaction in an effective fair value hedge relationship. In such cases, the carrying value of the loan or borrowing is adjusted to reflect fair value movements with the gain or loss being reported in the income statement.\n\nA derivative classified as a 'cash flow' hedge recognises the portion of gains or losses on the derivative which are deemed to be effective directly in equity in the hedge reserve. Any ineffective portion of the gains or losses is recognised in the consolidated income statement. When hedged cash flows result in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, the associated gains or losses previously recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For all other cash flow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the hedged cash flows affect the income statement.",

        "page_content": "## A1. Basis of consolidation and significant accounting policies continued\n\n## A1.2 Significant accounting policies\n\ncontinued\n\nFinancial instruments (note 24)\n\ncontinued\n\nInterest rate and foreign exchange derivatives continued\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. At the point of discontinuation, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity remains in equity until the forecast transaction affects profit or loss. On settlement, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Commodity derivatives\n\nWithin its regular course of business, the Group routinely enters into sale and purchase derivative contracts for commodities such as electricity, gas, carbon allowances and oil. Where the contract was entered into and continues to be held for the purpose of receipt or delivery in accordance with the Group's expected sale, purchase or usage requirements, the contracts are designated as 'own use' contracts and are measured at cost. These contracts are not within the scope of IFRS 9.\n\nDerivative commodity contracts which are not designated as own use contracts are accounted for as trading derivatives and are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value. Where a hedge accounting relationship is designated and is proven to be effective, the changes in fair value will be recognised in accordance with the rules noted above. There are currently no designated hedge relationships in relation to commodity contracts.\n\nOther commodity contracts, where own use is not established and a hedge accounting relationship is not designated, are measured at fair value with gains and losses on re-measurement being recognised in the income statement in cost of sales.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nDerivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives where the characteristics of the derivatives are not closely related to those of the host contracts.\n\n## Net investment hedges\n\nHedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted in a manner similar to effective cash flow hedges. Any gain or loss on the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity, in the translation reserve, and any gain or loss on the ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in the income statement. On disposal of the foreign operation, the cumulative value of any gains or losses recognised directly in equity is transferred to the income statement.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group's cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nTrade receivables do not carry any interest and are measured at cost less an appropriate allowance for lifetime expected credit losses.\n\n## Interest-bearing loans and borrowings\n\nAll such loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value including transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, except where the loan or borrowing is the hedged item in an effective fair value hedge relationship.\n\n## Share capital\n\nOrdinary shares are accounted for as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds received. Own equity instruments that are reacquired are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in the Group Income Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group's own equity instruments.\n\n## Hybrid equity\n\nHybrid equity comprises issued bonds that qualify for recognition as equity. Accordingly, any coupon payments are accounted for as dividends and are recognised directly in equity at the time the payment obligation arises. This is because the coupon payments are discretionary and relate to equity. Coupon payments consequently do not have any impact on the income statement. Coupon payments are recognised in the cash flow statement in the same way as dividends to ordinary shareholders. Tax credits in relation to the coupon payments are linked to the past transactions or events that support the coupon payments and consequently the tax credits are reported in the income statement.\n\n## Hybrid debt\n\nHybrid debt comprises issued bonds that have a fixed redemption date and are accounted within Loans and Borrowings. Coupon payments are recognised within the income statement as a finance cost.\n\n## A2. Taxation\n\nThe Group's primary tax disclosures are included at note 10. The following tables represent enhanced disclosures adopted in order to assist stakeholder understanding of the Group's tax position and policies as part of the Group's commitment to its Fair Tax Mark accredited status.\n\n## Reconciliation of tax charge to adjusted underlying current tax\n\n|                                                                                             | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2023 %   | 2022 \u00a3m (restated*)   | 2022 %   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------|-----------------------|----------|\n| Group (loss)/profit before tax                                                              | (205.6)   |          | 3,476.3               |          |\n| Less: share of results of associates and jointly controlled entities                        | (662.3)   |          | (109.8)               |          |\n| (Loss)/profit before tax                                                                    | (867.9)   |          | 3,366.5               |          |\n| Tax on profit on ordinary activities at standard UK corporation tax rate of 19% (2022: 19%) | (164.9)   | 19.0     | 639.6                 | 19.0     |\n| Tax effect of:                                                                              |           |          |                       |          |\n| Capital allowances less than depreciation                                                   | (41.6)    | 4.8      | (121.6)               | (3.6)    |\n| Movement in restructuring and settlement provisions                                         | (1.6)     | 0.2      | 1.1                   | -

The Group's Gas Production business, which was presented as a discontinued operation in the prior year (until the business was disposed on 14 October 2021) was taxed at a UK corporation tax rate of 30% plus a supplementary charge of 10% (combined 40%). Profits earned by the Group in the Republic of Ireland are taxable at either 12.5% or 25%, depending upon the nature of the income.\n\nCapital allowances are tax reliefs provided in law for the expenditure the Group makes on property, plant and equipment. The rates are determined by Parliament annually and spread the tax relief due over a number of years. This contrasts with the accounting treatment for such spending, where the expenditure on property, plant and equipment is treated as an asset with the cost being depreciated over the useful life of the asset, or impaired if the value of such assets is considered to have reduced materially.\n\nThe different accounting treatment of property, plant and equipment for tax and accounting purposes means that the taxable income of the Group is not the same as the profit reported in the financial statements. The substantial reversals of impairments and impairments undertaken in previous years in relation to certain property, plant and equipment assets, result in the depreciation or impairment charge to profit for the year differing to the amount of capital allowances due to the Group.\n\nStrategic Report\n\nShort term temporary differences arise on items such as provisions for restructuring costs and onerous contracts, and retirement benefit obligations, because the treatment of such items is different for tax and accounting purposes. These differences usually reverse in the year following that in which they arise, as is reflected in the deferred tax charge in these financial statements. Where interest charges or other costs are capitalised in the accounts, tax relief is either given as the charges are incurred or when the costs are taken to the income statement.\n\nAs explained at Accompanying Information A1 and A6 \uf150 , the Group measures its operating and financing derivatives at fair value under IFRS 9. As a result of the Group's subsidiaries applying the HMRC's 'disregard regulations', the re-measurement movements have no current tax effect impacting only the deferred tax position.\n\nAs detailed at note 22 and explained in the Accompanying Information A1 \uf150 , the Group has issued Hybrid equity securities which are treated as a component of equity. While the coupon payments relating to these securities are treated as distributions to the holders of the equity instruments, tax relief is allowed on the amount paid in the year. These tax credits are linked to the past transactions or events that support the coupon payments and consequently the tax credits are reported in the income statement.\n\n## A3.

Further qualitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 Credit risk\n- \u00b7 Liquidity risk\n- \u00b7 Commodity risk\n- \u00b7 Currency risk\n- \u00b7 Interest rate risk\n\nThe Board has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework. The Group's policies for risk management are established to identify the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Exposure to commodity, currency and interest rate risks arise in the normal course of the Group's business and derivative financial instruments are entered into to hedge exposure to these risks.\n\nSSE has a Group wide Risk Committee reporting to the Group Executive Committee, which is responsible for reviewing the strategic, market, credit, operational and liquidity risks and exposures that arise from the Group's operating activities. In addition, the Group has two dedicated Energy Market risk committees reporting to the Group Executive Committee and Board respectively, with the Group Executive Sub-committee chaired by the Group Finance Director (the 'Group Energy Markets Exposures Risk Committee') and the Board Sub-committee chaired by non-Executive Director Tony Cocker (the 'Energy Markets Risk Committee (EMRC)'). These Committees oversee the Group's management of its energy market exposures, including its approach to hedging.\n\nDuring the year ended 31 March 2023, the Group was exposed to exceptional volatility in energy markets impacting the primary commodities to which it is exposed (Gas, Carbon and Power) due to the ongoing impacts from the war in Ukraine and other global factors. The Group's approach to hedging, and the diversity of its energy portfolios (across Wind, Hydro, Thermal and Customers) has provided significant certain mitigation of these exposures. Exceptional rises and volatility in commodity prices have created a particular challenge in managing counter-party credit and collateral exposures and requirements. Market access to energy markets to enable hedging and prompt optimisation has been maintained by a combination of three key actions. Firstly, bilateral counterparty limits have been increased (subject to Executive Director authorisation) and SSE has continued to utilise market access provided by exchange platforms and auctions. Secondly, the SSE Group Parent Company Guarantee has been increased appropriately to reflect the impact of market volatility on counterparty exposures. Finally, since March 2022, SSE Treasury facilities have been increased by circa \u00a3730m with relationship banks and insurance companies in order to facilitate letters of credit to be posted as collateral instead of cash to support the route to market of the Group.\n\nAt 31 March, the Group's collateral position was as follows:\n\n|                                                               | Note   |   2023 \u00a3m |   2022 \u00a3m |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|-----------|\n| Collateral posted included within trade and other receivables | 18     |     316.3 |      74.7 |\n| Net collateral posted/(received)                              |        |     316.3 |      74.7 |\n\nExposure to the commodity, currency and interest rate risks noted arise in the normal course of the Group's business and derivative financial instruments are entered into to hedge exposure to these risks. The objectives and policies for holding or issuing financial instruments and similar contracts, and the strategies for achieving those objectives that have been followed during the year are explained below.\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## A6.1 Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations.\n\nCredit risk arising from the Group's normal commercial operations is controlled by individual business units operating in accordance with Group policies and procedures. Generally, for significant contracts, individual business units enter into contracts or agreements with counterparties having investment grade credit ratings only, or where suitable collateral or other security has been provided. Counterparty credit validation is undertaken prior to contractual commitment.\n\nCredit risk management for the Group's SSEN Transmission and SSEN Distribution businesses is performed in accordance with industry standards as set out by the Regulator and is financially controlled by the individual business units. The Group's greatest credit risks lie with the operations of the Customers business, the wholesale procurement activities conducted by Energy Portfolio Management ('EPM') under a trust arrangement and the activities carried out by the Group's Treasury function. In all cases, specific credit risk controls that match the risk profile of those activities are applied. Exposure to credit risk in the retail supply of electricity and gas to end user customers arises from the potential of a customer defaulting on their invoiced payables. The Group exposure to retail supply customers is limited to customers of the Group's Airtricity business. The creditworthiness of these customers is reviewed from a variety of internal and external information. The financial strength and creditworthiness of business customers is assessed prior to commencing, and for the duration of, their contract of supply.\n\nExposure to credit risk in the procurement of wholesale energy and fuel is managed by reference to agreed transaction credit limits which are determined by whether the counterparty:\n\n- \u00b7 holds an investment grade credit rating; or\n- \u00b7 can be assessed as adequately creditworthy in accordance with internal credit rules using information from other external credit agencies; or\n- \u00b7 can provide a guarantee from an investment grade rated entity or post suitable collateral or provide other acceptable assurances in accordance with group procedures where they have failed to meet the above conditions; or\n- \u00b7 can be allocated a non-standard credit limit approved by the relevant authority as delegated by the Group Board.\n\nCredit support clauses and Master Netting Agreements are typically included or entered into in order to mitigate the impact to the Group against counterparty failure or non-delivery. As part of its normal activities, EPM transacts significant volumes of commodity derivative products through cleared exchanges to mitigate credit risk. Such exchanges are subject to strict regulation by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and participants in these exchanges are obliged to meet rigorous capital adequacy requirements.\n\nIndividual counterparty credit exposures are monitored regularly and are subject to approved limits. At 31 March 2023, EPM had pledged \u00a3443.6m (2022: \u00a3545.9m) of cash collateral and letters of credit and had received \u00a3110.8m (2022: \u00a395.8m) of cash collateral and letters of credit principally to reduce exposures on credit risk.\n\nBank credit exposures, which are monitored and reported on daily, are calculated on a mark-to-market basis and adjusted for future volatility and probability of default. Any issues relating to these credit exposures are presented for discussion and review by the Tax and Treasury Committee.\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits which are readily convertible to cash. These are subject to insignificant risk of change in value or credit risk.\n\nDerivative financial instruments are entered into to cover the Group's market risks - commodity risk, interest rate risk, currency risk - and are consequently covered elsewhere in this note.\n\nTrade receivables represent the most significant exposure to credit risk and are stated after an allowance for impairment.",

Financial risk management continued\n\n## A6.2 Concentrations of risk\n\nTrade receivables recorded by reported segment held at the 31 March were:\n\n|                           | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| SSEN Transmission         | 8.0       | 7.9       |\n| SSEN Distribution         | 137.2     | 122.3     |\n| SSE Renewables            | 88.3      | 84.1      |\n| SSE Thermal               | 41.0      | 21.2      |\n| Gas Storage               | 1.5       | 1.4       |\n| Energy Customer Solutions |           |           |\n| Business Energy           | 386.9     | 231.3     |\n| SSE Airtricity            | 125.1     | 231.6     |\n| Distributed Energy        | 31.8      | 38.4      |\n| EPM                       | 567.5     | 679.3     |\n| Corporate Unallocated     | 16.7      | 16.4      |\n| Total SSE Group           | 1,404.0   | 1,433.9   |\n\nEnergy Customers Solution (Business Energy and SSE Airtricity) accounts for 36.5% (2022: 32.3%) of the Group's trade receivables from continuing operations. Trade receivables associated with the Group's 1.2 million electricity and gas customers are recorded within this business unit. The Group also has significant trade receivables associated with its EPM activities which are generally settled within two to four weeks from invoicing. The Group's exposure to credit risk is therefore subject to diversification with no exposure to individual retail customers totalling >10% of trade receivables. The largest customer balance, due from an EPM customer (also an EPM supplier), is 8% (2022: 7%) of the total trade receivables.\n\nThe ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was:\n\n|                                         | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Not past due                            | 1,229.0   | 1,167.7   |\n| Past due but not individually impaired: |           |           |\n| 0 - 30 days                             | 116.3     | 185.3     |\n| 31 - 90 days                            | 65.6      | 60.8      |\n| Over 90 days                            | 162.3     | 98.3      |\n|                                         | 1,573.2   | 1,512.1   |\n| Less: allowance for impairment          | (169.2)   | (78.2)    |\n| Net trade receivables                   | 1,404.0   | 1,433.9   |\n\nThe Group has past due debt which has not had an impairment allowance set aside to cover potential credit losses. The Group has certain procedures to pursue customers in significant arrears and believes its impairment policy in relation to such balances is appropriate. The increased ageing of the trade receivables results in an increase in provisions held in respect of them under the provision matrix approach employed. The Group also considers various risk factors when assessing the level of provision to recognise. Trade receivables and contract assets are written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.\n\nThe Group has other receivables which are financial assets totalling \u00a312.8m (2022: \u00a34.9m).\n\nThe movement in the allowance for impairment of trade receivables (continuing operations only) was:\n\n|                                                 | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Balance at 1 April                              | 78.2      | 77.1      |\n| Increase/(decrease) in allowance for impairment | 116.8     | (16.8)    |\n| Impairment losses recognised                    | (25.8)    | 17.9      |\n| Balance at 31 March                             | 169.2     | 78.2      |\n\nAt the end of each reporting period a review of the allowance for impairment of trade receivables (or bad debt provision) is performed by the respective businesses. Trade receivables do not contain a significant financing element, and therefore expected credit losses are measured using the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires lifetime expected credit losses to be recognised on initial recognition. A provision matrix is utilised to estimate the lifetime expected credit losses, based on the age, status and risk of each class of receivable, which is updated periodically to include changes to both forward-looking and historical inputs.\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## A6.3 Liquidity risk and Going Concern\n\nLiquidity risk, the risk that the Group will have insufficient funds to meet its liabilities, is managed by the Group's Treasury function. The Group can be exposed to significant movements in its liquidity position due to changes in commodity prices, working capital requirements, the impact of the seasonal nature of the business and phasing of its capital investment and recycling programmes.\n\nTreasury is responsible for managing the banking and liquidity requirements of the Group, risk management relating to interest rate and foreign exchange exposures, and for managing the credit risk relating to the banking counterparties with which it transacts. Short term liquidity is reviewed daily by Treasury, while the longer-term liquidity position is reviewed on a regular basis by the Board. The department's operations are governed by policies determined by the Board and any breaches of these policies are reported to the Tax and Treasury Committee and Audit Committee.\n\nIn relation to the Group's liquidity risk, the Group's policy is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.\n\nDuring the year, the Group's internal approach to managing liquidity was to seek to ensure that the Group had available committed borrowings and facilities equal to at least 105% of forecast borrowings over a rolling 6 month period.\n\nThe Group uses cash flow forecasts to monitor its ongoing borrowing requirements. Typically, the Group will fund any short-term borrowing positions by issuing commercial paper or borrowing from committed and uncommitted bank lines and will invest in money market funds when it has a cash surplus. Details of the Group's borrowings are disclosed at note 21. In addition to the borrowing facilities listed at note 21.3, the Group has \u00a350m of uncommitted bank lines and a \u00a315m overdraft facility.\n\nThe refinancing requirement in the 23/24 financial year is \u00a31.6bn, being the \u00a335m and \u00a3120m of US Private Placement maturing 28 April 2023 and 6 September 2023 respectively; \u00a3929m of short-term Commercial Paper that matures between April and June; \u20ac700m (\u00a3514m) Eurobond maturing 8 September 2023; \u00a350m of EIB loans maturing in August 2023. The directors are confident in the ability of the Group to maintain a funding level above 105% for the going concern assessment period based on the strong credit standing and borrowing history of the Group for both fixed debt and commercial paper, as discussed more fully below.\n\nGiven the committed bank facilities of \u00a33.5bn, \u00a32.75bn excluding Scottish Hydro Electric Transmission plc facilities, maintained by the Group and the current commercial paper market conditions, the Directors have concluded that both the Group and SSE plc as parent company have sufficient headroom to continue as a going concern. In coming to this conclusion, the Directors have taken into account the Group's credit rating and the successful issuance of \u00a314.4bn of medium to long term debt and Hybrid equity since February 2012, including \u00a31.6bn of long term funding in the 22/23 financial year being a \u20ac1bn NC6 Hybrid at 4% in April 2022 to re-finance the $900m and \u00a3300m Hybrids whose first call date was 16 September 2022, a 7 year \u20ac650m Eurobond at a coupon of 2.875% with an all-in cost of funding rate of just below 3% once fees and cost of pre-hedging have been included and a \u00a3350m dual tranche US Private Placement with Pricoa Capital being a \u00a3175m 10-year at 3.13% and a \u00a3175m 15-year at 3.24% giving an all-in average rate of 3.185% across both tranches.\n\nThe Group's period of Going Concern assessment is performed to 31 December 2024, 21 months from the balance sheet date, which is at least 12 months from the filing deadline of its subsidiary companies. As well as taking account of the factors noted, the Going Concern conclusion is arrived at after applying stress testing sensitivities to the Group's cash flow and funding projections including removal of proceeds from unconfirmed future divestments, negative and positive sensitivities on operating cash flows and uncommitted capex and other adjustments. The Group has also considered its obligations under its debt covenants. There have been no breaches of covenant in the year and the Group's projections support the expectation that there will be no breach of covenants over the period to 31 December 2024. The statement of going concern is included in the Audit Committee Report.\n\nAs at 31 March 2023, the value of outstanding cash collateral posted in respect of mark-to-market related margin calls on exchange traded positions was \u00a3316.3m (2022: cash posted \u00a374.7m).",

Financial risk management continued\n\n## A6.4 Commodity risk continued\n\n## Current hedging approach\n\nThe Group has traded in three principal commodities during the year, as well as the spreads between two or more commodity prices: power (baseload and other products); gas; and carbon (emissions allowances). Each commodity has different liquidity characteristics, which impacts on the degree of hedging possible. Similarly, each of the Group's assets carries different exposures to the commodity market and thus requires a different approach to hedging. As such, the Group's current hedging approach varies by each class of asset as follows:\n\n| Asset class     | Minimum Hedge Target                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Principal Commodity Exposures   |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| GB Wind         | Target to hedge less than 100% of anticipated wind energy output for the coming   12 months, progressively establishing the hedge over the 36 months prior to delivery.

The assets were commercially operated throughout the year and the business managed  its exposure to changes in the spread between summer and winter prices, market  volatility and plant availability. | Gas                             |\n| Business Energy | Sales to contract customers are 100% hedged: at point of sale for fixed, upon   instruction for flexi and on a rolling basis for tariff customers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Power, Gas                      |\n\nHowever, there are three principal areas where significant variations in earnings cannot be fully mitigated through hedging:\n\n- \u00b7 The impact of the weather on the volume of electricity produced from renewable sources;\n- \u00b7 The impact of operational matters such as unplanned outages; and\n- \u00b7 The ability of flexible thermal power stations to earn extrinsic income by providing services to the electricity system and by responding to shorter-term electricity market conditions.\n\nHedging is carried out by each asset class trading internally with EPM to effect these hedges and EPM then trading onwards with external counterparties and markets. EPM is only able to accept internal trades when there is sufficient liquidity to offset them in the external market or they can be offset with internal trades from other asset classes. In this way, the commodity risks to which EPM is individually exposed, are minimised.\n\nThe volumetric extent to which assets are hedged are reported monthly to the Group Energy Markets Exposures Risk Committee, and to the Energy Markets Risk Committee ('EMRC') on at least a quarterly basis. Variations to the hedging approach above will be required as markets and other factors (such as asset disposals) change. The EMRC also receives reporting on credit risk, other risk measures, and market liquidity in assessing whether any variations to the hedging approach are required.\n\nThe Group measures and manages the Commodity Risk associated with the financial and non-financial commodity contracts it is exposed to. However, within the Group's financial statements only certain commodity contracts are designated as financial instruments under IFRS 9. As a result, it is only the fair value of those IFRS 9 financial instruments which represents the exposure of the Group's commodity price risk under IFRS 7. This is a consequence of the Group's accounting policy which stipulates that commodity contracts which are designated as financial instruments under IFRS 9 should be accounted for on a fair value basis with changes in fair value reflected in profit or equity. Conversely, commodity contracts that are not designated as financial instruments under IFRS 9 will be accounted for as 'own use' contracts. As fair value changes in own use contracts are not reflected through profit or equity, these do not represent the IFRS 7 commodity price risk. Furthermore, other physical contracts can be treated as the hedging instrument in documented cash flow hedging relationships where the hedged item is the forecast future purchase requirement to meet production or customer demand. The accounting policies associated with financial instruments are explained in the Accompanying Information section A1 \uf150 .\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nThe Group's exposure to commodity price risk according to IFRS 7 is measured by reference to the Group's IFRS 9 commodity contracts. IFRS 7 requires disclosure of a sensitivity analysis for market risks that is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Group's financial position and performance to changes in market variables impacting upon the fair value or cash flows associated with the Group's financial instruments.\n\nTherefore, the sensitivity analysis provided discloses the effect on profit or loss and equity at the balance sheet date assuming that a reasonably possible change in the relevant commodity price had occurred and been applied to the risk exposures in existence at that date. The reasonably possible changes in commodity prices used in the sensitivity analysis were determined based on calculated or implied volatilities where available, or historical data.\n\nStrategic Report\n\nThe sensitivity analysis has been calculated on the basis that the proportion of commodity contracts that are IFRS 9 financial instruments remains consistent with those at that point. Excluded from this analysis are all commodity contracts that are not financial instruments under IFRS 9.\n\n|                        | 2023           | 2023                                                  | 2022           | 2022                                                  |\n|------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n|                        | Base Price (i) | Reasonably  possible  increase/ decrease in  variable | Base Price (i) | Reasonably  possible  increase/ decrease in  variable |\n| Commodity prices       |                |                                                       |                |                                                       |\n| UK gas (p/therm)       | 113            | +90/-71                                               | 313            | +190/-190                                             |\n| UK power (\u00a3/MWh)       | 149            | +89/-72                                               | 250            | +119/-119                                             |\n| UK carbon (\u00a3/tonne)    | 74             | +54/-39                                               | 76             | +73/-73                                               |\n| EU emissions (\u20ac/tonne) | 98             | +69/-54                                               | 79             | +76/-76                                               |\n| UK oil (US$/bbl)       | 597            | +290/-244                                             | 260            | +145/-145                                             |\n| IRL power (\u20ac/MWh)      | 172            | +138/-108                                             | 310            | +120/-120                                             |\n\nThe impacts of reasonably possible changes in commodity prices on profit after taxation based on the rationale described are as follows:\n\n| Incremental profit/(loss)            | 2023 Impact on profit  and equity  (\u00a3m)   | 2022 Impact on profit  and equity  (\u00a3m)   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Commodity prices combined - increase | 399.3                                     | 2,349.8                                   |\n| Commodity prices combined - decrease | (306.3)                                   | (2,349.8)                                 |\n\nThe sensitivity analysis provided is hypothetical and is based on the exposure to energy-related commodities, and their corresponding valuation under IFRS 9, that the Group has at each period end. This analysis should be used with caution as the impacts disclosed are not necessarily indicative of the actual impacts that would be experienced given it does not consider all interrelationships, consequences and effects of such a change in those prices.\n\n## A6.5 Currency risk\n\nThe Group publishes its consolidated financial statements in Sterling but also conducts business in foreign currencies. As a result, it is subject to foreign currency exchange risk arising from exchange rate movements which will be reflected in the Group's transaction costs or in the underlying foreign currency assets of its foreign operations.\n\nThe Group's policy is to use forward contracts, swaps and options to manage its exposures to foreign exchange risk. All such exposures are transactional in nature, and relate primarily to procurement contracts, commodity purchasing and related freight requirements, commodity hedging, long term plant servicing and maintenance agreements and the purchase and sale of carbon emission certificates. The policy is to seek to hedge 100% of its currency requirements arising under all committed contracts excepting commodity hedge transactions, the requirements for which are significantly less predictable. The policy for these latter transactions is to assess the Group's requirements on a rolling basis and to enter into cover contracts as appropriate.\n\nThe Group has foreign operations with significant Euro-denominated and JPY-denominated net assets. The Group's policy is to hedge its net investment in its foreign operations by ensuring the net assets whose functional currency cash flows are denominated in foreign currencies are matched by borrowings in the same currency. For SSE Pacifico, whose functional currency is JPY but which presently has limited capital commitments, SSE has no JPY denominated borrowings and hence has no current net investment hedge. For the acquired net assets whose functional cash flows are in Sterling, the Group will ensure Sterling denominated borrowings are in place to minimise currency risk.\n\nSignificant exposures are reported to, and discussed by, the Tax and Treasury Committee on an ongoing basis and additionally form part of the bi-annual Treasury report to the Audit Committee.",

The floating rate borrowings are provided by banks including the European Investment Bank (EIB). Such instruments include interest rate swaps and options, forward rate agreements and, in the case of debt raised in currencies other than Sterling, cross currency swaps. These practices serve to reduce the volatility of the Group's financial performance.\n\nAlthough interest rate derivatives are primarily used to hedge risk relating to current borrowings, under certain circumstances they may also be used to hedge future borrowings. Any such pre-hedging is unwound at the time of pricing the underlying debt, either through cash settlement on a net present value basis or by transacting offsetting trades. The floating rate borrowings mainly comprise cash advances from the European Investment Bank (EIB), however the Group is currently carrying a surplus cash position of \u00a3891.8m.\n\nThe impact of a change in interest rates is dependent on the specific details of the financial asset or liability in question. Changes in fixed rate financial assets and liabilities, which account for the majority of cash, loans and borrowings, are not measured at fair value through the income statement. In addition to this, changes to fixed-to-floating hedging instruments which are recorded under cash flow hedge accounting also do not impact the income statement. Changes in hedged items and hedging instruments recorded under fair value hedge accounting are recorded through the income statement. The exposure measured is therefore based on variable rate debt and instruments.\n\nThe net exposure to interest rates at the balance sheet date can be summarised thus:\n\n|                                                  | 2023 Carrying amount \u00a3m   | 2022 Carrying amount \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Interest bearing/earning assets and liabilities: |                           |                           |\n| - fixed                                          | (8,473.9)                 | (8,543.6)                 |\n| - floating                                       | 441.0                     | 328.9                     |\n|                                                  | (8,032.9)                 | (8,214.7)                 |\n| Represented by:                                  |                           |                           |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                        | 891.8                     | 1,049.3                   |\n| Derivative financial liabilities                 | 135.2                     | (199.3)                   |\n| Loans and borrowings                             | (8,654.0)                 | (8,671.2)                 |\n| Lease liabilities                                | (405.9)                   | (393.5)                   |\n|                                                  | (8,032.9)                 | (8,214.7)                 |\n\nFollowing from this, the table below represents the expected impact of a change of 100 basis points in short term interest rates at the reporting date in relation to equity and income statement. The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant. An increase in exchange rates would be a change to either the income statement or equity. The assessment is based on a revision of the fair value assumptions included in the calculated exposures in the previous table.\n\nAll sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis of the proportion of fixed to floating instruments being consistent as at the balance sheet date and is stated after the effect of taxation.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis is indicative only and it should be noted that the Group's exposure to such market rate changes is continually changing. The calculations are based on linear extrapolations of rate changes which may not reflect the actual result which would impact upon the Group.\n\n|                  |   2023 \u00a3m |   2022 \u00a3m |\n|------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Income statement |       3.7 |       2.5 |\n\nThe impact of a decrease in rates would be an equal reduction in the annual charge. There is no impact on equity as the analysis relates to the Group's net exposure at the balance sheet date. Contracts qualifying for hedge accounting are, by definition, part of the Group's covered position.",

The carrying value of these assets are approximately equivalent to fair value due to short term maturity aside from loans and borrowings which are subject to longer maturity dates.\n\nAll other financial assets and liabilities are measured at either Fair Value through Profit and Loss ('FVTPL') or Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income ('FVTOCI'). Fair values for energy derivatives are based on unadjusted quoted market prices, where actively traded. For energy derivatives that are not actively traded, interest rate instruments, foreign currency hedge contracts and cross currency swap contracts associated with foreign currency denominated long-term fixed rate debt, the fair values are determined by reference to closing rate market prices for similar instruments. Fair values for unquoted equity instruments are derived from venture capital or growth equity firm valuation statements.\n\nThe fair values are stated at a specific date and may be different from the amounts which will actually be paid or received on settlement of the instruments. The fair value of items such as property, plant and equipment, internally generated brands or the Group's customer base are not included as these are not considered financial instruments.\n\n## A7.2 Fair value hierarchy\n\nThe following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities.\n- \u00b7 Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices)\n- \u00b7 Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.\n\n|                              | 2023 Level 1 \u00a3m   | 2023 Level 2 \u00a3m   | 2023 Level 3 \u00a3m   | 2023 Total \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|\n| Financial assets             |                   |                   |                   |                 |\n| Energy derivatives           | -                 | 743.9             | 22.0              | 765.9           |\n| Interest rate derivatives    | -                 | 227.8             | -                 | 227.8           |\n| Foreign exchange derivatives | -                 | 11.5              | -                 | 11.5            |\n| Unquoted equity investments  | -                 | -                 | 27.4              | 27.4            |\n|                              | -                 | 983.2             | 49.4              | 1,032.6         |\n| Financial liabilities        |                   |                   |                   |                 |\n| Energy derivatives           | (189.6)           | (939.4)           | (23.8)            | (1,152.8)       |\n| Interest rate derivatives    | -                 | (92.6)            | -                 | (92.6)          |\n| Foreign exchange derivatives | -                 | (18.9)            | -                 | (18.9)          |\n| Loans and borrowings         | -                 | (154.6)           | -                 | (154.6)         |\n|                              | (189.6)           | (1,205.5)         | (23.8)            | (1,418.9)       |\n\nThere were no significant transfers out of Level 1 into Level 2 and out of Level 2 into Level 1 during the year ended 31 March 2023. There were no significant transfers out of Level 2 into Level 3 or out of Level 3 into Level 2 during the year ended 31 March 2023.\n\nDuring the year, the Group entered a 15-year Affiliate Contract for Difference ('ACfD') agreement with Seagreen Wind Energy Limited ('SWEL'). SWEL is a wholly owned subsidiary of Seagreen Holdco 1 Limited, a joint venture between the Group (49%) and TOTAL SE (51%). The Group also has some smaller commercial CfD arrangements entered into with non-government third parties that are also classified as derivatives. The ACfD and the commercial CfDs meet the definition of financial instruments and are classified as Level 3 on the fair value hierarchy due to significant unobservable inputs in the determination of fair value.\n\nThe fair value measurement impact in the income statement attributable to Level 3 CfDs was a loss of \u00a31.8m (2022: \u00a3nil). The fair value was determined using the income approach with reference to future market prices which are beyond the liquid period in the forward market.\n\nThe non-government CfDs were issued for \u00a3nil consideration, being the deemed transaction price. The Group has calculated that the contracts had a fair value on day 1, being the difference between the strike price per the contract and the forward market spot price. This valuation is based on unobservable inputs and is considered judgemental. Key assumptions applied when deriving the fair value are related to discount rates; electricity volumes; and electricity prices. In line with IFRS 9, the Day 1 gain is deferred and will be recognised over the life of the contract.\n\nThe Group's remaining Level 3 instruments are unquoted equity investments to which the Group made cash contributions of \u00a319.1m to in the year. The remaining movement (\u00a30.4m) was recognised in other comprehensive income.",

Hedge accounting\n\n## A8.1 Cash flow hedges\n\nThe Group designates contracts which qualify as hedges for accounting purposes either as cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. Cash flow hedges are contracts entered into to hedge a forecast transaction or cash flow risk generally arising from a change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates and which meet the effectiveness criteria prescribed by IFRS 9. The Group's accounting policy on cash flow hedges is explained in the Accompanying Information section A1 \uf150 .\n\nThe following table indicates the contractual maturities of the expected transactions and the qualifying cash flow hedges associated. Non-Sterling denominated contractual cash flows have been converted at the forward foreign exchange rate.\n\n| Cash flow hedges             | 2023 Carrying  amount   | 2023 Expected  cash  flows   | 2023 0 - 12  months   | 2023 1-2 years   | 2023 2-5 years   | 2023 > 5 years   | 2022 Carrying  amount   | 2022 Expected  cash  flows   | 2022 0 - 12  months   | 2022 1-2 years   | 2022 2-5 years   | 2022 > 5 years   |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Interest rate swaps:         |                         |                              |                       |                  |                  |                  |                         |                              |                       |                  |                  |                  |\n| Assets                       | 25.2                    | 28.1                         | 6.5                   | 5.5              | 15.8             | 0.3              | 5.7                     | 6.1                          | -                     | 2.3              | 3.4              | 0.4              |\n| Liabilities                  | -                       | -                            | -                     | -                | -                | -                | -                       | -                            | -                     | -                | -                | -                |\n|                              | 25.2                    | 28.1                         | 6.5                   | 5.5              | 15.8             | 0.3              | 5.7                     | 6.1                          | -                     | 2.3              | 3.4              | 0.4              |\n| Cross currency  swaps:       |                         |                              |                       |                  |                  |                  |                         |                              |                       |                  |                  |                  |\n| Assets                       | 178.9                   | 194.0                        | 110.1                 | 56.0             | 27.9             | -                | 160.5                   | 169.9                        | 27.8                  | 96.5             | 45.6             | -                |\n| Liabilities                  | (37.4)                  | (30.3)                       | (17.8)                | (17.6)           | (10.6)           | 15.7             | (132.7)                 | ( 1 27.9)                    | (54.2)                | (19.0)           | (47.7)           | (7.0)            |\n|                              | 141.5                   | 163.7                        | 92.3                  | 38.4             | 17.3             | 15.7             | 27.8                    | 42.0                         | (26.4)                | 77.5             | (2.1)            | (7.0)            |\n| Forward exchange  contracts: |                         |                              |                       |                  |                  |                  |                         |                              |                       |                  |                  |                  |\n| Assets                       | 2.4                     | (120.4)                      | (106.9)               | (11.7)           | (1.8)            | -                | 0.6                     | 9.6                          | 9.6                   | -                | -                | -                |\n| Liabilities                  | (11.5)                  | (337.7)                      | (292.0)               | (42.3)           | (3.4)            | -                | (43.4)                  | 521.8                        | 348.0                 | 137.1            | 36.7             | -                |\n|                              | (9.1)                   | (458.1)                      | (398.9)               | (54.0)           | (5.2)            | -                | (42.8)                  | 531.4                        | 357.6                 | 137.1            | 36.7             | -                |\n\n## A8.2 Net investment hedge\n\nThe Group's net investment hedge consists of debt issued in the same currency (\u20ac) as the net investment in foreign subsidiaries with \u20ac denominated functional currencies being the Airtricity Supply business, the thermal plants in Ireland and wind farms in Ireland and Southern Europe. The hedge compares the element of the net assets whose functional cash flows are denominated in \u20ac to the matching portion of the \u20ac borrowings held by the Group. This therefore provides protection against movements in foreign exchange rates. There is no net investment hedge in relation to SSE Pacifico as the Group has no JPY denominated debt.\n\nGains and losses in the hedge are recognised in equity and will be transferred to the income statement on disposal of the foreign operation (2023: \u00a343.1m loss, 2022: \u00a39.4m gain). Gains and losses on the ineffective portion of the hedge are recognised immediately in the income statement (2023: \u00a3nil, 2022: \u00a3nil).",

Principal accounting policies\n\n## 1.1 General information\n\nSSE plc (the Company) is a company domiciled in Scotland. The address of the registered office is given on the back cover. The Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about the Group.\n\n## 1.2 Basis of preparation\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law) including Financial Reporting Standard 101, 'Reduced Disclosure Framework'.\n\nUnder section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own income statement and related notes.\n\nIt has also taken advantage of the following disclosure exemptions available under FRS 101.\n\n- \u00b7 A Cash flow statement and related notes;\n- \u00b7 Related party disclosures;\n- \u00b7 Disclosures in respect of capital management; and\n- \u00b7 The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs.\n\nAs the consolidated financial statements of SSE plc include the equivalent disclosure, the Company has also taken advantage of the exemptions, under FRS 101, available in respect of the following disclosure:\n\n- \u00b7 Certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair value measurement and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial instrument disclosures\n\nThe Company previously assessed that, on the basis of materiality, the disclosures required under IFRS 2 Share-based Payment should be removed. The Company has assessed that at 31 March 2023 these disclosures continue to be immaterial to the Company's financial statements.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe Directors consider that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future (further details are contained in A6 \uf150 Accompanying Information of the consolidated financial statements). The financial statements are therefore prepared on a going concern basis.\n\n## Basis of measurement\n\nThe financial statements of the Company are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments, availablefor-sale financial assets and assets of the Company pension scheme which are stated at their fair value, and liabilities of the Company pension scheme which are measured using the projected unit credit method. The directors believe the financial statements present a true and fair view. The financial statements of the Company are presented in pounds sterling.\n\n## Critical accounting judgements and estimation uncertainty\n\nIn the process of applying the Company's accounting policies, management necessarily makes judgements and estimates that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. Changes in the assumptions underlying the estimates could result in a significant impact to the financial statements. The Group's key accounting judgement and estimation areas are noted in note 4.1 of the consolidated financial statements, with the most significant financial judgement areas as specifically discussed by the Audit Committee being highlighted separately. In particular, note 4.1(ii) Retirement benefit obligations, and the related disclosures in note 23, note 4.1(iv) Valuation of other receivables and note 4.3(ii) Decommissioning costs, of the consolidated financial statements are relevant to the Company.\n\n## Significant accounting policies\n\nThe significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these individual financial statements are set out below. These policies have been applied consistently to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Investments\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any impairment charges.\n\n## Interests in joint arrangements and associates\n\nAssociates are those investments over which the Company has significant influence but neither control nor joint control.\n\nThe Company's joint ventures and associates are stated at cost less any impairment.\n\n## Applicable Group accounting policies\n\nThe following significant accounting policies are consistent with those applied for the Group consolidated financial statements:\n\n- \u00b7 Equity and equity-related compensation benefits (Supplementary information A1.2 \uf150 )\n- \u00b7 Defined benefit pension scheme (Supplementary information A1.2 \uf150 )\n- \u00b7 Taxation (Supplementary information A1.2 \uf150 )\n- \u00b7 Financial instruments (Supplementary information A1 and A6 \uf150 )\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## 2. Supplementary financial information\n\n## 2.1 Auditor remuneration\n\nThe amounts paid to the Company's auditor in respect of the audit of these financial statements was \u00a30.4m (2022: \u00a30.4m).\n\nAmounts paid to the Company's auditor in respect of services to the Company other than the audit of the Company's financial statements have not been disclosed as the information is required instead to be disclosed on a consolidated basis.\n\n## 2.2 Employee numbers\n\nThe average number of people employed by the Company (including Executive Directors) during the year was 3 (2022: 3).\n\nThe costs associated with the employees of the Company, who are the Executive Directors of the Group, are borne by Group companies. No amounts are charged to the Company.\n\n## 2.3 Directors' remuneration and interests\n\nInformation concerning Directors' remuneration, shareholdings, options, long term incentive schemes and pensions is shown in the Remuneration Report on pages 166 to 187 \uf150 . No Director had, during or at the end of the year, any material interest in any other contract of significance in relation to the Group's business.\n\n## 3.

The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared and are entitled to one vote per share at meetings of the Company.\n\n- (i) Shareholders were able to elect to receive ordinary shares in place of the final dividend of 60.2p per ordinary share (in relation to year ended 31 March 2022) and the interim dividend of 29.0p (in relation to the current year) under the terms of the Company's scrip dividend scheme. This resulted in the issue of 18,241,941 and 9,413,103 new fully paid ordinary shares respectively (2022: 122,201,443 and 1,782,473). In addition, the Company issued 1.9m (2022: 0.6m) shares during the year under the savings-related share option schemes (all of which were settled by shares held in Treasury) for a consideration of \u00a318.0m (2022: \u00a36.3m).\n\nOf the 1,093.9m shares in issue, 3.6m are held as treasury shares.

The scheme is subject to an independent valuation at least every three years. The future benefit obligations are valued by actuarial methods on the basis of an appropriate assessment of the relevant parameters.\n\n## Pension summary:\n\n|                         | Scheme type     | Net actuarial loss recognised in  respect of the pension asset in the  statement of comprehensive income   | Net actuarial loss recognised in  respect of the pension asset in the  statement of comprehensive income   | Net pension asset   | Net pension asset   |\n|-------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                         |                 | 2023 \u00a3m                                                                                                    | 2022 \u00a3m                                                                                                    | 2023 \u00a3m             | 2022 \u00a3m             |\n| Scottish Hydro Electric | Defined benefit | (152.0)                                                                                                    | (24.6)                                                                                                     | 366.6               | 517.5               |\n| Net actuarial loss      |                 | (152.0)                                                                                                    | (24.6)                                                                                                     | 366.6               | 517.5               |\n\n## IFRIC 14 surplus restrictions\n\nThe value of Scottish Hydro Electric Pension Scheme assets recognised was previously impacted by the asset ceiling test which restricts the surplus that can be recognised to assets that can be recovered through future refunds or reductions in future contributions to the schemes, and may increase the value of scheme liabilities where there are minimum funding liabilities in relation to agreed contributions.\n\nIn 2016/17 the Group agreed with the trustees to the Scottish Hydro Electric Pension Scheme an amendment to the scheme rules to clarify that the Company has a clear right to any surplus upon final winding up of the scheme. This amendment removes the previous restriction on recognition of any surplus. The net pension asset of the Scottish Hydro Electric Pension Scheme at 31 March 2023 was equal to \u00a3366.6m (2022: \u00a3517.5m).\n\nThe individual pension scheme details based on the latest formal actuarial valuations are as follows:\n\n|                                         | Scottish Hydro Electric   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Latest formal actuarial valuation       | 31 March 2021             |\n| Valuation carried out by                | Hymans Robertson          |\n| Value of assets based on valuation      | \u00a32,050.5m                 |\n| Value of liabilities based on valuation | \u00a31,782.2m                 |\n| Valuation method adopted                | Projected Unit            |\n| Average salary increase                 | RPI +0.5%                 |\n| Average pension increase                | RPI                       |\n| Value of fund assets/accrued benefits   | 115.1%                    |\n\n## 10.1 Pension scheme assumptions\n\nThe scheme has been updated to 31 March 2023 by qualified independent actuaries.

The assumptions, equivalent to future longevity for members in normal health at age 65, are as follows:\n\n|                   |   At  31 March  2023 Male |   At  31 March  2023 Female |   At  31 March  2022 Male |   At  31 March  2022 Female |\n|-------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Currently aged 65 |                        22 |                          24 |                        22 |                          24 |\n| Currently aged 45 |                        24 |                          26 |                        24 |                          27 |\n\nThe impact on the scheme's liabilities of changing certain of the major assumptions is as follows:\n\n|                                          | At 31 March 2023                  | At 31 March 2023               | At 31 March 2022                  | At 31 March 2022              |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                                          | Increase/ decrease in  assumption | Effect on  scheme  liabilities | Increase/ decrease in  assumption | Effect on  scheme liabilities |\n| Rate of increase in pensionable salaries | 0.1%                              | +/-0.1%                        | 0.1%                              | +/-0.1%                       |\n| Rate of increase in pension payments     | 0.1%                              | +/-0.7%                        | 0.1%                              | +/-0.9%                       |\n| Discount rate                            | 0.1%                              | +/-0.7%                        | 0.1%                              | +/-1.0%                       |\n| Longevity                                | 1 year                            | +/-1.9%                        | 1 year                            | +/-2.0%                       |\n\nThese assumptions are considered to have the most significant impact on the scheme valuations.\n\n## Asset buy-in\n\nOn 1 October 2019, the Scottish Hydro Electric Pension Scheme entered into an asset buy-in, transferring the risk of volatility in the assumptions used to calculate the obligation for 1,800 pensioners and 567 dependents (covering c.\u00a3800m of the scheme's liabilities) to a third party. The asset buy-in is valued under the accounting principles of IFRS 13 and is considered a Level 3 instrument in the fair value hierarchy. This is in addition to a previous buy-in completed during the year ended 31 March 2018 when c.\u00a3250m of the scheme's assets and liabilities related to 617 pensioners and 190 dependents were transferred to a third party. The Company has now insured against volatility in obligations related to all pensioners to third parties (insurer PIC) and is now only exposed to valuation fluctuations related to active and deferred members.\n\n## 10.2 Valuation of pension scheme\n\n|                                             | Quoted \u00a3m   | Unquoted \u00a3m   | Value at  31 March 2023 \u00a3m   | Quoted \u00a3m   | Unquoted \u00a3m   | Value at  31 March 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------|---------------|------------------------------|-------------|---------------|------------------------------|\n| Equities                                    | 34.3        | -

SSE Services plc, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, has provided a guarantee to Group Trustee Independent Trustees in respect of Southern Electric Group of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme in respect of funding required by the Scheme.\n\nOn behalf of Scottish Hydro Electric Transmission plc, SSE plc has provided a guarantee to ABB Limited in connection with the use of HVDC Replica Control Panels for Caithness-Moray Project.\n\nOn behalf of SSE Contracting Limited (which was disposed on 30 June 2021), SSE plc continues to provide a guarantee to Tay Street Lighting (Leeds) Limited, Tay Valley Lighting (Newcastle & North Tayside) Limited and Tay Valley Lighting (Stroke on Trent) Limited in respect of provision and maintenance of public street lighting and illuminated traffic signage. Furthermore, on behalf of SSE E&P (UK) Limited, previously a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, now owned by a third party, SSE plc has provided the following 3 guarantees: a guarantee to Hess Limited in respect of decommissioning liabilities, a guarantee to Britoil Limited and Arco British Limited in respect of the acquisition of the Sean Field and also a guarantee to Perenco UK Limited in respect of a Sale and Purchase Agreement for the Minerva, Apollo and Mercury Fields.\n\nWhere the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee indebtedness of the other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make payment under the guarantee. The Company is continuing to assess the impact of the adoption of IFRS 17 to this treatment, which will be effective from 1 April 2023.\n\nStrategic Report\n\n## 13.

Estimates are based on the forecast remediation or clean-up costs at the projected date of decommissioning and are discounted for the time value of money. Within the agreement for the disposal of its Gas Production assets to Viaro Energy on 14 October 2021 (see note 12), the Company agreed to retain 60% (\u00a3238.2m) of the decommissioning provision within the business. \u00a350.5m (2022: \u00a313.1m) has been released for decommissioning during the current year due to a post disposal reassessment and movements in inflation and discounting assumptions. It is expected that the costs associated with decommissioning of these Gas Production assets will be incurred between 2023 and 2038.\n\n## Legal and restructuring provisions\n\nThe Company holds provisions related to reorganisation of the Group and certain provisions arising on disposal of subsidiaries or investments. In the year the Company released provisions in total of \u00a338.3m, of which \u00a335.0m for a tax indemnity provided to RockRose Energy Limited following the disposal of SSE E&P Limited on 14 October 2021 was released. In the year the Company utilised \u00a338.8m of the provision relating to restructuring and disposals. The remainder of this provision is expected to be settled in the next financial year.",

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 'Reduced Disclosure Framework' (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of the group and parent in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nThe non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard were not provided to the group or the parent company and we remain independent of the group and the parent company in conducting the audit.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the group and parent company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included:\n\n- \u00b7 Confirming our understanding of management's Going Concern process as well as the review controls in place over the preparation of the group's Going Concern model and the memoranda on going concern;\n- \u00b7 Engaging early with management to ensure all key matters were considered in their assessment;\n- \u00b7 Obtaining management's board approved forecast cash flows, covenant forecasts and sensitivities prepared by management to 31 December 2024, ensuring the same forecasts are used elsewhere within the group for accounting estimates and that the forecasts reflect the spend to come on the \u00a312.5bn committed as part of the NZAP Plus programme. We tested the models for arithmetical accuracy, as well as checking the net debt position at the year-end date which is the starting point for the model. We assessed the reasonableness of the cashflow forecast by analysing management's historical forecasting accuracy. We also ensured climate change considerations were factored into future cash flows. We performed reverse stress testing to understand how severe the downside scenarios would need be to result in negative liquidity or a covenant breach and how plausible were the scenarios. The EY assessment included consideration of all maturing debt through to 31 March 2025;\n- \u00b7 Reviewing management's assessment of mitigating options potentially available to the group to reduce cash flow spend in the Going Concern period, to determine their plausibility and whether such actions could be implemented by management. We have obtained support to determine whether these were within the control of management and evaluated the impact of these mitigations in light of our understanding of the business and its cost structures;\n- \u00b7 Reading the borrowing facilities agreements to assess their continued availability to the group and to ensure completeness of covenants identified by management;\n- \u00b7 Reviewing market data for indicators of potential contradictory evidence to challenge the company's going concern assessment including review of profit warnings within the sector and review of industry analyst reports. We held discussions with the Audit Committee to confirm the going concern position prepared by management; and\n- \u00b7 Considering whether management's disclosures in the financial statements sufficiently and appropriately reflect the going concern assessment and outcomes.\n\nStrategic Report\n\nDirectors' Report\n\nThe audit procedures performed in evaluating the director's assessment were performed by the Group audit team. We also considered the financial and non-financial information communicated to us from our component teams for sources of potential contrary indicators which may cast doubt over the going concern assessment.\n\n## Our key observations\n\nThe group is forecast to continue to be profitable and generate positive cashflows during the going concern period. Our reverse stress test scenario indicated that the group would need to be exposed to severe downside events impacting profitability and cash flows in order to breach liquidity or covenants. The severe downside scenario assumed full repayment of debt maturing over the going concern period, no new refinancing over the going concern period, no uncommitted disposal proceeds, a \u00a3500m group contingency to mitigate any downside performance against budget, offset by mitigating actions within managements control. We consider such a scenario to be highly unlikely, however, in unlikely events, including the business not performing in line with budget, management consider that the impact can be mitigated by further cash and cost saving measures, which are within their control, or through external fund raising, or a combination of both during the going concern period.\n\nThe group's principal source of funding (the revolving credit facility) extends beyond the going concern period (to 2025/2026). Having considered our severe downside and reverse stress test scenarios, we have not identified a plausible scenario where the Group would be unable to maintain cash flow liquidity and covenant headroom during the going concern period.\n\nWe found the capital commitments in the cash flow forecasts to be reflective of the spend to come on the \u00a312.5bn committed as part of the NZAP Plus programme.\n\n## Going concern conclusion\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period to 31 December 2024.\n\nIn relation to the group and parent company's reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## Overview of our audit approach\n\n| Audit scope       | \u00b7  We performed an audit of the complete financial information of 19 components and audit procedures on  specific balances for a further 21 components. \u00b7  The components where we performed full or specific audit procedures accounted for 95% of Adjusted Profit  before tax, 95% of Revenue and 94% of Total assets.   |\n|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Key audit matters | \u00b7  Impairment and reversal of impairment of certain power stations and gas storage assets; \u00b7  Group and parent pension obligations; \u00b7  Accounting for estimated revenue recognised.                                                                                                                                        |\n| Materiality       | \u00b7  Overall Group materiality of \u00a385.2m, which represents 5% of normalised adjusted profit before tax.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n\n## An overview of the scope of the parent company and group audits\n\n## Tailoring the scope\n\nOur assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each company within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the group and effectiveness of group-wide controls, changes in the business environment, the potential impact of climate change and other factors such as recent Internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each company.\n\nIn assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the 220 (2022: 149) reporting components of the Group, we selected 38 (2022: 35) components covering entities within the UK and Ireland, which represent the principal business units within the Group.\n\nOf the 38 components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of 19 (2022: 19) components ('full scope components') which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For the remaining 21 (2022: 16) components ('specific scope components'), we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within that component that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile.",

For the current year, the full scope components contributed 82% (2022: 78%) of the Group's adjusted profit before tax, 94% (2022: 94%) of the Group's Revenue and 48% (2022: 77%) of the Group's Total assets. The specific scope component contributed 13% (2022: 20%) of the Group's adjusted profit before tax, 1% (2022: 2%) of the Group's Revenue and 46% (2022: 16%) of the Group's Total assets. The audit scope of these components may not have included testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have contributed to the coverage of significant accounts tested for the Group. We also instructed 3 locations to perform specified procedures over certain aspects of Cash & Bank, Goodwill and Equity Investments in associates and jointly controlled entities, due to significant balances held within each location.\n\nOf the remaining 182 (2022: 114) components that together represent 9% (2022: 2%) of the Group's adjusted profit before tax, none are individually greater than 1% (2022: 1%) of the Group's adjusted profit before tax. For these components, we performed other procedures, including analytical review, intercompany eliminations and obtaining audit evidence to respond to any potential risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements.\n\nThe charts below illustrate the coverage obtained from the work performed by our audit teams.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| ADJUSTED PROFIT BEFORE TAX    | REVENUE                      | TOTAL ASSETS                  |\n|-------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| 82% Full scope components     | 94% Full scope components    | 48% Full scope components     |\n| 13% Specific scope components | 1% Specific scope components | 46% Specific scope components |\n| 5% Other procedures           | 5% Other procedures          | 6% Other procedures           |\n\n## Changes from the prior year\n\nThere have been minimal changes in scoping from the prior year, other than scoping in the acquisition of Triton (allocated as a full scope component). There have been some modifications to specific scope entities to reflect higher levels of trading within certain entities compared to the prior period to maintain appropriate coverage.\n\n## Involvement with component teams\n\nIn establishing our overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be undertaken at each of the components by us, as the primary audit engagement team, by component auditors from other EY global network firms operating under our instruction, or by third party auditors where we issued instructions. Of the 19 full scope components, audit procedures were performed on 2 of these directly by the primary audit team. For the 17 full scope and 21 specific scope components, where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.\n\nThe majority of full and specific scope components were led by the lead audit engagement partner, Annie Graham. For the remaining entities there were regular calls held between the lead audit engagement partner and component partners, with either file reviews performed by the primary team over audit documentation that has not been retained within the group audit file, or retention of key audit documentation on the group audit file.\n\nThis was the first year where a non-EY auditor was involved in a specific scope component, following the acquisition of Triton. We issued instructions, held regular calls with them and attended an on site file review and closing meeting. Other than the Irish Airtricity and Triton entities in scope, all other entities in scope were based within Scotland (Perth and Glasgow), where lead audit partner Annie Graham visited UK divisions throughout the year-end audit. Management meetings were held in person and remotely throughout the year across both the UK and Ireland. Annie also visited the non-EY component auditors of Triton.\n\nThe division and non-EY component visits involved discussion of audit approach, attending planning and closing meetings (some of which were held virtually), meeting with local management and reviewing relevant audit working papers on risk areas. The primary team interacted regularly with the component teams where appropriate during various stages of the audit, reviewed relevant working papers and were responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.\n\n## Climate change\n\nThe financial statement and audit risks related to climate change and the energy transition remain an area of audit focus in FY23. There continues to be increasing interest from stakeholders as to how climate change will impact SSE plc. The energy sector has a critical role to play in decarbonisation, by removing carbon from electricity which in turn will support other sectors. SSE operates principally within the UK and Ireland and both are seeking to achieve net zero across their economies by 2050.\n\nStrategic Report\n\nDirectors' Report\n\nThis year saw the government make targets and policy actions to tackle the UK energy crises on climate impacts, affordability and supply. The UK Governments targets include plans to decarbonise the UK's power system by 2035, support for up to 59,000 jobs in 2024 and up to 120,000 jobs in 2030 and mobilisation of additional public and private investment of \u00a3150-270 billion in line with their 2037 delivery pathway. The importance of cheap, clean and homegrown energy has become more important in order to reduce the UKs reliance on expensive and volatile overseas gas markets. In addition to the UK, governments across Europe and the world looked to recalibrate and expedite their renewable energy ambitions including publishing their carbon neutral pathways to meet 2050 targets.\n\nDuring the year, SSE has continued to make progress against their Net Zero Acceleration Plan and updated their strategy in November 2022 to take account of feedback from shareholders and other stakeholders. The changes involved the inclusion of scope 3 investments to recognise SSE's joint acquisition of Triton Power, the addition of cross-cutting issues to recognise the importance that climate adaptation and resilience play in the transition to net zero and further enhancement of the definition of net zero to SSE. As part of the 31 March 23 results, SSE announced a \u00a35.5bn increase to the committed capital pathway through NZAP Plus to further accelerate target delivery.\n\nSSE's long-term net zero ambitions are supported by a series of interim targets approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), as referenced by SSE within page 40 \uf150 . The Group committed to a \u00a312.5bn five-year investment plan. SSE intend to cut absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions by 72.5% between 2017 and 2030, are targeting net zero for scopes 1 and 2 by 2040 and net zero for all remaining scope 3 emissions by 2050, providing the appropriate policy mechanisms are in place to support security of supply for customers as noted on page 39 \uf150 .\n\nIn FY23, for the first time, SSE is compliant with the TCFD recommendations and recommended disclosures. The Group has determined that the most significant future impacts from climate change on its operations will be from variable wind generation risk caused by changes in climate patterns, storm damage network risk through increased severity of extreme weather events, accelerated gas closure risk through climate change and wind-capture market risk where the average wholesale power prices are lower as a result of more zero marginal cost wind generation coming on to the electricity system. These are explained on pages 42 to 45 \uf150 in the required Task Force for Climate related Financial Disclosures and on pages 68 to 69 \uf150 in the principal risks and uncertainties, which form part of the 'Other information,' rather than the audited financial statements. Our procedures on these disclosures therefore consisted solely of considering whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated. As described in note 4, the financial statement impact of climate is considered to have most impact on impairment, decommissioning, going concern & viability and decommissioning estimates.\n\nGovernment and societal responses to climate change risks are still developing, and are interdependent upon each other, and consequently financial statements cannot capture all possible future outcomes as these are not yet known. The degree of certainty of these changes may also mean that they cannot be taken into account when determining asset and liability valuations and the timing of future cash flows under the requirements of IAS 36. Budgets and forecasts for SSE plc reflect the spend to come on the \u00a312.5bn investment programme. In notes 15 and 20 to the financial statements supplementary sensitivity disclosures reflecting the impact of climate with regards to valuation of property, plant and equipment, impairment assessment of goodwill and valuation of decommissioning provisions and the impact of reasonably possible changes in key assumptions have been provided and significant judgements and estimates relating to climate change have been described within the aforementioned notes. We have ensured the completeness of climate consideration as part of our impairment audit procedures, including those referred to within our impairment KAM below.\n\nIn order to respond to the impact of climate change, we ensured we had the appropriate skills and experience on the audit team. Our audit team included professionals with significant experience in climate change and energy valuations. Our audit procedures were carried out by the group and component teams, with the component teams working under the direction of the group team. Our audit effort in considering climate change focused on ensuring that the effects of material climate risks disclosed on pages 42 to 45 \uf150 have been appropriately reflected in asset values and useful life and associated disclosures where values are determined through modelling future cash flows, being impairment considerations over Intangible assets and PP&E, and in the timing and nature of liabilities recognised, being decommissioning provisions. In addition, we performed detailed testing of the sensitivities noted in the accounts. Details of our procedures and findings on impairment are included in our key audit matters below.\n\nIn FY23 SSE conducted scenario analysis of its material climate related opportunities and risks. With the support of our climate change internal specialists, we considered managements scenario planning and modelling of these four risks and five opportunities disclosed on pages 42 to 45 \uf150 . We reviewed and challenged the impact pathways developed and basis of the key assumptions included within these scenarios. We verified the transition risk scenario frameworks used within the modelling to challenge the appropriateness, applicability to SSE current and future business model to ensure the accuracy of the financial impact ranges disclosed on pages 42 to 45 \uf150 . We challenged the Directors' considerations of climate change in their assessment of going concern and viability and associated disclosures. We also read the Other information in the annual report, and in doing so, considered whether the Other information, which includes SSE's climate targets, is materially consistent with the financial statements. We also considered consistency to other areas of assumptions, judgements and estimates and where applicable the procedures performed have been included within our KAMs below.\n\nWhilst the group have stated their commitment to the Paris Agreement to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, and also to their acceleration plan of their net zero ambitions which plans a short term (to 2025), medium term (2025-2035) and long term (2035-2050) roadmap, there may still be some areas in which the group currently unable to determine the full future economic impact on their business model, operational plans and customers to achieve this and therefore as set out above the potential impacts are incorporated to the extent of management's best estimate at 31 March 2023.",

These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nKey observations communicated\n\n| Risk                      | Our response to the risk   | to the Audit Committee   |\n|---------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Impairment or reversal of | Scoping:                   | We confirmed that the    |\n\nStrategic Report\n\nDirectors' Report\n\nKey observations communicated to the Audit Committee\n\n| Risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Our response to the risk                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                  |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Key assumptions:  Using our sector experience and our specialists we  benchmarked to industry sources, where appropriate, the  directors' judgement on the key assumptions including,  future power prices, power volatility, forecast power  demand, carbon prices, load factors, discount rate,   useful economic life and operating expenditure.

We compared the unbilled revenue estimation to  benchmark expectation. Benchmark expectation was  derived from the external settlements data combined with  billing frequency at an MPAN (Meter Point Administration  Number) level, usage and price movement from last billing  date to year end. We have analysed and assessed                                                   |\n|        | Specifically to the EBRS projected claim: Using our custom-built analytics tool, we prepared an  independent projection of the total claim forecast to  31 March 2023 and compared this to the EBRS income  recognised. We used claims submitted to date as our base  point and adjusted for extrapolated claimed invoices for the  remaining claim period, incorporated an estimated range of  outcomes on circa 18,000 of meters where claims have not  yet been made; and adjusted for reductions in rebilled  invoices claimed based on estimated meter reading. |\n\nWe have removed the prior year KAM relating to the SSE disposal programme given this was completed in prior year.\n\n## Our application of materiality\n\nWe apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.\n\n## Materiality\n\nThe magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Group to be \u00a385.2 million (2022: \u00a357.9 million), which is 5% (2022: 5% of adjusted profit before tax) of normalised adjusted profit before tax. Our key criterion in determining materiality remains our perception of the needs of SSE's stakeholders. We consider which earnings, activity or capital-based measure aligns best with their expectations. With the volatility in the Energy market seen this year, we changed our materiality basis from adjusted profit before tax to normalised adjusted profit before tax. We believe that normalised adjusted profit before tax provides us with a consistent measure of underlying year-on-year performance as it excludes the impact of non-recurring items which can significantly fluctuate year-on-year and do not provide a true picture of the profit benchmark that would affect the decisions of the users of the financial statements. Through applying a normalised earnings approach, large year-on-year swings driven primarily by price fluctuations rather than specific structural changes to SSE's business are minimised.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Parent Company to be \u00a3137.1 million (2022: \u00a395 million), which is 2% (2022: 2%) of Net Assets. The materiality has been capped at the group materiality of \u00a385.2 million.\n\n| Starting basis   | \u00b7  FY23 loss before tax - \u00a3205.6m (FY22: \u00a33,482.2m profit)                                                                                                        |\n|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Adjustments      | \u00b7  Movement on operating and financing derivatives -   FY23 \u00a32,351.5m; FY22 (\u00a32,121.4m)                                                                           |\n|                  | \u00b7  Non-recurring exceptional items - FY23 \u00a30.4m; FY22 (\u00a3269.2m) \u00b7  JV Tax - FY23 \u00a3104m; FY22 \u00a346.3m \u00b7  Variance from forecast to actual PBT FY23 nil; FY22 \u00a321.2m |\n| Materiality      | \u00b7  Totals FY23 \u00a32,250.3m adjusted profit before tax; FY22 \u00a31,159m \u00b7  Average to normalise FY23 \u00a31,704.7m \u00b7  Materiality of \u00a385.2m (5% of materaility basis)       |",

It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.\n\nOn the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group's overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 75% (2022: 50%) of our planning materiality, namely \u00a363.9 million (2022: \u00a328.9 million). The move from 50% to 75% reflects the continued process improvements and a low number and value of corrected and uncorrected errors in the prior year.\n\nAudit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was \u00a38.9m to \u00a321.0m (2022: \u00a34.9m to \u00a315.9m).\n\n## Reporting threshold\n\nAn amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.\n\nWe agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of \u00a34.3m (2022: \u00a32.9m), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\n\nWe evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report set out on pages 1 to 191 \uf150 , including the strategic report and the directors' report set out on pages 1 to 109 and 110 to 191 \uf150 respectively, other than the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\n\nIn our opinion, the part of the directors' remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.\n\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 the information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\n- \u00b7 the strategic report and the directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\n\n## Matters on which we are required to report by exception\n\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors' report.\n\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:\n\n- \u00b7 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or\n- \u00b7 the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors' Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\n- \u00b7 certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or\n- \u00b7 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\n\nStrategic Report\n\nDirectors' Report\n\n## Corporate Governance Statement\n\nWe have reviewed the directors' statement in relation to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the group and company's compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules.\n\nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n- \u00b7 Directors' statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties identified set out on page 91 \uf150 ;\n- \u00b7 Directors' explanation as to its assessment of the company's prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period is appropriate set out on page 71 \uf150 ;\n- \u00b7 Director's statement on whether it has a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities set out on page 191 \uf150 ;\n- \u00b7 Directors' statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out on page 154 \uf150 ;\n- \u00b7 Board's confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks set out on page 68 and 158 \uf150 ;\n- \u00b7 The section of the annual report that describes the review of effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set out on page 158 \uf150 ; and;\n- \u00b7 The section describing the work of the audit committee set out on page 150 \uf150 .\n\n## Responsibilities of directors\n\nAs explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement set out on page 191 \uf150 , the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\n## Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\n\nHowever, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the company and management.\n\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the group and determined that the most significant are IFRS, FRS101, the Companies Act 2006 and UK Corporate Governance Code and relevant tax compliance regulations in the jurisdictions in which the group operates. We also considered non-compliance of regulatory requirements, including the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) and regulations levied by the UK Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulatory Authority. We confirmed our understanding with the Internal Head of Regulation.\n- \u00b7 We understood how SSE plc is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management, internal audit, those responsible for legal and compliance procedures and the company Secretary. We verified our enquiries through our review of board minutes and papers provided to the Audit Committee.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the susceptibility of the group's financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by meeting with management from various parts of the business to understand where it considered there was susceptibility to fraud. We also considered performance targets and their propensity to influence on efforts made by management to manage earnings. We considered the programmes and controls that the group has established to address risks identified, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud; and how senior management monitors those programmes and controls. Where the risk was considered to be higher, we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud risk.\n- \u00b7 Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved: journal entry testing, with a focus on manual consolidation journals and journals indicating large or unusual transactions based on our understanding of the business; enquiries of legal counsel, group management, internal audit, business area management at all full and specific scope management; and focused testing. In addition, we completed procedures to conclude on the compliance of the disclosures in the annual report and accounts with all applicable requirements.",

Revenue  earned from energy related services may either be recognised over the expected contractual period  or following performance of the service, depending on the underlying performance obligation.                                                                   |\n| Distributed  Energy          | Distributed Energy                  | The provision of services to enable customers to optimise and manage low-carbon energy use;  development and management of battery storage and solar assets; distributed generation,  independent distribution, heat and cooling networks, smart buildings and EV charging activities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| EPM & I                      | Energy Portfolio  Management  (EPM) | The provision of a route to market for the Group's Renewable and Thermal generation businesses  and commodity procurement for the Group's energy supply businesses in line with the Group's  stated hedging policies. Revenue from physical sales of electricity, gas and other commodities  produced by SSE is recognised as supplied to either the national settlements body or the customer,  based on either the spot price at the time of delivery or trade price where that trade is eligible for  'own use' designation. The sale of commodity optimisation trades is presented net in cost of sales  alongside purchase commodity optimisation trades. |\n\nThe Group's reportable operating segments for 'Renewables', 'Thermal' and 'Business Energy' are substantially aligned to the business segments reported in the Consolidated Segmental Statement (CSS). However, it should be recognised that there are differences between the two disclosures, primarily driven by the Licence requirements - these are described in the notes below and shown in the table reconciling the CSS to the financial statements.\n\n## How the accounts are presented\n\nThe financial information presented in the CSS is based on operating activities of the Group's electricity generation businesses ('Renewables' and 'Thermal' segments described above) and the non-domestic electricity and gas supply business ('Business Energy' segment described above) in Great Britain. The paragraphs that follow describe how SSE's Renewables, Thermal and Business Energy (non-domestic supply) businesses interact with Energy Portfolio Management (EPM), which is the Group's energy markets business. The basis of preparation defines the revenues, costs and profits of each business and describe in more detail the transfer pricing arrangements in place for the financial year ended 31 March 2023. The CSS has been prepared on a going concern basis as set out in note A6.3 \uf150 of SSE plc's Annual Report.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Group's 'Renewables' business sells electricity and Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) from onshore and offshore windfarms and qualifying hydro to the Group's EPM business.\n\n'Thermal' sells electricity in respect of gas generation to EPM. It also receives external income in respect of ancillary services, balancing market participation and other contractual arrangements with third parties including government. It purchases its requirement for gas, oil and carbon from EPM.\n\n'Business Energy' sells electricity and gas to circa 0.2m business customer accounts in Great Britain and procures electricity, gas REGOS, RGGOs and ROCs from EPM.\n\nEPM acts as a route to market for Renewables and Thermal, and as counterparty with the external market for the procurement of electricity and gas for SSE Energy Services and Business Energy. EPM does not form part of the CSS as it is not within the scope defined by Ofgem. The policies governing the forward hedging activity undertaken by EPM are overseen by Energy Markets Risk Committee, whose responsibilities and roles are described on page 160 \uf150 of SSE Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2023.\n\nStrategic Report\n\nDirectors' Report\n\n## Renewable Electricity Generation\n\nThe Renewables profit and loss account above is based on the Group's electricity generation activity derived from natural sources of energy to produce electricity which includes wind, hydro and pump storage powered generation.\n\nRenewables as presented in the CSS includes revenue and operating profit for wholly owned renewable generation assets and also a proportion of turnover and operating profit in respect of joint ventures, joint operations and associate generation companies 1 . The principal joint ventures, joint operations and associates included are Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Limited, Clyde Windfarm (Scotland) Limited, Stronelairg Windfarm Limited, Dunmaglass Windfarm Limited, Greater Gabbard Offshore Winds Limited and Seagreen Wind Energy Limited. A full list can be found in note A3 \uf150 of SSE's audited financial statements.\n\nThe Renewables profitability statement bears the risks and rewards for plant performance and renewable generation output, changes in the power price achieved for renewable generation and the impact of weather.\n\nIndividual line items in the Renewables profit and loss account above are comprised of:\n\nRevenue From Sales of Electricity - revenue is recognised as generated and supplied to the national settlements body. Revenue is sold to the wholesale market through EPM at either the spot price at the time of delivery, or trade price where that trade is eligible for 'own use' designation. Revenue includes the sale of ROCs generated from qualifying plant to EPM. Generation volumes are the volume of power actually sold to the wholesale market.\n\nOther Revenue - includes ancillary services, capacity income, balancing market participation and other miscellaneous income.\n\nTransportation Costs - include Use of System charges and market participation costs.\n\nOther Direct Costs -include power purchase agreement ('PPA') costs, site costs and management charges from EPM.\n\nIndirect Costs - include salaries and other people costs, asset maintenance, rates, corporate costs and IT charges.\n\nDepreciation and Amortisation - the depreciation shown in the CSS is the underlying charge based on the useful remaining life of the assets.\n\n- 1 The PPA's that SSE has with its joint venture companies Clyde Windfarm (Scotland) Limited, Stronelairg Windfarm Limited and Dunmaglass Windfarm Limited provide SSE with contractual entitlement to 100% of the output of the windfarms. Accordingly, SSE has reported its rights to those volumes within its Renewables statistics and has also, as mandated by Ofgem, included 50% of the JV revenue in the CSS.\n\n## Thermal Electricity Generation\n\nThe Thermal profit and loss account above is based on the Group's conventional (thermal) electricity generation activity. Conventional generation is considered to be any generation where fuel is consumed to produce electricity and includes gas and oil fueled generation.\n\nThermal as presented in the CSS includes revenue and operating profit for wholly owned thermal generation assets and also a proportion of turnover and operating profit in respect of joint ventures 2 . The principal joint ventures included are Seabank Power Limited, Marchwood Power Limited and Triton Power Holdings Limited (acquired 1 September 2022). A full list can be found in note A3 \uf150 of SSE's audited financial statements.\n\nThe Thermal profitability statement bears the risks and rewards for plant performance, changes in market 'spark' (the marginal profit for generating electricity by gas), changes in government and EU policy particularly surrounding emissions.\n\nIndividual line items in the Thermal profit and loss account above are comprised of:\n\nRevenue From Sales of Electricity - revenue is recognised as generated and supplied to the national settlements body. Revenue is sold to the wholesale market through EPM at either the spot price at the time of delivery, or trade price where that trade is eligible for 'own use' designation. Generation volumes are the volume of power sold to the wholesale market.\n\nOther Revenue - includes ancillary services, capacity income, balancing market participation and other miscellaneous income.\n\nDirect Fuel Costs - Thermal procures fuel and carbon from EPM at wholesale market prices. The cost of fuel also includes the long term external purchase contracts and the impact of financial hedges. The WACOF (weighted average cost of fuel) calculation includes the costs of carbon emissions (reported in the environmental and social obligations cost line in the CSS).\n\nTransportation Costs - include Use of System charges and market participation costs.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Costs - include carbon costs.\n\n- 2 The tolling arrangements that SSE has with its joint venture Marchwood Power Limited provide SSE with contractual entitlement to 100% of the output of the power station. Accordingly, SSE has reported its rights to those volumes within its Thermal statistics and has also, as mandated by Ofgem, included 50% of the JV revenue in the CSS.",

Non-domestic volumes are expressed at customer meter point. Also included in 'Other revenue' is \u00a30.7bn recognised from the Energy Bill Relief Government Scheme which commenced in October 2022 to support non-domestic customers.\n\nDirect Fuel Costs - Business Energy does not engage in the trading of electricity and gas and procures all of its electricity and gas from EPM. The method by which EPM procures energy is at an arm's length arrangement on behalf of Business Energy is governed by Business Energy's forward hedging policy. The forward trades between Business Energy and EPM are priced at wholesale market prices at the time of execution and any differences in volume and reconciliation at the time of delivery is marked to the spot price on the day. WACOG (weighted average cost of gas) also includes all Allocation reconciliations and Unidentified Gas. The WACOE and WACOG also consist of trades marked to wholesale prices when committed at the point of sale for fixed price customer contracts or when a customer instructs SSE to purchase energy in respect of flexi-priced contracts. This transfer pricing methodology reflects how Business Energy actually acquired its energy. There have been no material changes in the transfer pricing policy in respect of Business Energy since the CSS for the financial year ending 31 March 2023.\n\nTransportation Costs - these include transportation, transmission and distribution use of system costs and BSUOS.\n\nEnvironmental and Social Obligation Costs - relate to policies designed to modernise and decarbonise the energy system in Great Britain and include ROCs, Feed in Tariff, charges under the Capacity Mechanism and CfD schemes and charges in relation to 'assistance for areas with high electricity distribution costs' (AAHEDC). REGO, RGGOs and GOO costs related to these schemes are also included in this section of the CSS. Industry Mutualisation costs have also been allocated to this element of the statement.\n\nOther Direct Costs - include: industry settlement costs, management and market access charges from EPM and other miscellaneous costs.\n\nIndirect Costs - include: sales and marketing, customer service, bad debts and collections, metering costs, commercial costs, central costs - including information technology, property, corporate, telecoms costs and costs incurred to meet Smart Metering rollout obligations for the year. Where costs cannot be directly allocated to a fuel (electricity/gas), they have been allocated using costing models based on activity, customer revenue or customer numbers - whichever is the most appropriate.\n\nBusiness Energy's profit and loss account bears the risk and rewards arising from the volatility in demand for energy, caused by the weather, consumption per customer and customer churn. It is also exposed to swings in wholesale costs and the uncertainty surrounding its share of government environmental and social schemes.\n\n## EPM\n\nEPM is responsible for optimising the Group's electricity, gas and other commodity requirements. The hedging activity undertaken by EPM is governed by the Group's Energy and Markets Risk Committee in accordance with the Statement on SSE's Approach to Hedging published in November 2018.\n\nStrategic Report\n\nDirectors' Report\n\n## Business Functions\n\nThe business functions in SSE have already been described in this document.

There are items which are in the financial statements and not in the CSS; and also there are items which Ofgem has requested be included in the CSS which are not in the financial statements.\n\n## Notes\n\n- 1 Income from the Energy Bill Relief Government Scheme which commenced in October 2022 to support non-domestic customers, recognised in 'Other operating income' in the SSE Financial Statements;\n- 2 Non-GB Electricity Generation relates to SSE's Renewables business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland;\n- 3 SSE applies equity accounting for the majority of its investments in JVs and Associates (which means it only includes its share of the profits/losses), in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The Ofgem mandated basis of preparation of the CSS requires that the proportionate share of revenue, costs and profits are shown in the CSS. The revenue shown in the CSS for JVs and Associates is not present in the financial statements and is therefore a reconciling item. The share of profits however are present in both CSS and financial statements, therefore no reconciliation is necessary;\n- 4 Non-GB Electricity Generation relates to SSE's Thermal business in the Republic of Ireland.\n\n## Adjustments to reported profit before tax\n\nSSE focuses its internal and external reporting on 'adjusted profit before tax' which excludes exceptional items, re-measurements arising from IFRS 9, depreciation on fair value uplifts and removes taxation on profits of joint ventures and associates, because this reflects the underlying profits of SSE, reflects the basis on which it is managed and avoids the volatility that arises out of IFRS 9. Therefore, these items have been excluded from the CSS.\n\nStrategic Report\n\nDirectors' Report\n\n## Independent auditor's report to the Consolidated Segmental Statement\n\n## Opinion\n\nWe have audited the Consolidated Segmental Statement financial statements of SSE plc (the Company) for the year ended 31 March 2023, which comprise the Consolidated Segmental Statement (CSS), Basis of preparation, Reconciliation of CSS to the Annual Report of SSE plc and the related disclosure notes. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is a special purpose framework comprising the financial reporting provisions of Ofgem's Standard condition 16B of Electricity Generation licences and Standard 19A of Electricity and Gas Supply Licenses.\n\nIn our opinion, the accompanying CSS of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2023 is prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the requirements of Standard condition 16B of Electricity Generation licences and Standard 19A of Electricity and Gas Supply Licenses and the basis of preparation on pages 337 to 341 \uf150 .\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) including 'ISA (UK) 800 (Revised) Special Considerations - Audits of Financial Statements Prepared in Accordance with Special Purpose Frameworks' . Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the CSS financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the CSS, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the CSS is appropriate.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of 19 months through to 31 December 2024.\n\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## Emphasis of Matter - Basis of Accounting and Restriction on Distribution and Use\n\nWe draw attention to pages 337 to 341 \uf150 of the CSS, which describes the basis of accounting. The CSS is prepared to assist the Company in complying with the financial reporting provisions of the contract referred to above. As a result, the CSS may not be suitable for another purpose. Our report is intended solely for the Company, in accordance with our engagement letter dated 14 April 2023, and should not be distributed to or used by parties other than the Company. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the CSS and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.\n\nOur opinion on the CSS does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the CSS or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the CSS itself. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.\n\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of directors\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the CSS in accordance with the financial reporting provisions of Section Z of the contract, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the CSS that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the CSS, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThose charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the CSS.\n\n## Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the entity and management.\n\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Company and determined that the most significant to the CSS is consideration of any non-compliance of regulatory requirements, including the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) and regulations levied by the UK Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulatory Authority. We have spoken with the SSE head of regulation to confirm our understanding.\n- \u00b7 We understood how SSE plc is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management, internal audit, those responsible for legal and compliance procedures and the company Secretary. We verified our enquiries through our review of board minutes and papers provided to the Audit Committee.\n- \u00b7 We assessed the susceptibility of the Company's CSS to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by meeting with management from various parts of the business to understand where it considered there was susceptibility to fraud. We also considered performance targets and their prosperity to influence on efforts made by management to manage earnings. We considered the programmes and controls that the Group has established to address risks identified, or that otherwise prevent, deter, and detect fraud; and how senior management monitors those programmes and controls. Where the risk was considered to be higher, we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud risk.\n- \u00b7 Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify noncompliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved: enquiries of legal counsel, Group management, internal audit, and focused testing. In addition, we completed procedures to conclude on the compliance of the disclosures in the CSS with all applicable requirements.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the CSS financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities \uf295 .

It includes a dedicated Investors section where you can find electronic copies of Company reports and further information about shareholder services including:\n\n- \u00b7 share price information;\n- \u00b7 dividend history and trading graphs;\n- \u00b7 the Scrip dividend scheme;\n- \u00b7 telephone and internet share dealing; and\n- \u00b7 downloadable shareholder forms.\n\n## Digital news\n\nSSE uses a dedicated news and views website (available at www.sse.com/news-and-views \uf295 ) and Twitter ( www.twitter.com/ sse \uf295 ) to keep shareholders, investors, journalists, employees and other interested parties up-to-date with news from the Company.\n\n## Sustainable communications\n\nSSE's sustainable communications strategy aims to reduce the volume of paper being used in its communications with shareholders and other stakeholders. Shareholders are able to access a wide range of shareholder documentation, including Annual Reports, the Notice of Annual General Meeting and useful forms through the Investors section of SSE's website, www.sse.com/investors \uf295 . We encourage shareholders to accept electronic formats as the default method for accessing shareholder documentation and dividend information.\n\nAll new shareholders are automatically registered as opting to access shareholder documentation through the 'Investors' area of our website. These shareholders receive a notification, by post, when new relevant documentation has been placed on the website. Shareholders who wish to opt for printed documentation and communication should confirm this in writing to Link Group.\n\n## Shareholder portal\n\nwww.sse-shares.com \uf295\n\nThis free online service, provided by Link Group, allows shareholders to easily manage their share portfolios, including:\n\n- \u00b7 View, update and calculate the market value of their shareholdings.\n- \u00b7 Change address details and dividend payment instructions.\n- \u00b7 View share price histories and trading graphs of listed companies.\n\n## E-communications programme\n\nYou can also choose to go a step further and sign-up to SSE's eCommunication programme which allows you to receive notification of the availability of new shareholder documentation.\n\nSimply register on our shareholder portal www.sse-shares.com \uf295 You will require your Investor Code (IVC), which can be found on any recent shareholder communications from SSE.\n\nWhere delivery of an email fails, we will attempt to contact you by post to update your details.

Interim dividends are paid in March, and final dividends are paid in September once approved by shareholders at the AGM. With significant focus on payment methods for dividends in recent years, in terms of efficiency, cost and security, SSE plc made the decision that from September 2019, it would no longer be paying dividends by cheque. All dividends are now credited to a shareholder's nominated UK bank/building society account. If you haven't already registered your UK bank/building society account details with Link Registrar or would like to amend the details on your account, you can do this by:\n\n- \u00b7 logging in to the dedicated Shareholder Portal at www.sse-shares.com \uf295 ; or\n- \u00b7 calling Link on 0345 143 4005* and speaking to one of the team.\n\nIf you do not have a UK bank or building society account, your dividends can be paid directly into a bank account outside of the UK using the International Payment service. Please visit https://ww2.linkgroup.eu/ips \uf295 for further information.\n\n## Scrip dividend\n\nAlternatively, shareholders may want to join the Scrip dividend scheme and receive future dividends in the form of additional new shares. Further details of the Scrip dividend scheme can be found at https://www.sse.com/investors/shareholder-services/ dividends-and-scrip-scheme \uf295 . You should still complete a bank mandate to enable future dividend payments should you ever withdraw from the Scrip scheme.\n\n## Share dealing\n\nShare dealing services are available from Link Share Dealing Services.\n\n## Telephone dealing\n\nFor information on the telephone dealing service call 0371 664 0445\n\nLines are open Monday-Friday, 8.00am - 4.30pm Please have your Investor Code (IVC) ready.\n\n.",

The terms of the offer through which the merger was effected was that for every Southern Electric plc ordinary share held, shareholders received one Scottish and Southern Energy plc (now SSE plc) ordinary share. A number of shareholders did not respond to the original merger offer, resulting in subsequent tracing communications over the following years. In 2017, more than 12 years after the formation of SSE, a complete tracing programme was initiated through the asset reunification company Capita Employee Benefits (Consulting) Limited (Capita Tracing), to locate dissentient shareholders and reunite them with their funds. The steps agreed were designed to enable the best possible outcome for dissentient shareholders and provided clear details of the actions required to claim their asset entitlement. Following the completion of all reasonable steps over \u00a32m (in a combination of shares and accrued dividends) was returned to dissentient shareholders. As required by the Companies Act 2006, the remainder totaling over \u00a39m was transferred to the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice. Unclaimed monies can still be claimed through direct application to the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice. The process for making such an application was provided to outstanding claimants and further details are provided at
