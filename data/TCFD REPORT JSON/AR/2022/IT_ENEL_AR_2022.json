The world economies were impacted by sudden and growing in/fl.ligaationary pressures that forced many central banks to rapidly tighten their monetary policies, with a consequent impact on the /fi.liganancial markets. The military con/fl.ligaict between Russia and Ukraine, and the resulting global unce/r\\_t.ligaainty, has also aggravated conditions on the energy, commodity and food markets, with direct repercussions on the prices of /fi.liganal consumer goods. In the United States, the real economy was heavily a/ff.ligaected by growing in/fl.ligaationary pressures, which prompted the Federal Reserve to implement rapid increases in its benchmark interest rate. In the euro area, the 1st Half of the year witnessed an economic recovery that outpaced expectations, while in the 2nd Half, with the emergence of the great unce/r\\_t.ligaainty engendered by the hostilities between Russia and Ukraine and the sudden increase in energy prices, the European economies saw growth slow signi/fi.ligacantly. The European Central Bank also decided to rapidly adjust its monetary policy stance, with multiple increases in its benchmark rates.\n\nIn Latin America, the macroeconomic context was characterized by two di/ff.ligaerent phases. The 1st Half of the\n\n## Francesco Starace\n\nChief Executive O/ffi.ligacer and General Manager\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nyear saw a signi/fi.ligacant post-pandemic recovery, while in the 2nd Half the economies of the area experienced the rapid and large high increase in international commodity prices, mainly driven by the con/fl.ligaict between Russia and Ukraine. National central banks responded by tightening their monetary policies, which, as a result, dampened the economic recovery.\n\nOn the energy front, in 2022 the European gas market experienced substantial volatility. The sharp rise in prices, which saw the TTF (Title Transfer Facility) index exceed \u20ac300/MWh during August, was caused by the supply unce/r\\_t.ligaainty of /fl.ligaows from Russia, which steadily decreased over the past year. The achievement of high storage /fi.ligalling percentages achieved before the winter season, together with temperatures that exceeded seasonal averages in November and December, subsequently led to a sharp fall in European gas prices in the closing months of 2022.\n\nThe rise in gas prices and a number of hitches along the supply chain in turn led to an increase in coal prices, which in 2022 reached an average of $290/t.\n\nThe quotations of CO 2 within the ETS (Emission Trading System) also increased, rising by over 50% compared with the previous year, despite the slowdown in economic activity in the 4th Qua/r\\_t.ligaer.\n\nThe bullish dynamics on the commodity markets produced a sharp increase in electricity prices",

At the same time, the process of decommissioning and conversion of coal-/fi.ligared plants continues.\n\nAs a result, the Group's speci/fi.ligac greenhouse gas emissions linked to electricity generation in 2022 amounted to 229 gCO 2eq /kWh, in line with the objectives ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligaed by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) in accordance with the path to limit the increase in global temperature to 1.5 \u00b0C.\n\nIn 2022, the creation of digital platforms was also completed. Using advanced analytics and a/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacial intelligence algorithms, these will analyze more than 50 million data points on a daily basis to optimize the management of our wind and solar plants throughout their entire life cycle, from design and construction to operation and maintenance.\n\n2022 was also a crucial year for the opening of the 3SUN Gigafactory construction site in Sicily.

A journey that began more than /fi.ligafteen years ago and which will help make a substantial contribution to the revival of the photovoltaic industry in Italy and Europe, giving the country a position on a strategic supply chain for the energy transition.\n\nEnel's strong commitment to electricity grids, which are enablers and protagonists of the energy transition, also continues. Thanks to the investment in their modernization and their even greater digitalization, 63% of the Group's end users are equipped with sma/r\\_t.liga meters, while a total of about 65 GW of distributed renewable energy, more than half of which in Italy, is connected to our grids.\n\nThe digital transformation continues through the adoption of a platform operating model based on advanced technological solutions that impact all operating processes - from the design and construction of new grid infrastructure to the optimization of operating and maintenance activities and managing the relationship with customers. The volume of electricity distributed worldwide was 508 TWh, constantly improving the quality of service rendered to our customers.\n\n2022 was also a crucial year for the development and growth of the NewCo Gridspe/r\\_t.ligaise, launched in 2021 with the aim of making Enel's innovative solutions in the sma/r\\_t.liga meter /fi.ligaeld available to third-pa/r\\_t.ligay distribution companies to accelerate the energy transition.\n\nThe strong commitment of the Group to the development of the electricity distribution infrastructure\n\n<!-- image -->",

Following the bi/r\\_t.ligah of Enel X Global Retail, a new organizational model was de/fi.liganed among the various countries to be/t\\_t.ligaer develop and manage the increasingly integrated, innovative and sustainable solutions that use the commodity as a competitive lever. Enel X Global Retail focuses on the electri/fi.ligacation of consumption, studying its e/ff.ligaective bene/fi.ligats for customers with the aim of de/fi.liganing a strategy for acceleration at the global level,\n\nleveraging about 67 million customers.\n\nThrough the new Global e-Mobility Business Line we are accelerating the electri/fi.ligacation of transpo/r\\_t.liga thanks to the strategic focus and the strengthening of the o/ff.ligaering and the operating model. This has enabled a signi/fi.ligacant increase in commercial pe/r\\_f.ligaormance in terms of charging points sold (around 92 thousand in 2022, +82% compared with 2021) and charging services provided (43 GWh in 2022, +134% compared with 2021). In order to ensure that we take a customer-centric approach to all processes, a recurring customer satisfaction survey system was consolidated in 2022 through the continuous measurement on a global scale of the Group Net Promoter Score. (1) In 2022, Global Customer Operations received around 1 million feedbacks, which made it possible to de/fi.ligane and guide improvement initiatives to make the customer experience increasingly simple, intuitive and e/ff.ligaective. One result was a 34% reduction in commercial complaints compared with the previous year. On the /fi.liganancial front, Enel issued 'sustainability-linked' bonds in euros, US dollars and British pounds in a total amount equivalent to about \u20ac12.1 billion. These issues are linked to the achievement of Enel's sustainability objective for the reduction of direct greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1) and also contribute to achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 ('Climate Action'). For the /fi.ligarst time ever for a multinational energy group, a bond linked to full decarbonization was issued, in line with the Group's goal of achieving zero direct greenhouse gas emissions by 2040.\n\nThe bond issue programs have made it possible to achieve a ratio between sustainable funding sources and the Group's total gross debt of about 63%. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, on December 22, 2022, Enel obtained a \u20ac12 billion revolving credit line dedicated to funding the collateral requirements for trading activities on energy markets. This /fi.liganancing operation, the e/ff.ligaectiveness of which is subject to the signing of an implementing decree by the competent ministries, falls within the framework of the measures made available to all energy companies based in Italy that meet speci/fi.ligac characteristics in order to ensure, in the current environment of high volatility in the energy markets, the e/ff.ligaective operation of the market on equal terms with other European operators in the sector. Among extraordinary transactions, in January 2022 the subsidiary Enel Produzione SpA completed the acquisition of the entire share capital of ERG Hydro Srl, owner of hydroelectric plants located in central Italy with an installed capacity of 527 MW and an average annual\n\noutput of about 1.5 TWh.\n\nIn March 2022, Enel X International Srl renewed its pa/r\\_t.liganership with the private equity fund Cinven in U/fi.liganet Latam, having acquired 79.4% of the share capital of U/fi.liganet Latam SLU from Sixth Cinven Fund and at the same time sold 80.5% of the share capital of the same company to Seventh Cinven Fund, ending up with an indirect stake of 19.5% of the share capital.

To achieve these objectives, over the course of the Plan, the Group plans to focus on an integrated business model targeted at the sustainable electri/fi.ligacation of energy consumption, an increasingly necessary step in global energy systems, supplying about 90% of /fi.ligaxed-price sales in the core countries with zero-emission electricity in 2025, bringing generation from renewable sources to around 75% of the total, and digitalizing about 80% of grid customers.\n\nThe consequence of the strategy focused on the integrated margin is the pa/r\\_t.ligaicular a/t\\_t.ligaention to the countries where the Group's presence covers the entire value chain in order to fully seize the oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities associated with the energy transition. In this context, the process that began years ago towards the disposal of the assets no longer aligned with our strategy is reaching completion, with planned disposals of around \u20ac21 billion over the 2022-2024 period in terms of the positive contribution to the reduction of the Group's net debt. The majority of this plan is expected to be completed by the end of 2023, completing the path towards a more agile corporate structure, focused on the six core countries (Italy, Spain, United States, Brazil, Chile and Colombia). The Group intends to ensure growth and /fi.liganancial strength by combining a compound annual growth rate ('CAGR') of 9-10% in ordinary pro/fi.ligat with an expected FFO/net debt ratio of 28% sta/r\\_t.ligaing in 2023, as well as maintaining a /fi.ligaxed DPS of \u20ac0.43 in 2023-2025, an increase on the \u20ac0.40 paid in 2022. In addition, the DPS for 2024 and 2025 is to be considered a sustainable minimum, not a maximum.\n\nThe Group con/fi.ligarms the use of two di/ff.ligaerent business models: the Ownership model, in which the Group directly invests in renewables, grids and customers, and the Stewardship model, in which the Group invests capital in existing businesses, newly established enterprises or acquiring minority stakes, in order to maximize the value of the know-how developed in the various businesses. These models will be applied,\n\ndepending on the geographical area and the operational context, to achieve the de/fi.liganed objectives.\n\nThe Group's investments in 2023-2025 will amount to about \u20ac37 billion. More than 80% will be aligned with the criteria of the European taxonomy, as they relate to activities that contribute to the mitigation of climate change thanks to the strong contribution of investments in renewables, the connection of distributed generation to the grid and advanced services for industrial and private customers.\n\nSome 60% of the Group's investments, of which about 50% in generation and about 10% in advanced energy customers and services, are expected to suppo/r\\_t.liga the Group's integrated commercial strategy, with grids accounting for about 40% of investments over the period covered by the Strategic Plan. At the country level, about 85% of these investments are expected to be allocated to Italy, Spain and the United States, where the Group can also bene/fi.ligat from policies to suppo/r\\_t.liga sustainable electri/fi.ligacation introduced by the EU and the United States.\n\nBy 2025, the Group plans to add about 21 GW of installed renewable capacity, including 4 GW of BESS. The decarbonization strategy, combined with the push towards electri/fi.ligacation, enables the Group to once again con/fi.ligarm its commitment to combating climate change. In 2022, the Group delineated a decarbonization roadmap, which covers both direct and indirect emissions along the entire value chain. It is composed of four targets that were ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligaed by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) in December, in line with the goal of keeping global warming below 1.5 \u00baC.\n\nEnel's new ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligaed targets follow up on the ambition set by the Company in 2021, when it brought forward its commitment to achieving zero emissions by ten years, from 2050 to 2040.\n\nThe Plan is based on the implementation of a number of fundamental strategic steps: i) the abandonment of coal-/fi.ligared generation by 2027 and gas-/fi.ligared generation by 2040, replacing the thermal generation po/r\\_t.ligafolio with new renewables capacity and hybridizing renewables with storage solutions; ii) by 2040, 100% of the electricity sold by the Group will be generated from renewables and by the same year the Group will stop selling gas to end users.\n\nAbout 40% of investments over the course of the Strategic Plan will be dedicated to the grids in /fi.ligave of\n\n<!-- image -->",

Consideration was also given to the indicators proposed in the white paper 'Toward Common Metrics and Consistent Repo/r\\_t.ligaing of Sustainable Value Creation' of the World Economic Forum (WEF), the details of which are highlighted in the section below on the WEF and in the 'Group Pe/r\\_f.ligaormance' chapter of this repo/r\\_t.liga.",

        "page_content": "## Business model\n\nEnel's business model has been structured so as to Group's strategic objectives, including the commitments made by the Group in the /fi.ligaght against climate change.\n\nThe  business  model  delineates  how  the  organizational units of the Company, linked to our three main businesses (generation, distribution and sales to end users), must work to reap all the possible bene/fi.ligats from the main trends in the sector, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular from trends bringing about the energy and digital transitions, possibly accelerating their implementation as well.\n\nThe role de/fi.liganed for all the major organizational units is also intended to enable them to e/ff.ligaectively address all the risks posed by developments in the rapidly changing energy industry.\n\nIn order to fully bene/fi.ligat from all the oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities emerging in the market environment in which it operates, the Group has identi/fi.ligaed two di/ff.ligaerent business models (Ownership and Stewardship) that it can use to achieve the ambitions we have de/fi.liganed.\n\nThe most appropriate and e/ff.ligaective business model is selected depending on the geographical area and operating environment involved:\n\n\u00b7\n\nthe  Ownership  business  model,  in  which  the  Group makes direct investments in renewables, grids and customers. This model is employed in countries where the entire value chain can already be leveraged, from generation to integration with end user. These six countries are de/fi.liganed as 'core' or 'Tier 1' countries and today include Italy and Spain in Europe and the United States, Brazil, Chile and Colombia in the Americas. The central\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Enel Grids : in developing and operating infrastructure that enables the energy transition, the Group ensures the reliability in the supply of energy and the quality of service to communities through resilient and /fl.ligaexible networks, leveraging e/ffi.ligaciency, technology and digital innovation, and ensuring appropriate returns on investment and cash generation.\n\n\u00b7\n\nrole of our customers in the Group's business model makes the integrated margin a pillar of our Plan. The correct management of the integrated margin requires the joint optimization of both sales of power, considering the di/ff.ligaerent options available in the countries in which we operate, and provisioning, which is linked to our generation rather than to the di/ff.ligaerent sourcing options;\n\nthe Stewardship business model, in which the Group invests capital in existing or new joint ventures or acquires minority stakes, with a view to maximizing the value of the know-how developed in the various businesses in which it operates with impo/r\\_t.ligaant /fi.liganancial and industrial pa/r\\_t.liganers. This is achieved through the delivery of speci/fi.ligac contractual services to pa/r\\_t.liganers or the subsequent monetization of these investments on the market. This model focuses mainly, but not exclusively, on 'non-core' or 'non-Tier 1' countries, where the Group's presence is not integrated and it seeks to build pa/r\\_t.liganerships with third pa/r\\_t.ligaies to explore new geographical areas or to leverage the Group's operational experience in alternative environments. It can also be activated for innovative businesses in core countries to facilitate sta/r\\_t.liga-up and scale-up.\n\nIn this design, each country organization acts within its territory in a matrix relationship with the broader and more global business lines, managing activities such as relations with local communities, regulation, the retail market and local communication. The current mission of each business can be summarized as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Enel Green Power and Thermal Generation : the Group operates through this business line to accelerate the energy transition, continuing to increase investments in new renewable energy capacity, and manages the decarbonization of its generation mix and the countries in which it operates, always aiming to ensure the safety and capacity of electrical systems. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, it uses digitalization to operate its assets ever more e/ffi.ligaciently and e/ff.ligaectively, thereby enhancing the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of our assets and the design of new plants.\n- \u00b7 Global Energy and Commodity Management : this business line manages our energy margin in the markets in which we operate as a single po/r\\_t.ligafolio in which Generation and Retail operations are always balanced e/ff.ligaectively. In addition, the line manages all trading operations on international desks.",

In 2022, the induction program continued with additional examination of cyber security and risk governance issues.\n\nAt the end of 2022 and during the /fi.ligarst two months of 2023, the Board of Directors carried out, with the assistance of a specialized independent advisor, an assessment of the size, composition and functioning of the Board and its commi/t\\_t.ligaees (the 'board review'), in line with the most advanced corporate governance practices accepted at the international level and incorporated within the Corporate Governance Code. The board review was also carried out using a 'peer review' approach, i.e., evaluating not only the operation of the body as a whole, but also the style and substance of the contribution made by each of its members, and it was extended to include the Board of Statutory Auditors. The board review also speci/fi.ligacally sought to verify the directors' perception of (i) the e/ff.ligaectiveness of induction activities and (ii) the Board's involvement with sustainability issues and their integration into corporate strategy, including climate change issues. The /fi.ligandings of the board review are repo/r\\_t.ligaed in Enel's Repo/r\\_t.liga on Corporate Governance and Ownership Structure.\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Board of Statutory Auditors have approved, each within their own sphere of competence, speci/fi.ligac diversity policies that set out the characteristics considered optimal for the members of these bodies, so that each can exercise their duties most e/ff.ligaectively, taking decisions that can e/ff.ligaectively draw on the contribution of a plurality of quali/fi.ligaed points of view, able to examine the issues under discussion from di/ff.ligaerent perspectives. The policy approved by the Board of Directors establishes that with regard to the types of diversity and the associated objectives:\n\n- the optimal composition of Board members should provide for a majority of independent directors;\n\n- even when the regulatory provisions on gender balance expire, it is impo/r\\_t.ligaant to continue to ensure that at least one-third of the Board of Directors, both at the time of appointment and during its term of o/ffi.ligace, shall be made up of directors of the least represented gender;\n\n- the international scope of the Group's activities should be taken into consideration, ensuring that at least one-third of directors should have adequate experience in the international arena, which is also considered useful for preventing the standardization of opinions and the emergence of 'group thought';\n\n- in order to achieve a balance between the need for continuity and renewal in management, it would be necessary to ensure a balanced combination of people of di/ff.ligaering seniority - and age - within the Board of Directors;\n\n- non-executive directors should have a management and/or professional and/or academic and/or institutional background such as to create a diverse and complementary set of skills and experience;\n\n- in view of the di/ff.ligaerences in their roles, the Chairman and the CEO should have the appropriate skills (speci/fi.ligacally indicated in the policy) for the e/ff.ligaective pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of their respective duties.",

Among other issues, these recommendations concern the composition of the management body, with regard to which it is also suggested to integrate a diversity of professional and management experience and skills, combined, where possible, with a diversity of gender, age and seniority, without prejudice to the provisions of applicable local legislation.\n\nIn order to regulate the procedures for the Company's engagement with institutional investors and with its shareholders and bondholders as a whole, in March 2021 the Board of Directors adopted, acting on a proposal from the Chairman formulated in agreement with the Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer, a speci/fi.ligac policy in this area (the 'Engagement Policy').

        "page_content": "Values and pillars of corporate ethics\n\nA robust system of ethics underlies all activities of the Enel Group. This system is embodied in a dynamic set of rules constantly oriented towards incorporating national and international best practices that everyone who works for and with Enel must respect and apply in their daily activities. The system is based on speci/fi.ligac compliance programs,\n\nincluding: the Code of Ethics, the Compliance Model under Legislative Decree 231/2001, the Enel Global Compliance Program, the Zero-Tolerance-of-Corruption Plan, the Human Rights Policy, and any other national compliance models adopted by Group companies in accordance with local laws and regulations.\n\n## Code of Ethics\n\nIn 2002, Enel adopted a Code of Ethics, (5) which expresses the Company's ethical responsibilities and commitments in conducting operations, governing and standardizing corporate conduct on the basis of standards aimed to ensure the maximum transparency and fairness with all stakeholders. The Code of Ethics is valid for the whole Group, taking due account of the cultural, social and economic diversity of the various countries in which Enel operates. Enel also\n\nrequires that all suppliers and pa/r\\_t.liganers adopt conduct that is in line with the general principles set out in the Code. Any violations or suspected violations of Enel Compliance Programs can be repo/r\\_t.ligaed, including in anonymous form, through a single Group-level platform (the 'Ethics Point'). With regard to the Code of Ethics, the following table repo/r\\_t.ligas total violations received and violations con/fi.ligarmed.\n\n|                                                                     |     |   2022 |   2021 | Change   | Change   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|--------|--------|----------|----------|\n| Total repo/r\\_t.ligaed violations of the Code of Ethics received     | no. |    172 |    153 | 19       | 12.4%    |\n| Con/fi.ligarmed violations of the Code of Ethics (1)                | no. |     29 |     44 | (15)     | -34.1%   |\n| - of which violations involving con/fl.ligaicts of interest/bribery | no. |      9 |      8 | 1        | 12.5%    |\n\n## Compliance Model under Legislative Decree 231/2001\n\nLegislative Decree 231 of June 8, 2001 introduced into Italian law a system of administrative (and de facto criminal) liability for companies for ce/r\\_t.ligaain types of o/ff.ligaenses commi/t\\_t.ligaed by their directors, managers or employees on behalf of or to the bene/fi.ligat of the company. Enel was the /fi.ligarst organization\n\nin Italy to adopt, back in 2002, this so/r\\_t.liga of compliance model that met the requirements of Legislative Decree 231/2001 (also known as 'Model 231').

It is a governance mechanism aimed at strengthening the Group's ethical and professional commitment to preventing the commission of crimes abroad that could result in criminal liability for the company and do harm to our reputation. Identi/fi.ligacation of the types of crime covered by the\n\nEnel Global Compliance Program - which encompasses standards of conduct and areas to be monitored for preventive purposes - is based on illicit conduct that is generally considered such in most countries, such as corruption, crimes against the government, false accounting, money laundering, violations of regulations governing safety in the workplace, environmental crimes, etc.\n\n## 'Zero-Tolerance-of-Corruption' Plan and the anti-bribery management system\n\nIn compliance with the tenth principle of the Global Compact, according to which 'businesses should work against corruption in all its forms, including exto/r\\_t.ligaion and bribery', Enel is commi/t\\_t.ligaed to combating corruption. For this reason, in 2006 we adopted the 'Zero-Tolerance-of-Corruption' Plan (ZTC Plan), con/fi.ligarming the Group's commitment, as described in both the Code of Ethics and the Model 231, to ensure propriety and transparency in conducting company business and operations and to safeguard our image\n\nand positioning, the work of our employees, the expectations of shareholders and all of the Group's stakeholders.

Enel's business model is based on the generation of sustainable value, together with its internal and external stakeholders, on continuous innovation, the pursuit of excellence and respect for human rights throughout the value chain. This translates into the rejection of practices such as modern slavery, forced labor and human tra/ffi.ligacking, and the promotion of diversity, inclusion, equal oppo/r\\_t.ligaunity and ensuring that people are treated with dignity and valued for their uniqueness, whether they work within the Company or elsewhere along the value chain in which the Group operates. The main international standards inspiring Enel's commitment are the United  Nations  framework  'Protect,  Respect,  Remedy', outlined in the guiding principles on business and human rights, and the guidelines for multinational companies of the OECD. This commitment is clearly re/fl.ligaected in the human rights policy drawn up and adopted back in 2013. In 2021, this document was updated to take account of the evolution of international reference frameworks and the operational,  organizational  and  management  processes of the Group. The document strengthens and expands the commitments already present in other codes of conduct adopted by Enel such as the Code of Ethics, the Zero-Tolerance-of-Corruption Plan and global compliance models. The update was approved by the Board of Directors of Enel SpA and then adopted by the subsidiaries. Enel unde/r\\_t.ligaakes to comply with these principles in every country in which it operates, respecting local cultural, social and economic diversity, requiring each stakeholder to adopt conduct in line with these principles, paying pa/r\\_t.ligaicular a/t\\_t.ligaention to high-risk environments or those exposed to con/fl.ligaicts.\n\nStakeholders are all those who have a direct or indirect interest in the activities of the Enel Group, such as customers, employees of any type or level, suppliers, contractors, pa/r\\_t.liganers,  other  companies  and  trade  associations,  the /fi.liganancial community, civil society, local communities and indigenous and tribal peoples, national and international institutions, the media, as well as the organizations and institutions that represent them.\n\nThe update, similar to the 2013 version, involved a process of consultation with stakeholders relevant to the Company (internal, other companies, suppliers, human rights expe/r\\_t.ligas, think tanks, NGOs) conducted in accordance with the criteria contained in the ''UN Global Compact Guide for Business: How to Develop a Human Rights Policy''.\n\nThe updated code identi/fi.ligaes twelve principles (compared with  the  previous  eight),  again  divided  into  two  macro-themes: work practices and community relations.\n\nThe Human Rights Policy is a commitment to:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nproactively consider the needs and priorities of people and society in general because this makes it possible to innovate processes and products, a key factor in an increasingly competitive, inclusive and sustainable business model, including through the adoption of the principles of circularity, the protection of natural capital and biodiversity;\n\npromote the engagement of our main external and internal stakeholders in order to enhance their awareness and develop a constructive dialogue that can provide a valuable contribution to the design of solutions to mitigate climate change.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  commitment  to  the  contribution  to achieving  the  United  Nations  Sustainable  Development Goals, the updates include: (i) a reminder of how environmental degradation and climate change are interconnected with human rights, in that the implementation of measures to mitigate the e/ff.ligaects of human activities on the  environment  cannot  take  place  without  taking  account of their social impact; (ii) the strengthening of the principles of 'respect for diversity and non-discrimination' and 'health and safety' in the pa/r\\_t.liga relating to psychological and physical well-being and work-life integration; (iii) an increase in the granularity of our commitment in our relations with communities, with pa/r\\_t.ligaicular regard to local communities, indigenous and tribal populations, privacy and communication.\n\nEnel has unde/r\\_t.ligaaken to monitor application of the Human Rights Policy (i) by employing a speci/fi.ligac due diligence process in the various countries in which we operate; (ii) by promoting conduct consistent with a just and inclusive",

These include those concerning working conditions, health and safety, appropriate working hours, rejection  of  forced  or  child  labor,  respect  for  personal\n\ndignity, non-discrimination and the inclusion of diversity, freedom of association and collective bargaining and respect for privacy by design and by default.

        "page_content": "Introduction\n\nto Group strategy\n\nSince 2015, the Group's strategy has been focused on sustainability and /fi.ligaghting climate change, placing pro/fi.ligatability and sustainable progress on the same vi/r\\_t.ligauous track. Enel's commitment initially translated into a desire to contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) launched by the United Nations Organization (UN), but in recent years it has expanded this orientation fu/r\\_t.ligaher, seeking to act as an enabling factor in the general context of the /fi.ligaght against climate change and the energy transition.\n\nWith these assumptions, the de/fi.liganition of the strategy has gradually been increasingly closely tied to the scenarios developed by the Group. The various transition trajectories hypothesized for the countries in which Enel operates, as well as the climate scenarios, represent one of the fundamental pillars of de/fi.liganing the strategic actions necessary to achieve these ambitious long-term objectives.\n\nLong-term  scenarios  need  to  be  accompanied  by  an equally careful and consistent analysis of the context and the sho/r\\_t.liga-term evolution of energy and macroeconomic variables. If the medium-long term goal is, in Enel's vision, anchored to the achievement of the Paris objectives on containing climate change, the sta/r\\_t.ligaing point of each strategic planning cycle has turned out to be changeable over the years, strongly in/fl.ligauenced by the disruptions they have characterized the recent past. Unexpected events such as the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic or the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine con/fl.ligaict have had a substantial impact on the environment in which the Group operates and prompted a series of managerial actions to restore the proper trajectory and achieve goals we have set for ourselves.\n\nThe suppo/r\\_t.liga lent by the de/fi.liganition of the scenarios also underpins the Strategic Dialogue process which, as will be\n\nexplored later, represents the incubator in which the Group develops and analyzes the most relevant strategic issues every year, with the aim of updating and adapting our positioning and business models.\n\nSome of Enel's most innovative and incisive decisions were born in this context: sta/r\\_t.ligaing with the decision to abandon coal-/fi.ligared thermal generation, passing through the more recent commitment to Zero Emissions by 2040 and arriving at Sustainability-linked Finance, Stakeholder Capitalism and Climate Change Strategy. The common thread has always remained anchored to sustainability, but over the years the scope of application has expanded to enable us both to increase the e/ff.ligaects of the Group's strategy and to clarify the stakeholders who will be able to bene/fi.ligat from it. Sustainability is integrated into the all-round strategy.\n\nThanks to the Stakeholder Capitalism frame, the Group has in fact declared its intention to make the creation of sustainable value and well-being generated by its activities more explicit, believing that in an increasingly interconnected world that aims to achieve full sustainability, companies will only thrive in the long term if they act collectively and if they are able to create value and share it with all stakeholders.\n\nIn this context, the most recent Capital Markets Day testi/fi.ligaed to the increased centrality of the integrated country-based strategy in the Group's design and the role that this strategy could play in accelerating the speed of transition of the individual countries in which Enel operates, all while reducing energy costs for our customers.\n\nWith the introduction of the Climate Change Strategy, the Group has laid the foundations for tackling climate change even more actively and proactively, expanding the areas of intervention beyond mitigation actions, which include decarbonization initiatives, and including adaptation plans for assets and business models.",

        "page_content": "Reference scenario\n\n## The geopolitical environment\n\nGlobal economic conditions can signi/fi.ligacantly impact the Group's activities due to their direct e/ff.ligaects on the growth rates of the national GDPs of the countries in which it operates. In recent years, the stability of the euro area has been shaken by a number of adverse events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has produced signi/fi.ligacant disruptions in supply chains and prompted the imposition of restrictions on economic activities, and the more recent military con/fl.ligaict between Russia and Ukraine. Since the economies of the euro area are among the most highly exposed to these hostilities due to their geographical proximity to the con/fl.ligaict area and their heavy dependence on gas impo/r\\_t.ligas from Russia, they have been heavily impacted both in terms of the slowdown in GDP growth and the high level of in/fl.ligaation. The la/t\\_t.ligaer was initially driven by the exponential increase in energy and commodity prices. Subsequently, the transfer of the higher costs of /fi.ligarms' production factors to the prices of non-energy industrial goods generated persistent in/fl.ligaationary pressures, which remain a risk factor that requires careful monitoring. The increase in  in/fl.ligaation  is  eroding  the  purchasing  power  of  households and weighing on industrial production. In response to these in/fl.ligaationary pressures, the European Central Bank (as well as most of the central banks of the advanced and emerging economies) has adopted a restrictive monetary policy stance, which, if it should be tightened and prolonged, could have signi/fi.ligacant impacts on economic activity and the /fi.liganancial stability of the euro area.\n\nThe year 2023 will once again be marked by the evolution of events connected with the military con/fl.ligaict between Russia and Ukraine, with direct impacts on geopolitical and social stability on a global scale. The world context is involved in and impacted by the evolution of the military con/fl.ligaict, which is still causing serious social and economic consequences for the countries directly or indirectly involved. Tensions between countries have increased over the last few months, exacerbated by the fact that there is no obvious end in sight for the Russia-Ukraine con/fl.ligaict and the emergence of strains in Asia and other pa/r\\_t.ligas of the world.\n\nOn the trade front, sanctions are still in place on international trade that are in/fl.ligauencing trade agreements between countries and industrial policies in various regions: the introduction of any new customs duties or restrictions on expo/r\\_t.ligas could fu/r\\_t.ligaher aggravate the current macroeconomic environment and make geopolitical conditions even more unce/r\\_t.ligaain.\n\nThe main risks in respect of energy commodities primarily regard the reduction in the supply of gas to Europe. With the deterioration in relations with Russia, all of Europe's other supply channels have become even more strategic, and any discontinuity would fu/r\\_t.ligaher drive expectations for higher gas prices. This increase would also involve coal and electricity prices, which are strongly correlated with trends in gas prices. A fu/r\\_t.ligaher source of unce/r\\_t.ligaainty is the possible increase in Chinese gas demand, which could a/t\\_t.ligaract the supplies of LNG currently sold in Europe. The recovery of Chinese economic activity could also have repercussions on the oil market, although this could be mitigated by the possible purchase of incremental volumes directly from Russia.\n\nThe current geopolitical context will also continue to in/fl.ligauence demand in the industrial metals sector, which is affected by the prospects of a slowdown in global economic growth and by the prolonged political and military tensions. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, in China, despite expectations for an upturn in demand following the post-COVID reopening of the economy, the recovery in demand in 2023 will be slow and irregular, and will greatly depend on the e/ff.ligaect of government stimuli. Speci/fi.ligacally, in the construction sector demand is only expected to rise sta/r\\_t.ligaing from the second half of the year. As regards metals used in renewable energy technologies, such as metals for ba/t\\_t.ligaeries and polysilicon, current conditions remain colored by unce/r\\_t.ligaainties about the management of Chinese and global supply chains, which will continue to in/fl.ligauence prices in the near future. Renewed strains are also expected to emerge for more energy-intensive metals, such as aluminum and steel, the prices of which remain closely linked to developments in the energy markets and the underlying geopolitical dynamics.",

        "page_content": "## Macroeconomic environment\n\nThe global macroeconomic environment in 2022 was characterized by a broad slowdown in the real economy, with estimated world GDP growth of around 3% on an annual basis, following the sharp post-pandemic recovery of around 6% the previous year. High levels of in/fl.ligaation quickly and unexpectedly impacted global economies, forcing central  banks  to  take  rapid  action  to  adopt  restrictive monetary policies, exacerbating /fi.liganancial market conditions. High in/fl.ligaationary pressures on a global scale have been driven both by demand-side pressures generated by earlier central bank measures to accommodate the recovery during the pandemic crisis, and by signi/fi.ligacant disto/r\\_t.ligaions in supply chains that have reduced the supply of goods. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, the military con/fl.ligaict between Russia and Ukraine, and the resulting global unce/r\\_t.ligaainty this has engendered, has signi/fi.ligacantly impacted the energy, commodity and food markets, with direct repercussions on the prices of /fi.liganal consumer goods and even more evident consequences for the European energy sector, which has been directly a/ff.ligaected by /fl.ligauctuating gas supplies and consequent impact on expectations of market operators.\n\nIn the United States, strong domestic demand generated by the resilience of the labor market and high wage levels, together with a rise in energy and food prices, drove in/fl.ligaation on an annual basis to record levels (8%), values that had not been registered since 1981. To respond to these unsustainable in/fl.ligaationary pressures, the Federal Reserve reacted  by  implementing  a  restrictive  monetary  policy stance with numerous large increases in policy rates. However, these in/fl.ligaationary dynamics, accompanied by restrictive /fi.liganancial conditions, weighed on US economic pe/r\\_f.ligaormance, which saw GDP grow by 2.1% on an annual basis. In  the  euro  area,  macroeconomic  conditions  changed substantially between the 1st and 2nd Qua/r\\_t.ligaers, recording estimated GDP growth of 3.3% on an annual basis. In the /fi.ligarst six months, the economic recovery exceeded expectations, suppo/r\\_t.ligaed by a strong recovery in consumption and private investment in response to the relaxation of the restrictions imposed during the pandemic. In the following six months, with the rise in unce/r\\_t.ligaainty in connection with the military con/fl.ligaict between Russia and Ukraine and the sudden increase in energy prices, the European economies recorded a signi/fi.ligacant slowdown. The euro area has been impacted more signi/fi.ligacantly by the armed con/fl.ligaict than the United States due to its greater geographical proximity and heavy dependence on Russian gas. The la/t\\_t.ligaer factor has contributed signi/fi.ligacantly to the surge in unce/r\\_t.ligaainty in the European energy markets. Finally, in response to the growing in/fl.ligaationary pressures (in/fl.ligaation stood at 8.4% on an annual basis), after more than a decade of interest rates close to zero, the European Central Bank also swiftly decided to adopt a restrictive monetary policy with repeated\n\nincreases in its policy rates. This has caused /fi.liganancial conditions in the markets to deteriorate.\n\nIn Latin America, the /fi.ligarst half of the year saw a signi/fi.ligacant recovery in private consumption demand for goods and services, suppo/r\\_t.ligaed by a recovery in the labor market and the substantial /fi.ligascal suppo/r\\_t.liga provided by governments in response to the pandemic crisis. Conversely, in the second half of the year, macroeconomic conditions were characterized by the restrictive monetary policy stances adopted by the national central banks, which dampened the economic recovery. The economies of Latin America have been impacted by the rapid surge in the international prices of energy and agricultural commodities, mainly re/fl.ligaecting the military con/fl.ligaict between Russia and Ukraine. In Brazil, the economic recovery in 2022 saw GDP growth outpace expectations at an estimated 3% on an annual basis, driven by robust domestic demand suppo/r\\_t.ligaed by signi/fi.ligacant social transfers from the government and by an improvement in job growth. However, the /fi.liganal qua/r\\_t.ligaers of the year were impacted by growing in/fl.ligaationary pressures (in/fl.ligaation rose to 9.3% on an annual basis) induced by a generalized increase in commodity and food prices, forcing the central bank to roll out a rapid series of restrictive monetary measures, which have had a negative impact on the growth outlook for this year. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, the possibility that the newly elected president Lula could reverse the economic policy direction adopted by the previous Bolsonaro government, the delay in the approval of structural reforms, together with the intensi/fi.ligacation of social protests, all raise unce/r\\_t.ligaainties about the actual speed of recovery in the sho/r\\_t.liga term and the country's /fi.ligascal strength and long-term economic growth potential. In Chile, economic growth was more moderate in 2022, coming in at 2.8% year-on-year after the strong 11.9% increase the previous year. Last year, the Chilean government did not retain many of the generous /fi.ligascal measures implemented the previous year, which had enabled the economy to pe/r\\_f.ligaorm beyond its potential. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, growing in/fl.ligaationary pressures, with annual in/fl.ligaation reaching 11.6%, followed by a deterioration in local and global /fi.liganancial conditions, had a negative impact on private consumption and investment. In Colombia, the real economy continued to pe/r\\_f.ligaorm well, with GDP growth estimated at 7.8%, after the 10.7% rise recorded the previous year. However, the resilience of private consumption and investment was tested, especially in the second half of the year, by a broad increase in prices, with annual in/fl.ligaation amounting to 10.2%. For the Peruvian economy, the growing in/fl.ligaationary pressures resulting from the increase in the prices of agricultural and energy goods (the annual in/fl.ligaation rate stood at 7.9%), the more restrictive monetary conditions adopted by the central bank and the considerable political unce/r\\_t.ligaainty linked to the agenda of Presi-",

On average, the TTF benchmark price rose by more than 160% compared with 2021, re/fl.ligaecting the unce/r\\_t.ligaainty about gas /fl.ligaows from Russia, which gradually dwindled over the course of the year until the closure of No/r\\_t.ligah Stream 1, the main pipeline serving the European market, at the beginning of September. Record prices were reached during the year (over \u20ac300/MWh in August).\n\nIn order to respond to the crisis, the European Union introduced a series of actions, including minimum storage obligations and gas price caps. The achievement of high storage percentages (above 90%) before the winter season, combined with mild temperatures in November and December, led to a sharp reduction in European gas prices in the /fi.liganal months of 2022.\n\nThe rise in gas prices, combined with various bo/t\\_t.ligalenecks along the value chain, in turn led to an increase in coal prices, which in 2022 reached an average of $290 a ton. High gas prices have made coal-/fi.ligared generation more a/t\\_t.ligaractive, increasing its consumption.\n\nIn the /fi.ligarst pa/r\\_t.liga of 2022, the oil market saw substantial increases in its price indices, re/fl.ligaecting optimism for the recovery of economic activity in a context in which supply appeared to be growing more slowly than demand. During the /fi.ligarst half of 2022, the price of Brent, the European oil benchmark, repeatedly exceeded $120 a barrel, recording an average value of $104 a barrel. Sta/r\\_t.ligaing from July, however, prices began to reverse their trend, re/fl.ligaecting softer demand due to the slowdown in economic activity. The average Brent price was around $99 a barrel in 2022, a 39% increase on 2021.\n\n|                   |          | 2022   | 2021   | Change   |\n|-------------------|----------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Brent             | $/barrel | 99     | 71     | 39.4%    |\n| API2              | $/ton    | 290    | 120    | -        |\n| TTF               | \u20ac/MWh    | 120    | 46     | -        |\n| CO 2              | \u20ac/ton    | 81     | 53     | 52.8%    |\n| Copper            | $/ton    | 8,831  | 9,310  | -5.1%    |\n| Aluminum          | $/ton    | 2,706  | 2,472  | 9.5%     |\n| Lithium carbonate | $/ton    | 71,640 | 18,645 | -        |\n| Polysilicon       | $/ton    | 35,589 | 25,331 | 40.5%    |",

In general, despite some unce/r\\_t.ligaainties about the regulatory future of this commodity, in 2022 the European Union con/fi.ligarmed that the ETS is the main policy tool available in the /fi.ligaght against climate change. This made the commodity very resilient to market shocks, as already observed in previous years.\n\nAs  happened  in  2021,  2022  was  also  characterized  by strong volatility for the metals sector, albeit with clearly different dynamics. The /fi.ligarst half of the year, with the outbreak of the con/fl.ligaict between Russia and Ukraine, experienced sudden price spikes, mainly for metals such as aluminum and nickel, driven by fears of possible critical supply issues and by general strains on commodity markets.

Copper prices remained at historically very high levels until June, averaging more than $9,900 a ton over the /fi.ligarst /fi.ligave months of the year (from the end of February to April, prices did not fall below $10,000 a ton), before reversing the trend and averaging around $8,000 a ton for the rest of the year (reaching a low of around $7,100 a ton in mid-July, a value not seen since the end of 2020). As regards the metals used more extensively in renewable energy technologies, such as metals for ba/t\\_t.ligaeries (lithium) or polysilicon, price dynamics have di/ff.ligaered signi/fi.ligacantly. Following developments in 2021, prices continued to rise throughout the year, driven by market fundamentals, which have remained strained, and in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular by demand from the EV sector and energy in general, which has continued to accelerate, despite global growth fears. For example, lithium carbonate prices in China have averaged above $70,000 a ton, up from around $40,000 a ton in January to around $80,000 a ton in the /fi.liganal months of the year. All this underscores the continuing strength of demand for green technology and related materials, the outlook for which does not appear to be slackening. In the near future, the outlook points to an easing of tensions on the prices of these commodities as well, thanks in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular to the entry of new supplies onto the market.",

        "page_content": "## The energy transition context\n\nDe/fi.liganing a solid and resilient strategy is key to fueling the creation of value for all stakeholders. In a complex, rapidly changing world, assessing the evolution of the energy transition process is a fundamental input in the de/fi.liganition of Enel's strategy. This assessment is pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly critical in the current environment, characterized, as discussed earlier, by growing geopolitical tensions, gas price volatility and supply chain di/ffi.ligaculties. At the same time, the objectives of the Paris Agreement require an acceleration of the energy transition, in order to limit the increase in average global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C compared with pre-industrial levels. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 'any fu/r\\_t.ligaher delay in conce/r\\_t.ligaed anticipatory global action on adaptation and mitigation will miss a brief and rapidly closing window of oppo/r\\_t.ligaunity to secure a livable and sustainable future for all'. (6) The recent World Economic Forum Annual Meeting (7) placed the issue of energy transition at the center of action for 2023 and for the rest of the decade, inviting action to be taken on investment capacity, public measures for the implementation of longterm objectives, infrastructure suitable for the transition and implementation of decarbonization paths for /fi.ligarms.\n\nWhile on the one hand the energy transition is proceeding along a path of disorderly policies ('disorderly transition ' (8) ) compared with expectations, on the other we are witnessing a convergence of calls for energy security, accessibility and sustainability, which is guiding everyone -political decision-makers, citizens and companies -in the same direction: towards an acceleration of the clean electri/fi.ligacation process.  In  pa/r\\_t.ligaicular,  the  Russia-Ukraine  con/fl.ligaict  could produce an acceleration in the electri/fi.ligacation of consumption and the development of renewables for reasons of energy e/ffi.ligaciency and security. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), (9) we are at a 'historic turning point towards a cleaner and more secure energy system thanks  to  the  unprecedented  response  from  governments around the world' to the energy con/fl.ligaict and crisis, including the In/fl.ligaation Reduction Act in the United S tates and REPowerEU in the European Union, which add to the renewable energy achievements and targets in countries such as China and India.\n\n(6) IPCC, 2022. AR6. WGII, Summary for Policymakers.\n\n(7)\n\nDavos, 2023.\n\n(8) According to the de/fi.liganition of the Network for Greening the Financial System, 2022. 'Scenarios for central banks and supervisors'.\n\n(9)\n\nIEA, 2022. World Energy Outlook.\n\n(10)  IEA, 2022. Renewable Energy Market Update.\n\n- (11)  IEA, 2022. Energy E/ffi.ligaciency.\n- (12)  IEA, 2022. Global Electric Vehicle Outlook.\n\nThe consequence has been an acceleration of the energy transition, evident in the results achieved in recent years and in the advancement of new policies. Additional renewables capacity had set a new record in 2021, increasing by 6% to nearly 295 GW. Growth expectations for 2022 and 2023 have again been revised upwards -despite supply chain  challenges,  construction  delays  and  higher  commodity prices than in the past -bringing expected additional renewables capacity to 320 GW (+8%), thanks to strong political suppo/r\\_t.liga in China, Europe and Latin America. Photovoltaic power is expected to account for 60% of the increase in global renewables capacity this year, with 190 GW entering service, a 25% increase over last year. (10) Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore,  high  energy  prices  have  underscored  the advantages of greater energy e/ffi.ligaciency and are leading to policy and behavioral changes to reduce energy consumption,  including  through  the  electri/fi.ligacation  of  /fi.liganal consumption (the demand for primary energy is decreasing thanks to the extraordinary e/ffi.ligaciency of electricity as an energy vector). The global economy used energy 2% more e/ffi.ligaciently in 2022 than in 2021, with a rate of improvement nearly four times higher than in the previous two years. Global investments in energy e/ffi.ligaciency - such as building renovations, public transpo/r\\_t.liga and electric car infrastructure - increased by 16% in 2022 compared with the previous year. (11)\n\nElectric mobility has also surged: the number of electric cars in circulation tripled in just three years, reaching over 16.5 million in 2021, with a major increase in sales in China, Europe and the United States, suppo/r\\_t.ligaed by ambitious policies (for example, in Europe the 'Fit for 55' package sets a goal of reaching 100% electric vehicle sales by 2035). (12) Even emerging markets registered substantial growth in 2021, including Latin America, where Chile in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular has set ambitious goals for the penetration of electric mobility. (13)\n\nThe transition, therefore, is shifting gears, as is clear in the recent projections for the global energy system produced by the IEA. For the /fi.ligarst time, an IEA current policies scenario (STEPS) sees a peak or plateau for all fossil fuels, associated with an increase of about 2.5 \u00b0C in global average temperature by 2100. The Announced Policies Scenario (APS) - which is more ambitious than the current policies scenario because it includes climate targets that have been announced but not yet implemented by states,",

Although the APS scenario raises hopes for the evolution of our energy system, there is still a large gap between today's ambitions and holding the temperature increase to below 2 \u00b0C. This gap is largely connected with the need to introduce measures to implement the long-term objectives, with a view to increasing both the development\n\nof renewables and the rate of electri/fi.ligacation of consumption in the sho/r\\_t.liga term. This is all the more impo/r\\_t.ligaant with regard to the most ambitious Paris Agreement objective, namely to limit the increase in global average temperature to +1.5 \u00b0C, the achievement of which requires governments and /fi.ligarms to expand their decarbonization objectives even fu/r\\_t.ligaher and the public to actively pa/r\\_t.ligaicipate in the energy transition process, seeking out increased e/ffi.ligaciency and sustainability in energy consumption.\n\n## Climate change and long-term scenarios\n\nEnel promotes transparency in its climate-change disclosures and works to demonstrate to its stakeholders that it is tackling climate change with diligence and determination. Enel has publicly commi/t\\_t.ligaed to adopting the recommendations of the Task force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) of the Financial Stability Board and to following all published updates. The Group is also taking on board the 'Guidelines on repo/r\\_t.ligaing climate-related information' published by the European Commission in June 2019, which, together with the TCFD recommendations and the GRI Standard, constituted the main framework for\n\nthe Group's repo/r\\_t.ligaing on climate change issues in 2021. Enel has been involved in a working group to develop speci/fi.ligac recommendations to suppo/r\\_t.liga the implementation of the  TCFD  guidelines  concerning  scenario  analysis.  The TCFD Advisory Council worked on the scenarios in 2020 and, since then, Enel has been involved in various initiatives of scenario analysis, sharing our experience in order to suppo/r\\_t.liga the increasingly widespread and transparent implementation of this practice among a growing number of organizations.\n\nScenario analysis\n\nThe Group develops sho/r\\_t.liga, medium and long-term scenarios for macroeconomic, /fi.liganancial, energy and climate developments in order to suppo/r\\_t.liga planning, capital allocation, strategic positioning and the assessment of the risks and resilience of the strategy. Scenario-based planning involves de/fi.liganing 'alternative futures' based on a number of key unce/r\\_t.ligaainty variables, such as achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. Compared with forecasting, scenario analysis provides greater /fl.ligaexibility and enables us to prepare for handling risks and seizing oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities. The\n\nforecasting approach develops projections based on past trends, which therefore do not anticipate changes, nor does it incorporate assessments of risks or unce/r\\_t.ligaainties. The preparation of scenarios allows companies to explore and model plausible alternative futures, designing various paths forward with di/ff.ligaerent timing and options, and ultimately to suppo/r\\_t.liga strategic decision-making with a view to maximizing oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities and mitigating risks. This aspect is pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly relevant in the event of potential signi/fi.ligacant disruptions.\n\n## Trend analysis\n\nWithin the scope of de/fi.liganing Enel's scenarios, the midand long-term trends have been identi/fi.ligaed and analyzed in depth, and the results of this analysis are summarized in an Industry View document for internal use. Designed to suppo/r\\_t.liga the decision-making process and Strategic Dialogue, this document provides an overview of the structural forc-\n\nes and macro-trends, and the scenario and technology drivers expected to act in the sector in which Enel operates. As a result, it provides a framework for the de/fi.liganition of actions aimed at guiding, preventing, and adapting to changes in our various businesses, as well as at seizing related oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities.",

There are many global, regional and national energy transition scenarios published by various providers and designed for a wide range of purposes, from government planning and policymaking to the suppo/r\\_t.liga of enterprise decision-making processes. Benchmarking entails analyzing the scenarios  produced  by  the  external  organizations  in  order to compare results in terms of the energy mixes, trends in emissions, and technology decisions and to identify the main drivers of the energy transition for each.\n\nEnel's benchmarking of external energy transition scenarios comprises the following steps.\n\n1.  Analysis of the context of global and national scenarios for the countries in which we operate. The analysis of scenarios, as well as the study of repo/r\\_t.ligas and datasets, is suppo/r\\_t.ligaed by constant dialogue with the analysts of the main scenario providers, which takes the form of in-depth meetings organized speci/fi.ligacally for the Group and peer-review sessions for their main repo/r\\_t.ligas.\n\nGlobal energy scenarios are typically grouped by family based on the degree of climate ambition, as follows:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nBusiness-as-usual/Stated-policies  scenarios : these provide a conservative benchmark for the future and represent how the energy system would evolve in the absence  of  additional  climate  and  energy  policies.

The project sought to develop a common and transparent approach to the use of public scenarios by enterprises operating in the energy system and to suppo/r\\_t.liga them in using the scenarios to assess the risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities associated with climate developments in a manner consistent with the TCFD.

        "page_content": "## Enel's energy transition scenarios\n\nAn energy transition scenario describes how energy production and consumption evolve in a speci/fi.ligac geopolitical, macroeconomic and regulatory and competitive context consistent with the available technological options. This corresponds to a ce/r\\_t.ligaain trend in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and a climate scenario and, therefore, a ce/r\\_t.ligaain increase in temperature by the end of the century compared with pre-industrial levels. It should be noted that the resulting scenario is not deterministic with respect to carbon dioxide emissions. For each climate scenario, the IPCC also always provides both the median value for global warming in 2100 and the very likely range (i.e., the interval covered by the /fi.ligafth to ninety-/fi.ligafth percentiles).\n\nThe main assumptions considered in developing the Enel energy transition scenarios concern:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nthe local policies and regulatory measures to combat climate  change,  enhance  energy  security  and  foster sustainable development, such as measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and the consumption of fossil fuels, to increase energy e/ffi.ligaciency, the electri/fi.ligacation of\n\nconsumption and the share of renewable generation; the global macroeconomic and energy context (for example, gross domestic product, population and commodity  prices),  also  considering  international  benchmarks;\n\nthe evolution of energy production, conversion and consumption technologies, both in terms of technical operating parameters and costs.\n\nIn 2022, Enel revised the framework of medium- and longterm energy transition scenarios, de/fi.liganing scenario narratives on the basis of three main scenario 'signposts', i.e., the main drivers of unce/r\\_t.ligaainty with respect to macroeconomic and energy developments: the achievement of the Paris objectives, the evolution of geopolitical tensions connected with the Russia-Ukraine con/fl.ligaict and the management of the COVID pandemic.\n\nThe benchmark scenario for the Group's long-term planning, called the Paris scenario, is therefore:\n\n\u00b7\n\na Paris-Aligned scenario calling for achievement of the objectives of the Paris Agreement, i.e., keeping the increase in the global average temperature below 2 \u00b0C compared with pre-industrial levels, with a level of climate ambition that is signi/fi.ligacantly higher than business as usual, but without necessarily assuming the global achievement of the Net Zero 2050 target, given the current global level of cumulative ambition;\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\na scenario which assumes that the geopolitical tensions boosted by the Russia-Ukraine con/fl.ligaict will have lasting e/ff.ligaects,  resulting  in  an  acceleration  of  electri/fi.ligacation and renewables use, as well as greater use of LNG, to increase the security of supply in the new context, especially at the European level;\n\ncharacterized by low or endemic COVID, with high vaccination rates and no need for large-scale lockdowns.\n\nThe climate ambition that characterizes the benchmark scenario assumes growing electri/fi.ligacation of consumption and  fu/r\\_t.ligaher  development  of  renewables,  thanks  in  pa/r\\_t.liga to the policies adopted to enhance energy security (e.g., REPowerEU and the In/fl.ligaation Reduction Act in the United States). In this scenario, governments, businesses, organizations and the public around the world pa/r\\_t.ligaicipate e/ff.ligaectively in the common e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.liga to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAs  for  the  possibility  of  assuming  achievement  of  the more challenging Paris Agreement objective, i.e., to stabilize global average temperatures to within +1.5 \u00b0C, as a benchmark for long-term planning, there remain evident unce/r\\_t.ligaainties that a number of countries could remain on business-as-usual trajectories, thereby slowing the decarbonization process towards net-zero emissions by 2050. Given this premise for the external context, the Enel Group operates  a  business  model  and  has  de/fi.liganed  strategic guidelines that are in line with the maximum ambition of the Paris Agreement objectives, i.e., they are consistent with an increase of 1.5 \u00b0C in the average global temperature by 2100, as ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligaed by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi). Enel has set a goal for 2040 to achieve zero direct emissions (Scope 1), with totally renewable electricity generation and zero emissions connected with retail energy sales (Scope 3).\n\nThe assumptions for trends in commodities prices feeding the benchmark scenario are consistent with the external scenarios that achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement. More speci/fi.ligacally, we assume sustained growth in the price of CO 2 through 2030, caused by a gradual reduction in the supply of permits as demand increases, as well as a signi/fi.ligacant decrease in the price of coal due to declining demand. As for gas, we expect pricing pressures to lessen in the coming years as we see a realignment between global supply and demand. Finally, we are forecasting a gradual stabilization in oil prices, with demand expected to peak by around 2030.",

        "page_content": "## Local transition scenarios\n\nEnel's benchmark scenario, the Paris scenario, covers all the geographical areas in which Enel operates and thus has a climate ambition that is in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, suppo/r\\_t.ligaed by a growing electri/fi.ligacation of energy consumption and the development of renewables capacity.\n\nThe scenarios have been de/fi.liganed at the local level using two complementary approaches:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nin the main countries in which we operate, a 'bo/t\\_t.ligaom up' approach has been employed, using models fundamental  to  simulating  the  long-term  equilibrium  of the entire energy system, imposing an explicit limit on the trend in CO 2 emissions for the country. The values of the scenario variables of relevance to the activities of the Group (including electricity demand, electri/fi.ligacation rates,  renewable  and  distributed-generation  capacity, the number of electric vehicles, and the production of green hydrogen) were then calculated using dedicated models over a time horizon to 2050, with a view to minimizing costs for the system, imposing a constraint on CO 2 emissions;\n\nfor the rest of the countries involved, the main scenario variables were determined by applying statistical analysis to internal and consensus data in relation to external scenarios aligned with the objectives of the Paris Agreement as provided by national and international accredited bodies.\n\nThe de/fi.liganition of internal transition scenarios was prompted by the need for greater modeling /fl.ligaexibility and greater geographical and operational granularity for the main variables that impact Enel's di/ff.ligaerent businesses compared with the scenarios that the main external providers can provide. The la/t\\_t.ligaer are typically produced and published at a global or regional level, with some exceptions for pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly large countries, which only rarely correspond to the countries in which the Group is present or has an interest.\n\nEurope, focus on Italy and Spain\n\nUnder  the Paris scenario,  European  countries  show  a downward trend in emissions consistent with the European 'Fit for 55' package thanks to a greater electri/fi.ligacation of energy consumption suppo/r\\_t.ligaed by an increasing contribution of renewables in the energy mix.\n\n## Italy\n\nIn Italy, the Paris scenario, which is more ambitious than the current national plan (National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan 2020), calls for an increase in electri/fi.ligacation to 30% by 2030 (as against 22% in 2021), with renewable energy generation meeting more than 70% of electricity demand (compared with about 55% under the Italian national plan). The Slower Transition scenario is constructed on the assumption that we remain substantially anchored to the provisions of the current National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan in terms of the ambition to reduce emissions, a less optimistic macroeconomic scenario than the Paris scenario, especially in the very /fi.ligarst few years, and greater pressures of prices and supply of fossil fuels and commodities.\n\nThe Accelerated Transition scenario retains the ambition of the Paris scenario with regard to decarbonization while assuming a more e/ff.ligaective review of authorization procedures for renewable plants, which produces a slight increase in the trend in installations, a more rapid reduction in the cost of green hydrogen production technologies and the consequent greater penetration of that source in hard-to-abate sectors, in place of blue and gray hydrogen (hydrogen produced from gas, respectively with and without the use of CCS technologies). In addition, the public devotes greater a/t\\_t.ligaention to climate change, which fosters greater 'climate awareness' in our personal behavior, such as the modal shift in the transpo/r\\_t.liga sector (increased use of low-emission transpo/r\\_t.liga, e.g., public transpo/r\\_t.liga).\n\n## Spain\n\nFor Spain, the ambition level de/fi.liganed under the national plan is in line with achievement of the Paris Agreement objectives. As such, the Paris scenario calls for an electri/fi.ligacation rate of 32% by 2030 (compared with 24% in 2021) and the development of renewables capacity that would bring the percentage of electricity demand met by renewable energy to over 80% (compared with 53% in 2021). By contrast, the alternative Slower Transition scenario assumes a delay in the implementation of policies for greater penetration of renewables and electric technologies, especially as regards private cars. The Accelerated Transition scenario retains the ambition of the Paris scenario, providing for more rapid implementation of authorization procedures for renewables. In addition, the scenario assumes greater incentives for the electri/fi.ligacation of buildings and full implementation of the national green hydrogen strategy, which would enable the acceleration of the construction of renewable plants coupled with electrolyzers before 2030.",

        "page_content": "Latin America, focus on Brazil and Chile\n\n## Brazil\n\nFor Brazil, the Paris scenario, which is more ambitious than the current national plan ( Plano Decenal de Expans\u00e3o de Energia 2031 , 2022) in terms of emissions reduction, would see an increase in electri/fi.ligacation to 25% in 2030 (compared with  22%  in  2021),  with  renewable  generation  meeting more than 88% of electricity demand (compared with the 82% envisaged in the national plan).\n\nThe Slower Transition scenario is constructed on the basis of an assumption that emissions will grow in line with the trend in the current national plan, with hydro generation expanding less than new thermal capacity (gas), and a less optimistic macroeconomic scenario compared with the Paris scenario, especially in the very /fi.ligarst years.\n\nThe Accelerated Transition scenario goes beyond the ambition of the Paris scenario as regards decarbonization, assuming an acceleration in the de/fi.liganition of the regulatory framework for the construction of o/ff.ligashore wind farms, with greater exploitation of the potential of this technology,  a  more  substantial  increase  in  the  penetration  of distributed solar generation and greater development of green hydrogen production technologies.\n\n## Chile\n\nAs far as Chile is concerned, the Paris scenario is consistent with the Net Zero scenario de/fi.liganed in the government's PELP document ( Plani/fi.ligacaci\u00f3n Energ\u00e9tica a Largo Plazo ) in terms of emissions reductions, and includes ambitious targets relating to the production and expo/r\\_t.liga of green hydrogen. Similar to the government scenario, it calls for the closure of all coal-/fi.ligared power plants by 2035 and an increase in the CO 2 tax, achieving high levels of electri/fi.ligacation of transpo/r\\_t.liga through a ban on the sale of conventional vehicles by 2040 and mandatory 100% electri/fi.ligacation of the city bus /fl.ligaeet from 2040.\n\nThe Slower Transition scenario takes a more measured approach, focusing on the application of current measures and policies, which are less ambitious than those included in the Paris scenario.\n\nThe Accelerated  Transition scenario  achieves  net-zero emissions by 2050 and, compared with the Paris scenario, envisages an acceleration of the electri/fi.ligacation of all sectors of the economy, including transpo/r\\_t.liga, bringing forward the ban on the sale of conventional vehicles to 2035, setting more ambitious goals for the expo/r\\_t.liga of green hydrogen, requiring that 100% of the electricity generation mix be renewable by 2050, phasing out coal by 2030 and raising taxes on CO 2 emissions fu/r\\_t.ligaher.\n\n## Why is electri/fi.ligacation a key lever of energy security, sustainability and a/ff.ligaordability? The Italian case\n\nThe electri/fi.ligacation of consumption coupled with renewable energy ('clean electri/fi.ligacation') can generate primary energy savings of up to 70% compared with fossil alternatives, with clear bene/fi.ligats in terms of safety and energy spending, all while making the system more sustainable.\n\nFrom the standpoint of the need to increase energy security and independence, Italy currently meets only 22.5% of its total energy requirements with national resources. The Paris-Aligned scenarios developed internally demonstrate that, by accelerating policies favorable to 'clean electri/fi.ligacation' in accordance with the climate objectives set out in Europe's 'Fit for 55' package, it is possible to raise the energy independence index from its current level of 22.5% to about 40% in just eight years, with that rising to over 80% by 2050.\n\nReducing the need for primary energy by switching from conventional and fossil fuel-based technologies to electric technologies is key to achieving carbon neutrality goals. Moreover, given its greater e/ffi.ligaciency, electricity is also cheaper for consumers: every million electric cars on the market would generate a reduction of an average of 8 Mtoe of petrol or diesel fuel and \u20ac400 million a year in energy costs for end users. Replacing 1 million gas boilers with electric heat pumps translates into savings of some 1 bcm of gas consumption, with total annual savings of \u20ac240 million for end users.

        "page_content": "## The physical climate scenario\n\nWithin  the  framework  delineated  above,  each  scenario narrative has been developed so as to ensure consistency between the energy transition scenarios and the climate scenarios.\n\nUnder the scenarios, the role of climate change is always the most impo/r\\_t.ligaant and generates e/ff.ligaects both in terms of transitioning the economy towards net-zero  emissions and in terms of physical impacts, which may be:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nacute phenomena, namely sho/r\\_t.liga-lived but intense phenomena, such as /fl.ligaooding, hurricanes etc. with potential impacts on assets (e.g., physical losses and business interruptions);\n\nchronic phenomena related to structural changes in the climate, such as the rising trend in temperatures, rising sea levels etc., which may cause persistent changes in the output of generation plants and in electricity consumption pro/fi.ligales in the residential and commercial sectors.\n\nThe projected future behavior of these phenomena is analyzed by selecting the best data available from the output data of climate models at di/ff.ligaerent resolution levels and historical data.\n\nThe Group has selected three of the global climate pathways developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which are in line with those of the IPCC's  sixth  Assessment  Repo/r\\_t.liga  (AR6).  These  scenarios are associated with emission pa/t\\_t.ligaerns linked to a level of the Representative Concentration Pathway, each of which is connected to one of the /fi.ligave scenarios de/fi.liganed by the scienti/fi.ligac community as Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs).  The  SSP  scenarios  include  general  assumptions concerning population, urbanization, etc. The three physical scenarios analyzed by the Group are as follows:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nSSP1-RCP 2.6: compatible with a range of global warming below 2 \u00b0C from pre-industrial levels (1850-1900) by 2100 (the IPCC forecasts an average of about +1.8 \u00b0C from 1850-1900). In the analyses that consider both physical and transition variables, the Group associates the SSP1-RCP 2.6 scenario with the Paris and Accelerated Transition scenarios.\n\nSSP2-RCP  4.5:  compatible  with  an  intermediate  scenario that calls for an average temperature increase of about 2.7 \u00b0C by 2100 from pre-industrial levels. The RCP 4.5 scenario is the one that is most representative of the world's current climate and political landscape and correlated transition assumptions. This scenario forecasts global warming in line with the estimates of tempera-\n\n\u00b7\n\nture increases that consider current policy around the world. (20) In the analyses that consider both physical and transition variables, the Group associates the SSP2-RCP 4.5 scenario with the Slower Transition scenario.\n\nSSP5-RCP 8.5: compatible with a scenario where no particular measures to combat climate change are implemented. This scenario forecasts an increase in global temperatures of about 4.4 \u00b0C from pre-industrial levels by 2100.\n\nThe Group considers RCP 8.5 to be a worst-case climate scenario used to assess the e/ff.ligaects of physical phenomena in a context of pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly signi/fi.ligacant climate change, but it is currently deemed not very likely. This RCP 2.6 scenario is used both to assess physical phenomena and pe/r\\_f.ligaorm analyses that consider an energy transition consistent with most ambitious mitigation objectives.\n\nThe analyses carried out for the physical scenarios considered both chronic and acute phenomena. For the description of speci/fi.ligac, complex events, the Group considers data and analyses of public bodies, universities, and private-sector entities.\n\nThe climate scenarios are global and must be analyzed at the local level in order to determine their impact in the areas of relevance to the Group. Among active pa/r\\_t.liganerships, collaboration is under way with the Ea/r\\_t.ligah Sciences Depa/r\\_t.ligament of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste. As pa/r\\_t.liga of this collaboration, the ICTP provides projections for the major climate variables with a grid resolution of varying from about 12 km to 100 km and a forecast horizon running from 2020 to 2050. The main variables are temperature, rain and snowfall, and solar radiation. Compared with past analyses, current studies are based on the use of multiple regional climate models: the one of the ICTP along with /fi.ligave other simulations, which have been selected as being representative of the set of climate  models  currently  available  in  the  literature.  The output of this set is representative of the average of the various climate models. This technique is usually used in the scienti/fi.ligac community to obtain a more robust and bias-free analysis, mediating the di/ff.ligaerent assumptions that could characterize the individual model.\n\nFor ce/r\\_t.ligaain speci/fi.ligac climatic variables, such as wind gusts, the Group also uses other providers specialized in that pa/r\\_t.ligaicular phenomenon.\n\nIn this phase of the study, future projections have been analyzed for Italy, Spain and all countries of interest to the Group in South America, Central America and No/r\\_t.ligah America, obtaining - thanks to the use of the set of models - a",

Similarly, the Group is also analyzing data related to climate projections for Africa, Southern Asia and Southeast Asia, thereby covering all of the main geographical areas in which the Group is present at the Group level.\n\nThe ICTP is also providing science suppo/r\\_t.liga to interpret all other climate data we gather. We are using climate scenarios for the countries of interest to the Group to allow for a uniform assessment of climate risk.\n\nSome of these phenomena entail high levels of complexity, as they depend not only on climate trends but also on the speci/fi.ligac characteristics of the territory and require fu/r\\_t.ligaher modeling to obtain a high-resolution representation. For this reason, in addition to the climate scenarios provided by ICTP, the Group also uses natural hazard maps. This tool makes it possible to obtain, with a high spatial resolution, recurrence intervals for a series of events, such as storms, hurricanes and /fl.ligaoods. As described in the section 'Risks and strategic oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities associated with climate change', these maps are widely used within the Group,\n\nwhich already uses historical data to optimize insurance strategies. In addition, work is under way to be able to take advantage of this information developed in accordance with climate scenario projections.\n\nFinally, the Group has acquired the tools and capabilities needed to autonomously gather and analyze the raw output published by the scienti/fi.ligac community, so as to have a global, high-level view of the long-term trends in the climate variables of interest to us. These sources include the output from the climate and regional models CMIP6 (21) and CORDEX. (22) CMIP6 is the sixth assessment of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), which is a project of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and of the Working Group of Coupled Modelling (WGCM), which provides  raw  climate  data  from  global  climate  models. These are used to assess standard global measurements at a resolution of about 100x100 km. The Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) also falls within the scope of the WCRP and generates regional climate forecasts at a higher resolution.\n\n## Physical scenario analysis - Integration of climate scenarios within the Open Country Risk model\n\nIn addition to using high-resolution data to analyze the impact of physical phenomena, the Group has also designed a higher-level analysis framework that enables us to obtain a country-level assessment of trends in ce/r\\_t.ligaain global climate hazards in a manner that is consistent across all regions. More speci/fi.ligacally, we have adopted a modular approach that will enable us to progressively upgrade our analyses by including new physical phenomena and re/fi.liganing both the data and our methodologies. At present, four climate phenomena are included: two related to extreme temperatures; one related to intense rainfall; and one related to drought. The possibility of introducing other phe-\n\nnomena such as extreme wind and sea level rise is also being evaluated. The phenomena are assigned a numerical index based on the global distribution to a resolution of about 100x100 km and are summarized in a composite index. This has enabled us to include a dimension related to climate change in the Open Country Risk model. This enables the tool to include both the aspects considered by the Country Risk models and those aspects related to the physical risks considered in the model as a cause of environmental and economic stress in a given country. The Open Country Risk model is described in greater detail in the section 'Macroeconomic and geopolitical trends'.",

Of  these,  the  /fi.ligarst  two  were  characterized using standard metrics widely used in the literature. For heat waves, the standard metrics were supplemented by an ad hoc metric for Enel Grids, correlating extreme past\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nphenomena  that  could  potentially  damage  underground grids. (23) The results in the RCP 2.6 scenario are shown in the /fi.ligagure. We see the average number of days a year experiencing a heat wave tending to increase compared with historical data, with more intense heat waves in the areas that already su/ff.ligaer most from the phenomenon today. The situation is also worsening in the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHISTORICAL\n\nDays per year by province experiencing a heat wave in the 1990-2020 period and average change in number of days in the RCP 2.6 scenario (2030-2050) with respect to historical /fi.ligagure indicated on the left.\n\n| Days per year historical   | \u2206 days - RCP 2.6 vs historical   |\n|----------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| 0  \u00b7  1                    | 0  \u00b7  2                          |\n| 1  \u00b7  2                    | 2  \u00b7  4                          |\n| 2  \u00b7  3                    | 4  \u00b7  6                          |\n| 3  \u00b7  4                    | 6  \u00b7  8                          |\n| 4  \u00b7  5                    | 8  \u00b7  10                         |\n\nExtreme rainfall was assessed by calculating changes in daily rainfall above the ninety-/fi.ligafth percentile, calculated as average millimeters per year in the periods being analyzed. In all the scenarios, in 2030-2050 extreme rain is forecast to increase, accompanied by a slight decrease in the annual total of daily rainfall excluding extreme events. The increase is the greatest in the No/r\\_t.ligah-east and along the Tyrrhenian coast.\n\nAs seen in previous analyses published by the Group, heat waves and /fi.ligare risk will change signi/fi.ligacantly, both increasing under the various climate scenarios considered. Fire risk is described by the Fire Weather Index (FWI), an indicator widely used internationally that takes account of temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind in order to calculate an estimate of /fi.ligare risk. Figures provided by the ICTP may be used to describe the trend in /fi.ligare risk in order to suppo/r\\_t.liga the business in properly managing this risk. Studies that examine the changes in the 2030-2050 forecasts compared with 1990-2020 show that, under all scenarios, there\n\nis an increase in the number of high-risk days (index > 45) in summer. This change mainly impacts the islands and southern Italy, where the increase in high-risk days goes from about +6 to +8 days compared with historical values.\n\nChronic phenomena: chronic temperature changes can be analyzed to obtain information about the potential effects on the cooling and heating demand of local energy systems. As was done in 2020, the thermal requirement was measured using Heating Degree Days (HDDs), i.e., the sum, for all days of the year with a T average \u2264 15 \u00b0C, of the di/ff.ligaerences between the internal temperature (with T internal assumed to be 18 \u00b0C) and the average temperature, and Cooling Degree Days (CDDs), i.e., the sum, for all days of the year with T average \u2265 24 \u00b0C, of the di/ff.ligaerences between the T average and the T internal (assumed to be 21 \u00b0C), respectively, for heating and cooling requirements.

The study can be divided into two phases:\n\n1. a comparison of the seasonal temperature and precipitation averages for 2022 with the observed seasonal distributions of the years 1950-2022; (25)\n\n2. a comparison of the 2022 seasonal temperature and precipitation averages with the seasonal distributions of the climate scenarios in the period 2030-2050.\n\nThe study found that 2022 was actually a unique year, with a winter precipitation around 1.3 mm/day lower than the seasonal average, followed by a spring that exceeded the average by 2.3 \u00b0C and a summer that exceeded the average by 3.4 \u00b0C. What we see is a year a/ff.ligaected by prolonged drought followed by extreme heat. Among years with one season of rainfall below the /fi.ligafth percentile and at least two seasons with temperatures at the extreme tail of the distribution (greater than the ninety-ninth percentile), 2022 stands alone in the historical distribution. We then looked for similar years in the distributions of the climate models (once it was asce/r\\_t.ligaained that the historical distributions are comparable to those of the historical models). The probability of a year like 2022 occurring in the 2030-2050 period remains very low (2%) in the RCP 2.6 scenario, while it increases (12%) in RCP 8.5. This increase is mainly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the rise in temperatures in Italy, for which the entire distribution shifts towards higher values, while the distribution of precipitation remains quite similar to historical pa/t\\_t.ligaerns.\n\nPhysical scenario analysis - Spain\n\nAcute phenomena: for Spain, the analysis /fi.ligarst focused on acute rainfall, calculated as average annual millimeters of rain in the reference periods.

(28) Comparing 2030-2050 with 1990-2020, the /fi.ligagures point to a signi/fi.ligacant increase in heat waves even under the RCP 2.6 scenario, pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly in ce/r\\_t.ligaain areas of Brazil, in Colombia, in Peru, and in no/r\\_t.ligahern Chile. This increase in extreme temperatures is expected to be even more accentuated under the more extreme scenarios (RCP 8.5). With regard to extreme rainfall, we have considered daily rainfall above the ninety-/fi.ligafth percentile, as was done for Italy and Spain. Future changes in this acute phenomenon are less uniform. Under the RCP 2.6 scenario, ce/r\\_t.ligaain areas, such as no/r\\_t.ligahern Brazil and no/r\\_t.ligahern Argentina, are expected to experience declines compared with the historical period, whereas other areas, such as western Colombia and ce/r\\_t.ligaain areas of Brazil and Peru, are expected to see an increase in extreme rainfall.\n\nChronic phenomena: a study was conducted of the potential changes in heating and cooling demand connected with chronic temperature changes. Here, too, we calculat-\n\ned the changes in Heating Degree Days (HDDs) and Cooling Degree Days (CDDs) for 2030-2050 compared with 1990-2020 based on data from six models at a resolution of 25x25 km. The country averages have been calculated as an average over the country, weighting each geographical node by population using the Shared Socioeconomic  Pathways  (SSPs)  associated  with  each  RCP  scenario. In  each  country  studied,  CDDs  increased  progressively across all scenarios: under the RCP 2.6 scenario, they increase by 35% in Chile, (29) but by only 13% and 18% in the other countries considered. Under the RCP 4.5 scenario, the increases were 113% in Chile and just over 25% for Argentina, Brazil and Peru, se/t\\_t.ligaling at 18% for Colombia. The increase in CDDs compared with the historical values is even more signi/fi.ligacant under the RCP 8.5 scenario. As for HDDs, the RCP 2.6 scenario points to considerable reductions in Colombia (-52%), Brazil (-21%), and Peru (-14%), with a slight decline in Chile (-5%). This trend is even more pronounced under the RCP 4.5 scenario: ~-62% in Colombia; ~-27% in Brazil; ~-20% in Peru and -8% in Chile.",

The analyses, which compare 2030-2050 forecasts with the historical period 1990-2020, show a downward trend in Argentina and Colombia. Brazil is projected to experience a slight increase or decrease in total rainfall under RCP 2.6 depending on the group of catchment areas basins con-\n\nsidered. By contrast, rainfall in Peru will remain substantially unchanged in RCP 2.6. Finally, as with Argentina and Colombia, the projections for Chile also point to a reduction in total rainfall in the scenario with the lowest emissions, but this may have already manifested itself in recent years (with a real decrease on historic norms).\n\n## Drought in Chile: is climate change already here?\n\nOver the last 15-20 years Chile has been experiencing a prolonged drought, with a water de/fi.ligacit of 20-40% compared with previous decades. The scienti/fi.ligac community has carefully studied this phenomenon, commonly referred to as Mega Drought (MD). (30) Two contributory causes for a MD have been identi/fi.ligaed: natural variability, which is assumed to be the major factor, and climate change, which is estimated to be responsible for about one qua/r\\_t.ligaer of this phenomenon. (31)\n\nWhat the coming decades will bring is not a simple question to answer. Scienti/fi.ligac studies suggest that, while it is not possible to predict when this will occur, natural variability will likely have a positive impact on the MD and thus reverse the current trend, leading to increased precipitation. At the same time, it is thought that climate change will continue to drive drought conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, it is believed that in the period 2030-2050 rainfall in Chile will probably tend to increase compared with the values observed during the recent Mega Drought, falling sho/r\\_t.liga of the levels registered in the 2000s due to climate change and the decrease in rainfall that this would entail.\n\n(31) Boisier et al .

This level of detail therefore makes it possible to discriminate the speci/fi.ligac e/ff.ligaects that a change in temperature can have on energy demand. For this purpose, the Paris , Slower Transition and Accelerated Transition scenarios described above have been expanded to include the e/ff.ligaect that temperature increases, measured in terms of Heating Degree Days (HDDs) and Cooling Degree Days (CDDs), have on energy demand (total, not just electricity) for residential and commercial heating and cooling. By de/fi.liganing a benchmark scenario consistent with achieving the Paris objectives and with Europe's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, (33) we were able to associate HDDs and CDDs consistent with the RCP 2.6 scenario with the Paris scenario. The same was done with the Accelerated Transition scenario, which, similarly to the Paris scenario, sees the achievement of net-zero emissions by 2050, but is characterized by a faster decline in emissions. HDDs and CDDs consistent with RCP 4.5 were instead associated with the Slower Transition scenario, because it corresponds to a slower decline in greenhouse gas emissions. To stress the analyses fu/r\\_t.ligaher, the la/t\\_t.ligaer scenario was also associated with RCP 8.5.\n\nFor Italy, as regards the separate e/ff.ligaect of the transition, in the Slower Transition scenario electricity demand is approximately 8% lower on average in 2031-2050 compared with Paris . If we exclude the e/ff.ligaect of electricity demand for green hydrogen production, for which the two scenarios have di/ff.ligaerent levels of ambition in accordance with their di/ff.ligaerent decarbonization trajectories, the change in electricity demand declines to 5%. It should be emphasized that green hydrogen is a more e/ffi.ligacient solution from an economic and climate point of view in the Slower Transition scenario as well. What changes between the two scenarios is the speed of penetration into the energy matrix, with only a marginal change in the value at 2050. In the Accelerated Transition scenario, the slightly higher level of\n\nclimate ambition of Paris is achieved not only through faster electri/fi.ligacation, but also lower consumption as a result of the adoption of more 'climate aware' behavior by consumers: electricity demand will increase on average in the period 2031-2050, but numerically by less than 1%.\n\nThe percentage di/ff.ligaerences between the Slower Transition and Paris scenarios for Spain are smaller than for Italy. This re/fl.ligaects the fact that for Spain the existing national energy plan already speci/fi.ligaes ambitious climate objectives, so the Slower Transition scenario does not di/ff.ligaer signi/fi.ligacantly from the Paris scenario. Consequently, less variability is expected in the evolution of the energy system and therefore of electricity demand in the 2031-2050 period. In fact, electricity demand in the Paris scenario is located between the Slower Transition -which shows a change in demand of less than 3% on average -and the Accelerated Transition scenario -which indicates a change in demand of more than 3% on average in the period 2031-2050. If we exclude the impact of electricity demand for hydrogen production, the delta decreases to around -2% for the Slower Transition scenario. Bear in mind that the level of demand for green hydrogen remains similar to Paris in both comparative scenarios, while the speed of penetration of the technology varies.\n\nFor both countries, the speed of the energy transition has a much greater impact on the level of electricity demand than the e/ff.ligaects of the increase in temperature deriving from climate change: the analyses pe/r\\_f.ligaormed show how an increase in temperature deriving from climate change causes demand to increase by less than one percentage point for both Italy and Spain. Conversely, decarbonization and energy e/ffi.ligaciency policies, together with technological innovation, greater social responsibility and the consequent switch from fossil to electric technologies (for example electric cars and heat pumps), will play a substantial role in the evolution of electricity demand and of the energy mix in general.",

that in future years greater than expected electri/fi.ligacation of heating in buildings could change both the sign and the size of the temperature e/ff.ligaect in both countries.\n\nIt is therefore necessary to monitor developments in the share of electri/fi.ligacation of heating during the annual review.\n\nE/ff.ligaect of the variation in temperatures on electricity demand in the\n\nmain Latin American countries in which the Group operates\n\nIn Latin America, the impact of temperature trends, quanti/fi.ligaed through the Heating Degree Days (HDDs) and Cooling Degree Days (CDDs) metrics, was estimated using econometric forecasting models based on historical elasticity for Argentina and Colombia, as well as the use of integrated energy system models for Brazil and Chile, similar to the approach adopted for Italy and Spain, as discussed above. Econometric forecasting models based on historical elasticity were used for Argentina, Colombia and Peru.\n\nIn the case of Brazil, the alternative transition scenarios ( Paris , Slower Transition and Accelerated Transition ) obtained through an integrated energy system model have been expanded to include the e/ff.ligaect of rising temperature on energy demand for cooling purposes in the residential and commercial sectors. HDDs and CDDs consistent with RCP 2.6 have been associated with the Paris and Accelerated Transition scenarios, while those consistent with RCP 4.5 were associated with the Slower Transition scenario. To stress the analyses fu/r\\_t.ligaher, the la/t\\_t.ligaer scenario was also associated with RCP 8.5.\n\nAs  regards  the  transition  e/ff.ligaect  considered  individually, electricity demand in the Slower Transition scenario is approximately 19% lower on average in 2031-2050 compared with the Paris scenario, given the di/ff.ligaerent levels of ambition of the two scenarios in both 2030 and to 2050. If we exclude the e/ff.ligaect of electricity demand for the production of green hydrogen, the delta is reduced to 15%. In the Accelerated Transition scenario, the slightly higher ambition of Paris is achieved via faster electri/fi.ligacation. Accordingly, the electricity demand delta in 2031-2050 averages around a positive 8%.\n\nAlso in this case, the speed of the energy transition has a much greater impact on the level of electricity demand than the e/ff.ligaects of the increase in temperature deriving from climate change. The analysis shows that any increases in temperature caused by climate change have a negligible e/ff.ligaect on electricity demand in Brazil.\n\nConsidering the integrated view, the potential e/ff.ligaect of more ambitious transition scenarios has a more signi/fi.ligacant impact on electricity demand than the increase in temperature resulting from climate change.",

This di/ff.ligaerence is mainly due to assumptions regarding  the  achievement  of  the  country's  ambitious targets  for  green  hydrogen  production  after  2030  set out in the document Plani/fi.ligacaci\u00f3n Energ\u00e9tica Nacional de Largo Plazo (PELP).

In the Accelerated Transition scenario, the greater ambition compared with the Paris scenario energy transition is achieved through the implementation of more stringent decarbonization policies to achieve more electri/fi.ligacation, greater penetration of green hydrogen in industry and transpo/r\\_t.liga and increased expo/r\\_t.ligas of hydrogen. This leads to an average increase of 41.2% in electricity demand over the baseline of the Paris scenario in 2031-2050.

Decarbonization policies together with technological innovation and greater social responsibility will play an active role in the evolution of the electricity sector and the energy mix in general.\n\nThe analysis shows that Argentina could experience an increase in demand due to higher temperatures, with prospective demand rising by an estimated 0.4% to 0.8% (calculated as the average of the demand forecasts for the 2030-2050 period). This estimate is highly dependent on the impact of macroeconomic factors on electricity demand in this country, leaving these forecasts subject to a signi/fi.ligacant degree of unce/r\\_t.ligaainty given the volatility involved.\n\nThe same considerations can also be extended to Colombia, where despite the positive elasticity of electricity demand to temperatures, the expected rise in temperature would still have less impact than that a/t\\_t.ligaributable to economic growth, of between 0.1% and 0.9%. In fact, in Colombia,  historical  evidence  still  shows  a  strong  coupling between the growth of electricity demand and GDP growth, with demand from the industrial sector accounting for around 50% of electricity consumption. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, the variability of the macroeconomic context could have repercussions on the electri/fi.ligacation of the residential and service sectors, which represent the most immediate drivers of the increase in electricity demand in the event of an increase in temperatures.",

In Europe, in response to the great volatility in gas prices, /fi.ligascal and regulatory measures have been introduced in many countries, to varying degrees of success, and di/ff.ligaerent signi/fi.ligacant funding has been made available to help overcome or mitigate the crisis brought about by high energy prices.\n\nIn order to speed up the energy transition, we are seeing an acceleration in the implementation of energy policy and of the new market design.",

We also expect to continue implementing our Stewardship model in non-core countries. At the same time, in line with the objective of exiting from carbon-intensive businesses, the Group expects to take advantage of the current market landscape to begin the process of exiting from the gas business. This overall program of disposals is an integral pa/r\\_t.liga of the plan to rede/fi.ligane the Group's structure while maximizing value for shareholders.\n\nWe expect 2023 to be the key year in the Group's longterm rationalization strategy.

Here at Enel, adapting to climate change also means exploring new business oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities to come out of the changing landscape, developing new technologies, and creating value from the capabilities acquired. The mitigation of climate change involves, in pa/r\\_t.liga, research into innovative technologies that will enable an economy that is green by design or that, for example, simply improve pe/r\\_f.ligaormance and circularity.",

Our roadmap currently calls for reducing all direct and indirect greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions by about 99% from 2017 levels by 2040 throughout our value chain, which is well below the overall threshold set by the SBTi (of 90%). The Group aims to reduce all emissions by 100% with a view to overcoming, over the sho/r\\_t.liga to medium term, all exogenous factors, such as the development of new technological solutions for the supply chain over a wide scale or the implementation of ce/r\\_t.ligaain market-based and political strategies. Enel actively collaborates with vendors, customers and policymakers to promote solutions and accelerate necessary actions.\n\nEnel's decarbonization roadmap is centered around promoting  electri/fi.ligacation  based  on  renewable  energy,  fully phasing out fossil fuels, accelerating the development of renewables, and enhancing grids and going digital.

In order to accelerate the development of renewable energy in the core countries, for the period 2023-2025 the Group will invest \u20ac17 billion, installing 19 GW of new renewables capacity and reaching 75 GW of consolidated renewables capacity by 2025. In addition, progress in grid digitalization will increase the share of digital customers to around 80%. By 2027, Enel will fully phase out all coal-/fi.ligared plants, conve/r\\_t.ligaing the sites to other uses and promoting new social, economic and environmental development for local communities through a just-transition approach that\n\nleaves no one behind.\n\nBy 2030, continuing the investment trend already undertaken in recent years in order to continue accelerating the energy transition, Enel will reach managed renewables capacity of about 130-150 GW, thereby bringing the Group's total generation capacity to a level of 85% renewables, with 100% of grid customers being fully digital. By 2040, generation will be 100% renewable, and the Group will have exited both gas-fueled generation and the retail sale of gas, with 100% of the electricity sold coming from renewable sources.",

Adaptation effo/r\\_t.ligas also include procedures, policies and best practices for resiliency, response and innovation.\n\nFor new investment, we can also take action right from the design and construction phases to reduce the impact of climate risks by design (e.g., by assessing risks and vulnerabilities during the design stage) and to take account of any chronic e/ff.ligaects (e.g., including climate scenarios in longterm estimates for renewable resources).\n\nOnce the weather and climate events have been identi/fi.ligaed, actions to maximize our capacity for adaptation may be categorized as follows.\n\n\u00b7\n\nResponse  Management  -  Procedures  to  prepare  the response to extreme events (e.g., acquiring sho/r\\_t.liga-term weather forecasts and training) and procedures to re-\n\nClean electri/fi.ligacation\n\nElectricity has emerged as a crucial vector in facilitating the transition to clean energy and the decarbonization of energy consumption. The scenarios that target the objectives of the Paris Agreement currently consider electri/fi.ligacation rates of at least 50% by 2050 in order to limit the increase in global temperatures to 1.5 \u00b0C by the end of the century as compared to the pre-industrial era.\n\nThe electri/fi.ligacation of consumption is, therefore, a central factor in reducing society's primary energy needs. Its intrinsic e/ffi.ligaciency makes it an essential pa/r\\_t.liganer of renewable energy in order to achieve zero emissions worldwide.\n\nBased on this assumption, the long-term strategy of the Enel Group places the following at the core of our objectives:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\na conce/r\\_t.ligaed push to electrify energy consumption; an acceleration in renewable energy to reach 85% carbon-free generation by 2030, while gradually eliminating fossil fuels and achieving a greater degree of energy independence for countries that are able to replace fossil-fuel impo/r\\_t.ligas with renewables;\n\ngrid digitalization and enhancement, which will be essential in order to suppo/r\\_t.liga such signi/fi.ligacant change in the energy system, while also enabling greater energy security and reliability.\n\nstore normal operations as quickly as possible (e.g., de/fi.liganing operating and organizational procedures to implement in response to critical events).\n\nResiliency Measures - Actions aimed at increasing asset resiliency, such as assessing the entity of potential acute and chronic risks in order to de/fi.ligane both design requirements and actions to take with regard to existing assets. New business options - Coming up with new businesses or products that are adapted to future changes in climate, so as to facilitate adaptation for both the Group and our communities and stakeholders.\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nIn order to assess the impact of climate change for the purpose of making business and strategy decisions, and thereby aimed at implementing adaptation measures in line with the above, the Group is investing in the development of quantitative models that also make use of climate scenario data in order to assess the impact of climate change on speci/fi.ligac assets or areas of production.\n\nA  number  of  these  models  are  intellectual  prope/r\\_t.ligay  as speci/fi.ligaed in the related section of this repo/r\\_t.liga.\n\nThe Group's strategic actions have the goal of increasing value for customers in the business-to-consumer (B2C), business-to-business (B2B), and business-to-government (B2G) segments by increasing the level of electri/fi.ligacation of these customers and improving the services provided. In order to achieve UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7, i.e., to ensure access to a/ff.ligaordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, increasing the volume of electricity sold and developing beyond-commodity services will be accompanied by a general reduction in costs. The value created by the Group by way of electri/fi.ligacation seeks to guide our customers along the gradual process of replacing fossil fuels in the various segments of consumption.\n\nExpanding the electric vehicle charging infrastructure is key to the mass dissemination of electric cars, so it is a necessary condition to the transition towards carbon-free mobility. This objective is shared by Enel X Way, which is fu/r\\_t.ligaher expanding its charging network and is seeking to have more than 4 million charging points by 2030.\n\nAnother key factor is the electri/fi.ligacation of residential consumption, which Enel will be pushing by promoting heat pumps for home heating and induction cooktops for the kitchen. This will lead to an increase in the electri/fi.ligacation rate for Enel customers from the current 17% to around",

Out of the total investment in grids over the coming years, an increasingly large pa/r\\_t.liga will be dedicated to increasing both the number of connections with new users and the /fl.ligaexibility and capability of the grid to handle an increasing share of distributed generation.\n\n## System electri/fi.ligacation\n\nFlagship projects\n\nEnel X is actively involved in managing three /fl.ligaagship projects in three di/ff.ligaerent locations of strategic impo/r\\_t.ligaance for the Group: Sardinia (Italy), Zaragoza (Spain), and Santiago (Chile). The goal is to create testbeds of electri/fi.ligacation and sustainability to test various business models that can be implemented quickly and with low levels of risk. The success of these projects will be key to broadening and\n\nexpo/r\\_t.ligaing these strategies into other areas of the world. The projects in these three locations will focus on promoting greater-than-average local penetration of electricity, while also building renewables capacity in order to serve the growing energy demand, suppo/r\\_t.ligaed in pa/r\\_t.liga by ba/t\\_t.ligaeries to store electricity. Electri/fi.ligacation can thereby contribute to the decarbonization of the energy system as a whole.\n\nThe #WATTACHANGE campaign\n\nThe nexus of electri/fi.ligacation and e/ffi.ligaciency needs to be easy for the public to understand. All too often this concept, like others, can be confusing and only accessible to the expe/r\\_t.ligas. To come up with examples and other content that is easy to grasp with regard to /fi.liganancial savings, energy security, and the creation of jobs through system electri/fi.ligacation, a group of clean-energy organizations, including\n\nEnel, has created a campaign speci/fi.ligacally aimed at promoting the bene/fi.ligats of clean electricity for consumers in terms of e/ffi.ligaciency, energy saving, and emission reduction. The project has been structured in two cycles, which accompanied the release of the 'Fit for 55' publication in July 2021 and of the REPowerEU plan in May 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSma/r\\_t.liga grids, clean energy and energy e/ffi.ligaciency are accessible to Enel customers thanks to the innovations brought to each sma/r\\_t.liga meter. At present, the Group has already installed 45 million digital meters, and we expect to reach 80 million units by 2030.\n\nTo reach these objectives by 2030, these actions must be put into practice immediately in order to have the desired e/ff.ligaect in time. We therefore need to design a path forward that enables us to reach our long-term objectives and make a concrete contribution to solving the world's challenges through practical action and innovative solutions.

With Grid Futurability \u00ae , Enel is anticipating emerging needs related to electri/fi.ligacation and establishing a roadmap of investment in our electricity distribution infrastructure in order to meet those needs. By combining the use of robust infrastructures and advanced technologies, Grid Futurability \u00ae seeks to provide grids that are increasingly resilient, interactive and intrinsically sustainable in the countries in which we operate, with a focus on urban areas. This approach harmonizes the sho/r\\_t.liga and long-term strategic needs, while maximizing  bene/fi.ligats  and  stakeholder  satisfaction,  and reducing the carbon footprint of our grids. It calls for the strategic use of technology in order to make the best use of existing electrical grids and build fully digital sma/r\\_t.liga grids.\n\nFlexibility Labs\n\nEnel Flexibility Labs aim to strengthen our collaboration with all stakeholders involved in the development of the distribution and electrical systems (e.g., providers of /fl.ligaexible services, producers of related technologies, energy communities, DSOs and TSOs). Using an open-platform grid simulator, the project makes it possible to test, in a realistic se/t\\_t.ligaing, behavior and events that are typical of an electrical grid, along with possible innovative solutions, so as to study this behavior in order to continue developing and improving all systems. The tests are a way to promote collaboration among the pa/r\\_t.ligaies involved and reinforce the use of distributed energy resources, thereby contributing to the ambitions of decarbonization and electri/fi.ligacation on the road to a net-zero future.\n\nOpen Power Grids Association\n\nLaunched by Enel Grids in May 2022, the Open Power Grids Association was created to promote a convergence on and co-design of operating standards for grid components, while maximizing the creation of shared value through  sustainability  and  security,  cost  e/ffi.ligaciency,  and technical pe/r\\_f.ligaormance. The association brings together electricity distributors, components producers and suppliers, research institutes, and other stakeholders in order to co-design and develop operating speci/fi.ligacations for electrical grids that are increasingly sustainable and respectful of the environment, with the shared goal of accelerating the energy transition.\n\n## Electri/fi.ligacation of consumption\n\nElectri/fi.ligacation of our vehicle /fl.ligaeet\n\nWith the goal of electrifying Enel's /fl.ligaeet of vehicles, this project is a strategic lever in decarbonization and electri/fi.ligacation. It will reduce the environmental impact of our vehicles and create economic value by reducing both fuel consumption and maintenance costs.\n\nElectri/fi.ligacation projects\n\nEnel is involved in various international round tables and other projects promoting clean electri/fi.ligacation. One main example is the Net Zero Carbon Cities initiative of the World Economic Forum (WEF), which aims to enable urban transformation towards clean electri/fi.ligacation and the circular economy, using integrated energy solutions for buildings and mobility. The project has enabled Enel to play an active role in the City Sprints in S\u00e3o Paulo and Cagliari, which is a series of workshops that bring together local businesses and city leaders in order to de/fi.ligane new pa/r\\_t.liganerships and promote public-private pa/r\\_t.liganerships. Enel's sma/r\\_t.liga meter has also been included in the Toolbox of Solutions, a digital platform encompassing more than 200 best practices and case studies of clean electri/fi.ligacation, energy e/ffi.ligaciency, and sma/r\\_t.liga infrastructure.\n\nWith regard to green hydrogen, Enel is one of the leaders in the project H2 Zero Pledges, led by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) to engage companies in suppo/r\\_t.ligaing the use and provision of hydrogen with the lowest possible carbon intensity. Enel, for example, has commi/t\\_t.ligaed to produce solely green H2 and expects to reach 2 GW of electrolyzer capacity by 2030 (to be updated to 3 GW in 2023).\n\n## Commitment to electri/fi.ligacation\n\nThe Enel Energy Compact\n\nEnel is one of the companies that has been involved in the United Nations High-Level Dialogue on Energy (HLDE) right from the sta/r\\_t.liga. The HLDE has led to the launch of a global roadmap to set speci/fi.ligac targets for the acceleration of the energy transition and ensure universal access to a/ff.ligaordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy systems by 2030.\n\nEnel's  commitment  includes  several  key  objectives  in suppo/r\\_t.liga of the Company's green electri/fi.ligacation pillar to increase renewables capacity and demand response, to reduce GHG emissions in line with the (SBTi-ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligaed) 1.5 \u00b0C scenario, to install new electric vehicle charging points, and to make new connections in rural and suburban areas",

By listening to and engaging with the various categories of stakeholders, we can identify the priorities and de/fi.ligane the Group's Sustainability Plan, in harmony with the Strategic Plan, based on speci/fi.ligac sho/r\\_t.liga-, mediumand long-term objectives, so as to ensure transparency and accountability in our path to sustainable progress.\n\nOur sustainability strategy, which centers around decarbonization and electri/fi.ligacation, is founded in a respect for human rights, the assurance of health and safety, and a solid structure of governance.\n\nOur commitment to human rights calls for an integrated, global approach that takes account of the needs of our stakeholders  throughout  the  entire  value  chain.  Safe-\n\n## Enel leading the global movement of CFOs toward the sustainable development goals\n\nAlbe/r\\_t.ligao De Paoli\n\nEnel CFO\n\nThe CFO Coalition being promoted by the UN Global Compact is a body that is co-chaired by Enel's CFO, Albe/r\\_t.ligao De Paoli, which aims to inspire the CFOs of large organizations to commit to the creation of long-term, sustainable shared value. This coalition has announced the commitment of the companies involved to tie nearly 50% of all their /fi.liganance to sustainability, including plans to issue new /fi.liganancial instruments, such as the sustainability-linked bonds that Enel introduced in 2019.\n\nThe goal is to mobilize trillions of dollars of investment each year in suppo/r\\_t.liga of the Sustainable Development Goals in areas such as sustainable infrastructure, renewable energy, water, health care, labor conditions, and more. The CFOs of our companies must also promote initiatives to create sustainable, shared value over the long term and increase awareness of the transformational impact that companies can have on /fi.liganancial markets, on the global economy, and on society as a whole.\n\nguarding the health and safety of all who work for and with the Group is a responsibility that is shared at all levels of the organization by integrating safety into processes and training, in relations with contractors, in managing and analyzing injuries in the workplace, and in ongoing quality controls. A solid structure of governance also enables us to ensure that our stakeholders bene/fi.ligat from our principles of transparency, fairness and integrity.\n\nThe planet plays a fundamental role in the creation of value at Enel, and combating climate change is one of the Group's primary challenges. We have de/fi.liganed speci/fi.ligac actions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and improving air quality in the areas in which we operate, while focusing on developing our renewables capacity and gradually closing coal-/fi.ligared plants.\n\nProtecting  natural  capital  and  biodiversity  and  making responsible use of water resources are key to protecting natural ecosystems and to the wellness of the people who live in them, all to the bene/fi.ligat of generations present and future.\n\nWith regard to our customers, we are commi/t\\_t.ligaed to ensuring high standards of service quality to the utmost satisfaction by anticipating market needs, so as to ensure reli-",

Within this landscape, with regard to all the Group's people, Enel is constantly commi/t\\_t.ligaed to improving the o/ff.ligaering of training, increasing the average hours of training per employee, and promoting individual growth, career training, skills development, and pe/r\\_f.ligaormance optimization as new needs arise. In this context, the Group aims to have 40% of all training focus on upskilling and reskilling by 2025.\n\nEnel is commi/t\\_t.ligaed to promoting initiatives that disseminate and strengthen a culture of health, safety, wellness, and  work-life  balance,  that  ensure  a  workplace  that  is safe, inclusive and able to value diversity and individuality, all within an approach based on innovation and entrepreneurial spirit. At Enel, inclusion means caring for all aspects of diversity and valuing the talents of every individual. In today's world, it is essential to innovate, co-create, a/t\\_t.ligaract and draw out talent, and develop a workplace that enables every individual to always express their unique traits in order to seize new oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities.\n\nThe Group has always been commi/t\\_t.ligaed to gender equality, and in 2021 Enel joined the 'Equal by 30' campaign of the Clean Energy Ministerial (CEM), by which various organizations from the public and private sectors commit to promoting gender equality in wages, among leadership, and in oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities by 2030 within the clean energy sector. We have con/fi.ligarmed our objectives for the percentage of women managers to reach 26.9% of senior management and 34.1% of middle management by 2025.\n\nA key factor in achieving our goals of decarbonization and electri/fi.ligacation is the existence of a resilient, sustainable supply chain. For this reason, we work closely with our suppliers, viewing them as pa/r\\_t.liganers in this change and basing our relationship on mutual loyalty, transparency and collaboration. This commitment translates into concrete action in the various stages of the procurement process: in the quali/fi.ligacation of vendors on social (human rights, health and safety) and environmental aspects; in requiring environmental ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacations as pa/r\\_t.liga of the tender process, such as carbon footprint ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacation (75% in value of all procurement agreements in 2025 will include CFP ce/r\\_t.ligai-\n\n/fi.ligacation); and in the application of rankings and/or targets for supplier carbon footprints.\n\nWith regard to the communities in which we operate, we are commi/t\\_t.ligaed to establishing strong, lasting relationships as a fundamental pa/r\\_t.liga of a business model that is able to create shared value over the long term for all stakeholders. The sustainability of our strategy has received con/fi.ligarmation in the progress we have made in terms of our contribution to reaching the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the Group's work with our communities, pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly with regard to ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education (SDG 4), providing access to  a/ff.ligaordable,  reliable,  sustainable  and  modern  energy (SDG 7), and promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth (SDG 8). The impo/r\\_t.ligaant successes thus far have been made possible by our Creating Shared Value (CSV) strategy and model, which integrate social and environmental factors in business processes throughout the value chain, with a pa/r\\_t.ligaicular emphasis on business development, engineering and construction, procurement, and asset management and maintenance.\n\nInnovation, digitalization and the circular economy embrace and strengthen all aspects of Enel's sustainability strategy and accelerate our path to sustainable progress.\n\nTo promote new uses of energy and new ways of managing it and making it accessible to more people in a sustainable manner, we have made innovation a key aspect of our business strategy. This open-innovation approach, which we have named Open Innovability \u00ae , involves traditional action and the development of new models and technologies based on cu/t\\_t.ligaing-edge innovation.\n\nWe promote open collaboration with sta/r\\_t.ligaups, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), large businesses, academia, in-house and other expe/r\\_t.ligas, investors, and all our pa/r\\_t.liganers such that the entire organization can focus on constant renewal, while ensuring the creation of long-term value.\n\nFinally, the energy transition cannot come about without digitalization and cyber security, for which the Group is commi/t\\_t.ligaed to disseminating the most advanced solutions and reinforcing e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.ligas to verify them, so as to prevent cyber-a/t\\_t.ligaack.\n\nThe circular economy, in turn, is increasingly seen as an accelerator of growth throughout the value chain and has become an essential factor in Enel becoming a leader not only in sustainability and innovation, but in the energy transition as a whole. A circular approach makes it possible to reduce both waste and the use of /fi.liganite natural resources, while maintaining the value of goods and materials. In this way, we are able to generate bene/fi.ligats for the environment related not only to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, but more generally as well to the consumption of water and other natural resources, to the production of",

The Group has also taken on the commitment to double this indicator by 2030 over 2020 levels.\n\nIn the words of Ernesto Ciorra, Enel's Chief Innovability \u00a9 O/ffi.ligacer, 'We must work so that raw materials are not con-\n\numed, but rather used and made available again for future production cycles. In this way, we can ensure, for ourselves and for the countries in which we operate, freedom from future supplies and independence from geopolitical tensions. We must do this now, because raw materials are available today, but global demand is increasing dispropo/r\\_t.ligaionately, in parallel with e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.ligas to decarbonize energy generation and industrial production generally. We are the /fi.ligarst to have taken up this commitment, and we are proud of this, because the /fi.ligarst will have a competitive advantage in the circular economy, while the last risk not having access to dwindling materials'.\n\n## Assessment of the risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities connected with the Strategic Plan\n\nThe process of de/fi.liganing the Group's strategies is accompanied by a careful analysis of the risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities connected with those strategies.\n\nIdentifying those risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities within the Enel Group's strategic and industrial planning process is designed to span the horizon of the Plan in an integrated manner.\n\nAlthough the strategy underlying the Plan, as described above, envisages a phase of careful analysis and veri/fi.ligacation of the strategic risk factors and variables, it retains scenario  assumptions  regarding  future  events  that  will not necessarily occur or not occur to the extent assumed, as they depend on variables that cannot be controlled by management.  Upside  and  downside  developments  may occur as time unfolds.\n\nBefore being able to approve the Strategic Plan, a quantitative analysis of the risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities associated with the Group's strategic positioning is presented annually to the Control and Risk Commi/t\\_t.ligaee appointed by the Board of Directors. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, risk factors such as macroeconomic and energy variables (such as exchange rates, in/fl.ligaation, commodity prices and electricity demand), regulatory developments, weather and climate events and risks connected with the strategy are identi/fi.ligaed.\n\nBased on the nature of the risk and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunity drivers, the analytical approach that best represents their volatility is selected. In practice, we pe/r\\_f.ligaorm a deterministic analysis based on what-ifs of the possible evolution of the main\n\nmarket and business variables with respect to the main risk factors for the execution of the Business Plan.\n\nThe validity of the results is also monitored with ex-post analyses by risk cluster. In 2022, most of the actual upside and downside events fell well within the limits estimated by the risk models of the Strategic Plan presented at the end of 2021.\n\nFocusing on the scenario risk analysis for the Strategic Plan, exchange rates, electricity demand and the volatility of energy and commodity prices, together with possible reviews of regulatory frameworks, represent almost all the volatility of the drivers. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, in addition to the US dollar the most impacting currencies are the Chilean peso, the Colombian peso and the Brazilian real. Italy and Spain represent nearly all of the Group's exposure to the impact of the volatility of energy prices and commodity price /fl.ligauctuations on margins.\n\nExamining the other risk factors, such as those connected with weather and climate events, we can see that geographical diversi/fi.ligacation signi/fi.ligacantly reduces the exposure to the risk associated with renewable resources - a highly positive factor considering the Group's positioning and the steady expansion of renewable generation. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, with regard to climate change, the risk associated with chronic e/ff.ligaects is of li/t\\_t.ligale signi/fi.ligacance over the course of the three years of the plan.\n\nThe monitoring of all possible regulatory issues is crucial for assessing any upside or downside impact on the Group.",

While  in/fl.ligaation  is  expected  to  moderate gradually over the course of the year, some underlying in/fl.ligaation dynamics involving /fi.liganal goods and services could persist in the coming qua/r\\_t.ligaers. In response, central banks may delay the process of normalizing their monetary policies by fu/r\\_t.ligaher tightening /fi.liganancial conditions. This represents a major risk, especially in emerging markets such as Latin America, where a fu/r\\_t.ligaher generalized decline in risk appetite could trigger additional capital out/fl.ligaows and place greater strain in bond issues by local governments. Indeed, the /fi.ligascal space of many emerging countries had already been stretched during the pandemic crisis in order to suppo/r\\_t.liga the economic recovery and concerns about debt sustainability in many countries have increased even more now in view of the increasingly less favorable global /fi.liganancial conditions. Finally, new risks could emerge if new variants of COVID-19 should spread, forcing governments to reintroduce restrictive measures on mobility and, con-\n\n## Economic factors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInstitutional and\n\npolitical factors\n\nSocial factors\n\n## Energy factors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOpen Country Risk is a quantitative model that extends the more conventional de/fi.liganition of country risk used in the existing literature by providing a more complete analysis of the risks involved, incorporating economic, /fi.liganancial, political, climate and energy factors.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, the Open Country Risk model has the ambition to measure the economic resilience of individual countries, de/fi.liganed as the balance of their position with respect to the rest of the world, the e/ff.ligaectiveness of internal policies, the vulnerabilities of their banking and corporate system that might po/r\\_t.ligaend systemic crises and their a/t\\_t.ligaractiveness in terms of economic growth, and /fi.liganally a quanti/fi.ligacation of extreme climate events as a cause of stress at\n\nthe environmental and economic level (economic factors). This is accompanied by an assessment of the robustness of the country's institutions and the political context (institutional and political factors), an in-depth analysis of social phenomena, measuring the level of well-being, inclusion and social progress (social factors), and the e/ff.ligaectiveness of the energy system and its positioning within the energy transition process, as these are all essential factors for\n\nsequently, generate new disto/r\\_t.ligaions in supply chains.\n\nThe considerable internationalization of the Group - which has a presence in many regions, including South America, No/r\\_t.ligah America and Africa - requires Enel to consider country risk, i.e., risks of a macroeconomic, /fi.liganancial, institutional, social or climatic nature and those speci/fi.ligacally associated with the energy sector whose occurrence could have a signi/fi.ligacant adverse impact on both revenue /fl.ligaows and the value of corporate assets. Enel has adopted a quantitative Open Country Risk assessment model capable of speci/fi.ligacally monitoring the riskiness of the countries in which it operates.\n\nThe Open Country Risk model seeks to go beyond the more conventional de/fi.liganition of country risk, which focuses on the ability of a government to repay the debt it has issued, to o/ff.ligaer a broader view of the risk factors that can impact a country. The model is divided into four risk components: economic, institutional and political, social, and energy factors.",

For example, the model incorporates various factors re/fl.ligaecting the weight of renewable sources in energy generation, the electri/fi.ligacation process and the environmental sustainability of the national energy system, which together are crucial characteristics for evaluating the country's potential growth and a/t\\_t.ligaractiveness in the medium to long term.\n\nRisks and strategic oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities associated with climate change\n\n## The identi/fi.ligacation and management of risks connected with climate change and actions to seize oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities\n\nAs discussed in previous sections, climate change and the energy transition will impact Group activities in a variety of ways.\n\nIn order to identify the main types of risk and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunity and their impact on the business associated with them in  a  structured  manner  consistent  with  the  Task  force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), we have adopted a framework that explicitly represents the main relationships between scenario variables and types of risk and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunity, specifying the strategic and operational approaches to managing them, comprising mitigation and adaptation measures.\n\nThere are two main macro-categories of risks/oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities: those connected with developments in physical variables and those linked to the evolution of the transition scenarios. The framework described has been created with a view to ensuring overall consistency, making it possible to analyze and evaluate the impact of physical and transition phenomena within solid alternative scenarios, constructed using a quantitative and modeling approach combined with ongoing dialogue with both internal stakeholders and external authorities.\n\nPhysical risks are divided in turn between acute (i.e., extreme events) and chronic, with the former linked to extremely intense meteorological conditions and the la/t\\_t.ligaer to more gradual but structural changes in climate conditions. Extreme events expose the Group to the risk of prolonged unavailability of assets and infrastructure, the cost of restoring service, customer disruptions and so on. Chronic changes in climate conditions expose the Group to other risks or oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities: for example, structural changes in temperature could cause changes in electricity demand\n\nand have an impact on output, while alterations in rainfall or wind conditions could impact the Group's business by increasing or decreasing potential electricity generation. In general, adapting to the probable changes that will occur in the future also drives activities in the /fi.ligaeld of innovation and strategic positioning: new businesses and be/t\\_t.ligaer products could be found to live sustainably in the changed context.\n\nThe energy transition characterized by a gradual reduction of CO 2 emissions has risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities connected both with changes in the regulatory and legal context and trends in technology development and competition, electri/fi.ligacation and customer behavior and the consequent market developments.\n\nConsistent with the situation delineated in the climate and transition scenarios used by Enel to determine risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities, the main transition-related phenomena are beginning to emerge in relation to customer adoption of new behavior, the adoption of industrial strategies in all economic sectors and developments in regulatory policies, including tax policies. By 2030, the transition trends will become visible in response to the evolution of the context: the Enel Group has decided to guide and facilitate the transition, preparing to seize all the oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities that may arise. As discussed previously, our strategic choices, which are already strongly oriented towards the energy transition, with more than 90% of investments directed at improving a number of the Sustainable Development Goals, enable us to incorporate risk mitigation and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunity maximization 'by design', adopting a positioning that takes account of the medium and long-term phenomena we have identi/fi.ligaed. The strategic choices are accompanied by the operating best practices adopted by the Group.",

The 'Climate change risks and opportunities' policy de/fi.liganes a shared approach for integrating issues relating to climate change and the energy transition into the Group's processes and activities, thus informing industrial and strategic choices to improve business resilience and long-term sustainable value creation, in line with the adaptation and mitigation strategy. The main steps considered in the policy are described below.\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nPrioritization of phenomena and scenario analysis. These activities include the identi/fi.ligacation of physical and transition phenomena relevant to the Group and the consequent preparation of the scenarios to be considered, which are developed through the analysis and processing of data from internal and external sources. For the phenomena so identi/fi.ligaed, functions can be developed to connect the scenarios (for example, data on changes in renewable sources) to the operation of the business (for example, changes in expected potential output).\n\nEvaluation of impacts. This includes all the analyses and activities needed to quantify the e/ff.ligaects at an operational, economic and /fi.liganancial level, consistent with the processes in which they are integrated (for example, design of new buildings, evaluation of operational performance, etc.).\n\nOperational and strategic actions. The information obtained from the previous activities is integrated into processes, informing the decisions of the Group and the business activities. Some examples of activities and processes that bene/fi.ligat from this are capital allocation, such as in the evaluation of investments in existing assets or new projects, the development of resilience plans, risk management and /fi.liganancing activities, engineering and business development.\n\nThe main sources of risk and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunity identi/fi.ligaed, the best practices for the operational management of weather and climate phenomena, and the qualitative and quantitative impact assessments pe/r\\_f.ligaormed to date are discussed below.

As declared by the TCFD, the process of disclosing information on the risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities connected with climate change will be gradual and incremental from year to year.\n\n## Enel's resilience to the energy transition and climate change\n\nThe impacts of climate change, technological evolution, the evolution of policies and changes in macroeconomic fundamentals and geopolitical and market conditions make it every more impo/r\\_t.ligaant to develop resilient business strategies, i.e., strategies both capable of withstanding external shocks, and therefore of absorbing the causes of potential crises and thriving even when external conditions change, whether slowly or rapidly, and equipped to identify new oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities and transform them into actions. Jointly considering the factors associated with energy transition scenarios and the various climate change scenarios is therefore a prerequisite for long-term planning.\n\nThe set of transition and climatic scenarios plays a role in guiding strategic and industrial decisions, taking account, for example, of the future e/ff.ligaects of temperature on electricity demand, the investments necessary to suppo/r\\_t.liga the process of ever greater electri/fi.ligacation and decarbonization, the evolution of the market environment and of consumer habits. Given that Enel's Strategic Plan concentrates more than 94% of investment on combatting climate change through the progressive expansion of generation from renewable sources and the development of infrastructure and services to guide energy systems and customers towards progressive electri/fi.ligacation, aiming at the same time at signi/fi.ligacantly reducing the use of fossil fuels and increasing quality and e/ffi.ligaciency, the Group's investments and activities delineate, by design, a long-term growth path that is in line with an energy transition consistent with the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe application of long-term climate scenarios enables the construction of adaptation plans for the Group's asset and business po/r\\_t.ligafolio. Climate scenarios are developed sta/r\\_t.ligaing with the identi/fi.ligacation of the most relevant physical phenomena for each business (such as heat waves, extreme rainfall, /fi.ligare risk, etc.), to produce analyses that provide  both  high-level  indicators  (such  as  comparable country risk indices) and high-resolution data, which make it possible to study physical impacts at the single-site level. The approach applies to both the existing po/r\\_t.ligafolio and new investments.

However, in order to obtain an indicative estimate of the potential impacts, and include the possible early emergence of chronic e/ff.ligaects, it is possible to test sensitivity of the Business Plan to the factors potentially in/fl.ligauenced by the physical scenario, regardless of any direct relationship with climate variables. The current Business Plan was constructed using the information contained in the median scenarios relating to chronic phenomena, in order to also consider the possible e/ff.ligaects of trends in climatic variables.\n\nAnalysis on the impact of chronic climate\n\nchange on renewable generation\n\nTo calculate the impact of the chronic e/ff.ligaects of climate change on the production of our assets, a series of ad hoc functions have been created for each renewable technology (wind, solar and hydroelectric) and plant, which associate, with each change in climatic variables (e.g., temperature, radiation, wind speed, rainfall), probable changes in terms of electrical producibility of the plants in our po/r\\_t.ligafolio.\n\nTo calibrate these 'link' functions, we sta/r\\_t.ligaed from the historical data of the weather-climate variables (34) and from the internal references of the observed producible energy\n\nof our plants. In this way, link functions have been obtained which respond to the speci/fi.ligac characteristics of each renewable plant and technology.\n\nIt was therefore possible to study the chronic climate impacts for possible future projections of climate variables (RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios).\n\nTogether with the chronic phenomena, which involve average structural changes, it is necessary to study the typical volatility of the weather and therefore more sho/r\\_t.liga-term. Both the information derived from the variation ranges of the chronic trends projected by the climatic scenarios and the historical volatilities of the meteorological data were taken as input for the strategic planning, through analysis of the variations in electricity production (TWh) over the last 10 years.\n\nAll /fl.ligauctuations, both weather and climatic, can lead to adjustments, since the production of the plants feeds the sourcing for the sale of energy to customers. In essence, reductions in terms of energy for renewable production can lead to imbalances on the sourcing side which can lead to the purchase of the missing volumes on the market to feed the commercial strategy. Conversely, greater renewable production leads to a possible reduction in the purchase of volumes on the market (or possibly higher sales). From the analyses carried out at individual plant level and then aggregated, it has been calculated that on average\n\n(34) Historical data from ISPRA ( Istituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca Ambientale ) and ERA5 data from ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts).",

The average changes in wind production will greatly depend on the location of the assets, with both positive and negative minor changes. Finally, the e/ff.ligaects for solar technology will generally be positive with average increases at the country level of up to 3% in the period 2030-2050 in the RCP 2.6 scenario. These e/ff.ligaects, aggregated at the po/r\\_t.ligafolio level, highlight the e/ff.ligaects of geographical and technological diversi/fi.ligacation that balance the di/ff.ligaerent variations.\n\nAcute physical changes creating risks and\n\noppo/r\\_t.ligaunities\n\nWith  regard  to  acute  physical  phenomena  (extreme events), the intensity and frequency of extreme physical phenomena can cause signi/fi.ligacant and unexpected physical damage to assets and generate negative externalities associated with the interruption of service.\n\nWithin climate change scenarios, the acute physical component plays a leading role in de/fi.liganing the risks to which the Group is exposed, due both to the broad geographical diversi/fi.ligacation of its asset po/r\\_t.ligafolio and the primary importance of renewable resources in electricity generation.\n\nAcute physical phenomena, in di/ff.ligaerent cases such as wind storms, /fl.ligaoods, heat waves, cold snaps, etc., are characterized by considerable intensity and a frequency of occurrence that, while not high in the sho/r\\_t.liga term, is clearly trend-\n\ning upwards in medium and long-term climate scenarios.\n\nTherefore, the Group, for the reasons described above, is already managing the risk associated with extreme events in the sho/r\\_t.liga term. At the same time, the methodology is also being extended to longer time horizons (up to 2050) in accordance with the climate change scenarios that have been developed (RCP 8.5, 4.5 and 2.6).\n\n## Acute event risk assessment methodology\n\nIn order to quantify the risk deriving from extreme events, the Group uses a consolidated catastrophic risk analysis approach, which is adopted in the insurance sector and in the IPCC repo/r\\_t.ligas. (35) Through its insurance business units and the captive insurance company Enel Insurance NV, the Group manages the various phases of assessing the risks connected with natural disasters: from assessment and quanti/fi.ligacation to the corresponding insurance coverage to minimize impacts.\n\nThe methodology is applicable to all extreme events that can be analyzed, such as wind storms, heat waves, tropical cyclones, /fl.ligaooding, etc. In all of these types of natural disasters, three independent factors can be identi/fi.ligaed, as brie/fl.ligay described below.\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nThe event probability (hazard), i.e., the theoretical frequency of the event over a speci/fi.ligac time frame: the recurrence interval. In other words, a catastrophic event that has, for example, a recurrence interval of 250 years has a probability of occurrence in any given year of 0.4%. This information, which is necessary for assessing the level of frequency of the event, is then associated with the geographical distribution of Group assets.\n\nFor this purpose, the Group adopts the hazard map tool, which associates the estimated frequency associated with an extreme event, for the di/ff.ligaerent types of natural disasters, with each geographical point of the global map. This information, organized in geo-referenced databases, are obtained from global reinsurance companies, weather consulting /fi.ligarms or academic institutions.\n\nVulnerability, which indicates in percentage terms how much value would be lost upon the occurrence of a given catastrophic event. In more speci/fi.ligac terms, reference can be made to the damage to material assets, the impact on the continuity of electricity generation and/or distribution or the provision of electrical services to end users.\n\nThe Group, especially in the case of damage to its assets, conducts and promotes speci/fi.ligac vulnerability analyses for each technology in its po/r\\_t.ligafolio: solar, wind and hydroelectric generation plants, transmission and distribution grids, primary and secondary substations, etc. These analyses are naturally focused on the extreme events that most impact the di/ff.ligaerent types of technologies. This produces a so/r\\_t.liga of matrix that associates the signi/fi.ligacantly impacted type of asset with the individual natural catastrophic events.\n\nExposure is the set of economic values present in the Group's po/r\\_t.ligafolio that could be materially impacted in the presence of catastrophic natural events. Again, the dimensions of the analyses are speci/fi.ligac for the di/ff.ligaerent production technologies, distribution assets and services to end users.\n\nH. Kumamoto and E.J.

The Group implements various risk mitigation measures, which, as described below, include both insurance coverage and other management and operational arrangements to fu/r\\_t.ligaher lower the Company's risk pro/fi.ligale.\n\nThe empirical evidence indicates negligible repercussions from these risks, as shown by the data for the last /fi.ligave years.\n\nConsidering the most signi/fi.ligacant events, de/fi.liganed as events with a gross impact of more than \u20ac10 million, the cumulative gross impact amounts to about \u20ac130 million, which represents less than 0.06% of the value of the Group's insured assets as at 2022 (about \u20ac224 billion), most of which was recovered through insurance reimbursements.\n\n## Acute Events Risk Index (AERI)\n\nThe Group has developed a climate change index called Acute Events Risk Index (AERI) (36) to provide a high-level indication of changes in risk a/t\\_t.ligaributable to climate change for acute phenomena. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the results show the share of installed capacity that, based on climate projections (RCP 2.6), will be located in areas characterized by a risk class that will vary depending on the expected increase in the hazard a/t\\_t.ligaributable to climate change in the 2030-2050 period compared with the historical period.\n\nThe index considers the Group's hydroelectric, solar and wind plants (Enel Green Power and Enel X), using climate metrics and the approach followed for the preliminary screening, which will also be described later, in order to identify assets that will be exposed to more intense climate change e/ff.ligaects. The objective of this evaluation is to de/fi.ligane the priorities for the detailed analyses necessary for the identi/fi.ligacation of adaptation actions. It is impo/r\\_t.ligaant to specify that this index o/ff.ligaers a summary representation of a screening pe/r\\_f.ligaormed for each plant and relevant physical phenomenon, against which priorities will be evaluated for more detailed analyses.\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the relevant physical phenomena are considered for each plant, with respect to which the level of future climate change is calculated and a risk class (high, medium, low, very low) is assigned to each asset using an appropriate weighting system. At this point it is possible to aggregate the results and arrive at the Group AERI value broken down by each risk category.\n\nAs shown in the /fi.ligagure below, in the RCP 2.6 scenario, only 1% of the total analyzed capacity (37) of the Enel Group is located in areas classi/fi.ligaed as at high risk from climate change: for these plants, a detailed analysis is a priority in order to identify possible adaptation measures. By comparison, 15% will be located in medium-risk areas. This means that the asset situation must be analyzed on a rolling basis to evaluate whether to proceed with more in-depth analyses using higher resolution data in order to determine the need for adaptation with respect to speci/fi.ligac phenomena. Finally, the remaining installed capacity (84%) is associated with a low or very low risk: plants in these categories are not expected to be exposed to substantial climate change impacts in the RCP 2.6 scenario. For these, therefore, the criteria and actions already implemented remain adequate and any detailed studies will have a lower priority. The analyses will in any case be updated and re/fi.liganed on an ongoing basis to ensure monitoring of expected climate change e/ff.ligaects on all plants.",

The two main programs, in terms of coverage and volumes, are the following:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nthe Prope/r\\_t.ligay Program ('Prope/r\\_t.ligay Damage and Business Interruption Insurance Program') for material damage to assets and the resulting business interruption. Accordingly, in addition to the costs of rebuilding assets (or pa/r\\_t.ligas thereof), the /fi.liganancial losses due to the stoppage of electricity generation and/or distribution are also covered, within the limits and conditions de/fi.liganed in the policies;\n\nthe Liability Program ('General & Environmental Liability Insurance Program'), which insures against losses caused to third pa/r\\_t.ligaies, including the impact that extreme events may have on the Group's assets and business.\n\nBased on e/ff.ligaective risk assessment, it is possible to specify appropriate limits and insurance conditions within the policies, and this also applies in the case of extreme natural events linked to climate change. In fact, in the la/t\\_t.ligaer case, the impacts on the business can be signi/fi.ligacant but, as has happened in the past in various locations around the world, the Group has demonstrated a high degree of resilience, thanks to the ample insurance coverage limits, thanks in pa/r\\_t.liga to the Group's solid reinsurance capabilities through the captive company Enel Insurance NV.\n\n54\n\n%\n\nThe presence of this e/ff.ligaective insurance coverage does not make the actions that the Group takes in the preventive maintenance of its generation and distribution assets any less impo/r\\_t.ligaant. In fact, while on the one hand the e/ff.ligaects of these activities are immediately re/fl.ligaected in the mitigation of the impacts of extreme events, on the other hand they are a necessary prerequisite for optimizing risk /fi.liganancing and minimizing the cost of the Group's global insurance coverage  programs,  including  the  risk  associated  with catastrophic natural events. This adaptive strategy takes the form of management strategies and actions that go beyond insurance alone and change with the surrounding conditions. For example, the Group has managed to sterilize much of the strong upward trend in premiums on the insurance markets through changes to its risk retention policies for assets, as well as through internal risk transfer policies that reward the business lines that are most vi/r\\_t.ligauous in terms of risk mitigation. From this perspective, the method and the information extracted from the ex-post analysis of events play a crucial role in determining the processes and practices to be deployed in mitigating such events in the future.\n\nWithin the Prope/r\\_t.ligay Program, Enel Insurance NV o/ff.ligaers a Premium Refund mechanism for business lines connected with losses and the achievement of the Group's SDG objectives, contributing to the vi/r\\_t.ligauous circle linked to the Group's adaptation to the challenges of climate change.",

        "page_content": "## Grid resilience lies at the hea/r\\_t.liga of Enel's strategy\n\nThe Enel Grids Business Line, following the Group guidelines mentioned above ('Climate change risks and opportunities'), has issued a speci/fi.ligac policy (Climate Change Risk Assessment) that provides general criteria, methodological tools and requirements for identifying, analyzing and assessing climate change risks in respect of the assets managed and the activities conducted, in order to monitor the risk and the actions to be implemented to mitigate its impacts.\n\nIn the Enel Grids Business Line the Enel Group has adopted an approach in recent years called '4R' to cope with extreme climate events. A speci/fi.ligac policy (which seeks to implement an innovative strategy to ensure the resilience of the distribution grid) has been developed to de/fi.ligane the measures to be taken both in preparation for an emergency within the network and for the prompt restoration of service once climate events have caused damage to assets and/or outages. The 4R strategy is divided into four phases:\n\n1.\n\nRisk prevention: this includes actions that make it possible to reduce the probability of losing network components because of an event and/or to minimize its e/ff.ligaects, i.e., interventions aimed both at increasing the\n\nGuidelines for Readiness Response and Recovery actions during emergencies\n\nGuideline for Network Resilience Enhancement Plan\n\nThis policy seeks to identify the most impactful extraordinary climate events on the network, to evaluate the speci/fi.ligac KPIs of the AS-IS network and to improve them based on proposed interventions in order to be able to evaluate the order of priority. In this manner, actions are selected that, when implemented, will minimize the impact on the grid of pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly critical extreme events in a given area/region. The policy therefore covers the /fi.ligarst two phases of the 4R approach, suggesting measures regarding risk prevention and readiness.\n\nIn Italy, this policy has been translated into the Resilience Plan that e-distribuzione has prepared each year since 2017, which represents an addendum to the Development Plan for ad hoc investments over a 3-year time horizon to reduce the impact of extreme events in ce/r\\_t.ligaain critical areas, namely heat waves, icing and windstorms (with the associated risk of falling trees). In 20172021, some \u20ac672 million were invested and about \u20ac262 million will be invested in the following three-year period, as speci/fi.ligaed in the addendum to the 2022-2024 Plan. To address these risks, investments include the targeted replacement of uninsulated lines with insulated conductors, the undergrounding of cables in some cases or solutions involving routes to restore power that are not vulnerable to the above phenomena.\n\nAs in Italy, similar issues are being explored in other countries, both in Europe and South America, in order to prepare an ad hoc investment planning process to enhance the resilience of grids to extreme events, taking due account of the distinctive characteristics of each territory.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\n4.\n\nrobustness of the infrastructure and maintenance interventions. The choice of technical solutions to enhance resilience is guided by a catalogue that identi/fi.ligaes the most appropriate response for each climate event and geographical area.\n\nReadiness: this includes all measures aimed at increasing the speed with which a potentially critical event can be identi/fi.ligaed, ensuring coordination with Civil Protection authorities and local institutions and preparing the necessary resources once a grid disruption has occurred. Response: this represents the phase in which the operational capacity to cope with an emergency upon the occurrence of an extreme event is assessed. It is directly related to the ability to mobilize operational resources in the /fi.ligaeld and the capacity to remotely restore power supply through resilient backup systems.\n\nRecovery: this is the last phase, in which the goal is to return the grid to ordinary operating conditions as soon as possible in cases where an extreme weather event has caused service interruptions despite the increased resilience measures taken previously.\n\nFollowing this approach, the business line has prepared various policies for speci/fi.ligac actions to address the various aspects and risks associated with climate change. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular:\n\nThis policy covers the last three phases of the 4R approach, indicating guidelines and measures to improve preparation strategies, mitigate the impact of total blackouts and, /fi.liganally, restore service to as many customers as possible in the sho/r\\_t.ligaest time possible.",

The document provides guidelines to be implemented in the various territories involved to identify areas/plant at risk, de/fi.ligane speci/fi.ligac prevention measures (e.g., evaluation of speci/fi.ligac maintenance plans and any upgrades) and, in the event of a /fi.ligare, manage the emergency optimally in order to limit its impact and restore service as soon as possible.\n\nThese include the implementation of systems for weather forecasting, monitoring the status of the grid and evaluating the impact of critical climate phenomena on the grid, the preparation of operational plans and the organization of speci/fi.ligac exercises. Pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly impo/r\\_t.ligaant in this regard are advance agreements for the mobilization of extraordinary resources to respond to emergencies, comprising both internal personnel and contractors. For example, in Italy, in addition to having installed and placed in operation three experimental stations to observe and investigate ice formation on MV lines, IoT sensor trials were launched to monitor on above-ground lines in areas that are highly exposed to snow and wind (Project Newman).\n\nEnel Grids is making a signi/fi.ligacant contribution to the drafting of the initial industry publications on the impo/r\\_t.ligaance of resilience and adaptation to climate change and possible actions, including the repo/r\\_t.liga issued by Eurelectric-EPRI (38) in December 2022 entitled 'The Coming Storm: building electricity resilience to extreme weather'.\n\nWith a view to ensuring continuous improvement, Enel Grids also pe/r\\_f.ligaorms scouting activities, directly contacting sta/r\\_t.ligaups and industry expe/r\\_t.ligas or using challenges proposed by the Enel Group's Innovability function, in order to identify innovative technological solutions to suppo/r\\_t.liga climate impact and adaptation measures to increase the resilience of the grid.\n\n## Analyzing future climate impacts to identify adaptation measures\n\nBeginning with the mapping of key phenomena at the global level, Enel Grids monitors trends in the most critical threats in the various countries in which the Group operates in order to estimate their future impact on the grid in the medium and long term. To do this, it is /fi.ligarst necessary to pe/r\\_f.ligaorm a preliminary assessment of the impacts on the grid (including associated failures) of the extreme weather events that have occurred in the past. The mapping that associates the most critical acute events to each core country is shown in the /fi.ligagure below. This enables the identi/fi.ligacation of priority analyses to identify any adaptation measures.",

Here are some examples:\n\n## Heavy rainfall/wind storms\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nIn 2022, an analysis was conducted to investigate the phenomenon of explosive cyclogenesis (the product of a combination of intense wind and rain) in Spain, with projections of events up to 2050, evaluating the possible future impacts on grid assets. The initial /fi.ligandings suggest that the trend is substantially in line with the historical observed record, with the exception of the coastal areas of Catalonia, where a possible intensi/fi.ligacation of events is expected.\n\nAgain in 2022, studies were also carried out in Colombia on the impact of rainfall in both the Bogot\u00e0 and Cundinamarca areas, evaluating the possible scenarios up to 2050. The in-depth studies carried out show a substantial persistence over time of the negative effects associated with this phenomenon. On the basis of these initial results, the planned response measures mainly  regard  waterproo/fi.ligang  secondary  substations in urban areas, to ave/r\\_t.liga /fl.ligaood risk, and strengthening aerial infrastructures to limit the consequences of the direct impact of rainfall.\n\n## Heat waves\n\n\u00b7\n\nIn 2022 heat waves in Italy were investigated fu/r\\_t.ligaher on the basis of the initial results in 2020. This critical event is characterized by the persistence of high tempera-\n\ntures over a period of several days in correspondence with the absence of precipitation which, by hindering the dissipation of heat from underground cables, causes an anomalous increase in the risk of multiple failures on grids, especially in urban areas and in summer tourist locales. The analyses pe/r\\_f.ligaormed have highlighted how this climate phenomenon will intensify in the coming decades by 10-40% by 2050 (depending on the climate scenario), requiring adequate adaptation actions as already laid out in the expanding commitment envisaged both by the Resilience Plan indicated above and from pa/r\\_t.ligaicipation in the tender of the NRRP (National Recovery and Resilience Plan) for the funds (\u20ac350 million) allocated for increasing the resilience of infrastructure.\n\n## Wild/fi.ligares\n\n\u00b7\n\nWith regard to /fi.ligare risk, the business line, consistent with the above policy, is preparing an update of the policy on /fi.ligare risk prevention, applying an index that evaluates the /fi.ligare risk of areas based on topological and environmental characteristics (FWI: Fire Weather Index) as a suppo/r\\_t.liga tool, with projections of scenarios to 2050 on developments in the phenomenon. So far, each country has conducted a study to identify the areas at greatest risk of forest /fi.ligares. Today, the study also draws on GIS (Geographic  Information  System)  mapping  for  more precise identi/fi.ligacation of grids in di/ff.ligaerent environments (protected natural areas, forests, habitats). This makes it possible to adopt even more e/ff.ligaective construction or maintenance design measures to prevent /fi.ligare risk.",

At the same time, potential risks and possible resilience solutions  are  being  assessed  for  business-to-business  and business-to-government customers.\n\nThe work on adaptation focused on de/fi.liganing a methodology for assessing the vulnerability of Enel X Global Retail  assets  by  extending  the  studies  developed  by  Enel Green Power and Thermal Generation and Enel Grids for the assessment and management of acute meteorological events for solar (Distributed Energy PV) and for public lighting.\n\nFor solar, a preliminary climate risk screening was carried out in the countries/assets identi/fi.ligaed as priorities for certain acute events such as extreme winds, heavy rainfall/ /fl.ligaoods and /fi.ligare risk. From the work pe/r\\_f.ligaormed so far and from the /fi.ligandings of the preliminary screening for solar energy, no critical issues have emerged concerning climate impacts on the identi/fi.ligaed assets. The analysis will be extended to sites for new facilities. For public lighting assets, the correlation analysis between data regarding historical losses/faults recorded so far and acute climatic events is being re/fi.liganed.\n\nInclusion of climate change e/ff.ligaects in the\n\nassessment of new projects\n\nMany activities connected with the evaluation and implementation of new projects can bene/fi.ligat from general and site-speci/fi.ligac climate analyses, which the Group is beginning to integrate with those already considered in the evaluation of new projects. For example:\n\n\u00b7\n\npreliminary studies: in this phase, climate data can serve as a preliminary screening tool, with the analysis of speci/fi.ligac climate phenomena, such as those discussed previously in the analysis of physical scenarios, and synthetic\n\nPolicy & Regulation\n\nLimits on\n\nemissions and\n\ncarbon pricing\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nindicators such as the Climate Risk Index, integrated into the Open Country Risk model. These data provide a preliminary measure of the most relevant phenomena in an area among those identi/fi.ligaed as being relevant for each technology;\n\nestimation of expected output: the climate scenarios will be progressively integrated to enable the evaluation of how climate change will modify the availability of renewable sources at the speci/fi.ligac site. In the in-depth development of the preliminary analyses on potential output, the approach applied for now to selected pilot sites is described and then scaled up over the entire generation po/r\\_t.ligafolio;\n\nenvironmental  impact  analysis:  the  Group  has  begun to  integrate  a  Climate  Change  Risk  Assessment  into project documentation. This contains a representation of  the  main  physical  phenomena  and  their  expected change in the area;\n\nresilient design: as noted, the development of resilient assets by design is a key climate change adaptation activity. The Group is working to progressively consider analyses based on climate data, such as the increase in the frequency and intensity of acute events. The la/t\\_t.ligaer will integrate existing analyses based on historical data already in use, in order to increase the resilience of future assets, including all necessary adaptation actions over the useful life of a project.\n\n## Transition phenomena: repercussions on our business, risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities\n\nWith regard to the risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities associated with transition variables, we use the di/ff.ligaerent reference scenarios in combination with the elements that make up the risk identi/fi.ligacation process (e.g., competitive context, long-term vision of the industry, materiality analysis, technological evolution, etc.) to identify the drivers of potential risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities. Priority is given to the most material phenomena. The main risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities identi/fi.ligaed within this framework are described below.\n\nLaws  and  regulations  that  introduce  more  stringent  emission  limits  by  government  action (non-market driven) and market-based mechanisms.\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nOppo/r\\_t.ligaunities : command & control regulations and market-based mechanisms strengthening CO 2 price signals to foster investment in carbon-free technologies.\n\nRisks : lack of a coordinated approach among the various actors and policymakers involved and limited e/ff.ligaectiveness of the policy instruments, with an impact on the speed of the trend towards electri/fi.ligacation and decarbonization in the various sectors, compared with a decisive Group strategy focused on the energy transition.",

This impact is limited, however, considering an unchanged market design based on system marginal prices in the medium term. Any alternative market structures could induce di/ff.ligaerent e/ff.ligaects.\n\nWith regard to the /fi.liganancial impact of changes in transition scenarios, the Group analyzed the impact of the Slower Transition and Accelerated Transition scenarios on 2030 results in terms of EBITDA compared with the benchmark Paris scenario.\n\nWith regard to the electri/fi.ligacation of consumption, however, the Slower Transition scenario envisages lower penetration rates for the most e/ffi.ligacient electrical technologies, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular electric vehicles and heat pumps, producing a decrease in electricity demand compared with the Paris scenario, which would have a limited impact on the commodity and beyond-commodity retail business.

The commodity risk control process limits the impact of unexpected changes in market prices on margins and, at the same time, ensures an adequate margin of /fl.ligaexibility that makes it possible to seize sho/r\\_t.liga-term oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities.\n\nIn order to mitigate the risk of interruptions in the supply of fuel and raw materials, the Group has diversi/fi.ligaed fuel sources, using suppliers from di/ff.ligaerent geographical areas.\n\nIn 2022, the complex global economic crisis - triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic - continues in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine con/fl.ligaict and climate change, sparking increases in the volatility of prices of energy commodities and other raw materials. In the last qua/r\\_t.ligaer, the risks recorded by Enel exceeded the limits estimated in 2021 for the year 2022 for energy commodities, which were contained thanks to careful and timely mitigation measures, the geographical diversi/fi.ligacation of our business and supply channels in order to reduce dependence on Russian gas. Finally, the adoption of global and local strategies, such as /fl.ligaexibility in contractual clauses and proxy hedging techniques (in the event that hedging derivatives are not available on the market or are not su/ffi.ligaciently liquid), has made it possible to optimize results even in a highly dynamic market context.\n\nIn view of their geographical diversi/fi.ligacation, access to international markets for the issuance of debt instruments and transactions in commodities, Group companies are exposed to the risk that changes in exchange rates between the presentation currency and other currencies could generate unexpected changes in the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance and /fi.liganancial aggregates in their respective /fi.liganancial statements. Given the current structure of Enel, the exposure to currency risk is mainly linked to the US dollar and is a/t\\_t.ligaributable to:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\ncash /fl.ligaows in respect of the purchase or sale of fuel or electricity;\n\ncash /fl.ligaows in respect of investments, dividends from foreign subsidiaries or the purchase or sale of equity investments;\n\ncash /fl.ligaows connected with commercial relationships;\n\n/fi.liganancial assets and liabilities.\n\nThe possible impacts of exchange rate risk are re/fl.ligaected in:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\ncosts and revenue denominated in foreign currencies with respect to the time at which pricing conditions were de/fi.liganed or the investment decision was made (economic risk);\n\nrevaluations or adjustments to fair value of /fi.liganancial assets and liabilities sensitive to exchange rates (transaction risk);\n\nthe consolidation of subsidiaries with di/ff.ligaerent currencies of account (translation risk).\n\nThe currency risk management policy is based on systematically hedging the exposures of the Group companies, with the exception of translation risk.\n\nAppropriate operational processes ensure the de/fi.liganition and implementation of appropriate hedging strategies, which typically employ /fi.liganancial derivatives obtained on OTC markets.\n\nRisk control through speci/fi.ligac processes and indicators enables us to limit possible adverse /fi.liganancial impacts and, at the same time, to optimize the management of cash /fl.ligaows on the managed po/r\\_t.ligafolios.

Other risks include the reputational and /fi.liganancial risks associated with signi/fi.ligacant exposures to a single counterpa/r\\_t.ligay or groups of related customers, or to counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies operating in the same sector or in the same geographical area.\n\nThe exposure to credit risk is a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the following types of operations:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nthe sale and distribution of electricity and gas in free and regulated markets and the supply of goods and services (trade receivables);\n\ntrading activities that involve the physical exchange of assets or transactions in /fi.liganancial instruments with commodity underlyings (the commodity po/r\\_t.ligafolio);\n\ntrading in derivatives, bank deposits and, more generally, /fi.liganancial instruments (the /fi.liganancial po/r\\_t.ligafolio).\n\nThe policy for managing credit risk associated with commercial activities and transactions in commodities provides for a preliminary assessment of the creditwo/r\\_t.ligahiness of counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies and the adoption of mitigation instruments, such as obtaining guarantees.\n\nThe control process based on speci/fi.ligac risk indicators and, where possible, limits ensures that the economic and /fi.liganancial impacts associated with a possible deterioration in credit standing are contained within sustainable levels. At the same time, this approach preserves the necessary /fl.ligaexibility to optimize po/r\\_t.ligafolio management.\n\nIn addition, the Group unde/r\\_t.ligaakes transactions to factor receivables without recourse, which results in the complete derecognition of the corresponding assets involved in the factoring.\n\nFinally, with regard to /fi.liganancial and commodity transactions, risk mitigation is pursued through the diversi/fi.ligacation of the po/r\\_t.ligafolio (giving preference to counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies with a high credit rating) and the adoption of speci/fi.ligac standardized contractual frameworks that contain risk mitigation clauses (e.g., ne/t\\_t.ligaing arrangements) and possibly the exchange of cash collateral.\n\nDespite the deterioration in the collection status of ce/r\\_t.ligaain customer segments, which was taken into consideration in determining impairment of trade receivables, the Group's po/r\\_t.ligafolio has so far demonstrated resilience to the macroeconomic context and current price scenario. This re/fl.ligaects the expansion of digital collection channels and a solid diversi/fi.ligacation of commercial customers.\n\nEnel's liquidity risk management policy is designed to maintain su/ffi.ligacient liquidity to meet expected commitments over a given time horizon without reso/r\\_t.ligaing to additional sources of /fi.liganancing, also retaining a prudential liquidity reserve, su/ffi.ligacient to meet any unexpected commitments. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, in order to meet its medium and long-term commitments, Enel pursues a borrowing strategy that provides for a diversi/fi.ligaed structure of funding sources, which it uses to meet its /fi.liganancial needs, and a balanced maturity pro/fi.ligale.\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group, while solvent, would not be able to discharge its obligations in a timely manner or would only be able to do so on unfavorable terms or in the presence of constraints on disinvestment from assets with consequent capital losses, owing to situations of tension or systemic crises (credit crunches, sovereign debt crises, etc.) or changes in the perception of Group riskiness by the market.",

The framework is based on the commitment of top management, on global strategic management, on the involvement of all business areas as well as of the units involved in the design and implementation of our systems. The Group leverages the best technologies available on the market while also acting on the human factor through initiatives to increase awareness and understanding of cyber security, which represents the /fi.ligarst line of corporate defense. In addition, the framework incorporates regulatory requirements for information security, as well as the execution of extensive tests (in IT, OT and IoT environments) to identify and remove identi/fi.ligaed vulnerabilities. In addition, the Group has developed an IT risk management methodology founded on 'risk-based' and 'cyber security by design' approaches, thus integrating the analysis of business risks into all strategic decisions and integrating security requirements over the entire life cycle of solutions and services. Enel has also created its own Cyber Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) in order to proactively respond to any IT security incidents.\n\nFinally, back in 2019, the Group also took out an insurance policy for cyber security risks in order to mitigate those risks with other tools in addition to technical countermeasures.\n\nThe Group is carrying out a complete digital transformation of how it manages the entire energy value chain, developing new business models and digitizing its business processes, integrating systems and adopting new technologies. A consequence of this digital transformation is that the Group is increasingly exposed to risks related to the functioning of the IT systems, which are integrated across the Company with impacts on processes and operations, which could expose IT and OT systems to service interruptions or data losses.\n\nThese risks are managed using a series of internal measures developed by the Group to guide the digital transformation. It has set up an internal control system that introduces control points along the entire IT value chain, enabling us to prevent the emergence of risks engendered by such issues as the creation of services that do not meet business needs, the failure to adopt adequate security measures and service interruptions. The internal control system oversees both the activities pe/r\\_f.ligaormed in-house and those outsourced to external associates and service providers.

Already present in Europe in the Green Deal, in 2022 this was sanctioned by the Global Biodiversity Framework approved at COP 15 in Montreal. In this context, companies in every sector, and above all industry leaders, are ever more aware that environmental risks are economic risks. As a result, they are called upon to increase their commitment and accountability for developing and adopting innovative and sustainable technical solutions and development models.\n\nEnel has made the e/ff.ligaective prevention and minimization of environmental impacts and risks a foundational element of each project across its entire life cycle.\n\nThe adoption of ISO 14001-ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligaed environmental management  systems  across  the  entire  Group  ensures  the implementation of structured policies and procedures to identify and manage the environmental risks and oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities associated with all corporate activities. A structured control plan combined with improvement actions and objectives inspired by the best environmental practices, with requirements  exceeding  those  for  simple  environmental regulatory compliance, mitigate the risk of impacts on the environment, reputational damage and litigation. Also contributing are the multitude of actions to achieve the challenging environmental improvement objectives set by Enel,\n\nsuch  as  those  regarding  atmospheric  emissions,  waste production and water consumption, especially in areas with high water stress and impacts on habitats and species.\n\nThe risk of water scarcity is directly mitigated by Enel's development strategy, which is based on the growth of generation from renewable sources that are essentially not dependent on the availability of water for their operation. Special a/t\\_t.ligaention is also devoted to assets in areas with a high level of water stress, in order to develop technological solutions to reduce consumption. Ongoing collaboration with local river basin management authorities enables us to adopt the most e/ff.ligaective shared strategies for the sustainable management of hydroelectric generation assets.\n\nFinally, e/ff.ligaective action is being taken for ecosystems to protect, restore and conserve biodiversity in species and natural habitats, respecting the mitigation hierarchy (avoid, minimize, restore and o/ff.ligaset) as well as appropriate terrestrial, marine and river monitoring to verify the e/ff.ligaectiveness of the measures adopted.\n\nEnel takes an active pa/r\\_t.liga in the international engagement with in/fl.ligauential stakeholders and networks (e.g., Business for Nature, Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures, World Business Council for Sustainable Development and Science Based Targets for Nature) on issues concerning nature and biodiversity.\n\nProcurement, logistics and supply chain\n\nThe  purchasing  processes  of  Global  Procurement  and the associated governance documents form a structured system of rules and control points that make it possible to combine the achievement of economic business objectives with full compliance with the fundamental principles set out in the Code of Ethics, the Enel Global Compliance Program, the Zero-Tolerance-of-Corruption Plan and the Human Rights Policy, without renouncing the promotion of initiatives for sustainable economic development.\n\nThese principles have been incorporated into the organizational processes and controls that Enel has voluntarily decided to adopt in order to establish relationships of trust with all its stakeholders, as well as de/fi.ligane stable and constructive relationships that are not based exclusively on ensuring /fi.liganancial competitiveness but also take account of best practices in essential areas for the Group, such as the avoidance of child labor, occupational health and safety and environmental responsibility. Thanks to the greater interaction and integration with the outside world and with the di/ff.ligaerent pa/r\\_t.ligas of the corporate organization, the procurement process has assumed an increasingly central role in the creation of value. Global Procurement contributes to a resilient and sustainable supply chain, thinking from a circular economy perspective and fostering innovation, sharing the Group's values and objectives with sup-\n\npliers who thereby become enablers of the achievement of Enel's targets.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, bonus factors have been introduced in tenders in order to engender vi/r\\_t.ligauous behavior on the pa/r\\_t.liga of our suppliers. For example, the environmental impact of any customer is strongly in/fl.ligauenced by the impact of its upstream supply chain, and that is why Global Procurement pushes its suppliers to objectively measure their carbon footprint and improve their pe/r\\_f.ligaormance.\n\nFrom the point of view of the procurement process, the various Procurement Units almost systematically adopt the tender mechanism, thus ensuring maximum competition and equal access oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities for all operators who are in possession of the technical, economic//fi.liganancial and environmental requirements, security, human, legal and ethical rights. Procurement with direct assignment and without a competitive procedure can only take place in exceptional cases, duly motivated, in compliance with current legislation on the ma/t\\_t.ligaer.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, the single global supplier quali/fi.ligacation system for the entire Enel Group, even before the procurement process begins, veri/fi.ligaes that potential suppliers who intend to pa/r\\_t.ligaicipate in procurement procedures are aligned with the Company's strategic vision and expectations in all",

The  e/ff.ligaectiveness  of  supply  chain  risk  management  is monitored  through  speci/fi.ligac  indicators  -  including  the probability of insolvency, the concentration of contracts with individual suppliers or industrial groups, the supplier's dependence on Enel, a pe/r\\_f.ligaormance indicator for the correctness of conduct during the tender, quality, punctuality and sustainability in the execution of the contract, country risk, etc. - for which thresholds have been speci/fi.ligaed to guide the de/fi.liganition of the procurement, negotiation and\n\nPeople and organization\n\nEnel has placed sustainability at the center of its strategy as the hea/r\\_t.liga of its business model in order to contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda. The Group has incorporated sustainability into di/ff.ligaerent geographical, economic and social contexts with the aim of guiding the Just Transition, essential for the future of the planet, accelerating the decarbonization of its energy mix through the growth of renewables and increasing electri/fi.ligacation of consumption. The profound social, economic and cultural transformations we are experiencing, from the energy transition to the  processes  of  digitalization  and  technological  innovation, also have a profound e/ff.ligaect on the world of work, renewing its paradigms and imposing major cultural and organizational  changes,  which  require  new  professional\n\nquali/fi.ligacations and skills.\n\nIn order to deal with change, it is essential to act inclusively, placing the Person at the center in his or her social and work dimension, with adequate tools to cope with this epochal transformation.\n\nOrganizations must increasingly move towards new agile and /fl.ligaexible work and business models that are sustainable along the entire value chain. It is also essential to adopt policies to enhance the diversity and talents of each person, understanding that the contribution of the individual represents an essential element for the creation of widespread and shared value.\n\nRecognition of the value of the person in his or her uniqueness,  constant  listening,  empathy,  sharing,  passion,  involvement, are some of the keywords that guide our way of working and experiencing the Company, in a path that moves from Me to get to We.\n\ntender award strategy, enabling informed choices of risk and potential bene/fi.ligat (savings).\n\nThe actions taken to counter the impact of the COVID-19 emergency have focused in di/ff.ligaerentiating supply sources to avoid interruptions in the supply chain and the remote pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of activities that would ordinarily require physical interaction between Enel and the supplier (e.g., inspections at the company). Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, to counter the consequences of the geopolitical situation in Ukraine, which has increased market volatility and fu/r\\_t.ligaher stressed the supply chain, already strained during the COVID-19 pandemic, Global Procurement constantly monitors activities related to the supply/logistics chain, with the active pa/r\\_t.ligaicipation of our suppliers, through a speci/fi.ligac contractual monitoring obligation, to mitigate the risks of market sho/r\\_t.ligaages, logistical problems and business interruptions.\n\nThe centrality of people and the management of human capital take on a key role in the energy transition, acting as an enabling factor and representing the priorities to which speci/fi.ligac objectives are linked. The primary of these are: the development of digital skills and competences; the promotion of reskilling and upskilling for our people (continuous, personalized, /fl.ligaexible, accessible and transversal) in order to ensure long life employability; the sharing of industry best practices and training aimed also at those who work with our people, both suppliers and contractors; the appropriate widespread involvement of the corporate purpose, which ensures the achievement of results while guaranteeing greater satisfaction for people understood as motivation and well-being; the development of systems for evaluating the working environment and pe/r\\_f.ligaormance; the dissemination of diversity and inclusion policies to all countries in which the Group operates, as well as instilling an inclusive organizational culture based on the principles of non-discrimination and equal oppo/r\\_t.ligaunity, key drivers for a/t\\_t.ligaracting and retaining talent.\n\nThe Group is involved in enhancing the resilience and /fl.ligaexibility of organizational models through the simpli/fi.ligacation and digitalization of processes in order to enable the effectiveness  and  autonomy  of  individuals  and  teams  by strengthening people empowerment processes and fostering an entrepreneurial approach through a 'cou/r\\_t.ligaeous' leadership model that values people's talents, a/t\\_t.ligaitudes and aspirations in a/ffi.ligarming the We. The hybrid working method, which combines in-o/ffi.ligace and remote work in /fl.ligaexible propo/r\\_t.ligaions that take into account everyone's needs, as well as the use of innovative and /fl.ligaexible organizational models, are tools aimed precisely at suppo/r\\_t.ligaing this evolution of organizational culture on the basis of trust and",

Consequently, the Group's new business model requires the management of an increasingly large and growing volume of personal data in order to achieve the /fi.liganancial and business results envisaged in the 2023-2025 Strategic Plan.\n\nThis exposes Enel to the risks connected with the protection of personal data (an issue that must also take account of the substantial growth in privacy legislation in most of\n\nthe countries in which Enel operates). These risks may result in the loss of con/fi.ligadentiality, integrity or availability of the personal information of our customers, employees and others (e.g., suppliers), with the risk of incurring /fi.liganes determined on the basis of global turnover, the prohibition of the use of ce/r\\_t.ligaain processes and consequent /fi.liganancial losses and reputational harm.\n\nIn order to manage and mitigate this risk, Enel has adopted a model for the global governance of personal data, with the appointment of personnel responsible for privacy issues at all levels (including the appointment of Data Protection O/ffi.ligacers at the global and country levels) and digital compliance tools to map applications and processes and manage risks with an impact on protecting personal data, in compliance with speci/fi.ligac local regulations in this /fi.ligaeld.",

As a distribution system operator (DSO), our Group has embraced the challenges of the energy transition to develop the grid of the future: 'sma/r\\_t.liga', modern, /fl.ligaexible and digital. Enel works with renewed focus on achieving the highest levels of service, taking advantage of advanced digitalization of our grid for greater e/ffi.ligaciency in terms of resource costs and superior quality in the customer experience as it concerns electri/fi.ligacation.\n\nThis ongoing cultural evolution is at the core of our ambition to become the world's best grid operator. To suppo/r\\_t.liga this ambitious transformation, we have launched Grid Futurability \u00ae , a global, customer-focused approach that Enel is adopting in order to renew, reinforce and expand our networks over the coming years. Within the scope of the Grid Futurability \u00ae plan and in line with the Group's strategy, Enel has begun working in conce/r\\_t.liga with a range of actors on the value chain with the goal of coordinating our path to zero emissions by actively engaging with our main stakeholders (e.g., industry associations, universities and\n\nresearch centers, other DSOs, vendors, contractors, etc.), so as to create a fully decarbonized grid for the future. Sustainable infrastructures are key to achieving the goals of our 'Zero Ambition' plan. In 2022, Enel overhauled the value chain by applying the concept of 'sustainable by design' and redesigned production processes and asset decommissioning with the goal of reducing the consumption of raw materials, maximizing economic value, and reducing environmental impact.\n\nThe grid also represents a 'mine of materials' that, when suitably regenerated, can be used as inputs in the production of new assets or new products in other production chains. Using an approach known as 'grid mining', the entire value chain of assets is being analyzed in order to recover valuable materials/devices from obsolete grid infrastructures, with the aim of minimizing the environmental impact and the consumption of resources by maximizing the positive social aspects, with a view to creating longterm value.\n\nGoing beyond the more traditional technological investments, Enel takes account of the varied needs of customers in both rural and urban environments to identify priorities and unde/r\\_t.ligaake the renewal, strengthening and expansion of grids in the coming years through circular-economy solutions and processes, but above all to rethink the integration of grids with territories and communities.\n\nEnel has been tasked with promoting access to an electrical service that is sustainable, reliable and safe, while ensuring this service reaches as many customers as possible, including those who are the most vulnerable and at greatest risk. Universal access to energy is one of the primary driving forces in combating pove/r\\_t.ligay and ensuring",

The company is positioned as a reliable pa/r\\_t.liganer that can help drive the digital transformation of power grids throughout the industry as pa/r\\_t.liga of the energy transition.\n\nElectricity sold by Enel in 2022 came to 321.1 TWh, increasing by 11.7 TWh (+3.8%) compared with the previous year. Quantities increased mainly in Italy (+4.4 TWh) and Latin America (+7.2 TWh), mainly in Chile (+3.1 TWh) and Brazil (+2.4 TWh). In addition, gas sold by Enel in 2022 totaled 10.2 billion cubic meters, an increase of 0.3 billion cubic meters compared with the previous year.\n\nEnel's leadership position has been gained thanks to the a/t\\_t.ligaention we place on the customer in providing quality services: aspects that concern more than just the provision of electricity and/or natural gas, extending, above all, to intangible aspects of our service that relate to the perception and satisfaction of our customers.\n\nThrough our products for both the residential and business markets, Enel provides dedicated o/ff.ligaers with a lower environmental impact and a concentration on the most vulnerable segments of the population. In fact, all the countries in which the Group operates provide forms of suppo/r\\_t.liga (often linked to government initiatives) which assist these segments of the population in paying their electricity and gas bills, so as to give everyone equal access to electricity. Enel is commi/t\\_t.ligaed to ensuring high levels of service quality\n\nand maximum customer satisfaction by anticipating market needs, so as to provide reliable answers and establish lasting relationships based on trust, collaboration and dialogue. In recent years, we have introduced new payment methods and enhanced the digital channels, and our customers have been given the means to monitor their consumption and improve energy e/ffi.ligaciency. It is our goal at Enel to make customers aware of the impo/r\\_t.ligaant role they play in the energy transition, which is why we are committed to recognizing the contribution of every individual who chooses to reduce their impact on our planet by adopting good habits of renewable energy use, recycling and reuse, sharing, and reducing waste.\n\nIn 2022, digital customers, i.e., those who have signed up via web or app, accounted for 37% of all Enel customers.\n\nEnel is also continuing its e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.ligas to expand digitalization and the development of new services. Enel X Global Retail continues to lead the development of innovative technologies that make clean electricity increasingly accessible and common in the home, in business and in government, while also accelerating service digitalization in order to increase the e/ffi.ligaciency of energy use.\n\nIn 2022, we launched the Enel X Way Business Line dedicated to electric mobility and, more pointedly, to expanding the infrastructure for electric vehicle charging in order to meet the needs of a rapidly growing marketplace, while also developing advanced charging technologies and /fl.ligaexible solutions aimed at improving the customer experience and suppo/r\\_t.ligaing electri/fi.ligacation in transpo/r\\_t.liga for consumers, businesses and cities.\n\nPublic charging points of Enel in 2022 amount to 22,617, an increase of 4,548 on 2021, mainly in Italy and Spain.",

This increase is due to the growing demand for electricity compared with the previous year, with a greater thermal generation o/ff.ligase/t\\_t.ligaing the reduction in hydroelectric output for the year.\n\nElectricity generated by Enel in 2022 from zero-emission\n\nsources amounted to 61.0% of total production, a slight increase compared with 2021, re/fl.ligaecting the increase in the contribution from solar and wind sources.\n\nThe reduction of the environmental impacts associated with the operation of our plants is a strategic objective for us, pursued through the application of the best available technologies and best international practices.\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, as regards the emissions of atmospheric pollutants  in  connection  with  thermal  generation,  in  2022 there was a slight decrease in NO x emissions, both in absolute and speci/fi.ligac terms, re/fl.ligaecting lower overall generation from gas and CCGT plants. Emissions of SO 2 and dust are in line with 2021. The speci/fi.ligac emissions of SO 2 amounted to 0.07 g/kWh eq (unchanged from 2021), those of NO x came to 0.32 g/kWh eq (-9% compared to 2021, when they came to 0.35 g/kWh eq ) and those of dust came to 0.005 g/ kWh eq , unchanged from 2021.\n\nProtection and development of natural capital\n\nThe protection of natural capital and combating climate change are strategic factors that are integrated into planning and in business management and development, so as to promote the sustainable economic development of the communities in which we operate, and are determinant factors in consolidating the Company's leadership in energy markets.\n\nAs an energy company, our operations depend on natural resources but, at the same time, have an impact on such resources.

The water needed in electricity generation is obtained from 'non-scarce' (i.e., seawater) and scarce (i.e., su/r\\_f.ligaace and underground freshwater and civil-use water) sources. Beginning in 2022, Enel renewed and revitalize its commitment to preserving water resources, adopting a new more challenging target for the reduction of speci/fi.ligac withdrawals of freshwater. In 2022, speci/fi.ligac freshwater withdrawals totaled 0.23 l/kWh eq , a slight decrease from 2021 (0.25 l/kWh eq ).\n\nEnel's commitment to biodiversity\n\nEnel has extensive experience in managing and preserving biodiversity in and around our production sites in an ever-increasing number of countries. In 2019, Enel adopted Group guidelines that establish the principles and procedures for managing our impact on biodiversity throughout the entire life cycle of our plants, from development and operations to decommissioning.\n\nThe identi/fi.ligacation of potential impacts on biodiversity and nature is essential in order to determine the most e/ff.ligaective strategies for avoiding, minimizing, correcting, or o/ff.ligasetting associated e/ff.ligaects, in line with the mitigation hierarchy. In the same way, identifying all that depends on biodiversity and natural capital enables us to identify the best strategies to reduce any consequent risks for the Company. In 2022, we pursued 200 projects to safeguard species\n\nEnel constantly monitors all generation sites located in areas at risk of water scarcity (water-stressed areas) in order to ensure the most e/ffi.ligacient management of the resource. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, for production sites that have been identi/fi.ligaed as 'critical' (39) , i.e., in a water-stressed area where freshwater is withdrawn for process needs, water management methods are analyzed in order to minimize consumption and maximize withdrawals from non-scarce sources (i.e., seawater and industrial or waste water).\n\nAbout 13.3% of the Enel Group's total electricity output uses fresh water in water-stressed areas.\n\nand natural habitats in and around operational plants, 80 of which were developed in pa/r\\_t.liganership with government, non-governmental  organizations,  and  universities,  for  a total investment of \u20ac11.9 million. These projects were carried out throughout the world. Examples of measures to mitigate our impact on biodiversity, in application of related policies, may be found in the Sustainability section of Enel.com at the following address: h/t\\_t.ligaps://www.enel.com/ investors/sustainability/strategy-sustainable-progress/biodiversity.\n\nAlso in 2022, we carried out a fu/r\\_t.ligaher 63 projects related to plants under construction, mainly in Brazil, Chile, Spain and No/r\\_t.ligah America, aimed at protecting and monitoring the indigenous species a/ff.ligaected, for a total investment of over \u20ac6.4 million.",

        "page_content": "## Statement on the alignment of Enel's business with the European taxonomy\n\nFinancial metrics calculation process\n\nAs  described  in  the  section  'European  Union  taxonomy', Enel pe/r\\_f.ligaormed a speci/fi.ligac implementation process to classify all its economic activities along its value chain in accordance with the following three categories: eligible-aligned, eligible-not aligned and not eligible.\n\nThe calculation of the /fi.liganancial metrics associated with each economic activity was pe/r\\_f.ligaormed using a speci/fi.ligac process during which the following criteria were implemented and the following considerations were made.\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nThe three /fi.liganancial metrics required under the European taxonomy regulation: turnover (revenue), capital expenditure (capex) and operating expenditure (opex or ordinary operating expenses) were calculated in accordance with the eligibility analysis described in the section 'European Union taxonomy'.\n\nAlthough not expressly requested, Enel also pe/r\\_f.ligaormed an assessment for ordinary gross operating pro/fi.ligat, believing that this metric best represents the actual /fi.liganancial pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of integrated utilities such as Enel.\n\nThe  /fi.liganancial  information  was  collected  from  the  accounting system used by the Enel Group or from the management systems used by the corporate business lines.  However,  some  exceptions  were  also  made  to provide a more detailed representation of the /fi.ligagures or to exclude ce/r\\_t.ligaain speci/fi.ligac activities from the overall eligibility-alignment calculation (such as not-aligned hydroelectric  generation  or  infrastructure  considered eligible-not aligned among eligible-aligned distribution systems). For example, the following proxies were used:\n\n- hydroelectric: eligible-not aligned hydroelectric plants were excluded considering their output multiplied by average unit revenue for 2021 and 2022. This approach was also extended to capital expenditure, ordinary operating expenses and ordinary gross operating pro/fi.ligat;\n\n- distribution: new connections between a substation or network and a generation plant whose greenhouse gas intensity exceeds the threshold of 100 gCO 2eq / kWh  have  been  excluded  considering  their  power (in MW) multiplied by average revenue (thousands of euro/MW) for 2021 and 2022. This approach was only applied to revenue and capital expenditure.\n\nThe aggregate /fi.liganancial data in the repo/r\\_t.ligaing refer to 'segment'  values  and  include  items  concerning  third pa/r\\_t.ligaies and inter-segment transactions.\n\nThe  /fi.liganancial  metrics  have  been  repo/r\\_t.ligaed  treating  all sales of electricity and gas as not eligible.\n\n2021 /fi.ligagures have been restated to take account of the following methodological changes:\n\n- electricity generation from gaseous fossil fuels: considered  eligible-not  aligned  following  application  of the criteria established in the Complementary Delegated Act (previously repo/r\\_t.ligaed as not eligible);\n\n- electricity  transmission  and  distribution:  the  eligibility of the distribution activity in Colombia was rede/fi.liganed to take account of updated information from the national electrical system related to new renewables capacity built over the last /fi.ligave years, which changed the status from eligible-aligned to eligible-not aligned. In addition, minor adjustments were made to criteria to identify the infrastructure dedicated to creating a direct connection or expanding an existing direct connection between a substation or a grid and a power generation plant with an intensity of greenhouse gases in excess of 100 gCO eq /kWh measured based over the life cycle;\n\n- retail sale of electricity: considered to not be eligible (previously declared to be eligible) in that the activity is not explicitly mentioned in the Climate Delegated Act; - Enel X Global Retail: combined heat and power (CHP) from gaseous fossil fuels within the scope of distributed energy is now considered eligible-not aligned following application of the criteria established in the Complementary Delegated Act (previously considered not eligible);\n\n- capital  expenditure:  taking  account  of  recognized costs based on 'IFRS 16 - Leasing', paragraph 53(h), as required by the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2012/2178.\n\nTotal revenue, capital expenditure, ordinary gross operating pro/fi.ligat, and operating expenses in absolute terms correspond to the revenue, investments, ordinary gross operating pro/fi.ligat, and operating expenses of each speci/fi.ligac activity. The levels of the individual KPIs correspond to each individual economic activity out of the total revenue/capital expenditure/ordinary gross operating pro/fi.ligat of the Group (with the exception of ordinary operating expenses, the total of which refers solely to the type of costs required by the taxonomy). The share of revenue/capital expenditure/ordinary gross operating pro/fi.ligat/ordinary operating expenses of each individual economic activity contributes to the climate change mitigation goal. This is the only EU taxonomy objective repo/r\\_t.ligaed in the table, as the alignment analysis was pe/r\\_f.ligaormed only for this objective as it is more relevant than the climate change adaptation objective and the criteria for the other environmental objectives are not yet available. During the 2022 Capital Markets Day, Enel announced 80% alignment of capex for the period 2023-2025 for the Group's contribution to climate change mitigation.\n\n\u00b7",

Nonetheless, the retail sale of electricity is a fundamental segment of the energy value chain. Excluding this activity from the de/fi.liganition of a sustainable energy system is an obstacle to the key role played by the liberalization of the EU market and, ultimately, to the e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.ligas and value of decarbonized end-user consumption.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, electri/fi.ligacation, promoted by way of renewable energy, is the most e/ffi.ligacient and cost-e/ff.ligaective solution to dealing with climate change in that it is clean, accessible and high yield, in addition to being the only way to achieve a truly clean energy system. However, sustainable electri/fi.ligacation of the end uses of energy calls not only for clean technologies of energy production, but also for the companies conducting the retail sale of energy to o/ff.ligaer renewable energy to the end user in order to meet their energy needs.\n\nFor  these  reasons,  Enel  believes  that  the  EU  taxonomy should explicitly consider the retail sale of electricity to be an eligible activity for which alignment should be based on the same criteria available for the activity of electricity generation. In this way, the sale of electricity to end users would be connected to the source of production, thereby incentivizing resellers to sell electricity from sustainable sources.\n\nWithin this context, the role of integrated utilities is even more relevant. Although they operate in the production and retail sale of electricity with di/ff.ligaerent companies within the same group, these utilities manage the activity model with a more global, uni/fi.ligaed view of the entire energy value chain. Provided below is a presentation of overall /fi.ligagures as if the retail  sale  of  electricity  were  taxonomy-eligible  and  determining alignment by applying the same criteria as for electricity generation. We have based these /fi.ligagures on the mechanisms of the guarantees of origin available in Italy and Spain, in that they provide consumers with transparency concerning the percentage of electricity sold by resellers whose production sources are actually renewable, thereby meeting existing criteria of the EU taxonomy related to the activity of electricity generation.\n\nAs a result, revenue from the sale of electricity has been measured based on the quantity of retail sales of energy by the companies of the Group in Italy and Spain using the guarantees of origin (based on /fi.ligagures provided by the national authorities) and applying average per-unit revenue. This approach has also been taken for capex, opex and ordinary gross operating pro/fi.ligat (EBITDA). To avoid double counting, eligible revenue by segment is shown net of intersegment transactions (between Enel Green Power, Enel Grids, and Retail).\n\n| Results of retail electricity sales            | Units            | 2022    | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------------|---------|--------|\n| Ordinary gross operating pro/fi.ligat (EBITDA) |                  |         |        |\n| - Eligible-aligned                             | %                | 57.6    | 67. 0  |\n| - Eligible-not aligned                         | %                | 19.2    | 18.5   |\n| - Not eligible                                 | %                | 23.2    | 14.5   |\n| Total                                          | millions of euro | 19,683  | 19,210 |\n| Turnover (Revenue)                             |                  |         |        |\n| - Eligible-aligned                             | %                | 30.2    | 40.4   |\n| - Eligible-not aligned                         | %                | 34.2    | 35.5   |\n| - Not eligible                                 | %                | 35.6    | 24.1   |\n| Total                                          | millions of euro | 143,009 | 88,006 |\n| Capex (Capital expenditure)                    |                  |         |        |\n| - Eligible-aligned                             | %                | 83.0    | 82.7   |\n| - Eligible-not aligned                         | %                | 9.2     | 9.6    |\n| - Not eligible                                 | %                | 7. 8    | 7. 7   |\n| Total                                          | millions of euro | 15,088  | 13,831 |\n| Operating expenses (Opex)                      |                  |         |        |\n| - Eligible-aligned                             | %                | 66.9    | 61.1   |\n| - Eligible-not aligned                         | %                | 14.2    | 15.7   |\n| - Not eligible                                 | %                | 18.9    | 23.2   |\n| Total                                          | millions of euro | 1,050   | 1,029  |",

        "page_content": "## Sustainable /fi.liganance\n\nAt Enel, sustainable /fi.liganance is a key lever in creating value. The new sustainability-linked bond issues, together with all the sustainable /fi.liganancing arranged in 2022, have enabled us, by year end, to achieve a ratio of sustainable /fi.liganance to total gross debt for the Group of 63%.\n\nSustainable /fi.liganance includes public and private funds directed towards sustainable investments, thereby working to reach sustainable development goals.\n\nIn 2020, Enel was the world's /fi.ligarst company to include a mechanism in its funding agreements that links the cost of /fi.liganancing to achieving one or more of the sustainability targets speci/fi.ligaed in the Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework, a document that extends the sustainability-linked approach to all instruments of /fi.liganancial debt. It establishes a set of indicators, targets and principles that govern the development of sustainable /fi.liganance throughout the Group, linking our /fi.liganancial strategy to our sustainability objectives. The Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework is updated annually in line with the objectives de/fi.liganed in the Group's Strategic Plan.\n\nThe latest framework moves up the target for reducing 'Scope 1 GHG emissions Intensity relating to Power Generation (gCO 2eq /kWh)' by 100% from 2050 to 2040. . (40)\n\nIt should also be noted that, within the scope of actions aimed at reaching SDG 7 and SDG 13 and the EU Environmental Objective of Climate Change Mitigation, three new indicators were added in February 2023 (i.e., 'Scopes 1 and 3 GHG emissions Intensity relating to Integrated Power (gCO 2eq /kWh)', 'Absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions relating to Gas Retail (MtCO 2eq )', and 'Propo/r\\_t.ligaion of CAPEX aligned to the EU Taxonomy (%)').\n\nTherefore,  the  Group's  /fi.liganancial  instruments  and  transactions can have an interest rate or other structural or /fi.liganancing terms that are linked to achieving goals related to reducing direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions (SDG 13 'Climate Action'), to increases in renewables capacity (SDG 7 'A/ff.ligaordable and Clean Energy'), or to the percentage of capital expenditure within a given period in activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable in accordance with the criteria de/fi.liganed under A/r\\_t.ligaicle 3 of the EU taxonomy regulation (2020/852).\n\nShown below are the KPIs and targets included in the latest update of Enel's Sustainability-Linked Financing Framework, published in February 2023.\n\n|                                                                                     | Actual values   | Target   | Target   | Target   | Target   | Target   | Target   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n|                                                                                     | 2022            | 2022     | 2023     | 2024     | 2025     | 2030     | 2040     |\n| Scope 1 GHG emissions Intensity relating   to Power Generation (gCO 2eq /kWh)       | 229             |          | 148      | 140      | 130      | 72       | 0        |\n| Scope 1 and 3 GHG emissions Intensity relating   to Integrated Power (gCO 2eq /kWh) | 218             |          |          |          | 135      | 73       | 0        |\n| Absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions relating   to Gas Retail (MtCO 2eq )                 | 22.9            |          |          |          | 20.9     | 11.4     | 0        |\n| Renewable Installed Capacity Percentage (%) (41)                                    | 63.1%           | 60%      | 65%      | 66%      | 76%      | 85%      | 100%     |\n| Propo/r\\_t.ligaion of CAPEX aligned to the EU Taxonomy (%)                           | 81.9%           |          |          | >80%     |          |          |          |\n\nThese indicators are periodically veri/fi.ligaed by an external body, and Enel publishes the /fi.ligagures in the annual /fi.liganancial and sustainability repo/r\\_t.ligas.\n\nIn  2022,  installed  renewables  capacity  accounted  for 63.1% of the total, thereby surpassing the target for a minimum threshold of 60%. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, this includes the achievement of the targets contained in the /fi.ligarst sustainability-linked bonds issued by Enel Finance International in 2020 on the GBP market.\n\nIn  2022,  the  Group  continued  pursuing  a  development\n\nstrategy oriented towards sustainable /fi.liganance with structured transactions amounting to the equivalent of more than \u20ac23 billion.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, the Group, through its /fi.liganancial subsidiaries Enel Finance International and, for the /fi.ligarst time, Enel Finance America, issued sustainability-linked bonds in a variety of markets and currencies in the amount of about \u20ac12.1 billion. (42)\n\nIn May 2022, Enel and Enel Finance International increased the amount of the current Sustainability-Linked Revolving Credit Facility, the world's largest sustainable credit facility linked to SDG 13, from \u20ac10 billion to \u20ac13.5 billion.",

For the /fi.ligarst time in the world, this new issue united an indicator connected with the EU taxonomy with another connected with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), while also including targets for full decarbonization.\n\nIn the area of public /fi.liganance, the Group suppo/r\\_t.ligas the economic recovery plan and intends to become a strategic pa/r\\_t.liganer in the implementation of the Green Deal and the Recovery Plan at both the European and national levels. The goal is to drive a sustainable, rapid and e/ff.ligaective recovery through a broad pipeline of shovel-ready projects focused on  decarbonization,  electricity  grids  and  electri/fi.ligacation, aimed at accelerating the green and digital transition of the European economy with a signi/fi.ligacant impact in terms of GDP, employment and reduction of CO 2 emissions, in full alignment with the European taxonomy.\n\nTo this end, the Group has identi/fi.ligaed potential initiatives for about \u20ac4.3 billion in investment over the period 2023-2030, with relative impact by way of both the Ownership and the Stewardship models. These initiatives focus on green hydrogen, renewables and storage, revitalization of the photovoltaic manufacturing industry, sma/r\\_t.liga grids, grid resilience and charging infrastructure for electric mobility. The Group has also promoted pa/r\\_t.liganerships with public and private entities, both with a view to the decarbonization and electri/fi.ligacation of energy consumption through the expansion of electric bus /fl.ligaeets, the transition to green po/r\\_t.ligas and the promotion of energy e/ffi.ligaciency in public buildings.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, in the context of subsidized loans from international and national /fi.liganancial institutions, the Group is leading an innovation process aimed at accelerating the mobilization of capital to suppo/r\\_t.liga sustainable growth through the use of sustainability-linked /fi.liganancial instruments.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, in 2022, the Group received subsidized loans totaling \u20ac1.8 billion that, following the path taken in our private-sector /fi.liganancing, include sustainability-linked mechanisms connected with SDG 13. Some of the main transactions include the /fi.ligarst sustainability-linked /fi.liganancing agreement between Denmark's Expo/r\\_t.liga Credit Agency EKF and Enel Finance America for a total of $800 million.\n\nIn the coming years, Enel will continue to make use of sustainable /fi.liganance tools, with the aim of achieving a ratio between sustainable borrowing and the Group's total debt of about 70% by 2025.\n\nPa/r\\_t.ligaicipation in international round tables\n\nto promote sustainable /fi.liganance\n\nEnel continues to focus on sustainable /fi.liganance, and we have  strengthened  our  commitment  towards  our  key stakeholders around the world by co-chairing the CFO Coalition for the SDGs of the UN Global Compact and by pa/r\\_t.ligaicipating in the UN's Global Investors for Sustainable Development (GISD) Alliance.\n\nAfter launching the Principles on Integrated SDG Investments and Finance, the CFO Coalition turned its focus to an analysis of the targets set by companies for the SDGs and related indicators, company case studies for the implementation of the SDG Investments and Finance strategy, and the development of pro/fi.ligales by sector. Within this context, the CFOs invested more than $110 billion to suppo/r\\_t.liga the SDGs, thereby increasing SDG /fi.liganance by 55% over the previous year. In addition, an advisory board has been established. Enel is a member of this board, which will work to provide industry and regional capabilities, to help coordinate cooperation between the CFOs and the broader sustainable-/fi.liganance community on speci/fi.ligac issues, and to provide recommendations and contacts for recruiting new coalition members.\n\nAlso of note are the results achieved by the collaboration with the GISD Alliance, such as the update to the Model Mandate, which serves as a guide for asset owners to ensure that management and sustainability goals are fully re/fl.ligaected in the agreement with the managers of those assets. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, given that Enel is a member of the GISD Alliance, we have contributed to the joint statement of the Alliance in response to the public consultation launched by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) with regard to sustainability repo/r\\_t.ligaing.\n\nAlso notable is the work that has been done in Europe by way of our stakeholder CSR Europe. In this regard, in conjunction with the European SDG Summit 2022, Enel pa/r\\_t.ligaicipated in the following round tables: 'The Role of Double Materiality in Sustainability Repo/r\\_t.ligaing' on how double materiality is integrated into the CSRD and in what way companies can implement it; and 'The Challenge of Circularity in the Green Transition' on the circular economy and the energy transition.",

More speci/fi.ligacally, the increase primarily concerned Italy (\u20ac415 million), Canada (\u20ac189 million), Peru (\u20ac159 million), Spain (\u20ac120 million), Chile (\u20ac63 million), Australia (\u20ac40 million), Colombia (\u20ac13 million), and Brazil (\u20ac24 million, due in pa/r\\_t.liga to currency e/ff.ligaects). These increases were only pa/r\\_t.ligaially o/ff.ligaset by decreased capital expenditure in India (\u20ac102 million), South Africa (\u20ac71 million), Mexico (\u20ac21 million), Panama (\u20ac12 million), and Guatemala (\u20ac7 million).\n\nIn response to increasingly volatile weather events and so as to invest in grid resilience, investment in electricity distribution also increased.\n\nThe greatest investments in distribution came in Italy (\u20ac160 million), Brazil (\u20ac157 million) - mainly for grid maintenance and reliability improvements - and Peru (\u20ac16 million). These factors were only pa/r\\_t.ligaly o/ff.ligaset by a decrease in capital expenditure in Spain, Chile and Colombia.\n\nCapital  expenditure  increased  in  the  End-user  Markets Business Line, pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly in Italy (\u20ac33 million) and Spain (\u20ac52 million), a/t\\_t.ligaributable essentially to the digitalization of customer-management processes.\n\nThe increase in capital expenditure by Enel X came mainly in Italy (\u20ac27 million) in the e-City and e-Home businesses, in No/r\\_t.ligah America (\u20ac25 million) and Australia (\u20ac9 million) due to increased investment in ba/t\\_t.ligaery energy storage for the execution of new projects, in Brazil (\u20ac11 million) as the combined e/ff.ligaect of increased expenditure for the Sma/r\\_t.liga Lighting, e-Home and Distributed Energy businesses (with new photovoltaic projects launched), in Peru (\u20ac12 million) in the Public Lighting business, in Colombia (\u20ac7 million) following the launch of new projects in the Distributed Energy business (photovoltaics), and in Spain (\u20ac5 million) in the e-Home business.\n\nThe growth of capital expenditure in Thermal Generation and  Trading  (\u20ac168  million),  especially  in  Italy  and  Latin America, is a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the conversion of a number of plants from coal to gas in order to lower CO 2 emissions.",

The Open Innovation model makes it possible to connect all areas of the Company with sta/r\\_t.ligaups, industrial pa/r\\_t.liganers, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), research centers, universities and entrepreneurs - drawing in pa/r\\_t.liga on crowdsourcing platforms -to face the challenges of the business, taking into account the drivers of the Group's Strategic Plan.\n\nThe Company has numerous innovation pa/r\\_t.liganership agreements that, in addition to the traditional /fi.ligaelds of action linked to renewable energy and conventional generation, have promoted the development of new solutions for e-mobility, microgrids, energy e/ffi.ligaciency and the industrial Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nEnel's innovation strategy leverages the online crowdsourcing platform openinnovability.com and a global network of 10 Innovation Hubs (3 of which are also Labs) and 22 Labs (3 of which are dedicated to sta/r\\_t.ligaups), which consolidates the new model of collaboration with sta/r\\_t.ligaups and SMEs. The la/t\\_t.ligaer o/ff.ligaer innovative solutions and new business models and Enel makes its expe/r\\_t.ligaise, testing facilities and a global network of pa/r\\_t.liganers available to suppo/r\\_t.liga its development and possible scale-up. The Hubs are located in the most relevant innovation ecosystems for the Group (Catania, Pisa, Milan, Silicon Valley, Boston, Rio de Janeiro, Madrid, Barcelona, Santiago de Chile, Tel Aviv). They manage relationships with all the players involved in innovation activities and constitute the main source of scouting for innovative sta/r\\_t.ligaups and SMEs, responding to the innovation needs manifested by business lines. In September 2022 Enel inaugurated the new AI & Robotics Lab in Tel Aviv, specializing in the development of a/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacial intelligence and robotics for renewable energy and electricity grids.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, in 2022, Enel was one of the /fi.ligarst companies in the world to voluntarily adopt the ISO 56002 standard for innovation management. The ISO 56002 standard is pa/r\\_t.liga of the broader ISO 56000 series of standards and covers all aspects of innovation management: from the bi/r\\_t.ligah of an idea to its implementation on a global scale. It enables you to enhance the e/ff.ligaectiveness of innovation and business oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities, creating the conditions for a widespread culture of innovation that stimulates the creativity of employees and stakeholders and fosters the emergence of new value propositions in line with market developments.\n\nIn 2021, the integration of Open Innovation Culture and Agile Transformation was launched at the Group level with the aim of providing the business with comprehensive suppo/r\\_t.liga, from the generation of the idea to the project implementation phase, using Innovation and Agile methodologies as key drivers to create competitive advantage and generate cost optimization over time.\n\n2022 saw the continuation of the activities of the innovation communities, multidisciplinary working groups created to innovatively address the most relevant issues for the business and new technologies in order to create value for the Group. To the existing communities of energy storage, blockchain, drones, energy accumulation, metaverse, robotics, sensors and quantum computing, other innovation communities have been added, including wearables, additive manufacturing, data monetization, a/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacial intelligence and machine learning, materials and hydrogen. The communities continuously monitor potential technological improvements or share useful new business models, value-added services or use cases for types of technology that could be implemented in di/ff.ligaerent areas of the Enel Group.\n\nAs pa/r\\_t.liga of innovation activities, 194 Proofs of Concept were launched in 2022 (168 in 2021) to test innovative solutions, while 60 innovative solutions (46 in 2021) are in the scale-up phase and \u20ac104.5 million have been invested (including personnel costs) in innovation.",

On average, the CERT monitoring registers 3 billion events relating to corporate assets from around 7,000 data sources every day, correlating them through automatic analysis, and producing an average of 300 'incidents' per day. This data is collected globally on a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities before they can disrupt business operations and classify anomalous behavior on the network, in order to monitor and optimize management of security incidents.\n\nThe incidents are classi/fi.ligaed on the basis of a speci/fi.ligac impact matrix (Enel Cyber Impact Matrix), on a scale from 0 to 4. The majority of accidents, having no signi/fi.ligacant impact on the Group's systems, are classi/fi.ligaed at level 0/1 and are automatically or semi-automatically blocked or managed\n\nto understand the resilience of central protection techniques compared with distributed approaches;\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nvi/r\\_t.ligaual authentication solutions based on machine learning and a/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacial intelligence for distributed devices with low computational capabilities;\n\nservices  for  identifying  vulnerabilities  in  assets  and third-pa/r\\_t.ligay services used by the organization that could undermine the security of the organization itself (external a/t\\_t.ligaack su/r\\_f.ligaace);\n\nsolutions that exploit the greater potential of a/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacial intelligence and machine learning to enhance capabilities in detecting IT threats and automating the process of analysis, correlation and response to incidents;\n\nsolutions for identifying vulnerabilities of assets and devices (mobile devices, IoT, web applications, etc.) with the help of innovative techniques;\n\nreview  of  industrial  environments  through  the  implementation of a vulnerability identi/fi.ligacation process with scripts without impacting the operating environments.\n\nby existing corporate defenses. Incidents classi/fi.ligaed as level 2, 3 or 4, which by contrast could have a potential impact on the Group, are managed directly by CERT analysts involving the interested stakeholders.\n\nIncident management by its very nature must evolve over time to face a complex and constantly changing cyber landscape. In fact, since the establishment of the CERT, the number of events to be managed has increased, as has the perimeter to be protected, driving the introduction of new technologies and the integration of increasingly specialized skills. An evolution in this direction is represented by the integration of SOAR and machine learning. The former, the acronym for Security Orchestration, Automation and Response, is a software product that enables the automation of repetitive tasks through the de/fi.liganition of automatic operational /fl.ligaows. The la/t\\_t.ligaer is a branch of a/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacial intelligence that deals with creating systems that learn or improve pe/r\\_f.ligaormance based on the data they use. These technologies allow for the acceleration, enrichment and uniform  tracking  of  the  activities  necessary  during  the analysis and management phases of an incident, providing great suppo/r\\_t.liga to analysts, who are thus able to parallelize",

Decarbonization and electri/fi.ligacation are not separate from circularity, but rather are pa/r\\_t.liga of a single paradigm aimed at developing a new economic model to reduce dependence on raw materials as much as possible, ensuring full envi-\n\nthe enhancement of the internal team with new cyber security professionals.\n\nronmental and social sustainability and the competitiveness of the business model.\n\nThe  Group's  vision  is  based  on  /fi.ligave  pillars,  which  act through three main levers: design (sta/r\\_t.ligaing from the choice of input materials, planning focusing on extending useful life, maximizing the utilization factor of the asset and the value recoverable at the end of its life), the methods of use of the asset (i.e., the extension of the useful life, sharing, product as a service) and closing the loop of the cycles (i.e., reuse, remanufacturing, recycling and reuse of recovered materials as new circular input).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nProduct as\n\na service\n\nBusiness model where the customer purchases a service for a limited time, while the company retains ownership of the product, maximising its use factor and useful life.\n\nThe  circular  model  has  therefore  been  implemented  in all Group activities, with the aim of redesigning the value chain  in  order  to  reduce  the  consumption  of  resources and the related social and environmental impacts and make the business model more competitive by reducing\n\ngeopolitical and price risks linked to the procurement of raw materials, especially critical commodities. In this regard, Enel's initiatives include promotion of the use of renewable resources or resources deriving from previous life cycles (for example, the use of recycled plastic for sma/r\\_t.liga",

For this reason, Enel has implemented the Circular Procurement Strategy, which aims to improve the circularity of the products and services purchased and is also developing tools and new approaches to improve the tracking of materials and their impacts along the value chain, in order to incentivize suppliers to make the use of resources more e/ffi.ligacient by recycling and recovering them at the end of their life.\n\nSince the initial stages of adopting the circular approach, Enel has leveraged the measurement of the environmental and economic bene/fi.ligats of circularity, understanding that a model must be measurable in order to be not only sustainable but also economically competitive. As pa/r\\_t.liga of the 2023 World Economic Forum in Davos, Enel launched a new KPI for measuring circularity, Economic CirculAbility \u00a9 , which considers the Group's overall EBITDA and compares it with the quantity of resources consumed, including both fuel and commodities, along the entire value chain from the various business activities. At the same time, the Group has unde/r\\_t.ligaaken to double this indicator by 2030 compared with 2020, which means halving the amount of resources consumed compared with the EBITDA generated. Enel thus becomes the /fi.ligarst company in the world to adopt a circularity indicator of this type, and to set itself such an ambitious goal.",

Within this landscape, ongoing employee training, along with strategies of upskilling, aimed at developing training and empowerment programs to improve pe/r\\_f.ligaormance within a given role, and reskilling, aimed at learning new skills and capabilities that enable people to /fi.ligall new positions, are of increasing impo/r\\_t.ligaance.\n\nIn 2022, in suppo/r\\_t.liga of these strategies, we provided a total of about 3.1 million hours of training, up from the previous year (about 2.9 million hours in 2021), an average of more than 47 hours per employee (more than 44 hours per employee in 2021). This was made possible by the upgrading of digital tools and the E-Ducation platform, which ensured broad access to content and expanded the culture of digitalization for learning, including remotely. In Italy, we\n\nsigned a remote-work agreement that allows employees in roles that can be pe/r\\_f.ligaormed remotely to work remotely for up to 60% of their total work days, with the option to increase that percentage in ce/r\\_t.ligaain cases. This capacity for /fl.ligaexibility and resilience has drawn on the /fl.ligaexible working experience gained in Italy since as early as 2016 and then gradually extended throughout the Group and on the digital and technological transformation, which made Enel the world's /fi.ligarst major utility company to fully embrace the cloud model.\n\nIn addition to training and awareness initiatives to accompany the adoption of fully digital modes of work, we have continued training programs related to conduct, technical issues, safety, reskilling, and the digital culture.\n\nIn line with the Group's commitment, the training budget has been increased compared with the previous year, with total training costs incurred in 2022 coming to about \u20ac30 million (about \u20ac20 million in 2021).",

This year, 667 employees world-\n\nwide were involved in mentoring initiatives (325 mentees and 342 mentors).\n\nFinally, with regard to acknowledging the value of people, we made the transition in 2022 from a system based on assessments for entering management positions to the development of a program of empowerment that helps people to be more aware of their speci/fi.ligac talents, a/t\\_t.ligaitudes, preferences and aspirations, while suppo/r\\_t.ligaing them in more complex roles within the organization.\n\nWithin this context, new selection criteria have been introduced into the annual plan of management succession aimed  at  greater  inclusiveness  and  at  valuing  diversity. More speci/fi.ligacally, we have removed the age limit for eligibility in the succession plan and introduced a parameter than ensures at least 50% of all successors are women, while also incentivizing the inclusion of o/ffi.ligace sta/ff.liga among the appointments.\n\nOpen Listening and organizational wellness\n\nAt the end of 2022, we issued a new Open Listening survey concerning  the  organization's  global  corporate  climate. The 2022 survey was completed by 75.6% of all Group employees, and the overall job-satisfaction rate was 89.6%. The goal of the survey is to measure employee wellness and job satisfaction through active listening in a number of areas of impo/r\\_t.ligaance to the organization (including worklife balance, networking, training, diversity and inclusion).\n\nIn addition, in 2021, Enel worked with employees to create a global wellbeing model founded on eight pillars with an impact on overall satisfaction, namely: emotional, physical, social, ethical, /fi.liganancial and cultural wellbeing, work-life\n\nharmony, and sense of protection. To measure wellness and understand what is of greatest impo/r\\_t.ligaance to people, a global wellbeing survey has been conducted. The results of the 2021 survey, which was repeated in October 2022 with the added dimension of motivation, led to the preparation and launch of the 2022 Global Wellness Program involving a diverse, multicultural team. The program is intended for all Enel employees and features an experience that is both physical and digital. As for results, the surveys measured an overall sense of wellness, worldwide, of 60%, meaning that 60% of all those surveyed repo/r\\_t.ligaed feeling average to high levels of satisfaction with their own wellness.",

        "page_content": "Including diversity at Enel\n\nAt Enel, inclusion, wellness, engagement and value creation are fundamental aspects of our approach with our people. Our approach to diversity and inclusion is based on the principles of non-discrimination, equal oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities, personal dignity, inclusion regardless of any form of diversity, and work-life balance. This approach is embodied in an organic set of actions that promote an a/t\\_t.ligaention to and expression of individuality, a culture of inclusiveness without prejudice, and a coherent mix of talents, qualities and experience, all of which creates value for our people and for our business.\n\nThe approach has been rati/fi.ligaed in our Cha/r\\_t.ligaer for the Individual, a protocol of intent that Enel signed on March 29, 2022, underscoring the impo/r\\_t.ligaance of personal wellbeing and integrity to a healthy, safe, motivating and engaging ecosystem able to express its full potential.\n\nThis is an innovative protocol, a new model designed in this unprecedented era of unce/r\\_t.ligaainty due to the COVID pandemic, which has transformed working relationships and has presented us with an extraordinary oppo/r\\_t.ligaunity for change, capping o/ff.liga a cultural transformation at Enel that had already begun some time before. In processes of digital, cultural and energy transition, people are the key to our success - our true competitive advantage. Managing these times of rapid change calls for inclusiveness, especially in the workplace. It is out of this awareness that our Cha/r\\_t.ligaer of the Person aims to value the individual as a key player in an ecosystem in which the Company and the trade unions work together to create a healthy, safe, motivating and engaging workplace - a workplace in which wellness, productivity, continuous learning, and safety can work in conce/r\\_t.liga towards the complete ful/fi.ligallment of the individual, with an ever greater role for, and hence accountability of, the person.\n\nThe milestones that have brought us to today began back in 2013 with publication of our policy on Human Rights. This was followed, in 2015, by Enel's adoption of the seven Women's Empowerment Principles (WEPs) promoted by the UN Global Compact and UN Women and the parallel publication of the policy on Diversity and Inclusion, which de/fi.liganes the principles of non-discrimination, equal oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities, dignity, work-life balance, and inclusiveness regardless of any form of diversity. In 2019, our Workplace Harassment Policy introduced the issues of individual respect, integrity and dignity in the workplace into the prevention of all types of harassment, and these principles were  disseminated  in  2020  when  we  published  online Enel's Statement Against Harassment in the workplace. (43) In 2021, we issued our global policy on Digital Accessibility\n\nto ensure equal oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities in access to digital systems and information.\n\nIn recent years, intensive awareness e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.ligas have led to the dissemination and strengthening of a culture of inclusion at all levels and in all se/t\\_t.ligaings within the organization by way of communication campaigns and local and global events focused on a range of issues. Of note among the most impo/r\\_t.ligaant initiatives in 2022 are the actions dedicated to having a systemic impact on various aspects of the gender gap and the inclusion of disabilities, new global initiatives of STEM awareness, projects to suppo/r\\_t.liga the vulnerable, initiatives related to cultural diversity in various countries, and events to raise awareness of the concept of individuality and uniqueness. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, we organized the global event YOUniqueness Makes the Di/ff.ligaerence aimed at exploring the concept of individual uniqueness in relationships and in the organization, and we completed the provision of training throughout the Group entitled Beyond Bias and Harassment in the Workplace.\n\nPromoting a culture of inclusiveness at Enel also involves target se/t\\_t.ligaing and measurement. It is an approach that is encapsulated in an organic plan of actions measured by way of a broad set of KPIs subject to commitments approved by the corporate boards and published in the Sustainability Repo/r\\_t.liga and Plan. These commitments include: balancing the percentage of women in hiring processes; increasing  the  representation  of  women  in  senior  and middle management and in succession plans; increasing the number of female students involved in STEM-awareness initiatives; and promoting projects for the inclusion of employees with disabilities at all stages of the employee journey.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, in terms of gender equality, company strategy is organized into various lines of action. We are working to increase the presence of women in hiring processes, reaching 52.2% in 2022 (52.1% in 2021) and continuing the upward trend of the last /fi.ligave years. In terms of women in management positions, we have seen both the number and the percentage of female managers continue to climb, increasing by 1.3 percentage points in 2022 (from 23.6% in 2021 to 24.9% in 2022). Actions to value the contribution of women throughout the organization, and not just in senior positions, have also continued, and the e/ff.ligaects of these e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.ligas will be be/t\\_t.ligaer seen over the medium to long term, due in pa/r\\_t.liga to generational dynamics. Among the actions taken globally, the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance target for the percentage of women in top management succes-",

These STEM awareness and orientation initiatives reached nearly 10,000 female secondary-school students in 2022 and more than 30,000 female students over the last six years. (44)\n\nOn the issue of disabilities, Enel provides equipment, services, working methods and other initiatives to create an inclusive climate for work and relationships for all that provides full autonomy at work regardless of the disability. Worldwide, we have 2,129 employees with disabilities. The issue is pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly relevant in Italy (with 1,568 employees with disabilities, about 74% of the Group total).\n\nWith Enel's participation in the global 'Valuable 500' initiative in 2019, the issue became one of great interest, leading, in 2020, to the launch of the global project 'Value for Disability', aimed at seizing potential business and  promoting  inclusion  among  employees  and  customers with disabilities by designing specific global and local plans of action. Every country with at least one employee with a disability has a focal point for hearing and responding to specific needs and designing dedicated actions, as stated in the Diversity and Inclusion Policy. Many countries have also organized initiatives focused on intercultural and intergenerational issues and on the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nFinally, to promote care for all people who find themselves  in  circumstances  that  have  had  an  impact  on work, the MaCro@Work Caring Program for employees with chronic disorders and the Parental Program to support parenting throughout the Group are continuing in the various countries to which they have been extended.\n\nThe table below shows Enel's commitment to diversity and inclusion, including the percentage of employees with disabilities, the number of women in senior and middle management, and the ratio of the average salaries of women to those of men.\n\nDiversity and inclusion\n\n|                                                                   | 2021 Change   | 2021 Change   | 2021 Change   | 2021 Change   | 2021 Change   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Disabled personnel or personnel belonging to protected categories | %             | 3.3           | 3.2           | 0.1           | 3.1%          |\n| Women in senior and middle management                             | no.           | 4,462         | 4,163         | 299           | 7. 2 %        |\n| Percentage of women in senior and middle management               | %             | 31.8          | 30.6          | 1.2           | 3.9%          |\n| Percentage of women in management succession plans                | %             | 46.1          | 42.7          | 3.4           | 8.0%          |\n| Percentage of women in senior management succession plans         | %             | 50            | -             | 50            | -             |\n| Base salary and remuneration ratios                               |               |               |               |               |               |\n| Ratio of base salary women-to-men:                                | %             | 104.7         | 104.8         | -0.1          | -0.1%         |\n| - senior manager                                                  | %             | 83.9          | 84.6          | -0.7          | -0.8%         |\n| - middle manager                                                  | %             | 92.8          | 94.2          | -1.4          | -1.5%         |\n| - o/ffi.ligace sta/ff.liga                                        | %             | 88.8          | 88.4          | 0.4           | 0.5%          |\n| - blue collar                                                     | %             | 125.0         | 111.2         | 13.8          | 12.4%         |\n| Ratio of base remuneration women-to-men:                          | %             | 105.4         | 105.1         | 0.3           | 0.3%          |\n| - senior manager                                                  | %             | 80.7          | 81.1          | -0.4          | -0.5%         |\n| - middle manager                                                  | %             | 91.9          | 93.2          | -1.3          | -1.4%         |\n| - o/ffi.ligace sta/ff.liga                                        | %             | 89.3          | 88.4          | 0.9           | 1.0%          |\n| - blue collar                                                     | %             | 125.4         | 112.0         | 13.4          | 12.0%         |\n\n(44)  Beginning in 2022, the /fi.ligagure only includes initiatives targeting primary and secondary schools.",

These checks are conducted by specialist HSEQ personnel from outside the units being assessed, assisted by technicians specialized in the speci/fi.ligac business.\n\nWith regard to incident detection, analysis and management, the Group follows Policy 106 - Classi/fi.ligacation, communication, analysis and repo/r\\_t.ligaing of incidents, which establishes the roles and procedures that ensure the timely repo/r\\_t.ligaing of accidents, analysis of their causes, and de/fi.liganition and monitoring of improvement plans based on the type of incident.\n\nBased on the evidence to come out of the monitoring system, we have implemented a data-driven approach based on analytics and other digital tools that enable us to assess the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of internal units and suppliers, to identify the areas at greatest risk of fatal or life-changing injuries, and to then establish procedures for managing them. This approach is suppo/r\\_t.ligaed by the collection and dissemination of best practices, which are integrated into ongoing training in order to prevent repeat occurrences of the given incident type.\n\nWith regard to suppliers, (45) the approach of the Enel Group is to consider each to be a pa/r\\_t.liganer with which we share the cardinal environment and safety rules. As such, these issues are integrated into the tender process, and supplier pe/r\\_f.ligaormance is assessed both as pa/r\\_t.liga of the quali/fi.ligacation process and when carrying out the contract by way of\n\nnumerous controls and other mechanisms, including: the Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) Terms, the Supplier Pe/r\\_f.ligaormance Management (SPM) process, the Contractor Assessment (CA) process, and Evaluation Groups (EGs).\n\nAs for safety, health, too, is a fundamental value in our focus on individual growth and wellness. For this reason, the Enel Group has adopted a structured health management system based on preventive and protective measures and is commi/t\\_t.ligaed to developing a corporate culture that promotes  psycho-physical  health,  organizational  wellbeing and a balance between personal and professional life.\n\nTo this end, both globally and locally, Enel: promotes initiatives aimed at improving the quality of a typical workday in terms of both physical and emotional wellbeing; designs awareness campaigns to promote a healthy lifestyle; sponsors screening programs aimed at preventing illness; and provides facilitated access to medical and other healthcare services, assistance for people with disabilities, and speci/fi.ligac initiatives of preventive medicine.\n\nIn order to suppo/r\\_t.liga the change process and ensure the dissemination of a strong culture of safety throughout the organization, the Enel Group has established a detailed process for the provision and management of training for all employees. In 2022, a total of about 1.245 million hours of health and safety training was provided to Enel employees.\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, within the HSEQ unit of the holding company, there is the unit known as SHE Factor, the mission of which is to implement, integrate and harmonize throughout the Group dedicated training programs aimed at promoting a new mentality concerning a be/t\\_t.ligaer way to work that is safer for people and more sustainable for the environment, such as the courses Safety Leadership, Stop Work Policy, and Buddy Pa/r\\_t.liganers.",

This model has been incorporated along the entire value chain and is divided into six main steps such as the analysis of the contexts already in the initial phase of the business projects, the mapping and analysis of stakeholders and their priorities, the development of the materiality matrix to then plan and manage sustainability projects, which are evaluated at di/ff.ligaerent stages of project implementation. Models of sustainable construction sites and plants are also included in the approach. A fu/r\\_t.ligaher evolution has been the extension of this approach to the design, development and supply of energy services and products, as well as in the innovation of processes by using new technologies and helping to build increasingly circular, inclusive and sustainable communities.\n\nIn line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Enel makes a concrete contribution to the sustainable progress of the territories in which it operates. This commitment is fully integrated into our purpose and corporate values, from the expansion of infrastructure to education and vocational training programs, and projects to suppo/r\\_t.liga cultural and economic activities. Speci/fi.ligac initiatives have been designed to promote access to energy with rural and suburban electri/fi.ligacation, addressing energy pove/r\\_t.ligay and promoting social inclusion for the most vulnerable segments of the population, also using new technologies and circular economy approaches and adopting a strategy that fully incorporates sustainability into our business model and activities. Various initiatives have been developed globally for the protection of biodiversity, in line with the Group's decarbonization strategy.\n\nThere are two major challenges in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular: the equitable and sustainable transition and the post-pandemic recovery.\n\nThe  energy  transition  represents  an  impo/r\\_t.ligaant  accelerator of growth and modernization of industry, thanks to the potential it o/ff.ligaers in terms of economic development, well-being, quality of life and equality. Far-sighted policies are necessary to seize these oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities, ensuring\n\na just and inclusive transition and taking pa/r\\_t.ligaicular account of the needs of the social categories most exposed to change. Enel is convinced that in order to generate lasting pro/fi.ligat, value must be shared with the entire environment in which it operates.\n\nWith  the  continuation  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  our commitment to suppo/r\\_t.liga communities has also continued, with  the  activation  of  speci/fi.ligac  initiatives  to  sustain  socio-economic recovery through the development of local marketplaces, facilitating access to credit and promoting inclusive business models to suppo/r\\_t.liga the weaker segments of the population, with pa/r\\_t.ligaicular a/t\\_t.ligaention to people in physically, socially and economically vulnerable positions. Many digitalization projects have also been unde/r\\_t.ligaaken to suppo/r\\_t.liga connectivity in rural areas, computer literacy, the pa/r\\_t.ligaicipation of women in STEM /fi.ligaelds, e-commerce platforms and online or o/ffl.ligaine solutions with a positive impact on local economies.\n\nIn 2022, Enel developed over 2,300 sustainability projects involving more than 6.3 million bene/fi.ligaciaries in the countries in which Enel operates. In line with the SDGs, the projects concern activities such as the expansion of infrastructure, vocational education and training programs, projects to suppo/r\\_t.liga cultural and economic activities, promotion of access to energy, rural and suburban electri/fi.ligacation, addressing energy pove/r\\_t.ligay and the promotion of social inclusion for the most vulnerable categories of the population. A fundamental lever in the realization of these projects is the use of over 1,200 active international pa/r\\_t.liganerships with non-pro/fi.ligat organizations, social enterprises, sta/r\\_t.ligaups and institutions with close ties to the area.\n\nAn approach that leads to the implementation of a wide range of projects in di/ff.ligaerent areas, thanks in pa/r\\_t.liga to the activation of vi/r\\_t.ligauous ecosystems such as the Open Innovability \u00ae platform, which is based on openness and sharing, facilitating and promoting the identi/fi.ligacation of innovative social ideas and solutions.\n\nThe involvement of local communities is essential to develop a constructive dialogue that can actively contribute to facing the challenges posed by the social impacts of the decarbonization of the economy and to identify e/ff.ligaective measures to respond to local needs in synergy with corporate objectives.",

Suppliers are asked not only to meet the necessary quality standards but also to commit themselves to adopting best practices in the /fi.ligaelds of human rights and the environment.\n\nThis is pursued within clear references to codes of conduct, including the Group's Human Rights Policy, the Code of  Ethics,  the  Zero-Tolerance-of-Corruption  Plan  and global compliance programs.\n\nIn 2022 we signed agreements with a total of more than 6,213 vendors.\n\nAssessments of environmental, social and governance aspects are conducted at all procurement phases, i.e., in the quali/fi.ligacation phase, in the tender and contracting process and in the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance monitoring phase. Enel's global vendor quali/fi.ligacation system (with about 31,400 active quali/fi.ligacations at December 31, 2022) enables us to accurately assess businesses that intend to pa/r\\_t.ligaicipate in tender processes through the analysis of compliance with technical, /fi.liganancial, legal, environmental, human (including health and safety), ethical rights and integrity requirements. The company must continue to meet these requirements throughout the duration of their quali/fi.ligacation. Accordingly, companies already included in Enel's Register of Quali/fi.ligaed Suppliers are constantly monitored for events involving both the company itself and its main o/ffi.ligacers, mainly through the use of external databases. As regards the tendering and bargaining process, in line with Enel's commitment to introduce sustainability issues, the Company has adopted a structured process for de/fi.liganing 'sustainability requirements and rewarding factors (K)' which can be used by the various purchasing and monitoring units throughout the period of execution of the contract. The process provides for the presence of two 'Libraries', which catalog all the sustainability requirements and Ks grouped into social, environmental and circularity ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacation macro-categories. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, speci/fi.ligac contractual clauses have been de-\n\n/fi.liganed, which are included in all works, service and supply contracts and updated periodically, to take account of various regulatory developments and ensure alignment with international best practices.\n\nThe General Terms of Contract refer to the current regulations on pay, contributions, insurance and taxation for all workers employed in any capacity in the execution of the contract by the supplier. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, the principles referred to in the relevant ILO Conventions and provisions of law are explicitly referred to: equal treatment, prohibition of discrimination, abuse and harassment; trade union freedom, association and representation; refusal of forced labor; safety and environmental protection and sanitation conditions.  In  the  event  of  con/fl.ligaict  between  regulatory sources, the more restrictive shall prevail. Vendor pe/r\\_f.ligaormance is evaluated and monitored along the entire procurement process. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the monitoring systems employed during execution of the contract include Supplier Pe/r\\_f.ligaormance Management (SPM), whose objective within our collaboration with vendors is not only to unde/r\\_t.ligaake any corrective actions in the contract execution phase, but also to encourage a process of improvement using actions that reward the adoption of best practices. The process is based on an objective and systematic collection of data and information relating to the execution of the service covered by the contract. These data are used to produce speci/fi.ligac indicators, also called categories (Quality, Punctuality, Health and Safety, Environment, Human Rights & Correctness, Innovation & Collaboration), which, when combined in a weighted average, represent the Supplier Pe/r\\_f.ligaormance Index (SPI).\n\nThrough the SPM process, 701 goods categories and 7,666 vendors were monitored in the last year (compared with 698 goods categories and some 6,782 vendors in 2021).\n\nMeetings with suppliers continued in 2022 with a focus on decarbonization issues, circularity and human rights with a view to jointly developing practices and common approaches and to accompany suppliers in along the vi/r\\_t.ligauous path of sustainability.",

Following the transaction, Enel and CVC operate the company in a joint control regime.\n\nThe transaction is in line with the Enel Group's current Strategic Plan, under the Stewardship model, which envisages investments carried out with third pa/r\\_t.ligaies, with the aim to add new infrastructure and services in order to accelerate the electri/fi.ligacation process of customers' energy demand.\n\nThe agreements in place with the counterpa/r\\_t.ligay envisage, among other clauses, that, sta/r\\_t.ligaing from 2029, if CVC decides to sell its share on the market and does not /fi.ligand buyers willing to pay a price that will ensure a speci/fi.ligac return on the investment made by the fund, Enel would have the option of regaining control of Gridspe/r\\_t.ligaise. The probability of this scenario occurring was assessed as remote as at December 31, 2022.\n\n## Enel signs a \u20ac12 billion revolving credit facility guaranteed by SACE\n\nOn December 23, 2022, Enel SpA and a pool of /fi.liganancial institutions composed of Banco BPM SpA, BPER Banca SpA, Cassa Depositi e Prestiti SpA, Intesa Sanpaolo SpA and UniCredit SpA, with the la/t\\_t.ligaer also acting as agent bank, signed a \u20ac12 billion revolving credit facility to fund the collateral requirements of the trading activities of Enel and Enel Global Trading SpA on energy markets.\n\nThe credit facility, which is guaranteed by the Italian expo/r\\_t.liga credit agency SACE SpA up to 70% of its nominal amount and has a term of about 18 months, was /fi.liganalized in line, inter alia , with the provisions of (i) Communication C(2022) 7945 /fi.liganal from the European Commission regarding the 'Temporary Crisis Framework for State Aid measures to suppo/r\\_t.liga  the  economy  following  the  aggression  against Ukraine by Russia' and European Commission Decision SA.104722 of December 20, 2022 regarding 'State aid: amendments to Italian scheme, including up to \u20ac23 billion budget increase, to suppo/r\\_t.liga companies in context of Russia's war against Ukraine', as well as (ii) the Decree Law 50 of May 17, 2022 (the 'Aid Decree'), conve/r\\_t.ligaed into Law 91 of July 15, 2022, as amended with Decree Law 144 of September 23, 2022, conve/r\\_t.ligaed into Law 175 of November 17, 2022.",

The legislative proposal seeks to make the Recovery and Resilience Facility the strategic framework for the initiatives to be introduced under REPowerEU. In order to access the resources available under this plan, Member States must add to their existing Recovery and Resilience Plans a dedicated chapter se/t\\_t.ligaing out the reforms and new investments they will pursue to hasten the reduction in dependence on fossil fuels, while at the same mitigating their costs and socio-economic impact during the transition.\n\nThe Commission estimates the investment needed by 2030 to achieve the REPowerEU objectives and gradually eliminate impo/r\\_t.ligas of fossil fuels from Russia at around \u20ac300 billion (\u20ac210 billion by 2027). About 95% of this will be dedicated to accelerating the energy transition (with an increase in the renewables capacity, energy e/ffi.ligaciency and heat pumps in the residential sector, energy e/ffi.ligaciency and decarbonization in the industrial sector, development of transmission networks, distribution and storage, increase in the production of sustainable biomethane and biomass).\n\nThe legislative process, which began in May, was concluded in December with the provisional agreement reached by the Council and the European Parliament on the proposed REPowerEU regulation, which in addition to con/fi.ligarming the main elements proposed by the Commission also sets out how the plan will be /fi.ligananced, including the use of:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u20ac225 billion of loans not yet used in the Recovery and Resilience Plans. Even countries that have already used all the funds at their disposal (e.g., Italy, Romania and Greece) will be able to access any resources remaining after the countries that are still entitled have submi/t\\_t.ligaed their applications; \u20ac20 billion, funded both through the Innovation Fund and by frontloading the auctioning of ETS allowances. These funds will be distributed to each country based on the allocation key which takes into account cohesion policy, the Member States' dependence on fossil fuels and the increase of investment prices;\n\nadditional  resources  from  voluntary  transfers  from  the Brexit Adjustment Reserve (BAR) and unspent cohesion funds from the previous multiannual /fi.liganancial framework (2014-2020) to suppo/r\\_t.liga SMEs and vulnerable households pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly a/ff.ligaected by energy price increases.\n\nAs regards the Recovery and Resilience Facility, in 2022, the Commission and the European Council continued work on reviewing the National Recovery and Resilience Plans, approving those of the /fi.liganal two countries, Hungary and the Netherlands, in the 2nd Half of the year.\n\nDuring the year, the European Union continued to disburse /fi.liganancing to those Member States that had requested pre-/fi.liganancing of their activities or that had reached the milestones and targets indicated in their Recovery and Resilience Plans. At the end of 2022, the total amount of funds disbursed by the EU amounted to around \u20ac139 billion (\u20ac94 billion in grants and \u20ac45 billion in loans).\n\nDevelopments in the 'Fit for 55' and REPowerEU packages\n\n## Energy and climate targets\n\nThe European Commission's 'Fit for 55' package, presented in July 2021, proposed raising the EU's 2030 targets in suppo/r\\_t.liga of a more ambitious climate goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 and achieving climate neutrality by 2050.\n\nDue to the energy crisis that began in 2021 and that was exacerbated by the Ukraine crisis in 2022, it has become\n\nnecessary  to  /fi.ligand  additional  sho/r\\_t.liga  and  medium-term measures to strengthen economic growth, ensure secure energy supplies and hold to the commitment on Europe's climate targets.\n\nThe REPower EU strategy is the response of the European Commission, which proposes to:\n\n\u00b7\n\nspeed up the spread of renewable energy, by increasing the 2030 'Fit for 55' target from 40% to 45% and presenting the 'EU Solar Strategy';",

Some of the most signi/fi.ligacant of these are the revisions of the Renewable Energy Directive (RED III), the Energy E/ffi.ligaciency Directive (EED), the Energy Pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), the EU Emissions Trading System Directive (EU ETS), and the Regulation se/t\\_t.ligaing CO 2 emissions restrictions for motor vehicles.\n\n## European Industrial Strategy\n\nOn March 10, 2020, the new Industrial Strategy was presented, with the goals of: helping European industry remain competitive globally, making Europe climate neutral by 2050 and shaping Europe's digital future. The strategy proposes a series of legislative and non-legislative initiatives to suppo/r\\_t.liga all of Europe's industrial actors, ranging from large to small enterprises, research centers and sta/r\\_t.ligaups. These include comprehensive measures to modernize and decarbonize energy intensive industries, to suppo/r\\_t.liga the sustainable and sma/r\\_t.liga mobility industries, to promote energy e/ffi.ligaciency and ensure a secure and su/ffi.ligacient supply of low-carbon energy at competitive prices. The Industrial Strategy also proposes entering into a series of new alliances like the European alliance on clean hydrogen in order to speed up the decarbonization of industry and to maintain a position of industrial leadership, followed by alliances on low-carbon industries, on industrial clouds and platforms and raw materials. In addition to a full range of actions - both horizontal and intended to promote speci/fi.ligac technologies - the European Commission will systematically analyze the risks and needs of the various industrial ecosystems. In carrying out its analysis, the Commission will work closely with an inclusive and open industrial forum that was to be set up by September 2020.\n\n## Digital technology\n\nOn June 3, 2022, the European Data Governance Act (Regulation (EU) 2022/868) was adopted. It seeks to organize\n\nand encourage data sharing within the EU to build a more competitive European data economy. In addition, negotiations with the United States on a new data privacy shield concluded with the publication on December 13, 2022 of a process to adopt an adequacy decision for the EU-US Data Privacy Framework, which, once formally adopted, acknowledges that the United States will guarantee an adequate level of protection for the personal data transferred from the EU.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, two regulations were adopted in 2022, the Digital  Markets  Act  (DMA)  and  the  Digital  Services  Act (DSA), which introduce rules applicable to all digital services, including online markets and other online platforms that operate in the European Union. The DMA establishes a series of strictly de/fi.liganed objective criteria for qualifying a large online platform as a so-called 'gatekeeper'. The DSA sets a new standard for the liability of online platforms for illegal and harmful content. It will provide be/t\\_t.ligaer protection for internet users and their fundamental rights, as well as de/fi.ligane a single set of rules for the internal market, helping smaller platforms to grow. Also relating to data use, the European Commission published on February 23, 2022 its proposed Data Act, a regulation touching on delicate issues, such as obligations for sharing data, monetizing data and data access, which is currently being debated at European level.\n\nPrompted  by  growing  concerns  regarding  cyber  risk, discussions about the revision of the Network and Information Security Directive (NIS2), intended to improve the management of risks and incidents and cooperation for essential businesses, were concluded quickly and the new Directive (EU) 2022/2555 was published in the O/ffi.ligacial Journal on December 27, 2022. The new directive was aligned with sector legislation, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), which was also published on the same day as the Directive (EU) 2022/2555, to provide legal clarity and to ensure consistency between it and NIS2.\n\nOn September 28, 2022, the Commission published two new proposals in relation to the EU's digital strategy and a/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacial intelligence, the main objectives of which are to adapt liability rules to the digital age, circular economy and the impact of global value chains:\n\nI.\n\nII.\n\nrevision of the product liability directive, to modernize the existing rules on liability for defective products to obtain fair compensation for personal injuries, damages or loss of data;\n\nnew AI liability directive on adapting non-contractual civil liability rules to a/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacial intelligence (AI), which aims to harmonize national rules on liability for damage arising from to/r\\_t.ligaious conduct, to make it easier to receive compensation for damage and to give companies the right to bring claims for liability based on a presumption of causality.\n\nBoth directives are currently being examined at European level, which is expected to continue throughout 2023.",

The package includes numerous proposals concerning transpo/r\\_t.liga and reducing CO 2 emissions in the transpo/r\\_t.liga sector and accelerating the transition to zero-emission mobility. During the second half of 2022 the European Parliament and Council made progress in analyzing numerous aspects of the 'Fit for 55' legislation:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nthe revision of the CO 2 standards for cars and vans (/fi.liganal act pending), which increases the emission reduction targets for 2030 for passenger cars and vans and requires that all new light vehicles sold from 2035 be zero-emission vehicles;\n\nAlternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR), currently in inter-institutional negotiations (Trilogue) stage, for the development of a public infrastructure for the distribution of alternative fuels (charging points, hydrogen refueling stations, etc.);\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nthe revision of the European Pe/r\\_f.ligaormance Building Directive (EPBD) to facilitate the installation of charging points in residential prope/r\\_t.ligaies;\n\nthe revision of the Trans-European Network of Transpo/r\\_t.liga (TEN-T) Regulation which aims to close regional, economic and social gaps through the development of interconnected air transpo/r\\_t.liga, roadway, railway and maritime network infrastructures at European level;\n\nthe revision of the Intelligent Transpo/r\\_t.liga System (ITS) Directive, currently in Trilogue stage, to regulate the deployment of intelligent transpo/r\\_t.liga systems in the /fi.ligaeld of road transpo/r\\_t.liga and for inte/r\\_f.ligaaces with other modes of transpo/r\\_t.liga;\n\nthe ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime initiatives, at the Trilogue stage, targeted at reducing greenhouse gas emissions for aviation and maritime transpo/r\\_t.liga, setting increasingly stringent emission limits for ships and planes, and envisaging measures to promote renewable or low-carbon fuels.\n\nOn November 10, 2022, the Commission presented the proposal on new Euro 7 standards to reduce air pollution from light and heavy vehicles and to improve air quality.\n\nHydrogen and decarbonized gas market package\n\nOn December 15, 2021, the European Commission published  the  package  for  the  decarbonization  of  the  gas market and the de/fi.liganition of a framework enabling the penetration of renewable and low-carbon gases into the system, including hydrogen, and rules governing the market and organization of the sector, including infrastructure aspects. The package includes low-carbon gas ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacation standards that ensure a 70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn addition, it promotes access and rate discounts for renewable and low-carbon gases. Among the salient points are the rules on ve/r\\_t.ligaical and horizontal unbundling and on access to networks in the hydrogen sector, with less stringent provisions until 2030 and exemptions for existing and new geographically con/fi.liganed hydrogen networks. The\n\nDe/fi.liganition of renewable hydrogen\n\nAs required by the Renewables Directive of 2018, the European Commission is responsible for issuing a delegated act to de/fi.ligane the criteria by which hydrogen produced from electricity can be considered renewable. The Commission has opened a formal stakeholder consultation and the act is now under review prior to adoption. The criteria concern\n\nCommission proposal also provides for separate Regulatory Assets Base (RABs) between gas and electricity and hydrogen infrastructures, but allows, subject to authorization by regulators, /fi.liganancial transfers between them to /fi.liganance the hydrogen network (charges on /fi.liganal gas and electricity consumers). Finally, the package envisages that gas Transmission System Operators (TSOs) must accept gas-hydrogen mixtures (so-called blending) at borders up to a percentage of 5%, with a cost allocation procedure that provides for the intervention of the authorities in the event of no agreement between network operators.\n\nThe /fi.liganal position to be negotiated in Trilogue by the Parliament and the Council is still being de/fi.liganed. It appears that position will be to propose a less stringent regulatory framework for hydrogen, at least in the initial stage.\n\nthe principles of additionality for renewable plants that power the electrolyzers and the spatial and temporal correlation between electrolyzers and renewable plants.\n\nThe European Parliament expressed its disagreement with the rules it deemed too strict in se/t\\_t.ligaing out its position on the revised Renewable Energy Directive.",

        "page_content": "## EU strategy on energy system integration\n\nAlongside its hydrogen strategy, on July 8, 2020, the Commission presented the EU strategy on energy system integration. The scope of the strategy is to transform the present energy system in which each sector (transpo/r\\_t.liga, industry, gas, buildings) is an isolated compa/r\\_t.ligament, creating  new  cross-sectoral  links,  leveraging  technological progress so as to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 at the least possible cost. The strategy sets out 38 actions to implement this more integrated system and is based on three main pillars: a more circular energy system, hinging on energy e/ffi.ligaciency; greater direct electri/fi.ligacation of enduse sectors; and the promotion of clean fuels, including renewable hydrogen and sustainable biofuels and biogas for sectors where electri/fi.ligacation is di/ffi.ligacult.\n\n## Just Transition Fund\n\nThe Just Transition Fund (JTF) is a funding instrument under the Just Transition Mechanism (JTM) which aims to provide suppo/r\\_t.liga to Member States by reducing the socio-economic impact of the transition towards climate neutrality. The total resources (2021-2027) allocated at Community level to the JTF amount to \u20ac17.5 billion (at 2018 prices), of which \u20ac7.5 billion under the 2021-2027 EU multiannual /fi.liganancial framework and \u20ac10 billion under Next Generation EU.\n\nThe JTF will suppo/r\\_t.liga workers, businesses and regional authorities in the green transition and will /fi.liganance a speci/fi.ligac number of activities, including the regeneration and decontamination of brown/fi.ligaeld sites, investments in renewable energy and energy e/ffi.ligaciency, upskilling and reskilling, and sustainable mobility.\n\nThe National Transition Plans for Italy and Spain were approved in December 2022, with allocated funding of \u20ac1.2 billion and \u20ac869 million (current prices), respectively.\n\nAs regards Italy, its plan focuses on investment in the areas of Sulcis Iglesiente and the Province of Taranto in projects to counter the e/ff.ligaects of the transition by: increasing the share of energy generated from renewable sources for businesses and persons, diversifying the local production system, and mitigating the social e/ff.ligaects and those on employment.\n\nThe Spanish plan targets the region of Asturias, the prov-\n\ninces of A Coru\u00f1a, Teruel, Le\u00f3n, Palencia, Almer\u00eda, Cadiz and C\u00f3rdoba, and a group of municipalities around Alc\u00fadia on the island of Mallorca. The plan will invest in energy ef/fi.ligaciency, the circular economy, renewable energy sources (solar, o/ff.ligashore wind, renewable hydrogen), and the 'green transformation' of the nation's industry.\n\n## Sustainable Finance\n\nWith regard to the European taxonomy, the /fi.ligarst delegated act, which establishes the technical screening criteria for determining whether a speci/fi.ligac economic activity makes a substantial contribution to the /fi.ligaght against climate change (adaptation and mitigation), entered into force on January 1, 2022. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, in February 2022, the European Commission presented the Complementary Delegated Act, which sets out the criteria for gas and nuclear energy activities, which was approved by the European Parliament and the Council, entering into force on January 1, 2023.\n\nIn the 2nd Half of 2022, the European Parliament and the Council were also engaged in inter-institutional negotiations (Trilogue) to agree on the /fi.liganal text of the Green Bond Standard Regulation. However, the co-legislators were unable to reach an agreement, mainly on the European  Parliament's  proposal  to  extend  the  disclosure obligations to other sustainable bonds, including sustainability-linked bonds.\n\nIn 2022, the European Parliament and the Council also reached an agreement on the corporate sustainability repo/r\\_t.ligaing directive, which entered into force in January 2023.\n\nAlso in the 2nd Half of 2022, the Council adopted its position on the corporate sustainability due diligence directive targeted at large companies, the proposal for which was presented by the European Commission in February 2022. Instead, the European Parliament has not completed its work and the inter-institutional negotiations have been postponed to 2023.\n\nFinally,  in  September  2022  the  European  Commission presented its proposed regulation to ban products made with forced labor, both 'domestic' goods made in Europe and those impo/r\\_t.ligaed from outside the EU. The European Parliament and the Council are expected to de/fi.ligane their positions in 2023.",

        "page_content": "New State aid regulations\n\nOn January 27, 2022, the new 2022 regulations on State aid for climate, environment and energy, namely Climate, Energy and Environmental Aid Guidelines (CEEAG), came into force. They will guide investment suppo/r\\_t.liga for decarbonization in the coming years, and for that they are of considerable impo/r\\_t.ligaance for the energy sector and for the Enel Group. The new regulations include a section dedicated to aid for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions including aid for the production of renewable and low-carbon energy, aid for energy e/ffi.ligaciency, including high-ef/fi.ligaciency cogeneration, aid for hydrogen, aid for storage and ba/t\\_t.ligaeries and aid for the reduction or prevention of emissions from industrial processes. An entire chapter has been dedicated to sustainable mobility, which governs aid for electric mobility and charging infrastructure, including the maritime sector. Energy e/ffi.ligaciency measures for buildings are also regulated, including ba/t\\_t.ligaeries and charging of electric vehicles. The proposed rules also o/ffi.ligacially recognize that /fi.liganancing for natural or legal monopoly power grids does not represent State aid. Finally, aid to nuclear technologies and fossil fuels are excluded from the scope of  the  guidelines,  while  all  types  of  storage,  including stand-alone systems, are included among the technologies allowed in the section dedicated to aid for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nIn 2022 work continued on the draft revision of the General  Block  Exemption  Regulation  (GBER)  with  impo/r\\_t.ligaant changes to the sections relating to climate, environmental protection and energy, including an update of the noti/fi.ligacation thresholds, in response to the energy crisis. The GBER de/fi.liganes speci/fi.ligac categories of State aid that, under ce/r\\_t.ligaain conditions, are compatible with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and exempts these categories from the obligation of prior noti/fi.ligacation to the Commission and its approval. The draft regulation proposes to expand the scope for Member States to /fi.liganance di/ff.ligaerent types of green projects, such as those to reduce CO 2 emissions, sustainable mobility and charging infrastructure. It also introduces new green conditions that large energy-intensive businesses must meet to receive aid in the form of reduced tax rates or exemptions from payment of system charges; storage, including ba/t\\_t.ligaeries; sustainable hydrogen and renewable energy communities. The new regulation will be published in the early months of 2023 and will permit greater /fl.ligaexibility in these key sectors in the long term.\n\nThe revised rules on State aid in favor of major impo/r\\_t.ligaant projects  of  common  European  interest  (IPCEI)  entered\n\nforce on January 1, 2022. The legislation sets out the criteria for the Commission's evaluation of the aid that Member States grant to cross-border IPCEIs that remedy market failures and enable cu/t\\_t.ligaing-edge innovations in key sectors and investments in technologies and infrastructures, with positive spillovers for the entire EU economy.\n\nThe European Commission approved the map for granting regional aid from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2027 for Italy and Romania in December 2021, for Greece in January 2022 and for Spain in March 2022, within the framework of the revised regional aid guidelines.\n\nOn May 12, 2022, the European Commission decided to phase out the State aid COVID Temporary Framework (TF COVID), adopted on May 19, 2020 and last amended on November 18, 2021, which covered the funds and projects of the NRRP. Most of the instruments provided under the Temporary Framework expired on June 30, 2022. The possibility of investment and solvency suppo/r\\_t.liga measures for Member States expired on December 31, 2022. However, a /fl.ligaexible transition for the conversion of debt instruments into other forms of aid is guaranteed until June 30, 2023. We have worked, within the TF COVID, to disburse aid for national measures intended to boost employment even in disadvantaged areas.\n\nOn March 23, 2022, the European Commission approved the Temporary Crisis Framework (TCF), which was intended to tackle rising electricity and gas prices as a consequence of the current geopolitical crisis sparked by the situation in Ukraine. The TCF was amended on July 20, 2022 to include new measures in line with the REPowerEU plan regarding the acceleration of the rollout of renewable energy and the facilitation of the decarbonization of industrial processes. An additional amendment was approved in October 2022 to fu/r\\_t.ligaher simplify the development of renewables and to align the TCF with the emergency measures taken in response to the energy crisis (for example, demand reduction  measures)  and  to  include  government  guarantees among liquid collateral on power trading markets. Some \u20ac672 billion has been disbursed under the TCF since when it was approved to the end of 2022. More speci/fi.ligacally, 53% of the State aid approved was noti/fi.ligaed by Germany, 24% by France and 7% by Italy.\n\nOn  October  19,  2022,  the  European  Commission  published the revised State aid Framework for research, development and innovation .",

The IPCEI Hydrogen Technology project was approved on July 15, 2022. Alongside this, work was begun on selecting the projects to be carried out under IPCEI Hydrogen Industry or IPCEI Hy2Use, approved on September 21, 2022.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to monitor the funds authorized by the European Commission for the countries of impo/r\\_t.ligaance to the Group in relation to TF COVID and TF Crisis.\n\nOn June 8, 2022, the Commission approved the \u20ac8.4 billion in State aid from Spain and Po/r\\_t.ligaugal to reduce wholesale electricity prices on the Iberian market, lowering the production costs of fossil fuel power plants.\n\nOn July 26, 2022, the European Commission approved a \u20ac700 million Italian scheme to suppo/r\\_t.liga SMEs and Midcaps a/ff.ligaected  by  the  crisis  in  Ukraine  through  direct  grants. Alongside this, it approved a \u20ac10 billion loan guarantee scheme proposed by Italy to suppo/r\\_t.liga companies across sectors in the context of the Ukraine crisis.\n\nOn  September  5,  2022,  the  Commission  approved  the\n\nMarket Revenue Cap\n\nIn October 2022, the Council approved the regulation on emergency measures to reduce energy prices. The regulation includes a cap on market revenue for inframarginal producers (e.g., renewable energy, nuclear power) of \u20ac180/ MWh. Revenue above this threshold will be subject to a clawback tax at a rate of 90-100% from December 2022\n\nto June 2023 and redistributed to customers to help them bear energy costs. The threshold imposed by the EU is higher than the average prices recorded in many Member States for inframarginal generation. Many Member States have adopted even stricter measures.\n\nSolidarity taxes\n\nThe surplus revenue generated by European Union companies and permanent establishments with activities in the crude oil, natural gas, coal and re/fi.liganery sectors is subject to a mandatory temporary solidarity contribution, unless the Member States have enacted equivalent national measures. Member States must ensure that enacted equivalent national measures share similar objectives and are subject to rules similar to those for the temporary solidarity contribution under the Regulation and generate comparable or higher proceeds than those estimated for the solidarity contribution. The temporary solidarity contribution for EU companies and permanent establishments with activities\n\nin the crude oil, natural gas, coal and re/fi.liganery sectors, including those that are pa/r\\_t.liga of a consolidated group merely for tax purposes, shall be calculated on the taxable pro/fi.ligats, as determined under national tax rules, in the /fi.ligascal year 2022 and/or the /fi.ligascal year 2023 and for their full duration, which are above a 20% increase in the average taxable pro/fi.ligats, as determined under national tax rules, in the four /fi.ligascal years sta/r\\_t.ligaing on or after 1 January 2018.

The Po/r\\_t.ligao Empedocle plant is eligible for longterm cost reimbursement until 2025, while plants located on the smaller islands are automatically eligible for cost reimbursement for all years in which they are declared essential,  including  2022  and  2023.  Admission  to  the cost reimbursement scheme guarantees coverage of the operating costs of the aforementioned plants, including a return on capital invested. Generation cost reimbursement, net of plant revenue, is granted by the Regulatory Authority for Energy, Networks and the Environment (ARERA) with measures authorizing payments on account and a /fi.liganal balance payment based on applications submi/t\\_t.ligaed by operators.\n\nFor 2022 and 2023 the remainder of essential capacity was contracted under alternative contracts which provide for the obligation, on the Ancillary Services Market (ASM), to o/ff.ligaer to go up/down to prices no higher/lower than the values identi/fi.ligaed using methods established by ARERA for a /fi.ligaxed premium.\n\nIn 2022, ARERA revised the valuation criteria for cost components relating to the cost of natural gas and the charges connected with the Emission Trading System (ETS) obligations pe/r\\_t.ligaaining to essential plants eligible for the cost reimbursement scheme and under alternative contracts, in order to more accurately re/fl.ligaect the spot price of the commodities underlying those charges in an environment of rising volatility in the benchmark prices.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, with its Resolution no. 452/2022/R/eel, ARERA revised the valuation criteria for natural gas costs, introducing,  as  from  October  1,  2022,  weekly  indexing of the prices recorded in the national balancing market, which replaces the previous qua/r\\_t.ligaerly indexing mechanism and the related prices recorded on the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) platform.\n\nThese rules were con/fi.ligarmed for 2023 by Resolution no. 532/2022/R/eel, with which ARERA also established that there would be a shift for 2023 from monthly to weekly indexing to calculate the cost component for ETS obligations.\n\nIn  order  to  tackle  the  gas  supply  problems  for  the 2022/2023  thermal  year,  Decree  Law  14/2022  (the  socalled 'Ukraine Decree') allowed the Ministry of Ecologi-\n\ncal Transition (MiTE) to require Terna to maximize thermal generation by plants with a capacity of over 300 MW powered by non-gas alternative fuels, as well as generation by bioliquid plants. The decree law also contains measures for the competent institutions to cooperate on issuing environmental waivers that may be necessary for the operation of plants whose output is to be maximized and ask ARERA to establish the supply rules for those plants and the reimbursement of costs incurred following the activation of the measure.\n\nWith its Guidelines of September 1, 2022, MiTE asked Terna to draw up and implement a gas-alternative production maximization plan for the September 19, 2022 - March 31, 2023 period to enable a savings of 1.8 billion cubic meters of gas, minimizing recourse to environmental waivers.\n\nTerna has identi/fi.ligaed the plants that will take pa/r\\_t.liga and, on September  19,  launched  the  production  maximization plan. Enel's Sulcis, Fusina, Torrevaldaliga Nord, and Brindisi plants are included.\n\nWith  its  Resolution  no.  430/2022/R/eel,  ARERA  established that:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nfor plants that are already deemed essential plants eligible for the cost reimbursement scheme (Sulcis plant), the existing supply and production cost reimbursement rules will continue to apply;\n\nfor other plants, the operator is required to present bids relating to the maximization plan announced by Terna at the minimum technical price on the energy markets and at the recognized variable cost (RVC) for each unit of generation in the ASM. Terna pays to the operator any positive di/ff.ligaerence between the energy market price and the RVC; while Terna pays to operators whose bids are accepted for sale on the ASM the day-ahead market zonal prices, if higher than the RCV. If revenue is not suf/fi.ligacient to cover even the /fi.ligaxed costs incurred during the maximization period, the operator can request that ARERA reimburse these costs, excluding the remuneration and amo/r\\_t.ligaization of the capital invested in the plant prior to the sta/r\\_t.liga of the maximization procedure.\n\nARERA, with Resolution no. 433/2021/R/eel, set the invested capital remuneration rate for essential plants eligible for reimbursement of costs for 2022, leaving it at 7%, the same as decided for 2021.\n\nSta/r\\_t.ligaing in 2023, ARERA, with Resolution no. 532/2022/R/ eel, modi/fi.ligaed the methodology for determining the nominal remuneration rate on capital invested in plants essential to the security of the electricity system eligible for the cost reimbursement scheme.

More specifically, WACC is obtained by applying the benchmarks for electricity transmission, with the exception of the speci/fi.ligac risk (beta asset) set equal to the electricity distribution value (0.4). It also includes an add-on of 0.2% to take account of any fu/r\\_t.ligaher charges and risk associated with essential generation eligible for the cost reimbursement scheme. Using the new methodology, the resolution sets nominal WACC for 2023 at 11.9% and this /fi.ligagure will be adjusted annually based on changes in the /fi.liganancial benchmarks used in the calculation.\n\nOn June 28, 2019, the Minister for Economic Development issued a decree approving the de/fi.liganitive rules governing the capacity remuneration mechanism (the capacity market). On November 6 and November 28, 2019 two auctions were held with delivery in 2022 and 2023 respectively: Enel was awarded capacity for both years. A number of operators and a sectoral trade association contested the decree and the results of the two auctions before the Lombardy Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga.\n\nTwo operators also challenged the European Commission decision approving the Italian mechanism before the EU Cou/r\\_t.liga. In two decisions dated 7 September 2022, the European General Cou/r\\_t.liga dismissed the actions and the two applicant companies decided to not appeal the decisions before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Justice of the European Union, thereby concluding the disputes. The disputes are still under way before the Lombardy Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga, which had suspended proceedings in April 2021 pending the rulings of the EU Cou/r\\_t.liga, having found a preliminary issue with respect to these proceedings.\n\nWith the Decree of the Minister for the Ecological Transition (MiTE) of October 28, 2021, the new capacity market regulation was approved. It will apply to auctions with delivery  from  2024.  In  execution  of  the  decree,  Terna launched the auction procedures for 2024, which took place on February 21, 2022. Enel was awarded annual contracts for approximately 10.4 GW of existing capacity with delivery in 2024, and contracts for approximately 1.5 GW of new capacity with a duration of 15 years from 2024 to 2038. Pursuant to the decree, the results of the 2024 auction will be used as the basis for assessing whether to hold an auction for the 2025 delivery year.\n\nIn December 2021, two operators /fi.ligaled two appeals with the Lombardy Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga against the MiTE Ministerial Decree of 28 October 2021, Terna's 2021 Capacity Market Regulations and the ARERA resolutions which de/fi.ligane the framework for the execution of the capacity auction for 2024 (and possibly for 2025). In May\n\n2022, the same companies also challenged the detailed repo/r\\_t.liga of the results of the main auction for 2024, published by Terna.\n\nIn March 2022, ARERA issued Resolution no. 83/2022/R/ eel with urgent measures to change the methods of calculating the strike price of the capacity market. The resolution was adopted to cope with the extreme volatility of the markets in recent months, introducing a mechanism for indexing on a daily basis the components relating to the cost of gas and the issue charges included in the calculation of the strike price. The new methodology replaces the current formulas, which provide for an indexation of the strike price on a monthly basis. The changes are e/ff.ligaective from March 5, 2022 and shall apply until a subsequent ARERA measures is issued.\n\nWith Resolution no. 523/2021/R/eel, from April 1, 2022, in implementation of the EU regulatory framework, an amendment was introduced to the rules governing imbalances, with the extension of the 'single pricing' mechanism for assigning a value to imbalances of all units, including  those  authorized  for  the  Ancillary  Services Market (ASD). The reform eliminates the dual price mechanism, which had applied to units authorized for the ASD and was more costly. At the same time, in order to discourage imbalances that could lead to an increase in system costs, the new regulation extends the macro-zone non-arbitrage fee to units authorized for the ASD and revises the structure of the fees for non-compliance with dispatching orders.\n\nAt  the  end  of  November  2021,  Legislative  Decree 199/2021 implementing Directive 2018/2001 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources was published in the Gazze/t\\_t.ligaa U/ffi.ligaciale . The decree also contains provisions on the con/fi.ligaguration of self-consumption and renewable energy communities, which are already governed in Italy by the experimental regulations introduced with Law 8/2020 (ratifying Decree Law 162/2019, the 'Milleproroghe' omnibus extension act) and subsequent implementation measures (ARERA Resolution no. 318/2020/R/eel and Ministerial Decree of September 16, 2020 of the Ministry for Economic Development). On December 27, 2022, in implementation of Legislative Decree 199/2021, ARERA approved the Consolidated Distributed Self-Consumption Code (TIAD), which sets out the new regulatory framework for energy communities and distributed self-consumption con/fi.ligagurations. The Ministry of the Environment and Energetic Safety (MASE) will have to update the incentive mechanisms for renewable energy plants inse/r\\_t.ligaed in collective self-consumption con/fi.ligagurations or renewable energy communities set out in the experimental rules. Until MASE adopts the implementing measures, the transitional rules will apply.",

Producers must return the di/ff.ligaerence between the market price, or the contracted price for forward sales, and a reference price identi/fi.ligaed in the same decree for each market zone (an average of \u20ac60/MWh). The implementation procedures of this mechanism have been speci/fi.ligaed by ARERA with Resolution no. 266/2022/R/eel. Decree Law 115 of August 9, 2022, rati/fi.ligaed with Law 142 of September 21, 2022,  introduced  some  modi/fi.ligacations  to  the  January measure  by  extending  the  application  period,  initially from February to December 2022, until June 2023, and specifying that, for ve/r\\_t.ligaically integrated groups, only contracts signed by group companies (including non-generators) with other natural or legal persons outside the group are eligible. On December 1, 2022, the Lombardy Administrative Regional Cou/r\\_t.liga granted the appeals /fi.ligaled by several operators, voiding Resolution no. 266/2022/R/ eel and the technical standards. On January 18, 2023, the Council of State granted the precautionary request presented by ARERA and published an order restoring Resolution no. 266/2022.\n\nFinally, the 2023 Budget Act (Law 197 of December 29, 2022), transposing Regulation (EU) 1854/2022, extends the  reimbursement  scheme  to  plants  not  covered  by Decree Law 4 of January 27, 2022, establishing a cap of \u20ac180/MWh.\n\nA/r\\_t.ligaicle 21 of Decree Law 17 of March 1, 2022, calls for optimizing the gas injection cycle in order to /fi.ligall the national stocks to at least 90% of available capacity, including through special storage conditions and methods of allocation of modulated storage space and the corresponding injection obligations.\n\nIn issuing the implementing regulations, ARERA, through Resolution no. 110/2022/R/gas, sought to promote /fi.ligalling gas stores by se/t\\_t.ligaing reserve prices at zero for all procedures for allocating modulated storage capacity. It also provides that costs in connection with the technical consumption of gas compression and treatment plants will not be charged to storage users.\n\nIn addition,  ARERA  introduced,  with  Resolution  no. 165/2022/R/gas, a mechanism (the so-called 'stock bonus') to fu/r\\_t.ligaher encourage the /fi.ligalling of gas stores. More speci/fi.ligacally, the mechanism calls for paying users a storage premium based on the volume of gas in storage at the end of the injection phase.\n\nIberia\n\nRoyal Decree Law 6/2022 of March 29 adopting urgent measures as pa/r\\_t.liga of the Plan for the National Response to the economic and social consequences of the war in Ukraine, Royal Decree Law 11/2022 of June 25 adopting and extending ce/r\\_t.ligaain measures to respond to the economic and social consequences of the war in Ukraine, address situations of social and economic vulnerability and the economic and social recovery of the island of La Palma\n\nOn March 30, 2022, Royal Decree Law 6/2022 of March 29 was published in Spain's O/ffi.ligacial Journal, approving ce/r\\_t.ligaain measures as pa/r\\_t.liga of the Plan for the National Response to the consequences of the war in Ukraine. The legislation contains various measures for the energy sector, some of which were extended until December 31, 2022 with Royal Decree Law 11/2022 of June 25 and until December 31, 2023 with Royal Decree Law 18/2022 of October 18 and Royal Decree Law 20/2012 of December 27. Some of the most signi/fi.ligacant measures were the following:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nextends until December 31, 2022 the payment obligation that Royal Decree Law 17/2021 of September 14 established for non-emi/t\\_t.ligaing generation plants in propo/r\\_t.ligaion to the presumed higher revenue that those plants would have earned following the incorporation into wholesale electricity prices of the value of the price of natural gas. Power hedged with /fi.ligaxed-price forward contracts before March 31, 2022 will be exempt from the application of the mechanism. Hedging instruments with a duration equal to or greater than one year and a /fi.ligaxed price after March 31, 2022 will be excluded if the /fi.ligaxed price is equal to or less than \u20ac67/MWh. In the case of bilateral contracts between generators and retailers in the same business group, the hedge price will be the price that sellers pass on to /fi.liganal consumers and, in this case, the exempt /fi.ligaxed price will be determined by increasing the value by \u20ac67/MWh in the average marketing margin of the sector;\n\nexceptionally, within two months of the entry into force of the royal decree law, a ministerial order will update the remuneration  parameters  for  renewable  sources,  cogeneration and waste plants, taking account of forward prices for the 2nd Half of 2021 for market prices and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, sta/r\\_t.ligaing from 2023 inclusive, the adjustment mechanism for deviations from the market price is eliminated, in order to encourage the forward sale of energy by these plants. However, Royal Decree Law 10/2022 of May 13 restored the adjustment mechanism for deviations from the market price, incorporating forward benchmarks in relation to the expected price;",

It establishes a temporary mechanism for adjusting generation costs to reduce the wholesale price of electricity. The measure establishes a mechanism for adjusting the generation costs of marginal fossil fuel technologies, with the aim of obtaining an equivalent reduction in the clearing price of the wholesale market until May 31, 2023.\n\nUnder this mechanism, the adjustment is based on the difference between a benchmark price for the gas consumed by thermal generation plants (\u20ac40/MWh for six months, subsequently increasing by \u20ac5/MWh per month, up to \u20ac70/ MWh) and the spot price of gas on the Spanish organized gas market (MIBGAS). This mechanism will be applicable to combined-cycle, coal and cogeneration plants not covered by any regulated remuneration framework. The amount of the adjustment will be distributed among the po/r\\_t.ligaion of Iberian demand that directly bene/fi.ligats, either because it buys energy at a price directly related to the wholesale market value or because it has signed or renewed a contract that already takes account of the bene/fi.ligacial e/ff.ligaect of the wholesale pricing mechanism. With regard to the la/t\\_t.ligaer aspect, the storage units, whether ba/t\\_t.ligaeries or pumping systems, as well as supply units for auxiliary generation services, are exempt from payment of the cost of the mechanism.\n\nThe entry into force of the mechanism was subject to the authorization  of  the  European  Commission,  which  was granted on June 8, 2022, following which the Ministry for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge approved Order TED/517/2022 of June 8, which established\n\nJune 14, 2022 as the sta/r\\_t.liga date for application of the mechanism (for the June 15 market day). In addition, this Royal Decree Law includes the following:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\na mandate has been established to introduce a reference to forward market prices, incorporating a price component  based  on  a  basket  of  products  (annual, qua/r\\_t.ligaerly and monthly) and a daily and intraday market price component, so that the new voluntary retail consumer price (PVPC) energy costing formula can begin to be applied in early 2023. Therefore, the Ministry began hearings on the drafting of a royal decree to modify the PVPC energy costing formula to incorporate a forward basket of products in addition to the daily and intraday market price component. Moreover, the cost of funding the Social Bonus by the operators of the reference market is incorporated in the PVPC. The draft royal decree also modi/fi.ligaes the scope of application of the PVPC, which  would  apply  to  residential  customer  and  micro-enterprises with a contractual capacity of no more than 10 kW. Finally, changes were made to the rules for non-peninsular territories;\n\nthe regime for the installation of renewable, cogeneration and waste facilities has been modi/fi.ligaed to reintroduce the adjustment mechanism for deviations from the market price and to incorporate a basket of prices in the price forecast, which will include both the daily market and forward benchmarks (annual, qua/r\\_t.ligaerly and monthly), with di/ff.ligaerent weights.\n\n## Royal Decree Law 17/2022 of September 20 adopting urgent measures in the /fi.ligaeld of energy, in application of the remuneration system for cogeneration plants and temporarily reducing the Value Added Tax (VAT) rate applicable to intra-EU delivery, impo/r\\_t.liga and acquisition of ce/r\\_t.ligaain fuels\n\nOn September 21, 2022, Royal Decree Law 17/2022 of September 20 was published, containing several urgent measures in the energy /fi.ligaeld, some of which were subsequently extended by Royal Decree Law 20/2022 of December 27. The measures adopted were as follows:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\noption for cogeneration plants to temporarily waive the regulated remuneration scheme in favor of the adjustment mechanism for production costs provided under Royal Decree Law 10/2022 of May 13;\n\ncreation  of  a  new  active  demand  response  service through auctions managed by the system operator;\n\ngreater /fl.ligaexibility in determining network transmission capacity, and streamlining and simplifying procedures for renewable energy projects;\n\nreduction in the VAT rate from 21% to 5% on supplies of natural gas, pellets, brique/t\\_t.ligaes, and /fi.ligarewood until December 31, 2023;\n\napplication of the entire surplus for 2021 to cover temporary  imbalances  and  transitory  deviations  between revenue and costs in the 2022 /fi.liganancial year.",

Consequently, the prices to be applied to regulated customers in the 2nd Half of 2019 were lowered to those applied in the 1st Half of 2019 (Decree 20T/2018) and were de/fi.liganed as 'stabilized prices for regulated customers' (PEC).\n\nBetween January 1, 2021 and the expiry of this mechanism, the prices to be applied will be those set every six months on the basis of A/r\\_t.ligaicle 158 of the Electricity Law and may not exceed the level of the PECs noted above adjusted for consumer price in/fl.ligaation.\n\nAny di/ff.ligaerences between the amount invoiced by applying the stabilization mechanism and the theoretical amount that could be invoiced considering the price that would have  been  applied  in  accordance  with  the  contractual terms and conditions agreed with the various electricity distribution companies will be accounted for as receivables for invoices to be issued to generation companies up to a maximum of $1,350 million until 2023. These di/ff.ligaerences will be recognized in US dollars and will not accrue interest until the end of 2025. Any imbalances in favor of the  generation  companies  must  be  recovered  no  later than December 31, 2027. It should be noted that the fund limit was reached in January 2022.\n\nOn August 2, 2022, the Ministry of Energy published Law 21.472, which establishes a rate stabilization fund and a new mechanism for the temporary stabilization of electricity prices for customers subject to rate regulation. This law establishes a Transitional Customer Protection Mechanism (TCPM) which will stabilize energy prices, complementing that provided for by Law 21.185, for customers subject to regulation of prices supplied by concession holders of the public distribution service governed by the General Law of Electricity Services. The purpose of the TCPM will be to pay the di/ff.ligaerences that occur between the invoicing of distribution companies to end customers for the energy and power component, and the amount that corresponds to the payment of the supply of electricity to generation companies.  The  resources  appropriated  for  the  operation of the TCPM cannot exceed $1,800 million and their availability will be extended until the balances originating from the application of the law are extinguished. Sta/r\\_t.ligaing from 2023, the National Energy Commission must project the total payment of the residual /fi.liganal account every six months for a date that cannot be later than December 31, 2032.\n\nArgentina\n\n## Rate revision - New resolutions\n\nThe Argentine generation sector is made up of companies that own power generation plants. The electricity generation companies sell the energy produced and their capacity on the market at a price established by the market regulator, CAMMESA, as is done for any subsequent rate adjustment or discounting.\n\nWith Resolution SE no. 826/2022, the Energy Secretariat approved two rate increases for generation companies for\n\n<!-- image -->",

A/r\\_t.ligaicle 37 of the law introduced an extraordinary retroactive tax on the windfall earnings on the gross revenue of generators pa/r\\_t.ligaicipating in the wholesale market (excluding RES under the FiT and FiP mechanisms). The measure aims to mitigate the impact of rising energy prices on consumers, /fi.liganancing discount in their electricity bills, and applies from October 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022 at a level of 90%. The exact method of calculation was introduced in October 2022 via ministerial decision. The regulatory authority estimates the impact on FEG to be \u20ac1.8 billion.\n\nMinisterial decision 70248/2434/2022, published on July 7, 2022, introduced a temporary energy market mechanism in response to the energy crisis. The new mechanism imposes a cap on generators' earnings, which varies by technology. The wholesale market is normally regulated to avoid disruptions in cross-border trading prices. The difference between the wholesale market price and the cap is paid into the Energy Transition Fund, which is used to subsidize consumers electricity bills. The cap for renewable energy generators operating in the wholesale market is set at \u20ac85/MWh (\u20ac112/MWh for hydroelectric power). The caps for companies generating electricity from lignite and natural gas will be calculated and announced monthly. The formula used to calculate the caps for these producers takes into account various parameters for covering electricity generation costs and enabling producers to earn a reasonable pro/fi.ligat. The mechanism entered into force in July 2022 and should be operational by July 2023.\n\nMinisterial decision 66576/5877/2022, published on July 7, 2022, determined the installed capacity from RES power plants that will be auctioned via a competitive procedure, the number of auctions to be held per year, the calendar for holding the auctions and other related ma/t\\_t.ligaers. The auction suppo/r\\_t.liga regime will remain in e/ff.ligaect until the end of 2024.\n\nMinisterial decision 84014/7123/2022, published on August  13,  2022,  established  the  priority  framework  for granting  binding  grid  connection  terms  for  RES  plants and storage provided by the grid manager and the system manager, including grid saturation areas. The priority clusters also include BESS+RES projects of FEGGH. This development is impo/r\\_t.ligaant because Enel Green Power Hellas has around 1.42 GW RES + 2.46 GW BESS (54 projects) in its pipeline (under joint development agreements).\n\nRomania\n\nThe  application  of  Emergency  Ordinance  no.  27/2022, containing measures applicable between April 1, 2022 and March 31, 2023 to end customers in the electricity and natural gas market, had an impact on Enel Green Power Romania's activities in 2022. GEG requires all electricity producers to pay a contribution to the Energy Transition Fund: the additional revenue generated by electricity producers as the di/ff.ligaerence between the average monthly net price on the sale of electricity and the benchmark price of RON 450/MWh (about \u20ac91/MWh) is taxed at 100% (for some months 80%). Only 5% of the cost of imbalances is taken into account, and for some months, the costs associated with /fi.liganancing contracts are not even included. Moreover,  since  December  2022  producers  that  trade electricity on the wholesale market are required to withhold and pay taxes to the Energy Transition Fund on revenue generated from residents/non-residents relating to long-term contracts for hedging market risk.\n\nGermany\n\nThe German government introduced a 90% tax on the revenue of producers of renewable energy, nuclear energy, and production from oil, waste and lignite above a ce/r\\_t.ligaain price (which varies based on technology), which began on December 1, 2022 and is expected to last until the end of June 2023, although it may be extended until April 30, 2024. The revenue raised from the tax will be used to /fi.liganance the price brakes on electricity, gas and heating prices that are at the hea/r\\_t.liga of a \u20ac200 billion package that Germany has adopted in response to high natural gas wholesale prices. RES plants receiving government suppo/r\\_t.liga will be taxed on revenue above the strike price plus a margin of \u20ac30/MWh and 10% of market revenue (in Germany, contracts for dif-",

Other RES plants will be taxed on revenue above \u20ac100/MWh plus a margin of \u20ac30/MWh and 10% of market revenue.\n\n## No/r\\_t.ligah America\n\nUnited States\n\n## Forced labor in the solar supply chain\n\nIn June 2021, US customs authorities responded to repo/r\\_t.ligas by issuing a 'Withhold Release Order' (WRO) on silicon-based products manufactured by the company Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. Ltd (Hoshine) and its subsidiaries, since they have been accused of exploiting their workforce. The WRO restricts the impo/r\\_t.liga into the United States of polysilicon products made by Hoshine Silicon Industry Co. Ltd.\n\nThe e/ff.ligaect on the US solar industry was the halt of shipments of photovoltaic modules by US customs, resulting in a delay in the delivery of solar equipment to end users, including Enel.\n\nAll photovoltaic equipment manufacturers had to produce clear documentation of their supply chain to meet US customs requirements. The documentation had to prove the speci/fi.ligac origin of metallurgical grade silicon in impo/r\\_t.ligaed photovoltaic products and demonstrate the absence of any Hoshine product in any pa/r\\_t.liga of the mining or manufacturing process.\n\nEnel's Code of Ethics and corporate procedures do not permit the exploitation of workers by any Group supplier or subcontractor. Neve/r\\_t.ligaheless, Enel is strengthening its controls, reviewing its supply chain and monitoring the implementation of the WRO by customs o/ffi.ligacials.\n\nIn a separate but connected development, in December 2021, President Biden signed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA). UFLPA requires US customs authorities to apply a presumption that goods 'mined, produced, or manufactured in whole or in pa/r\\_t.liga' in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region are made with forced labor and, therefore, are prohibited from being impo/r\\_t.ligaed into United States.\n\nGoods covered by this presumption shall not be allowed to enter unless the impo/r\\_t.ligaer proves that:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nit has fully complied with government guidelines and regulations;\n\nit has responded fully and substantially to all US customs inquiries; and\n\nit is determined 'with clear and convincing evidence' that the goods were not produced using forced labor.\n\nPolysilicon is one of the three industries on which application of the WRO is focused, and this focus extends to photovoltaic equipment that could contain raw materials mined in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.\n\nImplementation of the law will be guided by an administrative regulation process under way since February 2022, which is expected to be completed by June 2022.\n\nA key element of the UFLPA came into force on June 21, 2022: rebu/t\\_t.ligaable presumption. From now on, any impo/r\\_t.liga of goods mined, produced or manufactured in whole or in pa/r\\_t.liga in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XUAR), or from entities identi/fi.ligaed in a new UFLPA entity list, will be assumed to have been made with forced labor and will be barred from entering the United States. To prevent US customs from blocking the delivery of goods, impo/r\\_t.ligaers will need to demonstrate whether the goods to be impo/r\\_t.ligaed (or their components) were extracted, produced or manufactured in the XUAR and/or whether the goods to be impo/r\\_t.ligaed were purchased from a supplier identi/fi.ligaed in the UFLPA entity list.\n\nUFLPA compliance by impo/r\\_t.ligaers should ensure compliance with  the  current  Withhold  Release  Order  (WRO),  which blocks the impo/r\\_t.liga of any solar equipment containing metallurgical grade silicon manufactured by Hoshine.\n\nThe private nature of the blocked imposed by US customs makes it di/ffi.ligacult to monitor the application of the UFLPA. According to media repo/r\\_t.ligas, in June 2022 US customs blocked ce/r\\_t.ligaain impo/r\\_t.ligas of solar equipment into the United States under the UFLPA and required documentary evidence proving the origin of the qua/r\\_t.ligazite in the equipment supply chain.\n\n## US duties on impo/r\\_t.ligaed solar equipment\n\nIn February 2022, the Biden administration announced its decision to extend the duties applicable to impo/r\\_t.ligaed solar panels. The decision extends the collection of duties for another four years, while adopting a very marginal annual tari/ff.liga reduction: the duty on impo/r\\_t.ligaed solar panels will decline by 0.25% each year. It is impo/r\\_t.ligaant to note that the Biden administration's decision also con/fi.ligarms the tari/ff.liga exemption for bifacial solar modules, which are the main type of solar panels used by Enel for its utility-scale projects in the United States.\n\n## US duties on impo/r\\_t.ligaed Chinese products\n\nIn 2018, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) conducted  a  Section  301  investigation  and  found  that China's acts, policies and practices related to technology transfer, intellectual prope/r\\_t.ligay and innovation were unreasonable and discriminatory.",

To Enel, the list of greatest interest is that including Chinese components used for wind and solar projects and ba/t\\_t.ligaeries.\n\nIn September 2022, the USTR announced that it was seeking public comments regarding the e/ff.ligaectiveness of the Section 301 duties in order to understand the e/ff.ligaects of these on the economy and on US consumers in order to identify any other actions that could be taken.\n\nIt is not clear whether the USTR will use the comments to consider sta/r\\_t.ligaing a new exclusion process.\n\n## Federal loans and incentives for clean energy in the United States\n\nIn November 2021, President Biden signed the $1 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), also known as the bipa/r\\_t.ligaisan infrastructure law, unlocking funds for new spending on roads, bridges, aqueducts, broadband. The new law also contains provisions to boost the expansion of the country's electricity grid and suppo/r\\_t.liga existing and new clean energy technologies. It also contains provisions to suppo/r\\_t.liga existing nuclear power plants and hydroelectric plants, clean up orphaned wells and abandoned mining lands and facilitate access to critical minerals needed for clean energy production. Of potential interest to Enel, the following programs were announced in the 1st Half of 2022:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nclean hydrogen: the Depa/r\\_t.ligament of Energy (DOE) has received $8 billion to develop between 6 and 10 'Clean Hydrogen Hubs' in the United States. Each hub will consist of a network of clean hydrogen producers, potential consumers and connecting infrastructure located in  close  proximity.  The  DOE  is  receiving  applications, which must be completed and sent by April 2023. The programs selected for funding will be announced in the summer of 2023;\n\nthe National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program (NEVI) has made $5 billion in funding available over /fi.ligave years and distributed across all 50 states. The plan aims to promote the development of ba/t\\_t.ligaery-powered cars, ensuring that motorists always have somewhere to charge their vehicles.\n\nThe funding covers the cost of EV charging stations and the  related  infrastructure  (including  solar  power  and storage systems), as well as operation and maintenance costs for /fi.ligave years;\n\nelectric vehicle charging infrastructure: the US Depa/r\\_t.ligament of Energy (DOE) and the US Depa/r\\_t.ligament of Transpo/r\\_t.ligaation (DOT), acting through the Federal Highway Administration, have presented a plan to create a network of public electric vehicle chargers along interstate high-\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nways wo/r\\_t.ligah $5 billion. The money will be distributed over /fi.ligave years across all 50 states. The plan aims to promote the development of ba/t\\_t.ligaery-powered cars, ensuring that motorists always have somewhere to charge their vehicles. Separately, the DOT, acting through the Federal Transit Administration, has announced a plan to distribute $5.3 billion in grants to state and local transit agencies for the 'Low or No Emission Vehicle Program'. The 'Low or No Emission Vehicle Program' suppo/r\\_t.ligas transpo/r\\_t.liga agencies in purchasing or leasing low or no emission buses and other transpo/r\\_t.liga vehicles that use technologies such as electric ba/t\\_t.ligaeries;\n\nstrengthening the power grid and expanding transmission: this program of $2.5 billion in government subsidies over /fi.ligave years was introduced to strategically distribute publicly available EV charging infrastructure and other infrastructure to be located along alternative fuel corridors. At least 50% of this funding must be used for projects that expand access to EV recharging and alternative fuel infrastructures in rural areas and in low- and moderate-income communities with li/t\\_t.ligale private parking;\n\nelectric school buses: $5 billion over /fi.ligave years has been allocated to replace existing diesel-powered school buses with clean, zero-emission buses. Half of the funding will be spent on electric zero-emission buses, while the other half will be used on zero-emission buses powered with alternative fuels. Grants can cover up to 100% of the costs of replacing existing schools and installing charging and refueling stations. The IIJA will replace over 1,000 transpo/r\\_t.liga vehicles, including buses, with clean electric vehicles, thanks to an additional appropriation for the US DOT of $5.75 billion over the next /fi.ligave years, 5% of which will be dedicated to training the transpo/r\\_t.ligaation labor force on maintaining and managing the /fl.ligaeets.\n\n## In/fl.ligaation Reduction Act of 2022\n\nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the In/fl.ligaation Reduction Act (IRA), which sets aside $415 billion over the next 10 years in the form of grants, tax credits and investments to suppo/r\\_t.liga new clean energy technologies projects, renewable energy generation, the electri/fi.ligacation of transpo/r\\_t.liga systems and climate-sma/r\\_t.liga agriculture. It is expected that the measures will reduce carbon emissions by almost 40% in the United States by 2030 and will raise US GDP by\n\n- 0.2% in 2031. The funding will be distributed as follows: \u00b7 energy (to extend, and in some cases increase, tax cred-\n\nits; $263 billion);\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nclimate (to accelerate the reduction in emissions and suppo/r\\_t.liga low-income communities; $48 billion);\n\n- generation (to encourage the domestic production of solar panels, wind turbines and ba/t\\_t.ligaeries; $48 billion);\n\nenvironment (to create environmental quality incentives; $27 billion);",

The various tax credits will be phased down sta/r\\_t.ligaing the la/t\\_t.ligaer of:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nDecember 31, 2032; or\n\nthe year in which the US's greenhouse gas emissions from electricity generation will be 25% below 2022 emission levels.\n\nDepending on that status of the infrastructure to be built, tax credits may be available beyond 2032. The following are the IRA provisions that are of greatest interest to Enel.\n\nExtension and expansion of federal tax credits for clean energy: the IRA extends the production tax credit (PTC) ($26.5/MWh  for  projects  that  begin  construction  after December 31, 2021) and introduces a new technology-neutral clean electricity tax credit commencing in 2025. It also extends the investment tax credit (ITC) (30% for projects the begin construction after December 31, 2021) and launches a new technology-neutral clean electricity ITC beginning in 2025. Solar power developers may now request PTC instead of ITC. However, to be eligible for the full credit, projects must meet the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements for the entire period of construction (and perhaps also for some of the maintenance activities); project owners that fail to comply will have to pay a penalty or see their tax credit reduced to 20% ($5/MWh PTC or 6% ITC). The IRA also adds standalone energy storage projects, in line with the conditions for solar power, and microgrid controllers, speci/fi.ligacally for systems of between 4 kW and 20 MW, to the technology eligible for ITC.\n\nThe IRA creates a bonus tax credit if domestic content requirements or energy community requirements are met. Another new bonus tax credit is available for solar and wind facilities (and connected storage systems) located in low-income communities.\n\nA new 10-year clean hydrogen PTC of $3 per kilogram is available for hydrogen produced after December 31, 2022. For a project to be eligible, construction must begin before January 1, 2033.\n\nExtension and expansion of federal tax credits and loans for electric vehicles: in order to encourage the electri/fi.ligacation of the transpo/r\\_t.ligaation sector, the IRA extends various tax credits for new and previously owned electric vehicles and commercial electric vehicles, including buses, and expands the tax credit to cover the purchase of EV charging equipment.\n\nThe IRA allocates $1 billion for replacing heavy-duty Class 6 and 7 commercial vehicles with zero-emission vehicles (for example, school buses, public transpo/r\\_t.ligaation bus, garbage trucks) and $3 billion for the US Postal Service to purchase new electric delivery vehicles and charging stations.\n\nNew advanced manufacturing production tax credits: the IRA creates a new PTC for the production of components for wind, solar and ba/t\\_t.ligaery projects, such as solar PV cells, PV wafers, PV modules, wind turbines, nacelles, inve/r\\_t.ligaers, battery cells and modules, and many others. Tax credit amounts vary by component, production cost and ce/r\\_t.ligaain capacity factors. To be eligible, the component must be produced by the taxpayer in the United States. Credits are available on an annual basis for components sold beginning in 2023 until 2032 (gradually reduced sta/r\\_t.ligaing from 2030).\n\nNew direct payment of applicable tax credits and the transferability of some tax credits: the IRA creates the option for some sector operators to choose between direct pay or transferability of the tax credit, which means that we will see changes in the ways projects are developed and an expansion in the number of industries that develop projects. Enel is pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly interested in the direct pay option for new advanced PTC and for new clean hydrogen PTC.\n\n## Development of renewable energy on federal/public lands\n\nThe Biden administration set the goal of authorizing 25 GW of renewable energy on public lands by 2025. In order to reach this goal, the administration has ordered federal agencies to accelerate reviews of clean energy projects for production on public lands by establishing /fi.ligave new renewable energy coordination o/ffi.ligaces and has cuts rents and fees for solar and wind projects on public lands by more than 50%.\n\n## Domestic production of clean energy technologies\n\nOn June 2, 2022, President Biden issued presidential determinations giving the United States Depa/r\\_t.ligament of Energy (DOE) the authority to use the Defense Production Act (DPA) to accelerate domestic production of /fi.ligave key energy technologies:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nsolar;\n\ntransformers and electric grid components;\n\nheat pumps;\n\ninsulation;\n\nelectrolyzers, fuel cells and platinum group metals.\n\nThe DPA actions are pa/r\\_t.liga of the Biden administration's plan to reduce energy costs for households, strengthen national security and achieve lasting American energy independence that reduces demand for fossil fuels and suppo/r\\_t.ligas the development of renewable energy generation.",

Such information will include data on greenhouse gas emissions, ce/r\\_t.ligaain climate-related /fi.liganancial metrics, and material climate risk. The rules had been scheduled to be issued by the end of 2022, but the release date has been postponed.\n\n## Individual state policy actions\n\nCalifornia appropriates signi/fi.ligacant funds for clean energy initiatives: at the end of 2022, California had an almost $100 billion budget surplus and so allocated signi/fi.ligacant funding for various programs, including clean energy. Among these, it allocated a $550 million lump sum to suppo/r\\_t.liga distributed backup electricity assets for zero or low-emission resources to suppo/r\\_t.liga the grid when necessary, and a one-time $200 million appropriation for demand-side grid suppo/r\\_t.liga to reduce the load on the grid during periods of extreme stress.\n\nThe governor also allo/t\\_t.ligaed $10 billion over six years to accelerate the electri/fi.ligacation of the transpo/r\\_t.ligaation system.\n\nMaryland approves an impo/r\\_t.ligaant climate act: the Climate Solutions  Now  Act  came  into  force  in  June  2022.  The measure increases the State's target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 60% compared with 2006 levels by 2031, compared with the previous target of 40% by 2030. It also sets a deadline of 2045 for the achievement of net zero greenhouse gas emissions across the economy. The law creates a new standard of energy pe/r\\_f.ligaormance for buildings, which will have to repo/r\\_t.liga their emissions sta/r\\_t.ligaing from 2025. By 2030 buildings will have to reduce emissions by 20% compared with 2025 levels. The law allows the use of energy storage and upgrading of grid infrastructure as emission reduction measures, but only if it can be demonstrated that 'veri/fi.ligaable carbon reductions' will be achieved.\n\nMassachuse/t\\_t.ligas  introduces  zero-emission  vehicle  standards and energy storage initiative: Governor Charlie Baker signed a climate bill that requires that all new vehicles sold in the commonwealth be zero-emission vehicles as from 2035. The law also provides that the Depa/r\\_t.ligament of Public Utilities institute an incentives program for energy storage in order to achieve a 1,000 MWh energy storage target by December 31, 2025.\n\nNew York governor reaches budget agreement on electric buses: New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced a deal that includes a historic plan to fully electrify the state's school bus /fl.ligaeet. The plan calls for all new school bus purchases to be electric sta/r\\_t.ligaing in 2027 and for the state /fl.ligaeet to be electric by 2035. The state will provide aid to schools for  the  purchase  or  rental  of  electric  buses,  including charging infrastructure.\n\nCanada\n\n## Clean Fuel Standards\n\nCanada has released its standards for low-carbon fuels, the 'Clean Fuel Standards', after a signi/fi.ligacant delay prompted by the COVID crisis. This policy was announced a number of years ago and its rules have been /fi.liganalized for implementation in 2023. The Clean Fuel Standard (CFS) is central to the Canadian Government's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% compared with 2005 levels by 2030. The proposed regulation is also a key pa/r\\_t.liga of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nCFS requires suppliers of liquid fuels, such as gasoline, diesel and kerosene, to gradually reduce the amount of carbon in their products. Carbon intensity reduction targets will be set for each fuel, sta/r\\_t.ligaing in 2022 and increasing annually until 2030. Following entry into force in 2023, the regulation will require gasoline and diesel suppliers to meet increasingly stringent requirements to reduce the carbon intensity in the life cycle of their products. They will be able to do this both by reducing emissions from their production and re/fi.liganing processes, and by buying credits from producers of lower-emission fuel sources - which means that legislation should help suppo/r\\_t.liga emerging sectors such as biofuels and electric vehicle charging.\n\n## Recapitalization of funds for the reduction of carbon emissions\n\nDuring 2022, most of the funds earmarked for actions to reduce  carbon  emissions  were  appropriated.  These  include:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nLow Carbon Transit Operations Program: valued at $2.75 billion, it o/ff.ligaers suppo/r\\_t.liga to public transit and school bus operators  across  Canada  who  are  electrifying  their /fl.ligaeets.  The  Zero  Emission  Transit  Fund  maintains  the federal government's commitment to contribute to the purchase of 5,000 zero-emission buses over the next /fi.ligave years. This investment is being made in coordination with Canada Infrastructure Bank's commitment to invest $1.5 billion in zero-emission buses as pa/r\\_t.liga of its threeyear growth plan;\n\nZero  Emission  Vehicle  Infrastructure  Program  (ZEVIP): this is a $680 million initiative ending in 2027 and aimed at addressing the lack of charging and refueling stations in Canada, a major barrier to the adoption of zero-emission  vehicles,  by  increasing  the  availability  of  local charging and hydrogen refueling oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities. Funding will be provided through cost-sharing contribution agreements for eligible projects that will help meet the growing demand for recharging and refueling. This fund strengthens Canada's mandatory goal of making all new passenger cars and light trucks carbon neutral by 2035, accelerating the previous goal of 100% by 2040;",

The program will signi/fi.ligacantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions by encouraging the replacement of electricity generated from fossil fuels with renewable sources that can provide essential grid services, while suppo/r\\_t.ligaing Canada's smooth transition to an electri/fi.ligaed economy.\n\n## Launch of clean electricity standards\n\nIn March 2022, the government launched consultations to develop a Canadian standard for clean electricity, the Clean Electricity Standard (CES), and drive progress towards a zero-emission electricity grid by 2035. Expanding clean electricity will also be key to achieving the ambitious and achievable Canadian emissions reduction target of 40-45% compared with 2005 levels by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050. Canada already has one of the cleanest electricity grids in the world, with 82% of the electricity used coming from non-emi/t\\_t.ligaing sources.\n\nDeveloping a clean electricity standard is a collaborative process between the federal government, provinces, territories, indigenous groups, power companies, industry and Canadians in general. This inclusive approach suppo/r\\_t.ligas the competitiveness of the economy by providing a clear basis for provinces and territories to plan and operate their grids, while continuing to provide reliable electricity to Canadians and keeping costs for households and businesses a/ff.ligaordable.\n\n## Albe/r\\_t.ligaa Act on energy supply and storage\n\nThe Electricity Statutes Amendment Act, 2022, contains a package of aid for Albe/r\\_t.ligaa's electricity system to enable it to optimize and to implement public-scale energy storage systems.\n\nThe act integrates new technologies and innovations into Albe/r\\_t.ligaa's electricity system enabling energy storage, unlimited self-supply with expo/r\\_t.liga and help for the distribution system plan for electric vehicles, renewable power sources and other distributed energy resources. More speci/fi.ligacally, this legislation:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nincludes a formal de/fi.liganition for energy storage in Alberta's legislative and regulatory framework;\n\nallows distribution and transmission utilities to own and/ or operate energy storage assets under speci/fi.ligac conditions;\n\nallows competitive models to be used to procure distribution and transmission services from market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipants.\n\n## Africa, Asia and Oceania\n\nIndia\n\nOn December 5, 2022, the Deviation Se/t\\_t.ligalement Mechanism and Related Ma/t\\_t.ligaers Regulation (2022 DSM Regulation) entered into force. It was published by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) and will replace the 2014 DSM Regulation. The new regulation has a negative impact on Independent Power Producers (IPPs) with wind and solar plants. Basically, over-injection (i.e., injection into the grid in excess of the declared generation) will be compensated at the contractual rate for up to a 5% deviation and at 90% of the contractual rate for an over-injection of between 5% and 10%. No payment will be made for an over-injection of above 10%. The 2014 DSM Regulation instead provided that over-injection be remunerated based on a declining percentage of the contractual rate, ensuring higher revenue for producers. Over-injection up to 15% was remunerated at 100% of the contractual rate, between 15% and 25% at 90%, and so fo/r\\_t.ligah. The terms are also worse for under-injection (generation below that scheduled). A smaller range of deviation from the scheduled generation is tolerated and the penalties are greater than those in the 2014 version. In the case of under-injection up to 10%, the IPP must reimburse the purchaser according to the contractual rate without fu/r\\_t.ligaher penalty. If the under-injection exceeds 10%, the IPP must pay 10% of the average price on the day-ahead market, i.e., the clearing price, in addition to the costs associated with the deviation.\n\nThe new DSM Regulation has an impact on revenue owing to (i) no payment for over-injection above a 10% deviation, and (ii) higher deviation charges for under-injection.",

This period lasts eight years and is divided into two sub-periods of four years each (NPR1 for 2016-2019 and NPR2 for 2020-2023).\n\nWith regard to the NPR2 period, ARERA published Resolution no. 568/2019/R/eel, with which it updated rates for transmission, distribution and metering services in force in the 2020-2023 period, publishing the new integrated texts.\n\nThe method for determining the WACC for the period 2022-2027 was updated with Resolution no. 614/2021/R/ com, establishing a value of 5.2% for electricity distribution and metering. The regulation provides for an update of the value for 2025-2027, as well as the possibility of a fu/r\\_t.ligaher annual updating (in 2023 and 2024) should ce/r\\_t.ligaain /fi.liganancial indicators lead to a change in the WACC of at least 50 bps.\n\nAs for distribution and metering rates, ARERA approved the de/fi.liganitive reference rates for 2021, calculated by taking into account the updated balance sheet data for 2020 (Resolution no.153/2022/R/eel) and the provisional reference rates for 2022 on the basis of the preliminary balance sheet data for 2021 (Resolution no.193/2022/R/eel). The de/fi.liganitive reference rates for 2022 are expected to be published in 2023.\n\nWith  Resolution  no.  271/2021/R/com,  ARERA  initiated a procedure to introduce, from 2024, new methods for recognizing  the  costs  of  infrastructure  services,  called 'ROSS' (Adjustment for Expenditure and Service Objectives). In 2022, the corresponding consultation documents no. 317/2022/R/com and no. 655/2022/R/com were published.  ARERA,  with  its  Resolution  no.  527/2022/R/com, also initiated a procedure to introduce, from 2026, the 'full ROSS' version (based on analysis of the business plans drawn up by the companies and validated by ARERA).\n\nThroughout 2022, when making the qua/r\\_t.ligaerly updates, ARERA took the extraordinary step of canceling the general system charges for all types of customers and reinforcing the Social Bonus. The measures were made possible thanks to the resources allocated by the government to contain the e/ff.ligaects of price increases in the electricity sector. As pa/r\\_t.liga of these measures, the government also raised the ISEE (indicator of the equivalized economic) threshold for eligibility for Social Bonuses (for 2022 to \u20ac12 thousand;\n\nfor 2023 to \u20ac15 thousand). As a result, ARERA implemented the regulatory provisions scheduled for 2022 and is preparing the ones for 2023.\n\nIn 2022, ARERA completed the rate regulation for reactive energy, providing for the entry into force by April 1, 2023 of charges for reactive energy injected and an update of the charges for reactive energy withdrawn for distributors as well.\n\nAs  regards  service  quality,  ARERA,  with  Resolution  no. 646/2015/R/eel  as  amended,  established  output-based regulation for electricity distribution and metering services, including the principles for regulation for 2016-2023 (TIQE 2016-2023). With Resolution no. 566/2019/R/eel, ARERA completed the update of the TIQE for the 2020-2023 semi-period, proposing tools to bridge gaps in quality of service still existing between the various areas of the country, taking account of the time needed to implement interventions on the grid as well as the e/ff.ligaects of climate change. With Resolution no. 622/2022/R/eel, ARERA speci/fi.ligaed the bonuses and penalties connected with the output-based regulations for the electricity distribution service and innovative functions for 2021.\n\nWith Resolution no. 722/2022/R/eel, ARERA speci/fi.ligaed the bonuses for resilience interventions completed by e-distribuzione in 2021 eligible for the bonus-penalty mechanism envisaged under the provisions of Resolution no. 668/2019/R/eel, which introduced an incentive mechanism for investments to increase the resilience of distribution grids in terms of resistance to loads deriving from extreme weather events.\n\nWith regard to relations between distributors and traders, on January 1, 2021 the new version of the Electricity Transpo/r\\_t.liga Grid Code came into force with Resolution no. 261/2020/R/eel, which, due to the reduction in the time required to terminate transpo/r\\_t.liga contracts due to the default of sellers, reduced the credit exposure of distributors. Consequently, the value of guarantees that all sellers must give to distributors to cover the transpo/r\\_t.liga service provided was reduced (passing from a level of coverage ranging from 3 to 5 months of the trader's turnover to a new range between 2 and 4 months).\n\nWith Resolution no. 119/2022/R/EEL, ARERA introduced a single mechanism for distribution companies for the reimbursement of system general charges and network charges not collected by defaulting sellers in order to unify and streamline the pre-existing mechanisms.",

It establishes the TUR for natural gas to be applied as of January 1, 2023, and, taking account of the provisions of Royal Decree Law 17/2021 of September 14, provides for approximate increases of 7.7%, 9.0% and 9.5% respectively for TUR 1, TUR 2, and TUR 3.

This ministerial order sets the value of the remuneration for the years 2017 to 2019, taking into account the previous repo/r\\_t.ligas of the National Commission for Markets and Competition (CNMC).\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, on December 16, 2022, CNMC began preparing its proposed resolution se/t\\_t.ligaing the remuneration for 2020.\n\n## Europe\n\nRomania\n\nIn Romania, Distribution System Operators (DSOs) are required to purchase the power needed to cover grid losses from the wholesale market. ANRE will pay in advance a quota of the cost of such purchase, to be covered through the distribution tari/ff.ligas collected during the year. Within the context of the energy crisis, the costs of procuring energy have risen many times higher than amounts paid in advance, with serious consequences for the DSOs' /fi.liganancial position.\n\nIn 2022, the distribution rates were set by primary legislation through April 2023, independent of energy price developments on the wholesale market.\n\nIn September 2022, the authorities introduced, via primary legislation (followed by the corresponding secondary legislation), a capitalization mechanism for the additional\n\ncosts paid by the DSOs over the advance costs paid. The assets arising from this capitalization should be recovered over /fi.ligave years and compensation is equal to half the regulated rate of return applicable for the years analyzed. In addition, the authorities introduced a centralized acquisition mechanism, managed by the market operator (OPCOM), based on which producers sell electricity beyond that contracted to DSOs to cover grid losses, at a /fi.ligaxed price of RON 450/MWh (about \u20ac91/MWh), thereby reducing the /fi.liganancial pressure on the DSOs.\n\n## Latin America\n\nChile\n\n## Determination of 2020-2024 distribution rates\n\nOn December 23, 2022, with Resoluci\u00f3n Exenta no. 908, the National Energy Commission approved the technical repo/r\\_t.liga for the calculation of the components of the aggregate distribution value for the period 2020-2024.\n\nHowever, the process of determining rates for the period 2020-2024 is still ongoing. For the moment, rates continue to be applied in accordance with the methodology in force for the 2016-2020 period.\n\nArgentina\n\n## Rate revisions\n\nUntil the approval of a revision of the de/fi.liganitive integral rate is reached, the regulator ENRE is empowered to set temporary rate adjustments in order to guarantee stability in the provision of services.\n\nIn this context, during 2021, three changes to the rate framework were approved, of which two relating to the price of electricity to be applied to customers and one relating to the aggregate value of distribution. The la/t\\_t.ligaer resulted in a rate adjustment of 21.8% on April 30, 2021, which translated into a rate increase for /fi.liganal customers of approximately 9%. During 2022, another rate change was approved which led to a rate increase of 8% sta/r\\_t.ligaing from March 1, 2022, again pending the launch of a complete rate renegotiation process.\n\nBrazil\n\n## Rate revision for Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Cear\u00e1\n\nThe latest complete rate revisions approved for each Brazilian distribution company belonging to the Enel Group date back to 2018 (for Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Rio de Janeiro) and 2019 (for Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Cear\u00e1 and Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o S\u00e3o Paulo).

The law provides for gradual changes to the net metering system for new DG systems and ensures the application of current rules until 2045 for plants already in operation or which come into operation within the following 12 months.\n\nAdditionally, the law creates a transition period for new DG plants that connect to the grid between January 7, 2023 and July 7, 2023. After the transition period, consumers with DG will have to pay 100% of the network's transpo/r\\_t.liga costs (rate applied for the use of the distribution grid), net of the system bene/fi.ligats produced by the DG which must be calculated by the regulator in the 18 months following the publication of the law.\n\n## CIEN concession assigned to another operator\n\nIn December 2022, the concession for the CIEN Brazil-Argentina interconnection (Garabi I and Garabi II) was put out for tender following the expiry of the concession previously assigned to Enel.\n\nThe new operator TAESA will take over from March 31, 2023.\n\nThe new operator will therefore sign a new contract on March 31, 2023 and Enel will receive compensation relating to the values of the assets not yet depreciated equal to  \u20ac163.2  million  (/fi.ligagure  updated  to  August  2022).  The amount will in any case be updated at the e/ff.ligaective date of the compensation payment.\n\nColombia\n\nThe Energy and Gas Regulatory Commission (CREG) de/fi.liganes the method of remuneration of the distribution grid. The distribution rates are determined every /fi.ligave years and\n\nare updated monthly on the basis of the Producer Price Index (IPP).\n\n## Rate revisions\n\nWith Resolution no. 122 of 2020, CREG set the distribution rates for Codensa for the period 2018-2023.\n\nIn September 2022, following a national debate on high energy prices, CREG issued Resolutions nos. CREG 101027, 101-028, 101-029 and 101-031, which contain measures aimed at: (i) mitigating the high impact that in/fl.ligaation indices exe/r\\_t.liga on the transmission and distribution components of the electricity deriving from the rate; (ii) establish an optimization of the sta/r\\_t.ligaup and shutdown costs of thermal plants, in order to reduce the cost of the constraints; (iii) open a voluntary mechanism for sellers serving end users, sellers and producers to conduct negotiations to renegotiate the prices, durations and ratios of bilateral electricity contracts; and (iv) establish a mechanism that enables sales companies to defer payments to be made on the wholesale market to transmi/t\\_t.ligaers and grid operators.\n\nIn December 2022, the Communications Regulation Commission (CRC) published the Regulatory Agenda for the period 2023-2024, which contains 26 initiatives (comprising regulatory projects, activities and studies), structured around /fi.ligave strategic pillars: (i) welfare and consumer and public rights; (ii) markets and competition; (iii) innovation and  regulatory  improvement;  (iv)  value  group  management; and (v) institutional strengthening.\n\nPeru\n\nIn  Peru,  the  process  for  determining  distribution  rates takes place every four years and is referred to as the 'Distribution Value Added Fixing' (ADVD). Exceptionally, the last tari/ff.liga cycle set a duration of /fi.ligave years. Therefore, in 2018 the process of determining the ADVD for the period 20182022 was completed. The procedure for the period 20222026 is currently underway.\n\nIt should be noted that Peruvian legislation follows the regulatory scheme of the Model Company, whereby in each rate process the investment and operating and maintenance costs necessary to meet demand in the concession area are established, which will be recognized by each distribution company in accordance with the parameters and criteria de/fi.liganed by Osinergmin. The ADVD is determined individually  for  each  distributor  with  more  than  50,000 customers.",

With Resolution no. 491/2020/R/eel, ARERA established a last reso/r\\_t.liga service ('gradual safeguards service') for small businesses without a supplier, to be assigned by auction on a territorial basis for a period of three years. A ceiling of 35% was set for the market share that can be assigned to each supplier.\n\nIn March 2021, Enel Energia and Servizio Ele/t\\_t.ligarico Nazionale (together with Enel Italia) appealed the ministerial decree before the Lazio Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga, contesting the imposition of the antitrust cap at 35% and the lack of provisions (e.g., a social clause) for the reimbursement of the residual costs of Servizio Ele/t\\_t.ligarico Nazionale following the loss of customers. With regard to the la/t\\_t.ligaer point, in March 2021, Servizio Ele/t\\_t.ligarico Nazionale and Enel Italia also challenged Resolution no. 491/2020/R/eel with an appeal before the Lombardy Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga. At the moment, no hearing has yet been set for these appeals.\n\nWith Resolution no. 208/2022/R/eel (as amended) ARERA established another last reso/r\\_t.liga service ('gradual safeguards service')  for  supplying  micro-enterprises  and  non-residential customers with installed capacity of less than 15\n\nkW that did not opt for a free-market contract, sta/r\\_t.ligaing as of April 1, 2023 (due to the technical extension under Resolution no. 586/2022/R/eel). The gradual safeguards service for micro-enterprises is to be provided for a period of four years by operators that serve their local areas and that are chosen through a tender held by the Single Buyer open to all operators that meet ce/r\\_t.ligaain technical and /fi.liganancial requirements. At the end of the four years, the customer will continue to be served by the same operator under free market terms and conditions, unless the customer enters into a contract with another operator.\n\nAs with the measures governing the elimination of price protections for small business, Enel Energia and Servizio Ele/t\\_t.ligarico Nazionale appealed Resolution no. 208/2022/R/eel, applicable  for  micro-enterprises,  before  the  Lombardy Regional  Administrative  Cou/r\\_t.liga  in  July  2022,  challenging the imposition of the antitrust cap at 35% and the lack of provisions (e.g., a social clause) for the reimbursement of the residual costs of Servizio Ele/t\\_t.ligarico Nazionale following the loss of customers as a result of the e/ff.ligaects of the resolution. In October 2022, the companies also appealed before the Lazio Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga the MiTE decree se/t\\_t.ligaing out how the gradual safeguards service for micro-enterprises is to be implemented, basing their challenges on the same grounds.\n\nWith ruling no. 18/2021, the Lombardy Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga granted the appeals /fi.ligaled by Servizio Elettrico Nazionale and Enel Energia, voiding Resolution no. 279/2017/R/com. The resolution had established an incentive mechanism to increase the use of electronic invoices with customers on the regulated markets and made the compensation for the seller of the di/ff.ligaerential between the discount granted to customers and the avoided cost conditional upon reaching ce/r\\_t.ligaain thresholds. With Resolution no. 477/2021/R/com, ARERA consequently also amended, with e/ff.ligaect from 2022, the rules governing the recovery of amounts relating to previous years.\n\n## Electricity\n\nWith Resolution no. 402/2021/R/eel, the update for 2022 of the rate component covering the marketing costs of the operators of the enhanced protection service (RCV) and the levels of the fee for covering electricity marketing costs (PCV) was postponed to March 2022 (the RCV and PCV fees set by Resolution no. 604/2020/R/eel remained in e/ff.ligaect for the 1st Qua/r\\_t.ligaer).\n\nWith Resolution no. 146/2022/R/eel ARERA updated, with e/ff.ligaect from April 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023, the RCV component, at the same time adjusting the values in order to take account of the e/ff.ligaects of the delay in the update from",

Free-market operators were also given the oppo/r\\_t.ligaunity, under the measures, to se/t\\_t.ligale their corresponding debt position by January 2023 so as to not to have an impact on their cash positions at the end of 2022.\n\nWith regard to reimbursement mechanisms for end users in arrears in the electricity sector, in A/r\\_t.ligaicle 18 of the TIV (Integrated Sales Code) ARERA governs the compensation mechanism for the amounts not collected by operators of the enhanced protection service in respect of fraudulent withdrawals of power.\n\nWith Resolution no. 32/2021/R/eel, ARERA established a mechanism to reimburse arrears relating to the general system charges paid by the sales companies on the free and safeguard markets to distribution companies but not collected from end users (for the safeguard market, this only applies to customers that can be disconnected). For customers who cannot be disconnected on the safeguard market, the mechanism for reimbursing non-recoverable charges is governed by A/r\\_t.ligaicle 44 of the Integrated Sales Code (TIV).\n\n## Gas\n\nWith Resolution no. 603/2020/R/gas, the levels of the QVD component were updated for 2021, and subsequently delayed, with Resolution no. 401/2021/R/gas and notwithstanding the provisions of A/r\\_t.ligaicle 7.2 of the 7.2 del TIVG (Integrated Gas Sales Code), until March 31, 2022.\n\nThe QVD component was updated, sta/r\\_t.ligaing from April 1, 2022, with Resolution no. 147/2022/R/gas. Its speci/fi.ligacation took account of the e/ff.ligaects of the delay in the update from January 1, 2022. ARERA has also established that any updates that become necessary shall be made by March 2023.\n\nWith regard to reimbursement mechanisms for end users in arrears in the gas sector, in A/r\\_t.ligaicles 31quinquies and 37.1 le/t\\_t.ligaer b) of the Integrated Gas Sales Code (TIVG), ARERA regulates speci/fi.ligac mechanisms for the reimbursement of arrears for providers of the last reso/r\\_t.liga service and the default service on distribution grids.\n\n## Antitrust proceeding PS12461 - Modi/fi.ligacation of price conditions\n\nOn December 13, 2022, the Competition Authority noti/fi.ligaed Enel Energia SpA and six other companies (Hera, A2A, Acea, Eni Plenitude, Engie, Edison) that it had initiated a proceeding  for  unfair  commercial  practices,  contesting the violation of ce/r\\_t.ligaain provisions of the Consumer Code and A/r\\_t.ligaicle 3 of Decree Law 115 of August 9, 2022 (the so-called 'second Aid Decree') of August 10, 2022, rati/fi.ligaed with Law 142 of September 21, 2022. The decree law suspends, from August 10, 2022 to April 30, 2023 (subsequently extended to June 30, 2023 by the Milleproroghe Decree Law 198/2022), the e/ff.ligaectiveness of both contractual clauses that allow distribution companies to change the supply price and related noti/fi.ligacations, unless the price changes had already been made before the decree entered into force (August 10, 2022). With the notice of the sta/r\\_t.liga of the proceeding, the Competition Authority also prohibited the sending of new notices of price changes and ordered the correction of those already sent.\n\nWith an order of December 22, 2022, issued as pa/r\\_t.liga of the appeal /fi.ligaled by Iren, the Council of State distinguished contractual renewals (of expiring o/ff.ligaers) from those covered by ius variandi and excluded the applicability of A/r\\_t.ligaicle 3 of the decree law. This principle was also recognized by the government, which, with the Milleproroghe Decree of December 29, 2022, established that A/r\\_t.ligaicle 3 of the second Aid Decree shall not apply to the contractual clauses that allow an electricity and natural gas supply company to update the contractual /fi.liganancial conditions upon expiry of the same, in compliance with the contractual terms of notice and without prejudice to the right of withdrawal of the counterpa/r\\_t.ligay. On December 30, 2022, following the pronouncement of the Council of State and the aforementioned clarifying legislative intervention, the Competition Authority noti/fi.ligaed Enel Energia of a precautionary measure pa/r\\_t.ligaial upholding that issued at the sta/r\\_t.liga of the proceeding, calling upon it - for contracts for which the expiry of the /fi.liganancial conditions was not speci/fi.ligaed or was otherwise not determinable - to suspend renewals of the /fi.liganancial condi-",

It can satisfy the rest of its obligation by submi/t\\_t.ligaing energy e/ffi.ligaciency ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates (EEC).\n\n## Consumer protection measures: Social Bonus\n\nOn  March  30,  2022,  Royal  Decree  Law  6/2022  of  29 March, adopting urgent measures within the framework of the National Response Plan for the economic and social consequences of the war in Ukraine, was published in Spain's O/ffi.ligacial Journal. Speci/fi.ligacally, in the energy sector, this royal decree law includes several measures, some of which were extended until December 31, 2022 by Royal Decree Law 11/2022 of 25 June, and until December 31, 2023 by Royal Decree Law 18/2022 of October 18 and by Royal Decree Law 20/2022 of December 17. The primary measures regarding the Social Bonus are as follows:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nthe increase in the discounts of the electricity social bonus from 25% to 60% for vulnerable consumers, and from 40% to 70% for severely vulnerable consumers was extended until December 31, 2022;\n\nother aspects of the eligibility criteria of the Social Bonus were also modi/fi.ligaed. Speci/fi.ligacally, the Social Bonus is automatically renewed every two years. Likewise, there are new criteria for de/fi.liganing the category of vulnera-\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nble consumer, now based on the concept of cohabitation unit, formed by those people that live in the same home  as  a  married  couple,  cohabiting  pa/r\\_t.liganership, second degree of consanguinity, a/ffi.liganity, adoption or a similar relationship. The basic threshold is 1.5 times the Public Index of Multiple Purpose Income (IPREM), divided into 14 payments, and will increase by 0.3 for each additional adult member and by 0.5 for each minor forming the cohabitation unit. Those receiving the minimum  subsistence  income  will  also  form  pa/r\\_t.liga  of the group of recipients of the Social Bonus. The above thresholds will be increased by 1 in ce/r\\_t.ligaain cases (signi/fi.ligacant dependence, gender violence, terrorism, etc.), and they will be reduced by 50% for severely vulnerable consumers;\n\na loan of \u20ac75 million was granted in the 2022 General State Budget (GSB) to /fi.liganance the increased coverage of the thermal social bonus;\n\nit establishes a new mechanism for /fi.liganancing the Social Bonus. In accordance with this new mechanism, the Social Bonus will be covered by all players in the electricity  market  (generation,  transmission,  distribution and suppliers, and by direct consumers), in line with the tax-free aggregated billings of each activity, based on which a unitary contribution value will be set for each activity. If the degree of coverage of contributions is 20% lower than the real /fi.liganancing needs, the National Commission for Markets and Competition (CNMC) will propose  new  contribution  values.  Royal  Decree  Law 6/2022 of 29 March 2022, temporarily set those unitary contribution values, until CNMC proposed the de/fi.liganitive unitary values for 2022, which were approved by Order TED/733/2022 of July 22. Finally, it establishes that the amounts that were paid by the reference suppliers, and recognized in a ruling, to /fi.liganance the Social Bonus, will be assumed by the new taxpayers. On December 29, 2022, work began on drawing up the proposed unitary values for /fi.liganancing the Social Bonus for 2023.\n\nOn 19 October 2022, Royal Decree Law 18/2022 of October 18 was published, approving measures to reinforce the protection of energy consumers and to contribute to reducing natural gas consumption in application of the 'Plan +Security for your energy (+SE)', as well as measures on the remuneration of public sector workers and to protect seasonal agricultural workers a/ff.ligaected by the drought, which establishes the following measures relating to the Social Bonus:\n\n\u00b7\n\nthe discounts for recipients have been increased until December 31, 2023, from 60% to 65% in the case of vulnerable consumers, and from 70% to 80% for severely vulnerable consumers.

Form and content of the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements\n\nEnel SpA has its registered o/ffi.ligace in Viale Regina Margherita 137, Rome, Italy, and since 1999 has been listed on the Milan stock exchange.\n\nThere were no changes in the company name in 2022. Enel is an energy multinational and is one of the world's leading integrated operators in the electricity and gas industries, with a special focus on Europe and Latin America. The consolidated /fi.liganancial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2022 comprise the /fi.liganancial statements of Enel SpA, its subsidiaries and Group holdings in associates and joint ventures, as well as the Group's share of the assets, liabilities, costs and revenue of joint operations ('the Group').\n\nA list of the subsidiaries, associates, joint operations and joint ventures included in the consolidation scope is attached.\n\nThese  consolidated  /fi.liganancial  statements  were  approved and authorized for publication by the Board of Directors on March 16, 2023.\n\nThese consolidated /fi.liganancial statements have been audited by KPMG SpA.\n\n## Basis of presentation\n\nThe consolidated /fi.liganancial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2022 have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards (International Accounting Standards - IAS and International Financial Repo/r\\_t.ligaing Standards - IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), the interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Commi/t\\_t.ligaee (IFRSIC) and the Standing Interpretations Commi/t\\_t.ligaee (SIC), recognized in the European Union pursuant to Regulation (EC) no. 1606/2002 and in e/ff.ligaect as of the close of the year. All of these standards and interpretations are hereinafter referred to as the 'IFRS-EU'. The consolidated /fi.liganancial statements have also been prepared in conformity with measures issued in implementation of A/r\\_t.ligaicle 9, paragraph 3, of Legislative Decree 38 of\n\nFebruary 28, 2005.\n\nThe consolidated /fi.liganancial statements consist of the con-\n\nsolidated income statement, the statement of consolidated comprehensive income, the statement of consolidated /fi.liganancial position, the statement of changes in consolidated equity and the consolidated statement of cash /fl.ligaows and the related notes.\n\nThe assets and liabilities recognized in the statement of /fi.liganancial position are classi/fi.ligaed on a 'current/non-current basis', with separate repo/r\\_t.ligaing of assets held for sale and liabilities included in disposal groups held for sale. Current assets, which include cash and cash equivalents, are assets that are intended to be realized, sold or consumed during the normal operating cycle of the Group; current liabilities are liabilities that are expected to be se/t\\_t.ligaled during the normal operating cycle of the Group.\n\nThe income statement classi/fi.ligaes costs on the basis of their nature, with separate repo/r\\_t.ligaing of pro/fi.ligat/(loss) from continuing operations and pro/fi.ligat/(loss) from discontinued operations a/t\\_t.ligaributable to owners of the Parent and to non-controlling interests.\n\nThe consolidated cash /fl.ligaow statement is prepared using the indirect method, with separate repo/r\\_t.ligaing of any cash /fl.ligaows by operating, investing and /fi.liganancing activities associated with discontinued operations.\n\nNote that the items repo/r\\_t.ligaed in the cash /fl.ligaow statement also include any impacts deriving from companies classi/fi.ligaed as discontinued operations.

Accounting policies\n\n## 2.1 Use of estimates and management judgment\n\nPreparing the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements under IFRS-EU requires management to take decisions and make estimates and assumptions that may impact the carrying amount of revenue, costs, assets and liabilities and the related disclosures concerning the items involved as well as contingent assets and liabilities at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date. The estimates and management's judgments are based on previous experience and other factors considered reasonable in the circumstances. They are formulated when the carrying amount of assets and liabilities is not easily determined from other sources. The actual results may therefore di/ff.ligaer from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions are periodically revised and the e/ff.ligaects of any changes are re/fl.ligaected through pro/fi.ligat or loss if they only involve that period. If the revision involves both the current and future periods, the change is recognized in the period in which the revision is made and in the related future periods.\n\nIn order to enhance understanding of the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements, the following sections examine the main items a/ff.ligaected by the use of estimates and the cases that re/fl.ligaect management judgments to a signi/fi.ligacant degree, underscoring the main assumptions used by management in measuring these items in compliance with the IFRS-EU. The critical element of such valuations is the use of assumptions and professional judgments concerning issues that are by their very nature unce/r\\_t.ligaain.\n\nChanges  in  the  conditions  underlying  the  assumptions and judgments could have a substantial impact on future results.\n\nThe  information  included  in  the  consolidated  /fi.liganancial statements is selected on the basis of a materiality analysis\n\nto each individual item, and of non-current assets and disposal groups classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale, which are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\n\nThe  consolidated  /fi.liganancial  statements  are  presented  in euro, the functional currency of the Parent Enel SpA. All /fi.ligagures are shown in millions of euro unless stated otherwise.\n\nThe consolidated income statement, the statement of /fi.liganancial position and the consolidated statement of cash /fl.ligaows repo/r\\_t.liga transactions with related pa/r\\_t.ligaies, the de/fi.liganition of which is given in note 2.2 'Signi/fi.ligacant accounting policies'.\n\nThe consolidated /fi.liganancial statements provide comparative information in respect of the previous year.\n\ncarried out in accordance with the requirements of Practice Statement 2 'Making Materiality Judgments', issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nWith regard to the e/ff.ligaects of climate change issues, the Group believes that climate change represents an implicit element in the application of the methodologies and models used to pe/r\\_f.ligaorm estimates in the valuation and/or measurement of ce/r\\_t.ligaain accounting items. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, the Group has also taken account of the impact of climate change in the signi/fi.ligacant judgments made by management. In this regard, the main items included in the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements at December 31, 2022 a/ff.ligaected by management's use of estimates and judgments refer to the impairment of non-/fi.liganancial assets and obligations connected with the energy transition, including those for decommissioning and site restoration of ce/r\\_t.ligaain generation plants. For fu/r\\_t.ligaher details on these items, see note 19 'Prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment', note 24 'Goodwill', and note 40 'Provisions for risks and charges'.\n\nUse of estimates\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nRevenue from supply of electricity and gas to end users is recognized at the time the electricity or gas is delivered and includes, in addition to amounts invoiced on the basis of periodic (and pe/r\\_t.ligaaining to the year) meter readings or on the volumes noti/fi.ligaed by distributors and transpo/r\\_t.ligaers, an estimate of the electricity and gas delivered during the period but not yet invoiced that is equal to the di/ff.ligaerence between the amount of electricity and gas delivered to the distribution network and that invoiced in the period, taking account of any network losses. Revenue between the date of the last meter reading and the year-end is based on estimates of",

        "page_content": "the daily consumption of individual customers, primarily determined on their historical information, adjusted to re/fl.ligaect the climate factors or other ma/t\\_t.ligaers that may a/ff.ligaect the estimated consumption.\n\nFor more details on such revenue, see note 11.a 'Revenue from sales and services'.\n\n## Impairment of non-/fi.liganancial assets\n\nWhen the carrying amount of prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment, investment prope/r\\_t.ligay, intangible assets, right-of-use assets, goodwill and investments in associates/joint ventures exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use, the assets are impaired.\n\nSuch impairments are carried out in accordance with the provisions of IAS 36, as described in greater detail in note 24 'Goodwill'.\n\nIn order to determine the recoverable amount, the Group generally adopts the value in use criterion. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash /fl.ligaows generated by the asset, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re/fl.ligaects the current market assessment of the time value of money and of the speci/fi.ligac risks of the asset.\n\nFuture cash /fl.ligaows used to determine value in use are based on the most recent Business Plan, approved by the management, containing forecasts for volumes, revenue, operating costs and investments. These projections cover the next three years. For subsequent years, account is taken of:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nassumptions  concerning  the  long-term  evolution  of the main variables considered in the calculation of cash /fl.ligaows, as well as the average residual useful life of the assets or the duration of the concessions, based on the speci/fi.ligac characteristics of the businesses;\n\na long-term growth rate equal to the long-term growth of electricity demand and/or in/fl.ligaation (depending on the country and business) that does not in any case exceed the average long-term growth rate of the market involved.\n\nThe recoverable amount is sensitive to the estimates and assumptions used in the calculation of cash /fl.ligaows and the discount rates applied. Neve/r\\_t.ligaheless, possible changes in the underlying assumptions on which the calculation of such amounts is based could generate di/ff.ligaerent recoverable amounts. The analysis of each group of non-/fi.liganancial assets is unique and requires management to use estimates and assumptions considered prudent and reasonable in the speci/fi.ligac circumstances.\n\nIn line with its business model and in the context of the acceleration of the decarbonization of the generation mix and driving the energy transition process, the Group has also  carefully  assessed  whether  climate  change  issues have a/ff.ligaected the reasonable and suppo/r\\_t.ligaable assumption used to estimated expected cash /fl.ligaows. In this regard,\n\nwhere necessary, the Group has also taken account of the long-term impact of climate change, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular by considering in the estimation of the terminal value a long-term growth rate in line with the change in electricity demand determined using energy models for each country.\n\nInformation on the main assumptions used to estimate the recoverable amount of assets with reference to the impacts relating to climate change, as well as information on changes in these assumptions, is provided in note 24 'Goodwill'.\n\n## Expected credit losses on /fi.liganancial assets\n\nAt the end of each repo/r\\_t.ligaing period, the Group recognizes a loss allowance for expected credit losses on trade receivables and other /fi.liganancial assets measured at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost, debt instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, contract assets and all other assets in scope.\n\nLoss allowances for /fi.liganancial assets are based on assumptions about risk of default and on the measurement of expected credit losses. Management uses judgment in making these assumptions and selecting the inputs for the impairment calculation, based on the Group's past experience, current market conditions as well as forward-looking estimates at the end of each repo/r\\_t.ligaing period.\n\nThe expected credit loss (i.e., ECL) - determined considering probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD) - is the di/ff.ligaerence between all contractual cash /fl.ligaows that are due in accordance with the contract and all cash /fl.ligaows that are expected to be received (including all sho/r\\_t.ligafalls) discounted at the original e/ff.ligaective interest rate (EIR).\n\nIn  pa/r\\_t.ligaicular,  for  trade  receivables,  contract  assets  and lease  receivables,  including  those  with  a  signi/fi.ligacant  /fi.liganancial component, the Group applies the simpli/fi.ligaed approach, determining expected credit losses over a period corresponding  to  the  entire  life  of  the  asset,  generally equal to 12 months.\n\nBased on the speci/fi.ligac reference market and the regulatory context of the sector, as well as expectations of recovery after 90 days, for such assets, the Group mainly applies a default de/fi.liganition of 180 days past due to determine expected credit losses, as this is considered an e/ff.ligaective indication of a signi/fi.ligacant increase in credit risk. Accordingly, /fi.liganancial assets that are more than 90 days past due are generally not considered to be in default, except for some speci/fi.ligac regulated markets.\n\nFor trade receivables and contract assets the Group mainly applies a collective approach based on grouping trade receivables and contract assets into speci/fi.ligac clusters, taking into account the speci/fi.ligac regulatory and business context. Only if the trade receivables are deemed to be individually signi/fi.ligacant by management and there is speci/fi.ligac information about any signi/fi.ligacant increase in credit risk, does the Group apply an analytical approach.",

        "page_content": "In case of individual assessment, PD is mainly obtained from an external provider.\n\nConversely, for collective assessment, trade receivables are grouped based on shared credit risk characteristics and past due information, considering a speci/fi.ligac de/fi.liganition of default.\n\nBased on each business and local regulatory framework as well as di/ff.ligaerences in customer po/r\\_t.ligafolios also in terms of risk, default rates and recovery expectations, speci/fi.ligac clusters are de/fi.liganed.\n\nThe contract assets are considered to have substantially the same risk characteristics as the trade receivables for the same types of contracts.\n\nIn order to measure the ECL for trade receivables on a collective basis, as well as for contract assets, the Group considers the following assumptions related to ECL parameters:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nPD, assumed as to be the average default rate, is calculated on a cluster basis and taking into consideration minimum 24-month historical data;\n\nLGD is function of the default bucket's recovery rates, discounted at the EIR; and\n\nEAD is estimated as the carrying exposure at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date net of cash deposits, including invoices issued but not expired and invoices to be issued.\n\nBased  on  speci/fi.ligac  management  evaluations,  the  forward-looking  adjustment  can  be  applied  considering qualitative and quantitative information in order to re/fl.ligaect possible  future  events  and  macroeconomic  scenarios, which may a/ff.ligaect the risk of the po/r\\_t.ligafolio or the /fi.liganancial instrument.\n\nFor additional details on the key assumptions and inputs used please see note 48 'Financial instruments by category'.\n\n## Depreciable amount of ce/r\\_t.ligaain elements of Italian hydroelectric plants subsequent to enactment of Law 134/2012\n\nItalian  regulations  governing  large-scale  hydroelectric concessions were signi/fi.ligacantly modi/fi.ligaed by the 'Simpli/fi.ligacations Decree' (Decree Law 135 of 2018 rati/fi.ligaed with Law 12 of February 11, 2019). The regulations introduce a number of innovations which, if applied to existing concessions, would require a review of the useful lives of certain investments in hydroelectric plants in order to re/fl.ligaect the possibility that, at the end of the concession, some assets could be transferred free of charge to the new concession holder. However, in estimating the useful lives of these plants, management, with the suppo/r\\_t.liga of a legal opinion, considered the foreseeable outcome of the appeals promptly lodged by the Company - and others - and the related constitutionality issues, which have also been\n\nraised by industrial associations. Consequently, we believe that the legislation raises serious constitutionality issues that will be e/ff.ligaectively recognized in the appropriate fora. Accordingly, management deemed it appropriate not to re/fl.ligaect  the  changes  introduced  by  the  regulations  and therefore has continued to measure the useful lives of the plants as has been done in previous years under the previous regulatory system, considering this to be the most realistic estimate.\n\nLaw 134 of August 7, 2012 containing 'urgent measures for growth' (published in the Gazze/t\\_t.ligaa U/ffi.ligaciale of August 11, 2012), introduced a sweeping overhaul of the rules governing hydroelectric concessions. Among its various provisions, the law establishes that /fi.ligave years before the expiration of a major hydroelectric water diversion concession and in cases of lapse, relinquishment or revocation, where there is no prevailing public interest for a di/ff.ligaerent use of the water, incompatible with its use for hydroelectric generation, the competent public entity shall organize a public call for tenders for the award for consideration of the concession for a period ranging from 20 to a maximum of 30 years.\n\nIn order to ensure operational continuity, the law also governs the methods of transferring ownership of the business unit necessary to operate the concession, including all legal relationships relating to the concession, from the outgoing concession holder to the new concession holder, in exchange for payment of a price to be determined in negotiations between the depa/r\\_t.ligaing concession holder and the grantor agency, taking due account of the following elements:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nfor intake and governing works, penstocks and out/fl.ligaow channels, which under the consolidated law governing waters and electrical plants are to be relinquished free of charge (A/r\\_t.ligaicle 25 of Royal Decree 1775 of December 11, 1933), the revalued cost less government capital grants, also revalued, received by the concession holder for the construction of such works, depreciated for ordinary wear and tear;\n\nfor other prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment, the market value, meaning replacement value, reduced by estimated depreciation for ordinary wear and tear.\n\nWhile acknowledging that the new regulations introduce impo/r\\_t.ligaant changes as to the transfer of ownership of the business unit with regard to the operation of the hydroelectric  concession,  the  practical  application  of  these principles faces di/ffi.ligaculties, given the unce/r\\_t.ligaainties that do not permit the formulation of a reliable estimate of the value that can be recovered at the end of existing concessions (residual value).\n\nAccordingly, management has decided it could not produce a reasonable and reliable estimate of residual value. The fact that the legislation requires the new concession holder to make a payment to the depa/r\\_t.ligaing concession",

If additional information becomes available to enable the calculation of residual value, the carrying amounts of the assets involved will be adjusted prospectively.\n\n## Determining the fair value of /fi.liganancial instruments\n\nThe fair value of /fi.liganancial instruments is determined on the basis of prices directly observable in the market, where available, or, for unlisted /fi.liganancial instruments, using speci/fi.ligac valuation techniques (mainly based on present value) that maximize the use of observable market inputs. In rare circumstances where this is not possible, the inputs are estimated by management taking due account of the characteristics of the instruments being measured.\n\nFor more information on /fi.liganancial instruments measured at fair value, please see note 52 'Assets and liabilities measured at fair value'.\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 13, the Group includes a measurement of credit risk, both of the counterpa/r\\_t.ligay (Credit Valuation Adjustment or CVA) and its own (Debit Valuation Adjustment or DVA), in order to adjust the fair value of /fi.liganancial instruments for the corresponding amount of counterpa/r\\_t.ligay risk, using the method discussed in note 52 'Assets and liabilities measured at fair value'.\n\nChanges in the assumptions made in estimating the input data could have an impact on the fair value recognized for those instruments, especially in current conditions where markets are volatile and the economic outlook is highly unce/r\\_t.ligaain and subject to rapid change.\n\n## Development expenditure\n\nIn order to determine the recoverability of development expenditure, the recoverable amount is estimated making assumptions regarding any fu/r\\_t.ligaher cash out/fl.ligaow that is expected to be incurred before the asset is ready for use or sale, the discount rates to be applied and the expected period of bene/fi.ligats.\n\n## Pensions and other post-employment bene/fi.ligats\n\nSome  of  the  Group's  employees  pa/r\\_t.ligaicipate  in  pension plans o/ff.ligaering bene/fi.ligats based on their wage history and years of service. Ce/r\\_t.ligaain employees are also eligible for other post-employment bene/fi.ligat schemes.\n\nThe expenses and liabilities of such plans are calculated on the basis of estimates carried out by consulting actuaries, who use a combination of statistical and actuarial elements\n\nin their calculations, including statistical data on past years and forecasts of future costs. Other components of the estimation that are considered include mo/r\\_t.ligaality and retirement rates as well as assumptions concerning future developments in discount rates, the rate of wage increases, the in/fl.ligaation rate and trends in healthcare cost.\n\nThese estimates can di/ff.ligaer signi/fi.ligacantly from actual developments owing to changes in economic and market conditions, increases or decreases in retirement rates and the lifespan of pa/r\\_t.ligaicipants, as well as changes in the e/ff.ligaective cost of healthcare.\n\nSuch di/ff.ligaerences can have a substantial impact on the quanti/fi.ligacation of pension costs and other related expenses.\n\nFor more details on the main actuarial assumptions adopted, please see note 39.\n\n## Provisions for risks and charges\n\nFor more details on provisions for risks and charges, please see note 40 'Provisions for risks and charges'.\n\nNote 57 'Contingent assets and liabilities' also provides information regarding the most signi/fi.ligacant contingent assets and liabilities for the Group at year end.\n\n## Litigation\n\nThe Group is involved in various civil, administrative and tax disputes connected with the normal pursuit of its activities that could give rise to signi/fi.ligacant liabilities. It is not always objectively possible to predict the outcome of these disputes. The assessment of the risks associated with this litigation is based on complex factors whose very nature requires recourse to management judgments, even when taking account of the contribution of external advisors assisting the Group, about whether to classify them as contingent liabilities or liabilities.\n\nProvisions have been recognized to cover all signi/fi.ligacant liabilities for cases in which legal counsel feels an adverse outcome is likely and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the expense can be made.\n\nObligations associated with generation plants, including decommissioning and site restoration\n\nGeneration activities may entail obligations for the operator with regard to future interventions that will have to be pe/r\\_f.ligaormed following the end of the operating life of the plant.\n\nSuch interventions may involve the decommissioning of plants and site restoration, or other obligations linked to the type of generation technology involved. The nature of such obligations may also have a major impact on the accounting treatment used for them.\n\nIn the case of nuclear power plants, where the costs regard both decommissioning and the storage of waste fuel and other radioactive materials, the estimation of the fu-",

This is the interest rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the rightofuse asset in a similar economic environment. When no observable inputs are available, the Group estimates the IBR making assumptions to re/fl.ligaect the terms and conditions of the lease and ce/r\\_t.ligaain lessee-speci/fi.ligac estimates.\n\nOne of the most signi/fi.ligacant judgments for the Group is determining this IBR necessary to calculate the present value of the lease payments required to be paid to the lessor. The Group approach to determine an IBR is based on the assessment of the following three key components:\n\n\u00b7\n\nthe risk free rate, that consider the currency /fl.ligaows of the lease payments, the economic environment where the lease contract has been negotiated and also the lease term;\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nthe credit spread adjustment, in order to calculate an IBR that is speci/fi.ligac for the lessee considering any underlying Parent or other guarantee;\n\nthe lease related adjustments, in order to re/fl.ligaect into the IBR calculation the fact that the discount rate is directly linked to the type of the underlying asset, rather than being a general incremental borrowing rate. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the risk of default is mitigated for the lessors as they have the right to reclaim the underlying asset itself.\n\nFor more information on lease liabilities, please see note 48 'Financial instruments by category'.\n\n## Income tax\n\n## Recovery of deferred tax assets\n\nAt December 31, 2022, the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements repo/r\\_t.liga deferred tax assets in respect of tax losses or tax credits usable in subsequent years and income components whose deductibility is deferred in an amount whose future recovery is considered by management to be highly probable.\n\nThe recoverability of such assets is subject to the achievement of future pro/fi.ligats su/ffi.ligacient to absorb such tax losses and to use the bene/fi.ligats of the other deferred tax assets. Signi/fi.ligacant management judgment is required to assess\n\nthe probability of recovering deferred tax assets, considering all negative and positive evidence, and to determine the amount that can be recognized, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable pro/fi.ligats together with future tax planning strategies and the tax rates applicable at the date of reversal. However, where the Group should become aware that it is unable to recover all or pa/r\\_t.liga of recognized tax assets in future years, the consequent adjustment would be taken to pro/fi.ligat or loss in the year in which this circumstance arises.\n\nThe recoverability of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each period. Deferred tax assets not recognized are reassessed at each repo/r\\_t.ligaing date in order to verify the conditions for their recognition.\n\nFor more detail in deferred tax assets recognized or not recognized, please see note 25 'Deferred tax assets and liabilities'.\n\nManagement judgment\n\n## Identi/fi.ligacation of cash generating units (CGUs)\n\nFor impairment testing, if the recoverable amount cannot be determined for an individual asset, the Group identi/fi.ligaes the smallest group of assets that generate largely independent cash in/fl.ligaows.

Identifying such CGUs involves management judgments regarding the speci/fi.ligac nature of the assets and the business involved (geographical segment, business segment, regulatory framework, etc.) and the evidence that the cash in/fl.ligaows of the group of assets are largely independent of those associated with other assets (or groups of assets). The assets of each CGU are also identi/fi.ligaed on the basis of the manner in which management manages and monitors those assets within the business model adopted. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the number and scope of the CGUs are updated systematically to re/fl.ligaect the impact of new business combinations and reorganizations carried out by the Group, and to take account of external factors that could in/fl.ligauence the ability of assets to generate independent cash in/fl.ligaows. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, if ce/r\\_t.ligaain speci/fi.ligac identi/fi.ligaed assets owned by the Group are impacted by adverse economic or operating conditions that undermine their capacity to contribute to the generation of cash /fl.ligaows, they can be isolated from the rest of the assets of the CGU, undergo separate analysis of their recoverability and be impaired where necessary. The CGUs identi/fi.ligaed by management to which the goodwill recognized in these consolidated /fi.liganancial statements has been allocated and the criteria used to identify the CGUs are indicated in note 24 'Goodwill'.\n\n## Determining the useful life of non-/fi.liganancial assets\n\nIn determining the useful life of prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment and intangible assets with a /fi.liganite useful life, the Group considers not only the future economic bene/fi.ligats contained in the assets - obtained through their use, but also many other factors, such as physical wear and tear, the technical, commercial or other obsolescence of the product or service produced with the asset, legal or similar limits (e.g., safety, environmental or other restrictions) on the use of the asset, if the useful life of the asset depends on the useful life of other assets.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, in estimating the useful lives of the assets concerned, the Group has taken account of its commitment under the Paris Agreement. For more information on this issue, please see note 19 'Prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment'.\n\n## Determination of the existence of control\n\nUnder the provisions of IFRS 10, control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to a/ff.ligaect those returns through its power over the investee. Power is de/fi.liganed as the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee based on existing substantive rights.\n\nThe existence of control does not depend solely on owner-\n\nship of a majority investment, but rather it arises from substantive rights that each investor holds over the investee. Consequently, management must use its judgment in assessing whether speci/fi.ligac situations determine substantive rights that give the Group the power to direct the relevant activities of the investee in order to a/ff.ligaect its returns.\n\nFor the purpose of assessing control, management analyzes all facts and circumstances including any agreements with other investors, rights arising from other contractual  arrangements  and  potential  voting  rights  (call options, warrants, put options granted to non-controlling shareholders, etc.). These other facts and circumstances could be especially signi/fi.ligacant in such assessment when the Group holds less than a majority of voting rights, or similar rights, in the investee.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligahermore, even if it holds more than half of the voting rights in an entity, the Group considers all the relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it controls the investee.\n\nThe Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the elements considered in verifying the existence of control.\n\nAs repo/r\\_t.ligaed in Enel's consolidated /fi.liganancial statements at December 31, 2022, the Enel Group holds minor interests in Enel Green Power Rus LLC and Enel X Rus LLC.\n\nIn the wake of the Ukrainian con/fl.ligaict, a number of measures were adopted or unde/r\\_t.ligaaken that resulted in the termination of Enel's management and coordination role at the Russian companies in which the Group holds investments. These measures include: (i) the resignation of all non-independent  directors  and  all  managers  of  non-Russian nationality; (ii) the termination of intercompany contracts; and (iii) the modi/fi.ligacation of the organizational structure of the Enel Group in order to terminate repo/r\\_t.ligaing by the sta/ff.liga or business functions to Enel.\n\nAt December 31, 2022 the Enel Group continues to control the companies from an accounting point of view, in compliance with 'IFRS 10 - Consolidated Financial Statements'.\n\n## Determination of the existence of joint control and of the type of joint arrangement\n\nUnder the provisions of IFRS 11, a joint arrangement is an agreement where two or more pa/r\\_t.ligaies have joint control. Joint control exists only when the decisions over the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties that share joint control.\n\nA joint arrangement can be con/fi.ligagured as a joint venture or a joint operation. Joint ventures are joint arrangements whereby the pa/r\\_t.ligaies that have joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.

For this purpose, the management considers the structure and legal form of the arrangement, the terms agreed by the pa/r\\_t.ligaies in the contractual arrangement and, when relevant, other facts and circumstances. Following that analysis, the Group has considered its interest in Asociaci\u00f3n Nuclear Asc\u00f3-Vandell\u00f3s II as a joint operation.\n\nThe Group re-assesses whether or not it has joint control if facts and circumstances indicate that changes have occurred in one or more of the elements considered in verifying the existence of joint control and the type of the joint arrangement.\n\nIn the wake of the Ukrainian con/fl.ligaict, a number of measures were adopted or unde/r\\_t.ligaaken that resulted in the termination of Enel's management of Rusenergosbyt LLC (Group's associate). These measures include the resignation of all non-independent directors and all managers of non-Russian nationality and the termination of repo/r\\_t.ligaing by the sta/ff.liga or business functions to Enel.\n\nAt December 31, 2022 the Enel Group continues to exercise joint control of the company from an accounting point of view, in accordance with 'IFRS 11 - Joint arrangements'. For more information on the Group's investments in joint ventures, please see note 26 'Equity-accounted investments'.\n\n## Determination of the existence of signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence over an associate\n\nAssociates are those in which the Group exercises signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence, i.e., the power to pa/r\\_t.ligaicipate in the /fi.liganancial and operating policy decisions of the investee but not exercise control or joint control over those policies. In general, it is presumed that the Group has a signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence when it has an ownership interest of 20% or more.\n\nIn order to determine the existence of signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence, management must apply judgment and consider all facts and circumstances.\n\nThe Group re-assesses whether or not it has signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the elements considered in verifying the existence of signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence.\n\nFor more information on the Group's equity investments in associates, please see note 26 'Equity-accounted investments'.\n\n## Application of 'IFRIC 12 - Service concession\n\n## arrangements' to concessions\n\nIFRIC 12 applies to 'public-to-private' service concession arrangements, which can be de/fi.liganed as contracts under which the operator is obligated to provide public services, i.e., give access to major economic and social services for a ce/r\\_t.ligaain period of time, on behalf of a public entity (the grantor). In these contracts, the grantor conveys to an operator the right to manage the infrastructure used to provide services.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, IFRIC 12 gives guidance on the accounting by operators for 'public-to-private' service concession arrangements in the event that:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nthe grantor controls or regulates what services the operator must provide with the infrastructure, to whom it must provide them, and at what price; and\n\nthe grantor controls - through ownership, bene/fi.ligacial entitlement or otherwise - any signi/fi.ligacant residual interest in the infrastructure at the end of the term of the arrangement.\n\nIn assessing the applicability of these requirements for the Group, as operator, management carefully analyzed existing concessions.\n\nOn the basis of that analysis, the provisions of IFRIC 12 are applicable to some of the infrastructure of a number of companies that operate primarily in Brazil.\n\nFu/r\\_t.ligaher details about the infrastructure used in the service concession arrangements in the scope of IFRIC 12 are provided in note 20 'Infrastructure within the scope of 'IFRIC 12 - Service concession arrangements''.\n\n## Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nIn the process of applying IFRS 15, the Group has made the following judgments (fu/r\\_t.ligaher details about the most significant e/ff.ligaect on the Group's revenue are provided in note 11.a 'Revenue from sales and services').\n\nThe Group carefully analyzes the contractual terms and conditions on a jurisdictional level in order to determine when a contract exists and the terms of that contract's enforceability so as to apply IFRS 15 only to such contracts.\n\nWhen a contract includes multiple promised goods or services, in order to assess if they should be accounted for separately or as a group, the Group considers both the individual characteristics of goods/services and the nature of the promise within the context of the contract, also evaluating all the facts and circumstances relating to the speci/fi.ligac contract under the relevant legal and regulatory framework. To evaluate when a pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation is satis/fi.ligaed, the Group evaluates when the control of the goods or services is transferred to the customer, assessed primarily from the perspective of the customer.",

The measurement of progress towards complete satisfaction of a pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation is carried out consistently for pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligations and similar circumstances using an 'output' or 'input' method. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the cost incurred method (cost-to-cost method) is considered appropriate for measuring progress except when a speci/fi.ligac analysis of the contract counsels the use of an alternative method. If it should prove impossible to reasonably assess progress towards satisfaction of the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation, the Group recognizes revenue only to the extent of the incurred costs that are considered recoverable;\n\nif, on the other hand, the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation is satis/fi.ligaed at a given moment, as in the case of the supply of goods, revenue is recognized at the point in time in which the customer obtains the control of the goods, considering all relevant indicators.\n\nThe Group considers all relevant facts and circumstances  in  determining  whether  a  contract  includes  variable consideration  (i.e.,  consideration  that  may  vary  or  depends upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future event). In estimating variable consideration, the Group uses the method that be/t\\_t.ligaer predicts the consideration to which it will be entitled, applying it consistently throughout the contract and for similar contracts, also considering all available information, and updating such estimates until the unce/r\\_t.ligaainly is resolved. The Group includes the estimated variable consideration in the transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a signi/fi.ligacant reversal in the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the unce/r\\_t.ligaainty is resolved.\n\nThe Group considers that it is an agent in some contracts in which it is not primarily responsible for ful/fi.ligalling the contract and therefore it does not control goods or services before they are being transferred to customers. For example, the Group acts as an agent in some contracts for electricity/gas network connection services and other related activities depending on local legal and regulatory framework.\n\nFor contracts that have more than one pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation (e.g., 'bundled' sale contracts), the Group generally allocates the transaction price to each pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation in propo/r\\_t.ligaion to its stand-alone selling price. The Group determines stand-alone selling prices considering all information and using observable prices when they are\n\navailable in the market or, if not, using an estimation method that maximizes the use of observable inputs and applying it consistently to similar arrangements.\n\nIf the Group evaluates that a contract includes an option for additional goods or services (e.g., customer loyalty programs or renewal options) that represents a material right, it allocates the transaction price to this option since the option gives rise to an additional pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation.\n\nThe Group assesses recoverability of the incremental costs of obtaining a contract either on a contract-by-contract basis, or for a group of contracts if those costs are associated with the group of contracts.\n\nThe Group suppo/r\\_t.ligas the recoverability of such costs on the basis of its experience with other similar transactions and evaluating various factors, including potential renewals, amendments and follow-on contracts with the same customer.\n\nThe Group amo/r\\_t.ligaizes such costs over the average customer term. In order to determine this expected period of bene/fi.ligat from the contract, the Group considers its past experience (e.g., 'churn rate'), the predictive evidence from similar contracts and available information about the market.\n\n## Power Purchase Agreements\n\nPower Purchase Agreements (PPAs), which provide for the physical delivery of energy and which do not comply with the requirements of IFRS 10 for the existence of control or joint control over a company or an asset, and IFRS 16 for the recognition of a lease, but which comply with the de/fi.liganition of a derivative under IFRS 9, are accounted for on the basis of the own use exemption when the relevant conditions are met.\n\nFor more information on Vi/r\\_t.ligaual PPAs complying with the de/fi.liganition of derivative pursuant to IFRS 9, please see note 51 'Derivatives and hedge accounting'.\n\n## Classi/fi.ligacation and measurement of /fi.liganancial assets\n\nAt initial recognition, in order to classify /fi.liganancial assets as /fi.liganancial assets at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost, at fair value through other comprehensive income and at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss, management assesses both the contractual cash-/fl.ligaow characteristics of the instrument and the business model for managing /fi.liganancial assets in order to generate cash /fl.ligaows.\n\nIn order to evaluate the contractual cash-/fl.ligaow characteristics of the instrument, management pe/r\\_f.ligaorms the SPPI test at an instrument level, in order to determine if it gives rise to cash /fl.ligaows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding, pe/r\\_f.ligaorming speci/fi.ligac assessment on the contractual clauses of the /fi.liganancial instruments, as well as quantitative analysis, if required.

Related pa/r\\_t.ligaies also include entities that operate post-employment bene/fi.ligat plans for employees of Enel SpA or its associates (speci/fi.ligacally, the FOPEN and FONDENEL pension funds), as well as the members of the boards of statutory auditors, and their immediate family, and the key management personnel, and their immediate family, of Enel SpA and its subsidiaries. Key management  personnel  comprises  management  personnel who have the power and direct or indirect responsibility for the planning, management and control of the activities of the Company. They include directors (whether executive or not).\n\nSubsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity, regardless of the nature of the formal relationship between them, when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns deriving from its involvement and has the ability, through the exercise of its power over the investee, to a/ff.ligaect its returns.",

        "page_content": "The /fi.ligagures of the subsidiaries are consolidated on a full line-by-line basis as from the date control is acquired until such control ceases.\n\nConsolidation procedures\n\nThe /fi.liganancial statements of subsidiaries used to prepare the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements were prepared at December 31, 2022 in accordance with the accounting policies adopted by the Group.\n\nIf  a  subsidiary  uses  di/ff.ligaerent  accounting  policies  from those  adopted  in  preparing  the  consolidated  /fi.liganancial statements for similar transactions and facts in similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments are made to ensure conformity with Group accounting policies.\n\nAssets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in or excluded from the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements, respectively, from the date the Group gains control or until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.\n\nPro/fi.ligat or loss for the year and the other comprehensive income are a/t\\_t.ligaributed to the owners of the Parent and non-controlling interests, even if this results in a loss for non-controlling interests.\n\nAll intercompany assets and liabilities, equity item, revenue, expenses and cash /fl.ligaows relating to transactions between entities of the Group are eliminated in full.\n\nChanges in ownership interest in subsidiaries that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions, with the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests adjusted to re/fl.ligaect changes in their interests in the subsidiary. Any di/ff.ligaerence between the amount to which non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized in consolidated equity.\n\nWhen the Group ceases to have control over a subsidiary, any interest retained in the entity is remeasured to its fair value, recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss, at the date when control is lost, recognizing any gain or loss from the loss of control through pro/fi.ligat or loss. In addition, any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of the former subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence. Signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence is the power to pa/r\\_t.ligaicipate in decisions concerning the /fi.liganancial and operating policies of the investee without having control or joint control over the investee.\n\nA joint venture is a joint arrangement over which the Group exercises joint control and has rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Joint control is the sharing of control of an arrangement, whereby decisions about the relevant ac-\n\ntivities require unanimous consent of the pa/r\\_t.ligaies sharing control.\n\nThe Group's investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.\n\nUnder the equity method, these investments are initially recognized at cost and any goodwill arising from the di/ff.ligaerence between the cost of the investment and the Group's share of the net fair value of the investee's identi/fi.ligaable assets and liabilities at the acquisition date is included in the carrying amount of the investment.\n\nAfter the acquisition date, their carrying amount is adjusted to recognize changes in the Group's share of pro/fi.ligat or loss of the associate or joint venture in Group pro/fi.ligat or loss. Adjustments to the carrying amount may also be necessary following changes in the Group's share in the associate or joint venture as a result of changes in the other comprehensive income of the investee. The Group's share of these changes is recognized in the Group's other comprehensive income.\n\nDistributions received from joint venture and associates reduce the carrying amount of the investments.\n\nGains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associates or joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate or joint venture.\n\nThe /fi.liganancial statements of the associates or joint ventures are prepared for the same repo/r\\_t.ligaing period as the Group. When necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.\n\nAfter application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognize an impairment loss on its investment in an associate or joint venture. If there is objective evidence of a loss of value, the entire carrying amount of the investment undergoes impairment testing pursuant to IAS 36 as a single asset. For more information on impairment, please see the section 'Impairment of non-/fi.liganancial assets' in note 2.1 'Use of estimates and management judgment'.\n\nIf the investment ceases to be an associate or a joint venture, the Group recognizes any retained investment at its fair value, through pro/fi.ligat or loss. Any amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in respect of the former associate or joint venture are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.\n\nIf the ownership interest in an associate or a joint venture is reduced, but the Group continues to exercise a signi/fi.ligacant in/fl.ligauence or joint control, the Group continues to apply the equity method and the share of the gain or loss that had previously been recognized in other comprehensive income relating to that reduction is accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.",

Non-monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currency measured at fair value are translated using the exchange rate at the date the fair value was determined. Any exchange di/ff.ligaerences are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or\n\nloss.\n\nIn determining the spot exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related asset, expense or income (or pa/r\\_t.liga of it) on the derecognition of a non-monetary asset or non-monetary liability relating to advance consideration in foreign currency paid or received, the date of the transaction is the date on which the Group initially recognizes the\n\nnon-monetary asset or non-monetary liability associated with the advance consideration.\n\nIf there are multiple advance payments or receipts, the Group determines the transaction date for each payment or receipt of advance consideration.\n\nTranslation of /fi.liganancial statements\n\ndenominated in a foreign currency\n\nFor the purposes of the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements, all revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities are stated in euro, which is the presentation currency of the Parent. In order to prepare the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements, the /fi.liganancial statements of consolidated companies with functional currencies other than the presentation currency used in the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements are translated into euros by applying the closing exchange rate to the assets and liabilities, including goodwill and consolidation adjustments, and the average exchange rate for the period to the income statement items on the condition it approximates the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the respective transactions.\n\nAny resulting exchange gains or losses are recognized as a separate component of equity in a special reserve. The gains  and  losses  are  recognized  propo/r\\_t.ligaionately  in  the income statement on the disposal (pa/r\\_t.ligaial or total) of the subsidiary.\n\nWhen the functional currency of a consolidated company is the currency of a hyperin/fl.ligaationary economy, the Group restates the /fi.liganancial statements in accordance with IAS 29 before applying the speci/fi.ligac conversion method set out below.\n\nIn order to consider the impact of hyperin/fl.ligaation on the local currency exchange rate, the /fi.liganancial position and pe/r\\_f.ligaormance (i.e., assets, liabilities, equity items, revenue and expenses) of a company whose functional currency is the currency of a hyperin/fl.ligaationary economy are translated into the Group's presentation currency (the euro) using the exchange rate prevailing at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date, except for comparative amounts presented in the previous year's /fi.liganancial statements which are not adjusted for subsequent changes in the price level or subsequent changes in exchange rates.\n\nBusiness combinations\n\nBusiness  combinations  initiated  before  January  1,  2010 and completed within that /fi.liganancial year are recognized on the basis of IFRS 3 (2004).\n\nSuch business combinations were recognized using the purchase method, where the purchase cost is equal to the fair value at the date of the exchange of the assets acquired and the liabilities incurred or assumed, plus costs directly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the acquisition. This cost was allocated by recognizing the assets, liabilities and identi/fi.ligaable",

Any positive di/ff.ligaerence between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net assets acquired a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the owners of the Parent was recognized as goodwill. If the di/ff.ligaerence is negative, it is recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nThe carrying amount of non-controlling interests was determined in propo/r\\_t.ligaion to the interest held by non-controlling shareholders in the net assets. In the case of business combinations achieved in stages, at the date of acquisition any adjustment to the fair value of the net assets acquired previously was recognized in equity; the amount of goodwill was determined for each transaction separately based on the fair values of the acquiree's net assets at the date of each exchange transaction.\n\nBusiness combinations carried out as from January 1, 2010 are recognized on the basis of IFRS 3 (2008), which is referred to as IFRS 3 (Revised) hereafter.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, business combinations are recognized using the acquisition method, where the purchase cost (the consideration transferred) is equal to the fair value at the purchase date of the assets acquired and the liabilities incurred or assumed, as well as any equity instruments issued by the purchaser. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement.\n\nCosts directly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the acquisition are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nThe consideration transferred is allocated by recognizing the  assets,  liabilities  and  identi/fi.ligaable  contingent  liabilities of the acquired company at their fair values as at the acquisition date. The excess of the consideration transferred, measured at fair value as at the acquisition date, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree plus the fair value of any equity interest in the acquiree previously held by the Group (in a business combination achieved in stages) over the net amount of the identi/fi.ligaable assets acquired and the liabilities incurred or assumed measured at fair value is recognized as goodwill. If the difference is negative, the Group veri/fi.ligaes whether it has correctly identi/fi.ligaed all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to determine the amounts to recognize at the acquisition date. If after this assessment the fair value of the net assets acquired still exceeds the total consideration transferred, this excess represents the pro/fi.ligat on a bargain purchase and is recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nThe carrying amount of non-controlling interests is determined either in propo/r\\_t.ligaion to the interest held by non-controlling shareholders in the net identi/fi.ligaable assets of the acquiree or at their fair value as at the acquisition date.\n\nIn the case of business combinations achieved in stages, at\n\nthe date of acquisition of control the previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value and any positive or negative di/ff.ligaerence is recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nAny contingent consideration is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration classi/fi.ligaed as an asset or a liability, or as a /fi.liganancial instrument within the scope of IFRS 9, are recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss. If the contingent consideration is not within the scope of IFRS 9, it is measured in accordance with the appropriate IFRS-EU. Contingent consideration that is classi/fi.ligaed as equity is not re-measured, and its subsequent se/t\\_t.ligalement is accounted for within equity.\n\nIf the fair values of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities can only be calculated on a provisional basis, the business combination is recognized using such provisional values. Any adjustments resulting from the completion of the measurement process are recognized within 12 months of the date of acquisition, restating comparative /fi.ligagures.\n\nFair value measurement\n\nFor all fair value measurements and disclosures of fair value, that are either required or permi/t\\_t.ligaed by IFRS, the Group applies IFRS 13.\n\nFair value is de/fi.liganed as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction, between market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipants, at the measurement date (i.e., an exit price).\n\nThe fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell an asset or transfer a liability takes place in the principal market, i.e., the market with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset or liability. In the absence of a principal market, it is assumed that the transaction takes place in the most advantageous market to which the Group has access, i.e., the market that maximizes the amount that would be received to sell the asset or minimizes the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability.\n\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipants act in their economic best interest. Market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipants are independent, knowledgeable sellers and buyers who are able to enter into a transaction for the asset or the liability and who are motivated but not forced or otherwise compelled to do so.\n\nWhen measuring fair value, the Group considers the characteristics of the asset or liability, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular:\n\n\u00b7\n\nfor a non-/fi.liganancial asset, a fair value measurement takes into account a market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipant's ability to generate economic bene/fi.ligats by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipant that would use the asset in its highest and best use;",

The corresponding liability is recognized under provisions for risks and charges. The accounting treatment of changes in the estimate of these costs, the passage of time and the discount rate is discussed in note 40 'Provisions for risks and charges'.\n\nPrope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment transferred from customers to connect them to the electricity distribution network and/or to provide them with other related services is initially recognized at its fair value at the date on which control is obtained.\n\nBorrowing costs that are directly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, i.e., an asset that takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale, are capitalized as pa/r\\_t.liga of the cost of the assets themselves. Borrowing costs associated with the purchase/construction of assets that do not meet such requirement are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.\n\nCe/r\\_t.ligaain assets that were revalued at the IFRS-EU transition date or in previous periods are recognized at their fair value, which is considered to be their deemed cost at the revaluation date.\n\nWhere individual items of major components of prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment have di/ff.ligaerent useful lives, the components are recognized and depreciated separately.\n\nSubsequent costs are recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic bene/fi.ligats associated with the cost incurred to replace a pa/r\\_t.liga of the asset will /fl.ligaow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other costs are recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss as incurred.\n\nThe cost of replacing pa/r\\_t.liga or all of an asset is recognized as an increase in the carrying amount of the asset and is depreciated over its useful life; the carrying amount of the replaced unit is derecognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nPrope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment, net of its residual value, is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, which is reviewed annually.

Assets recognized under prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment are derecognized either upon their disposal (i.e., at the date the recipient obtains control) or when no future economic bene/fi.ligat is expected from their use or disposal. Any gain or loss, recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss, is calculated as the di/ff.ligaerence between the net disposal proceeds, determined in accordance with the transaction price requirements of IFRS 15, and the carrying amount of the derecognized assets.\n\n## Assets to be relinquished free of charge\n\nThe Group's plants include assets to be relinquished free of charge at the end of the concessions. These mainly regard major water diversion works and the public lands used for the operation of the thermal power plants.\n\nWithin the Italian regulatory framework in force until 2011, if the concessions are not renewed, at those dates all intake and governing works, penstocks, out/fl.ligaow channels and other assets on public lands were to be relinquished free of charge to the State in good operating condition. Accordingly, depreciation on assets to be relinquished was calculated over the sho/r\\_t.ligaer of the term of the concession and the useful life of the assets.\n\nIn the wake of the legislative changes introduced with Law 134 of August 7, 2012, the assets previously classi/fi.ligaed as assets 'to be relinquished free of charge' connected with the  hydroelectric  water  diversion  concessions  are  now considered in the same manner as other categories of 'Prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment' and are therefore depreciated over the useful life of the asset (where this exceeds the term of the concession), as discussed in the section above on the 'Depreciable amount of ce/r\\_t.ligaain elements of Italian hydroelectric plants subsequent to enactment of Law 134/2012', which you are invited to consult for more details.\n\nIn accordance with Spanish laws 29/1985 and 46/1999, hydroelectric power stations in Spanish territory operate under administrative concessions at the end of which the plants will be returned to the government in good operating condition. The terms of the concessions extend up to 2078.\n\nA number of generation companies that operate in Latin America hold administrative concessions with similar conditions to those applied under the Spanish concession system. These concessions will expire in Argentina in 2087, in Brazil in 2047, in Costa Rica in 2031, in Panama in 2060 and in Guatemala in 2062.\n\n## Infrastructure serving a concession not within the scope of 'IFRIC 12 - Service concession arrangements'\n\nAs regards the distribution of electricity, the Group is a concession holder in Italy for this service. The concession, granted by the Ministry for Economic Development, was issued free of charge and terminates on December 31, 2030. If the concession is not renewed upon expiry, the grantor is required to pay an indemnity. The amount of the indemnity will be determined by agreement of the pa/r\\_t.ligaies using appropriate valuation methods, based on both the carrying amount of the assets themselves and their profitability.\n\nIn determining the indemnity, such pro/fi.ligatability will be represented by the present value of future cash /fl.ligaows. The infrastructure serving the concession is owned and available to the concession holder. It is recognized under 'Prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment' and is depreciated over the useful lives of the assets.\n\nEnel also operates under administrative concessions for the distribution of electricity in other countries (including Spain and Romania). These concessions give the right to build and operate distribution networks for an inde/fi.liganite period of time.\n\nInfrastructure within the scope of 'IFRIC 12 -\n\nService concession arrangements'\n\nUnder a 'public-to-private' service concession arrangement within the scope of 'IFRIC 12 - Service concession arrangements' the operator acts as a service provider and, in accordance with the terms speci/fi.ligaed in the contract, it constructs/upgrades  infrastructure  used  to  provide  a public service and/or operates and maintains that infrastructure for the years of the concession.\n\nThe Group, as operator, does not account for the infrastructure within the scope of IFRIC 12 as prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment and it recognizes and measures revenue in accordance with IFRS 15 for the services it pe/r\\_f.ligaorms.

        "page_content": "such a case, the operator does not have an unconditional right to receive cash because the amounts are contingent on the extent that the public uses the service.\n\nIf the Group (as operator) has a contractual right to receive an intangible asset (a right to charge users of public service), borrowing costs are capitalized using the criteria speci/fi.ligaed in note 19 'Prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment'.\n\nHowever, for construction/upgrade services, both types of consideration are classi/fi.ligaed as a contract asset during the construction/upgrade period.\n\nFor  more  details  about  such  consideration,  please  see note 11.a 'Revenue from sales and services'.\n\nLeases\n\nThe Group holds prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment for its various activities under lease contracts. At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease.\n\nFor contracts entered into or changed on or after January 1, 2019, the Group has applied the de/fi.liganition of a lease under IFRS 16, that is met if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identi/fi.ligaed asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\nConversely, for contracts entered into before January 1, 2019,  the  Group  determined  whether  the  arrangement was or contained a lease under IFRIC 4.\n\n## Group as a lessee\n\nAt commencement or on modi/fi.ligacation of a contract that contains a lease component and one or more additional lease or non-lease components, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of its relative stand-alone price.\n\nThe Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the commencement date of the lease (i.e., the date the underlying asset is available for use).\n\nThe right-of-use asset represents a lessee's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term; it is initially measured at cost, which includes the initial amount of lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to retire and remove the underlying asset and to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located. Right-of-use assets are subsequently depreciated on a straight-line basis over the sho/r\\_t.ligaer of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the right-of-use assets, as follows:\n\n| Buildings                                    |   Average residual life (years) |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Ground rights of renewable energy plants     |                              31 |\n| Vehicles and other means of transpo/r\\_t.liga |                               5 |\n\nIf the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset to the Group at the end of the lease term or if the cost of the right-of-use asset re/fl.ligaects the fact that the Group will exercise a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the underlying asset.\n\nIn addition, the right-of-use assets are subject to impairment and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the lessee's incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date when the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable.\n\nVariable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.\n\nAfter the commencement date, the lease liability is measured at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost using the e/ff.ligaective interest method and is remeasured upon the occurrence of ce/r\\_t.ligaain events.\n\nThe Group applies the sho/r\\_t.liga-term lease recognition exemption to its lease contracts that have a lease term of 12 months or less from the commencement date. It also applies the low-value assets recognition exemption to lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low-value whose amount is estimated not material. For example, the Group has leases of ce/r\\_t.ligaain o/ffi.ligace equipment (i.e., personal computers, printing and photocopying machines) that are considered of low-value. Lease payments on sho/r\\_t.liga-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe Group presents right-of-use assets that do not meet the de/fi.liganition of investment prope/r\\_t.ligay in 'Prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment' and lease liabilities in 'Borrowings'.\n\nConsistent  with  the  requirement  of  the  standard,  the Group presents separately the interest expense on lease liabilities under 'Other /fi.liganancial expense' and the depreciation charge on the right-of-use assets under 'Depreciation, amo/r\\_t.ligaization and impairment losses'.\n\n## Group as a lessor\n\nWhen the Group acts as a lessor, it determines at the lease inception date whether each lease is a /fi.liganance lease or an operating lease.\n\nLeases in which the Group essentially transfers all the risks and rewards associated with ownership of the underlying asset are classi/fi.ligaed as /fi.liganance leases; otherwise, they are classi/fi.ligaed as operating leases. To make this assessment, the Group considers the indicators provided by IFRS 16. If a contract contains lease and non-lease components, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract applying IFRS 15. The Group accounts for rental income arising from operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease terms and it recognizes it as other revenue.",

Any gain or loss, recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss, is calculated as the di/ff.ligaerence between the net disposal proceeds, determined in accordance with the transaction price requirements of IFRS 15, and the carrying amount of the derecognized assets.\n\nTransfers are made to (or from) investment prope/r\\_t.ligay only when there is a change in use.\n\nIntangible assets\n\nIntangible assets are identi/fi.ligaable assets without physical substance controlled by the Group and capable of generating future economic bene/fi.ligats. They are measured at purchase or internal development cost when it is probable that the use of such assets will generate future economic bene/fi.ligats and the related cost can be reliably determined.\n\nThe cost includes any directly a/t\\_t.ligaributable expenses necessary to make the assets ready for their intended use.\n\nDevelopment expenditure is recognized as an intangible asset only when Group can demonstrate the technical feasibility of completing the asset, its intention and ability to complete development and to use or sell the asset and the availability of resources to complete the asset.\n\nResearch costs are recognized as expenses.\n\nIntangible assets with a /fi.liganite useful life are recognized net of accumulated amo/r\\_t.ligaization and any impairment losses. Amo/r\\_t.ligaization is calculated on a straight-line basis over the asset's estimated useful life, which is reassessed at least annually; any changes in amo/r\\_t.ligaization policies are re/fl.ligaected on a prospective basis. For more information on estimating useful life, please see note 2.1 'Use of estimates and management judgment'.\n\nAmo/r\\_t.ligaization commences when the asset is ready for use. Consequently, intangible assets not yet available for use are not amo/r\\_t.ligaized, but are tested for impairment at least annually.\n\nThe Group's intangible assets have a /fi.liganite useful life, with the exception of a number of concessions and goodwill.\n\nIntangible assets with inde/fi.liganite useful lives are not amo/r\\_t.ligaized, but are tested for impairment annually.\n\nThe assessment of inde/fi.liganite useful life is reviewed annually to determine whether the inde/fi.liganite useful life continues to be suppo/r\\_t.ligaable. If not, the change in useful life from inde/fi.liganite to /fi.liganite is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate. Intangible assets are derecognized either at the time of their disposal (at the date when the recipient obtains control) or when no future economic bene/fi.ligat is expected from their use or disposal. Any gain or loss, recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss, is calculated as the di/ff.ligaerence between the net  consideration  received  in  the  disposal,  determined in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 15 concerning the transaction price, and the carrying amount of the derecognized assets.\n\nThe estimated useful life of the main intangible assets, distinguishing between internally generated and acquired assets, is as follows:\n\n| Development expenditure: - internally generated                              | 5 years     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| - acquired                                                                   | 3-26 years  |\n| Industrial patents and intellectual prope/r\\_t.ligay rights:                  |             |\n| - internally generated                                                       | 3-10 years  |\n| - acquired                                                                   | 3-10 years  |\n| Concessions, licenses, trademarks and similar rights: - internally generated | 20 years    |\n| - acquired                                                                   | 10-18 years |\n| Other:                                                                       |             |\n| - internally generated                                                       | 2-28 years  |\n| - acquired                                                                   | 3-15 years  |\n\nThe Group also presents costs to obtain a contract with a customer capitalized in accordance with IFRS 15 as intangible assets.\n\nThe Group recognized such costs as an asset only if:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nthe costs are incremental, that is they are directly attributable to an identi/fi.ligaed contract and the Group would not have incurred them if the contract had not been obtained;\n\nthe Group expects to recover them, through reimbursements (direct recoverability) or the margin (indirect recoverability).\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the Group generally capitalizes trade fees and commissions paid to agents for such contracts if the capitalization criteria are met.\n\nCapitalized customer contract costs are amo/r\\_t.ligaized on a systematic basis, consistent with the pa/t\\_t.ligaern of the transfer of the goods or services to which they relate, and undergo impairment testing to identify any impairment losses to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset recognized exceeds the recoverable amount.",

For the estimate of the recoverable amount, please see note 2.1 'Use of estimates and management judgment'.\n\nThe recoverable amount is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset do not generate cash in/fl.ligaows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets and therefore it is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs.\n\nIf the carrying amount of an asset or of a CGU to which it is allocated is greater than its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss and presented under 'Depreciation, amo/r\\_t.ligaization and other impairment losses'.\n\nImpairment losses of CGUs are /fi.ligarstly charged against the carrying amount of any goodwill a/t\\_t.ligaributed to it and then against the other assets, in propo/r\\_t.ligaion to their carrying amount.\n\nIf the reasons for a previously recognized impairment loss no longer apply, the carrying amount of the asset is restored through pro/fi.ligat or loss, under 'Depreciation, amo/r\\_t.ligaization and other impairment losses', in an amount that shall not exceed the carrying amount that the asset would have had if the impairment loss had not been recognized. The original amount of goodwill is not restored even if in subsequent years the reasons for the impairment no longer apply.\n\nIf ce/r\\_t.ligaain speci/fi.ligac identi/fi.ligaed assets owned by the Group are impacted by adverse economic or operating conditions that undermine their capacity to contribute to the generation of cash /fl.ligaows, they can be isolated from the rest of the assets of the CGU, undergo separate analysis of their recoverability and be impaired where necessary.\n\nInventories\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value except for inventories involved in trading activities, which are measured at fair value with recognition through pro/fi.ligat or loss. Cost is determined on the basis of average  weighted  cost,  which  includes  related  ancillary charges. Net estimated realizable value is the estimated normal selling price net of estimated costs to sell or, where applicable, replacement cost.\n\nFor the po/r\\_t.ligaion of inventories held to discharge sales that have already been made, the net realizable value is determined on the basis of the amount established in the contract of sale.\n\nInventories include environmental ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates (for example, green ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates, energy e/ffi.ligaciency ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates and European CO 2 emissions allowances and guarantees of origin) exceeding compliance in the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period.

Under such approach, a loss allowance on /fi.liganancial assets is recognized at an amount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses, if the credit risk on those /fi.liganancial assets has increased signi/fi.ligacantly, since initial recognition,\n\nconsidering all reasonable and suppo/r\\_t.ligaable information, including also forward-looking inputs.\n\nIf at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date the credit risk on /fi.liganancial assets has  not  increased  signi/fi.ligacantly  since  initial  recognition, the Group measures the loss allowance for those /fi.liganancial assets at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses.\n\nFor /fi.liganancial assets on which a loss allowance equal to lifetime expected credit losses has been recognized in the previous repo/r\\_t.ligaing period, the Group measures the loss allowance at an amount equal to 12-month expected credit losses when the condition regarding a signi/fi.ligacant increase in credit risk is no longer met.\n\nThe Group recognizes in pro/fi.ligat or loss, as an impairment gain or loss, the amount of expected credit losses (or reversal) that is required to adjust the loss allowance at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date to the amount that is required to be recognized in accordance with IFRS 9.\n\nThe Group applies the low credit risk exemption, avoiding the recognition of loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses due to a signi/fi.ligacant increase in credit risk of debt securities at fair value through OCI, whose counterpa/r\\_t.ligay has a strong /fi.liganancial capacity to meet its contractual cash-/fl.ligaow obligations (e.g., investment grade).\n\nFor more information on the impairment of /fi.liganancial assets, please see note 48 'Financial instruments by category'.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nThis category includes deposits that are available on demand or at very sho/r\\_t.liga term, as well as highly liquid sho/r\\_t.ligaterm /fi.liganancial investments that are readily conve/r\\_t.ligaible into a known amount of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.\n\nIn addition, for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash /fl.ligaows, cash and cash equivalents do not include bank overdrafts at period-end.\n\n## Financial liabilities at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost\n\nThis category mainly includes borrowings, trade payables, lease liabilities and debt instruments.\n\nFinancial liabilities, other than derivatives, are recognized when the Group becomes a pa/r\\_t.ligay to the contractual clauses of the instrument and are initially measured at fair value adjusted for directly a/t\\_t.ligaributable transaction costs. Financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amo/r\\_t.ligaized cost using the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method. The e/ff.ligaective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the /fi.liganancial instrument or a sho/r\\_t.ligaer period, where appropriate, to the carrying amount of the /fi.liganancial asset or liability.",

This category also includes derivative /fi.liganancial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as de/fi.liganed by IFRS 9. Separated embedded derivatives are also classi/fi.ligaed as at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss unless they are designated as e/ff.ligaective hedging instruments.\n\nGains or losses on liabilities at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nFinancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss are designated at the initial date of recognition, only if the criteria in IFRS 9 are satis/fi.ligaed.\n\nIn this case, the po/r\\_t.ligaion of the change in fair value a/t\\_t.ligaributable to own credit risk is recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe Group has not designated any /fi.liganancial liability as at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss, upon initial recognition. Financial liabilities that qualify as contingent consideration are also measured at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\n## Derecognition of /fi.liganancial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets are derecognized whenever one of the following conditions is met:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nthe contractual right to receive the cash /fl.ligaows associated with the asset expires;\n\nthe Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards associated with the asset, transferring its rights to receive the cash /fl.ligaows of the asset or assuming a contractual obligation to pay such cash /fl.ligaows to one or more bene/fi.ligaciaries under a contract that meets the requirements provided by IFRS 9 (the 'pass through test');\n\nthe Group has not transferred or retained substantially all the risks and rewards associated with the asset but has transferred control over the asset.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognized when they are extinguished, i.e., when the contractual obligation has been discharged, cancelled or expired.\n\nWhen an existing /fi.liganancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially di/ff.ligaerent terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modi/fi.ligaed, such an exchange or modi/fi.ligacation is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The di/ff.ligaerence in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\n## Derivative /fi.liganancial instruments\n\nA derivative is a /fi.liganancial instrument or another contract: \u00b7 whose value changes in response to the changes in an underlying variable such as an interest rate, commodity or security price, foreign exchange rate, a price or rate index, a credit rating or other variable;\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nthat requires no initial net investment, or one that is smaller than would be required for a contract with similar response to changes in market factors;\n\nthat is se/t\\_t.ligaled at a future date.\n\nDerivative instruments are classi/fi.ligaed as /fi.liganancial assets or liabilities depending on the positive or negative fair value and they are classi/fi.ligaed as 'held for trading' within 'Other business models' and measured at fair value through profit or loss, except for those designated as e/ff.ligaective hedging instruments.\n\nAll derivatives held for trading are classi/fi.ligaed as current assets or liabilities.\n\nDerivatives not held for trading purposes, but measured at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss since they do not qualify for hedge accounting, and derivatives designated as e/ff.ligaective hedging instruments are classi/fi.ligaed as current or not current on the basis of their maturity date and the Group intention to hold the /fi.liganancial instrument till maturity or not. For more details about derivatives and hedge accounting, please see note 51 'Derivatives and hedge accounting'.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nAn embedded derivative is a derivative included in a 'combined' contract (the so-called 'hybrid instrument') that contains another non-derivative contract (the so-called host contract) and gives rise to some or all of the combined contract's cash /fl.ligaows.\n\nThe main Group contracts that may contain embedded derivatives are contracts to buy or sell non-/fi.liganancial items with clauses or options that a/ff.ligaect the contract price, volume or maturity.\n\nA derivative embedded in a hybrid contract containing a /fi.liganancial asset host is not accounted for separately. The /fi.liganancial asset host together with the embedded derivative is required to be classi/fi.ligaed in its entirety as a /fi.liganancial asset at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nContracts that do not represent /fi.liganancial instruments to be measured at fair value are analyzed in order to identify any embedded derivatives, which are to be separated and measured at fair value. This analysis is pe/r\\_f.ligaormed when the Group becomes pa/r\\_t.ligay to the contract or when the contract is renegotiated in a manner that signi/fi.ligacantly changes the original associated cash /fl.ligaows.\n\nEmbedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for as derivatives when:\n\n\u00b7\n\nthe host contract is not a /fi.liganancial instrument measured at fair value through pro/fi.ligat or loss;",

Conversely, during the hyperin/fl.ligaationary period (until it ceases), the gain or loss resulting from adjustments is recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss and disclosed separately in /fi.liganancial income and expense.\n\nSta/r\\_t.ligaing from 2018, this standard applies to the Group's transactions in Argentina, whose economy has been declared hyperin/fl.ligaationary from July 1, 2018.\n\nNon-current assets (or disposal groups)\n\nclassi/fi.ligaed as held for sale and discontinued\n\noperations\n\nNon-current assets (or disposal groups) are classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction, rather than through continuing use.\n\nThis  classi/fi.ligacation criterion  is  applicable  only  when non-current assets (or disposal groups) are available in their present condition for immediate sale and the sale is highly probable.\n\nIf the Group is commi/t\\_t.ligaed to a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary and the requirements provided for under IFRS 5 are met, all the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale when the classi/fi.ligacation criteria are met, regardless of whether the Group will retain a non-controlling interest in its former subsidiary after the sale.\n\nThe Group applies these classi/fi.ligacation criteria as envisaged in IFRS 5 to an investment, or a po/r\\_t.ligaion of an investment, in an associate or a joint venture. Any retained po/r\\_t.ligaion of an investment in an associate or a joint venture that has not been classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale is accounted for using the equity method until disposal of the po/r\\_t.ligaion that is classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale takes place.\n\nNon-current assets (or disposal groups) and liabilities of disposal groups classi/fi.ligaed as held for sale are presented",

If the Group ceases to classify a component as held for sale, the results of the component previously presented in discontinued operations are reclassi/fi.ligaed and included in pro/fi.ligat or loss from continuing operations for all periods presented.\n\nEnvironmental ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates\n\nSome Group companies are a/ff.ligaected by national regulations governing green ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates, guarantees of origin and energy e/ffi.ligaciency ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates (so-called white ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates), as well as the European 'Emissions Trading System'. Green  ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates  and  guarantees  of  origin  accrued  in propo/r\\_t.ligaion to electricity generated by renewable energy plants and energy e/ffi.ligaciency ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates accrued in propo/r\\_t.ligaion to energy savings achieved that have been ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligaed by the competent authority are treated as non-monetary government operating grants and are recognized at fair value, under other operating pro/fi.ligat, with recognition of an asset under other non-/fi.liganancial assets, if the ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates are not yet credited to the ownership account, or under inventories, if the ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates have already been credited to that account.\n\nAt the time the ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates are credited to the ownership account, they are reclassi/fi.ligaed from other assets to inventories.\n\nRevenue from the sale of such ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates is recognized under revenue, with a corresponding decrease in inventories.\n\nFor the purposes of accounting for charges arising from such regulatory requirements, the Group uses the 'net liability approach'.\n\nUnder this accounting policy, any environmental ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates received free of charge and those self-produced as a result of Group's operations that will be used for compliance purposes are recognized at nominal value (nil). In addition, charges incurred for obtaining (in the market or in some other transaction for consideration) any missing ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates to ful/fi.ligal compliance requirements for the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss on an accrual basis under other operating costs, as they represent 'system charges' consequent to compliance with a regulatory requirement.\n\nEmployee bene/fi.ligats\n\nLiabilities related to employee bene/fi.ligats paid upon or after ceasing employment in connection with de/fi.liganed bene/fi.ligat plans or other long-term bene/fi.ligats accrued during the employment period are determined separately for each plan, using actuarial assumptions to estimate the amount of the future bene/fi.ligats that employees have accrued at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date (using the projected unit credit method). More speci/fi.ligacally, the present value of the de/fi.liganed bene/fi.ligat obligation is calculated by using a discount rate determined on the basis of market yields at the end of the repo/r\\_t.ligaing",

If there is no deep market for high-quality corporate bonds in the currency in which the bond is denominated, the corresponding yield of government securities is used.\n\nThe liability, net of any plan assets, is recognized on an accrual basis over the vesting period of the related rights. These appraisals are pe/r\\_f.ligaormed by independent actuaries. If the plan assets exceed the present value of the related de/fi.liganed bene/fi.ligat obligation, the surplus (up to the limit of any cap) is recognized as an asset.\n\nAs regards the liabilities/(assets) of de/fi.liganed bene/fi.ligat plans, the cumulative actuarial gains and losses from the actuarial measurement of the liabilities, the return on the plan assets (net of the associated interest income) and the e/ff.ligaect of the asset ceiling (net of the associated interest) are recognized in other comprehensive income when they occur. For other long-term bene/fi.ligats, the related actuarial gains and losses are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nIn the event of a change being made to an existing de/fi.liganed bene/fi.ligat plan or the introduction of a new plan, any past service cost is recognized immediately in pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nIn addition, the Group is involved in de/fi.liganed contribution plans under which it pays /fi.ligaxed contributions to a separate entity (a fund) and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay fu/r\\_t.ligaher contributions if the fund does not hold suf/fi.ligacient assets to pay all employee bene/fi.ligats relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. Such plans are usually aimed to supplement pension bene/fi.ligats due to employees post-employment. The related costs are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss on the basis of the amount of contributions paid in the period.\n\n## Termination bene/fi.ligats\n\nLiabilities for bene/fi.ligats due to employees for the early termination of employee service arise out of the Group's decision to terminate an employee's employment before the normal retirement date or an employee's decision to accept an o/ff.ligaer of bene/fi.ligats in exchange for the termination of employment. The event that gives rise to an obligation is the termination of employment rather than employee service. Termination bene/fi.ligats are recognized at the earlier of the following dates:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nwhen the entity can no longer withdraw its o/ff.ligaer of bene/fi.ligats; and\n\nwhen the entity recognizes a cost for a restructuring that is within the scope of IAS 37 and involves the payment of termination bene/fi.ligats.\n\nThe liabilities are measured on the basis of the nature of the employee bene/fi.ligats. More speci/fi.ligacally, when the bene/fi.ligats represent an enhancement of other post-employment bene/fi.ligats, the associated liability is measured in accordance with the rules governing that type of bene/fi.ligats. Otherwise, if the termination bene/fi.ligats due to employees are expected to be se/t\\_t.ligaled wholly before 12 months of the close of the period in which the bene/fi.ligats are recognized, the entity mea-\n\nsures the liability in accordance with the requirements for sho/r\\_t.liga-term employee bene/fi.ligats; if they are not expected to be se/t\\_t.ligaled wholly before 12 months of the close of period in which the bene/fi.ligats are recognized, the entity measures the liability in accordance with the requirements for other long-term employee bene/fi.ligats.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe Group unde/r\\_t.ligaakes share-based payment transactions se/t\\_t.ligaled with equity instruments as pa/r\\_t.liga of the remuneration policy adopted for the Chief Executive O/ffi.ligacer/General Manager and for key management personnel.\n\nThe  most  recent  long-term  incentive  plans  provide  for the grant to recipients of an incentive represented by an equity component (se/t\\_t.ligaled with equity instruments) and a monetary component (paid in cash), which will accrue if speci/fi.ligac conditions are met. The monetary component is classi/fi.ligaed as a cash-se/t\\_t.ligaled transaction if it is based on the price (or value) of the equity instruments of the company that issued the plan or, in other cases, as another longterm employee bene/fi.ligat.\n\nIn order to se/t\\_t.ligale the equity component through the bonus award of Enel shares, a program for the purchase of treasury shares to suppo/r\\_t.liga these plans was approved. For more details on share-based incentive plans, please see note 53 'Share-based payments'.\n\nFor the equity component, the Group recognizes the services rendered by employees as personnel expenses over the period in which the conditions for remaining in service and for achieving ce/r\\_t.ligaain results must be satis/fi.ligaed (vesting period) and indirectly estimates their value, and the corresponding increase in a speci/fi.ligac equity item, on the basis of the fair value of the equity instruments (i.e., the issuer shares) at the grant date. This fair value is based on the observable market price of the share, taking account of the terms and conditions under which the shares were granted (with the exception of vesting conditions excluded from the measurement of fair value).\n\nThe overall expense recognized is adjusted at each repo/r\\_t.ligaing date until the vesting date to re/fl.ligaect the best estimate available to the Group of the number of equity instruments for which the service and pe/r\\_f.ligaormance conditions other than market conditions will be satis/fi.ligaed, so that the amount recognized at the end is based on the e/ff.ligaective number of equity instruments that satisfy the service and pe/r\\_f.ligaormance conditions other than market conditions at the vesting date.\n\nNo expense is recognized for awards which ultimately do not vest because the pe/r\\_f.ligaormance conditions other than market conditions and/or the service conditions have not been satis/fi.ligaed. Conversely, the transactions are considered to have vested irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting conditions are satis/fi.ligaed, provided that all other vesting conditions are met.\n\nIf the incentive based on equity instruments is paid in cash,",

Subsequently, and until its extinction, the liability is remeasured at fair value at each repo/r\\_t.ligaing date, considering the best possible estimate of the incentive that will vest, with changes in fair value recognized under personnel expenses. If the right to receive the monetary incentive does not vest because one or more conditions are not met, the related liability is reversed.\n\nProvisions for risks and charges\n\nProvisions are recognized where there is a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event at the end of the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period, the se/t\\_t.ligalement of which is expected to result in an out/fl.ligaow of resources whose amount can be reliably estimated.

Where the liability relates to decommissioning and/or site restoration in respect of prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment, the initial recognition of the provision is made against the related asset and the expense is then recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss through the depreciation of the asset involved. Where the liability regards the treatment and storage of nuclear waste and other radioactive materials, the provision is recognized against the related operating costs. A liability for restructuring refers to a program planned and controlled by management that materially changes the scope of a business unde/r\\_t.ligaaken by the Group or the manner in which the business is conducted. Such a liability is recognized when a constructive obligation is established, i.e., when the Group has approved a detailed formal restructuring plan and has sta/r\\_t.ligaed to implement the plan or has announced its main features to those a/ff.ligaected by it. Provisions do not include liabilities in respect of unce/r\\_t.ligaain income tax treatments that are recognized as tax liabilities. The Group could provide a warranty in connection with the sale of a product (whether a good or service) from contracts with customers in the scope of IFRS 15, in accordance with the contract, the law or its customary business practices. In this case, the Group assesses whether the warranty provides the customer with assurance that the related product will function as the pa/r\\_t.ligaies intended because it complies with agreed-upon speci/fi.ligacations or whether the warranty provides the customer with a service in addition to the assurance that the product complies\n\nwith agreed-upon speci/fi.ligacations.\n\nAfter the assessment, if the Group establishes that an assurance warranty is provided, it recognizes a separate warranty liability and corresponding expense when transferring the product to the customer, as additional costs of providing goods or services, without a/t\\_t.ligaributing any of the transaction price (and therefore revenue) to the warranty. The liability is measured and presented as a provision.\n\nOtherwise, if the Group determines that a service warranty is provided, it accounts for the promised warranty as a pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation in accordance with IFRS 15, recognizing the contract liability as revenue over the period the warranty service is provided and the costs associated as they are incurred.\n\nFinally, if the warranty includes both an assurance element and a service element and the Group cannot reasonably account for them separately, then it accounts for both of the warranties together as a single pe/r\\_f.ligaormance obligation.\n\nIn the case of contracts in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract exceed the economic bene/fi.ligats expected to be received under it (onerous contracts), the Group recognizes a provision as the lower of the excess of unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations (i.e., costs that relate directly to the contract, whether incremental or resulting from an allotment of other costs) under the contract over the economic bene/fi.ligats expected to be received under it and any compensation or penalty arising from failure to ful/fi.ligal it.\n\nChanges in estimates of accruals to the provisions addressed here are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss in the period in which the changes occur, with the exception of those in the costs of decommissioning, retiring and/or restoration resulting from changes in the timetable and costs necessary to extinguish the obligation or from a change in the discount rate. These changes increase or decrease the carrying amount of the related assets and are taken to pro/fi.ligat or loss through depreciation. Where they increase the carrying amount of the assets, it is also determined whether the new carrying amount of the assets is fully recoverable. If this is not the case, a loss equal to the unrecoverable amount is recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nDecreases in estimates are recognized up to the carrying amount of the assets. Any excess is recognized immediately in pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nFor more information on the estimation criteria adopted in determining provisions for retiring and/or restoration of prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment, especially those associated with decommissioning nuclear power plants and storage of waste fuel and other radioactive materials, please see note 2.1 'Use of estimates and management judgment'.\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers\n\nThe Group recognizes revenue from contracts with customers at an amount that re/fl.ligaects the consideration at",

The loan is initially recognized and measured at fair value and the government grant is measured as the di/ff.ligaerence between the initial carrying amount of the loan and the funds received. The loan is subsequently measured in accordance with the requirements for /fi.liganancial liabilities. Government grants are recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Group recognizes as expenses the costs that the grants are intended to compensate.\n\nWhere the Group receives government grants in the form of a transfer of a non-monetary asset for the use of the Group, it accounts for both the grant and the asset at the fair value of the non-monetary asset received at the date of the transfer.\n\nCapital grants, including non-monetary grants at fair value, i.e., those received to purchase, build or otherwise acquire non-current assets (for example, an item of prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment or an intangible asset), are deducted from the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in pro/fi.ligat or loss over the depreciable/amo/r\\_t.ligaizable life of the asset as a reduction in the depreciation/amo/r\\_t.ligaization charge. If there is insu/ffi.ligacient information to enable adequate a/t\\_t.ligaribution to the /fi.ligaxed assets to which they refer, capital grants are recognized as deferred income under other liabilities, and credited to pro/fi.ligat or loss on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset.",

The amendments are intended to replace a reference to the de/fi.liganitions of assets and liabilities provided by the Revised Conceptual Framework for Financial Repo/r\\_t.ligaing issued in March 2018 (Conceptual Framework) without signi/fi.ligacantly changing its provisions.\n\nThe amendments also add to IFRS 3 a requirement that, for transactions and other events within the scope of 'IAS 37 - Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets' or 'IFRIC 21 - Levies', an acquirer applies IAS 37 or IFRIC 21 (instead of the Conceptual Framework) to identify the liabilities it has assumed in a business combination.\n\nFinally, the amendments clarify the existing guidelines in IFRS 3 for contingent assets acquired in a business combination, specifying that, if it is not sure that an asset exists at the acquisition date, the contingent asset shall not be recognized.\n\n' Amendments to IAS 16 - Prope/r\\_t.ligay, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use ', issued in May 2020. The amendments prohibit a company from deducting from the cost of prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment amounts received from selling items produced while the company is preparing the asset for its intended use. Instead, a company will recognize such sales proceeds and related cost in pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\n' Amendments to IAS 37 - Onerous Contracts - Costs of Ful/fi.ligalling a Contract ', issued in May 2020. The amendments specify which costs an entity includes in determining the cost of ful/fi.ligalling a contract for the purpose of assessing whether the contract is onerous. To this end, the cost of ful/fi.ligalling a contract comprises the costs that relate directly to the contract. These consist of the incremental costs of ful/fi.ligalling that contract or the allotment of other costs that relate directly to ful/fi.ligalling contracts.\n\n' Annual improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020 ', issued in May 2020. The document mainly comprises amendments to the following standards:\n\n-\n\nFirst-Time Adoption of International Financial Repo/r\\_t.liga-\n\ning Standards '; the amendment simpli/fi.ligaes the application of IFRS 1 by an investee (subsidiary, associate or joint venture) that becomes a /fi.ligarst-time adopter of IFRS Standards after its parent has already adopted them. More speci/fi.ligacally, if the investee adopts the IFRSs after its parent and applies IFRS 1.D16 (a), then the  investee  can  elect  to  measure  the  cumulative translation di/ff.ligaerences for all foreign operations at the amounts that would be included in the parent's consolidated /fi.liganancial statements, based on parent's date of transition to the IFRSs;\n\n- ' IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments '; with regard to fees included in the '10 per cent' test for derecognition of  /fi.liganancial  liabilities,  the  amendment  clari/fi.ligaes  the fees that an entity includes when assessing whether the terms of a new or modi/fi.ligaed /fi.liganancial liability are substantially di/ff.ligaerent from the terms of the original /fi.liganancial liability. In determining those fees paid net of fees received, the borrower shall include only fees paid or received between the borrower and the lender, including fees paid or received by either the borrower or lender on the other pa/r\\_t.ligay's behalf;\n\n- ' IFRS 16 - Leases '; the International Accounting Standards Board amended Illustrative Example 13 accompanying 'IFRS 16 - Leases'. Speci/fi.ligacally, the amendment eliminates the potential for confusion in the application of IFRS 16 created by the way in which Illustrative  Example  13  had  illustrated  the  requirements for lease incentives. The example had included a reimbursement relating to leasehold improvements without explaining whether the reimbursement quali/fi.ligaed as a lease incentive. The amendment removes the illustration of a reimbursement relating to leasehold improvements from the example;\n\n- ' IAS 41 - Agriculture '; the amendment removes the requirement for entities to exclude cash /fl.ligaows for taxation when measuring fair value. Accordingly, entities shall use pre-tax cash /fl.ligaows and a pre-tax rate to discount those cash /fl.ligaows.\n\nThe application of the amendments for 2022 did not have a material impact on these consolidated /fi.liganancial statements .",

Argentina - Hyperin/fl.ligaationary economy:\n\nimpact of the application of IAS 29\n\nAs from July 1, 2018, the Argentine economy has been considered hyperin/fl.ligaationary based on the criteria established by 'IAS 29 - Financial repo/r\\_t.ligaing in hyperin/fl.ligaationary economies'.

The associated tax e/ff.ligaect was recognized in taxes for the year.\n\nIn order to also take account of the impact of hyperin/fl.ligaation on the exchange rate of the local currency, the income state-\n\nment balances expressed in the hyperin/fl.ligaationary currency have been translated into the Group's presentation currency (euro) applying, in accordance with IAS 21, the closing exchange rate rather than the average rate for the year in order to adjust these amounts to present values.\n\nThe cumulative changes in the general price indices from December 31, 2018 until December 31, 2022 are shown in the following table:\n\n| Periods                                   | Cumulative change  in general consumer  price index   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| From July 1, 2009 to December 31, 2018    | 346.30%                                               |\n| From January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 | 54.46%                                                |\n| From January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 | 35.41%                                                |\n| From January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021 | 49.73%                                                |\n| From January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022 | 97.08%                                                |\n\nIn 2022, the application of IAS 29 generated net /fi.liganancial income (gross of tax) of \u20ac290 million.\n\nThe following tables repo/r\\_t.liga the e/ff.ligaects of IAS 29 on the balance at December 31, 2022 and the impact of hyperin/fl.ligaation on the main income statement items for 2022, di/ff.ligaerentiating between that concerning the revaluation on the basis of the general consumer price index and that due to the application of the closing exchange rate rather than the average exchange rate for the period, in accordance with the provisions of IAS 21 for hyperin/fl.ligaationary economies.\n\nMillions of euro\n\n|                   | Cumulative hyperin/fl.ligaation  e/ff.ligaect at Dec. 31, 2021   | Hyperin/fl.ligaation e/ff.ligaect for the  period   | Exchange di/ff.ligaerences   | Cumulative hyperin/fl.ligaation  e/ff.ligaect at Dec. 31, 2022   |\n|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Total assets      | 1,366                                                            | 1,183                                               | (560)                        | 1,989                                                            |\n| Total liabilities | 346                                                              | 359                                                 | (150)                        | 555                                                              |\n| Equity            | 1,020                                                            | 824 (1)                                             | (410)                        | 1,434                                                            |\n\n## Millions of euro\n\n| Revenue                                                                | IAS 29 e/ff.ligaect 254   | IAS 21 e/ff.ligaect (356)   | Total e/ff.ligaect at Dec. 31, 2022 (102)   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Costs                                                                  | 280 (1)                   | (449) (2)                   | (169)                                       |\n| Operating pro/fi.ligat                                                 | (26)                      | 93                          | 67                                          |\n| Net /fi.liganancial income/(expense)                                   | (46)                      | (1)                         | (47)                                        |\n| Net income/(expense) from hyperin/fl.ligaation                         | 290                       | -

Climate change disclosures\n\nThe move towards 'net zero' is under way worldwide and the processes of decarbonization and electri/fi.ligacation of the global economy are crucial to avoiding the serious consequences of an increase in temperatures of over 1.5 \u00b0C.\n\nWith this outlook, the Group has set its strategic guidelines as follows:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nallocate  capital  to  suppo/r\\_t.liga  a  decarbonized  electricity supply;\n\n- enable the electri/fi.ligacation of customers' energy demand; leverage the creation of value along the value chain;\n\nbring forward achievement of the sustainable 'net-zero' goals to 2040.\n\nConsidering the risks related to climate change and the commitments established under the Paris Agreement, the\n\nGroup has decided to achieve the carbon neutrality objectives in advance and re/fl.ligaect its impact on assets, liabilities, and pro/fi.ligat or loss, highlighting its signi/fi.ligacant and foreseeable impacts as required under the Conceptual Framework of the international accounting standards.\n\nIn this regard, in accordance with the provisions of the document published by the IFRS Foundation on November 20, 2020, the Group provides explicit information in the notes to these consolidated /fi.liganancial statements regarding how climate change is re/fl.ligaected in our accounts.\n\nFor a more e/ff.ligaective and comprehensive communication concerning climate change disclosures prepared as pa/r\\_t.liga of the notes to these consolidated /fi.liganancial statements, we have mapped this disclosure as shown below, providing references to the various sections where issues associated with climate change are addressed.\n\n| Topic

The transaction was closed with the ful/fi.ligallment of the conditions to which the sale was subject, including authorization of the operation by the President of the Russian Federation pursuant to paragraph 5 of Decree 520 of August 5, 2022.\n\nUpon completion of the sale, Enel sold all power generation assets in Russia, which include approximately 5.6 GW of conventional capacity and approximately 300 MW of wind capacity at various stages of development, ensuring continuity for its employees and customers.\n\nThe  overall  transaction  had  a  negative  impact  on  the Group's pro/fi.ligat of about \u20ac1,551 million, mainly re/fl.ligaecting the release of the translation reserve of \u20ac1,054 million, and the value adjustment of about \u20ac497 million.\n\nFor more information, please see the section on 'Main acquisitions and disposals during the year'.\n\n## Romania\n\nOn December 14, 2022, Enel SpA entered into an Exclusivity Agreement with Greek company Public Power Corporation SA (PPC) in relation to the potential disposal of all the equity stakes held by Enel Group in Romania. In this regard, the value of the net assets of Enel Romania was adjusted to the expected sale price, with recognition of a value adjustment of \u20ac696 million.

The negative e/ff.ligaect was pa/r\\_t.ligaially o/ff.ligaset by the increase in the consolidation scope mainly re/fl.ligaecting the acquisition of Enel Hydro Appennino Centrale Srl (\u20ac349 million) and 'Exchange di/ff.ligaerences' (a positive \u20ac147 million) mainly regarding Brazil, Chile and the United States.\n\nThe criteria used to identify the cash generating units (CGUs) are based on revenue separation, which is considered the main criterion in view of the nature of our business, taking due account of the operational rules and regulations of the markets in which they operate and the corporate organization. For the purposes of impairment testing of goodwill, the CGUs are grouped on the basis of expected synergies, consistent with management's strategic and operational vision, within the operating segments identi/fi.ligaed for segment repo/r\\_t.ligaing purposes.\n\nNote also that in 2022 the existing CGUs underwent extensive analysis to assess the possible presence of signi/fi.ligacant changes pursuant to IAS 36, paragraph 72.\n\nThis analysis led to the modi/fi.ligacation of the existing CGUs only for Enel X Way, a new global business established from the spin-o/ff.liga of electric mobility operations from Enel X.\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the new Enel X No/r\\_t.ligah America CGU was identi/fi.ligaed.\n\nThe recoverable amount of the goodwill recognized was estimated by calculating the value in use of the CGUs or groups of CGUs using discounted cash /fl.ligaow models, which involve estimating expected future cash /fl.ligaows and applying an appropriate discount rate, selected on the basis of market inputs such as risk-free rates, betas and market-risk premiums.\n\nCash /fl.ligaows were determined on the basis of the best information available at the time of the estimate, taking account of the speci/fi.ligac risks of individual CGU or groups of CGUs, and drawn:\n\n\u00b7\n\nfor the explicit period, from the Business Plan approved by the Board of Directors of the Parent on November 21, 2022, containing forecasts for volumes, revenue, operating costs, capital expenditure, industrial and commercial organization and developments in the main macroeconomic variables (in/fl.ligaation, nominal interest rates and ex-\n\n\u00b7\n\nchange rates) and commodity prices. The explicit period of cash /fl.ligaows considered in impairment testing was three years;\n\nfor subsequent years, from assumptions concerning longterm developments in the main variables that determine cash /fl.ligaows, the average residual useful life of assets or the duration of the concessions.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, the terminal value is calculated based on the speci/fi.ligac characteristics of the businesses related to the various CGUs or groups of CGUs subject to impairment testing:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nperpetuity, for the businesses of large-hydro (LH) power generation and of distribution, in which the licenses and public concessions are of a long-term nature and are easily renewable; as well as for the Enel X and Enel X Way businesses, as they feature the development of speci/fi.ligac knowhow that is sustainable over the long term;\n\nannuity, for CGUs or groups of CGUs that are predominantly characterized by retail business, for which the residual life is, therefore, essentially correlated with the average duration of the customer relationships; as well as for businesses of conventional thermal power generation (Generation and Trading). This method is also used for the renewable energy (Enel Green Power) businesses to take account of: (i) the value resulting from the remaining useful lives of the plants; and (ii) the residual value, in the event of plant decommissioning, associated with licensing rights, the competitiveness of the production facilities (in terms of natural resources), and network interconnectivity.\n\nThe nominal growth rate (g-rate) is equal to the long-term rate of growth in electricity and/or in/fl.ligaation (depending on the country and business involved) and in any case no higher than the average long-term growth rate of the reference market.\n\nThe Group therefore con/fi.ligarmed its strategic direction based on the trends associated with the energy transition. The use of capital has been focused on:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\ndecarbonization  through  the  gradual  development  of generation assets that use renewable sources and the simultaneous exit from coal and gas-/fi.ligared electricity production (by 2040);\n\nelectri/fi.ligacation of energy consumption, with the incentive of new products and services for end users and the simultaneous gradual exit from gas sales to end users (by 2040); digitization  and  upgrading  of  distribution  networks,  to cope with the energy transition under way and guarantee quality of service to customers.",

In any event, GHG emissions covered by all of the above targets are equal, on the whole, to 98.7% of total Scope 1 and 2 emissions in 2022, and therefore exceed the threshold of 95% required under the Science Based Target initiative.\n- (3) The target is in line with the path to 1.5 \u00b0C set by the SBTi for the electrical services industry (Sectoral Decarbonization Approach, or SDA), although it could not be o/ffi.ligacially validated because the SBTi does not ce/r\\_t.ligaify targets over a time frame of less than /fi.ligave years from the presentation date.\n- (4) The target could not be o/ffi.ligacially validated because the SBTi does not ce/r\\_t.ligaify targets over a time frame of less than /fi.ligave years from the presentation date. In addition, the SBTi has not de/fi.liganed a Sectoral Decarbonization Approach for these types of emissions, so the ambition level cannot be veri/fi.ligaed.\n- (5) Two di/ff.ligaerent percentage limits have been set for the target for Scope 3 GHG emissions by the supply chain, as allowed under the SBTi approach, which required coverage of at least 67% of Scope 3 emissions for the 2030 target, and at least 90% for the 2040 target.",

Gas price tensions are expected to ease in the coming years in light of a realignment between supply and demand at the global level. Finally, the price of oil is expected to stabilize, with peak demand coming around 2030.\n\nNote also that the Group has used sensitivity analyses to take account of the impacts of climate change in the long term.

In general, the costs are quanti/fi.ligaed on the basis of a standard contract between Enresa  and  the  electricity  companies  approved  by  the Ministry for the Economy in September 2001, which regulates the retirement and closing of nuclear power plants. The time horizon envisaged, three years, corresponds to the period from the termination of power generation to the  transfer  of  plant  management  to  Enresa  (so-called\n\npost-operational  costs)  and  takes  account,  among  the various assumptions used to estimate the amount, of the quantity of unused nuclear fuel expected at the date of closure of each of the Spanish nuclear plants on the basis of the provisions of the concession agreement.\n\nSite retirement, removal and restoration\n\nprovision\n\nThis provision represents the present value of the estimated cost for the retirement and removal of non-nuclear plants where there is a legal or constructive obligation to do so. The provision mainly regarded the Endesa Group and Enel Produzione. The change in the provision in 2022",

It includes an estimate of the potential liability relating to disputes that arose during the year, as well as revised estimates of the potential costs associated with disputes initiated in prior years, based on the indications of internal and external consultants. The balance for litigation mainly regards the companies in Latin America (\u20ac395 million), Spain (\u20ac169 million) and Italy (\u20ac127 million).\n\nThe decrease compared with the previous year, equal to \u20ac131 million, mainly re/fl.ligaects the decrease in the provision in Brazil following the deconsolidation of Celg-D.\n\nProvision for environmental ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates\n\nThe provision for environmental ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates covers costs in respect of sho/r\\_t.ligafalls in the environmental ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates need for  compliance  with  national  or  supranational  environmental protection requirements and mainly regards Iberia (Endesa Energ\u00eda and Endesa Generaci\u00f3n SA).\n\nProvision for taxes and duties\n\nThe provision for taxes and duties covers the estimated liability deriving from tax disputes concerning direct and indirect taxes.\n\nThe balance of the provision also includes the provision for current and potential disputes concerning local property tax (whether the Imposta Comunale sugli Immobili (ICI) or the Imposta Municipale Unica (IMU)) in Italy. In Italy, the Group has taken due account of developments in land registry regulations (which with e/ff.ligaect from January 1, 2016 excluded machinery, devices, equipment and other plant speci/fi.ligac to a production process from the calculation of the imputed rent for buildings classi/fi.ligaed in land registry group D, which includes generation plants) in estimating the liability for such taxes, both for the purposes of quantifying the probable risk associated with pending litigation and generating a reasonable valuation of probable future charges on positions that have not yet been assessed by the Revenue Agency and municipalities.\n\nOther provisions\n\nOther provisions cover various risks and charges, mainly in connection with regulatory disputes and disputes with local authorities regarding various duties and fees or other charges.\n\nThe decrease of \u20ac49 million in other provisions is mainly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to Enel Global Trading for uses of provisions for insurance compensation.\n\nProvision for early retirement incentives and\n\nother restructuring plans\n\nThe  provision  for  early  retirement  incentives  and  other restructuring plans includes the estimated charges related to binding agreements for the voluntary termination of employment contracts in response to organizational needs. The reduction of \u20ac305 million for the year mainly re/fl.ligaects uses of provisions for incentives established in previous period in Spain ( Acuerdo de Salida Voluntaria ) and Italy to cover the early termination of employment for certain employees.\n\nProvision for restructuring programs\n\nconnected with the energy transition\n\nEnel, in its role as a leader of the energy transition, has placed decarbonization and growth of renewables around the world at the center of its strategy.\n\nIn this context, Enel has begun restructuring the activities associated with the energy transition process, which involves thermal generation plants in all the geographical areas in which the Group operates. The consequent revision of processes and operating models will require changes in the roles and skills of employees, which the Group intends to implement with highly sustainable plans based on redeployment programs, with major upskilling and reskilling plans and voluntary individual early retirement agreements. The energy transition is also based on the progressive and expansive development of digital tools, as digitization is essential to responding to multiple external forces and making informed and well-considered decisions at every level within the Group.",

This approach, based on an assessment of any significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, is pe/r\\_f.ligaormed comparing the PD at origination with PD at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date, at each repo/r\\_t.ligaing date.\n\nThen, based on the results of the assessment, a loss allowance is recognized based on 12-month ECL or lifetime ECL (i.e., staging):\n\n- 12-month ECL, for /fi.liganancial assets for which there has not been a signi/fi.ligacant increase in credit risk since initial recognition;\n\n- lifetime ECL, for /fi.liganancial assets for which there has been a signi/fi.ligacant increase in credit risk or which are credit impaired (i.e., defaulted based on past due information);\n\nthe simpli/fi.ligaed approach, for trade receivables, contract assets and lease receivables with or without a signi/fi.ligacant /fi.liganancing  component,  based  on  lifetime  ECL  without tracking changes in credit risk.\n\n\u00b7\n\nA forward-looking adjustment can be applied considering qualitative and quantitative information in order to re/fl.ligaect future  events  and  macroeconomic  developments  that could impact the risk associated with the po/r\\_t.ligafolio or /fi.liganancial instrument.\n\nDepending on the nature of the /fi.liganancial assets and the credit risk information available, the assessment of the increase in credit risk can be pe/r\\_f.ligaormed on:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nan individual basis, if the receivables are individually signi/fi.ligacant and for all receivables which have been individually identi/fi.ligaed for impairment based on reasonable and suppo/r\\_t.ligaable information;\n\na collective basis, if no reasonable and suppo/r\\_t.ligaable information is available without undue cost or e/ff.ligao/r\\_t.liga to measure expected credit losses on an individual instrument basis.\n\nWhen there is no reasonable expectation of recovering a /fi.liganancial asset in its entirety or a po/r\\_t.ligaion thereof, the gross carrying amount of the /fi.liganancial asset shall be reduced. A write-o/ff.liga represents a derecognition event (e.g., the right to cash /fl.ligaows is legally or contractually extinguished, transferred or expired).",

Accordingly, beyond this time limit, trade receivables are presumed to be credit impaired); and\n\nspeci/fi.ligac clusters are de/fi.liganed on the basis of speci/fi.ligac markets, business and risk characteristics.\n\nContract assets substantially have the same risk character-\n\nistics as trade receivables for the same types of contracts. In order to measure the ECL for trade receivables on a collective basis, as well as for contract assets, the Group uses the following assumptions regarding the ECL parameters:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nPD, assumed equal to the average default rate, is calculated by cluster and considering historical data from at least 24 months;\n\nLGD is a function of the recovery rates for each cluster, discounted using the e/ff.ligaective interest rate; and\n\nEAD is estimated as equal to the carrying amount at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date net of cash deposits, including invoices issued but not past due and invoices to be issued.\n\nDespite the deterioration in the collection status of ce/r\\_t.ligaain customer segments, which was taken into consideration in determining impairment of trade receivables, the Group's po/r\\_t.ligafolio has so far demonstrated resilience to the macroeconomic context and the current price scenario. This re/fl.ligaects the expansion of digital collection channels and a solid diversi/fi.ligacation of commercial customers.\n\nThe following table repo/r\\_t.ligas changes in the allowance for expected credit losses on loan assets in accordance with the general approach.\n\n| Millions of euro                  | ECL 12-month allowance   | ECL lifetime allowance   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Opening balance at Jan. 1, 2021   | 65                       | 143                      |\n| Accruals                          | -                        | 9                        |\n| Uses                              | -                        | -                        |\n| Reversals to pro/fi.ligat or loss | (25)                     | (9)                      |\n| Other changes                     | 25                       | 26                       |\n| Closing balance at Dec. 31, 2021  | 65                       | 169                      |\n| Opening balance at Jan. 1, 2022   | 65                       | 169                      |\n| Accruals                          | 22                       | 5                        |\n| Uses                              | -                        | -                        |\n| Reversals to pro/fi.ligat or loss | -                        | (11)                     |\n| Other changes                     | (58)                     | 56                       |\n| Closing balance at Dec. 31, 2022  | 29                       | 219                      |",

change of control clauses, under which the borrower and, in some cases, the guarantor could be required to renegotiate the terms and conditions of the /fi.liganancing or make compulsory early repayment of the loans granted; rating clauses, which provide for the borrower or the guarantor to maintain their rating above a ce/r\\_t.ligaain spec-\n\ni/fi.ligaed level;\n\ncross-default clauses, under which the occurrence of a default event in respect of a speci/fi.ligaed /fi.liganancial liability (above a threshold level) of the issuer or, in some cases, the guarantor constitutes a default in respect of the liabilities in question, which become immediately repayable.\n\nSome loan contracts entered into by Enel SpA, including as guarantor, provide for some additional covenants, such as:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nthe commitment to use the loan exclusively to hedge collateral for trading activities on the energy markets;\n\na 'reputational damage' clause, under which the lending bank can request the cancellation of its /fi.liganancial commitment unde/r\\_t.ligaaken by it and the early payment of the sums disbursed if it has su/ff.ligaered asce/r\\_t.ligaained harm to its own reputation or that of other persons as a result of substantial breach of ce/r\\_t.ligaain regulations;\n\nthe commitment, also of the guarantor, to ensure compliance with ce/r\\_t.ligaain environmental and social regulations and standards.",

Risk management\n\nFinancial risk management governance and\n\nobjectives\n\nAs pa/r\\_t.liga of its operations, the Enel Group is exposed to a variety of /fi.liganancial risks, notably interest rate risk, commodity risk, currency risk, credit and counterpa/r\\_t.ligay risk and liquidity risk.\n\nEnel's primary objective is to mitigate /fi.liganancial risks appropriately so that they do not give rise to unexpected changes in results.\n\nThe following sections detail the above /fi.liganancial risks.\n\nThere were no changes in the sources of exposure to such risks compared with the previous year.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk derives primarily from the use of /fi.liganancial instruments and manifests itself as unexpected changes in charges on /fi.liganancial liabilities, if indexed to /fl.ligaoating rates and/or exposed to the unce/r\\_t.ligaainty of /fi.liganancial terms and conditions in negotiating new debt instruments, or as an unexpected change in the value of /fi.liganancial instruments measured at fair value (such as /fi.ligaxed-rate debt).\n\nThe  main  /fi.liganancial  liabilities  held  by  the  Group  include bonds, bank borrowings, borrowings from other lenders, commercial paper, derivatives, cash deposits received to secure  commercial  or  derivative  contracts  (guarantees, cash collateral).\n\nThe Enel Group mainly manages interest rate risk through the de/fi.liganition of an optimal /fi.liganancial structure, with the dual goal of stabilizing borrowing costs and containing the cost of funds.\n\nThis goal is pursued through the diversi/fi.ligacation of the po/r\\_t.ligafolio of /fi.liganancial liabilities by contract type, maturity and interest rate, and modifying the risk pro/fi.ligale of speci/fi.ligac exposures using OTC derivatives, mainly interest rate swaps and interest rate options. The term of such derivatives does not exceed the maturity of the underlying /fi.liganancial liability, so that any change in the fair value and/or expected cash /fl.ligaows of such contracts is o/ff.ligaset by a corresponding change in the fair value and/or cash /fl.ligaows of the hedged position.\n\nProxy hedging techniques can be used in a number of residual circumstances, when the hedging instruments for",

Enel also uses various types of derivative, typically on the OTC market.\n\nThe derivatives in the Group's po/r\\_t.ligafolio of /fi.liganancial instruments include cross currency interest rate swaps, currency forwards and currency swaps. The term of such contracts does not exceed the maturity of the underlying instrument, so that any change in the fair value and/or expected cash /fl.ligaows of such instruments o/ff.ligasets the corresponding change in the fair value and/or cash /fl.ligaows of the hedged position.\n\nCross currency interest rate swaps are used to transform a long-term /fi.liganancial liability denominated in currency other than the presentation currency into an equivalent liability in the presentation currency.\n\nCurrency forwards are contracts in which the counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies agree to exchange principal amounts denominat-\n\ned in di/ff.ligaerent currencies at a speci/fi.ligaed future date and exchange rate (the strike). Such contracts may call for the actual exchange of the two principal amounts (deliverable forwards) or payment of the di/ff.ligaerence generated by differences between the strike exchange rate and the prevailing exchange rate at maturity (non-deliverable forwards). In the la/t\\_t.ligaer case, the strike rate and/or the spot rate can be determined as averages of the rates observed in a given period.\n\nCurrency swaps are contracts in which the counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies enter into two transactions of the opposite sign at di/ff.ligaerent future dates (normally one spot, the other forward) that provide for the exchange of principal denominated in different currencies.\n\nThe following table repo/r\\_t.ligas the notional amount of transactions outstanding at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, broken down by type of hedged item.\n\n| Millions of euro                                                                                       | Notional amount   | Notional amount   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                                                                                                        | at Dec. 31, 2022  | at Dec. 31, 2021  |\n| Cross currency interest rate swaps (CCIRSs) hedging debt denominated in currencies other than the euro | 28,444            | 21,123            |\n| Currency forwards hedging currency risk on commodities                                                 | 8,392             | 6,183             |\n| Currency forwards/CCIRSs hedging future cash /fl.ligaows in currencies other than the euro             | 5,333             | 5,034             |\n| Other currency forwards                                                                                | 1,497             | 926               |\n| Total                                                                                                  | 43,666            | 33,266            |\n\n## More speci/fi.ligacally, these include:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nCCIRSs with a notional amount of \u20ac28,444 million to hedge the currency risk on debt denominated in currencies other than the euro (\u20ac21,123 million at December 31, 2021);\n\ncurrency forwards and cross currency swaps with a total notional amount of \u20ac13,725 million used to hedge the currency risk associated with purchases of natural gas and fuel and expected cash /fl.ligaows in currencies other than the euro (\u20ac11,217 million at December 31, 2021); changes in the notional amount during the year were a/ff.ligaected by a greater exposure to exchange rate risk, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular towards the US dollar, following the increase in natural gas prices and the increase in the use of coal for electricity generation;\n\nother currency forwards, which include OTC derivatives transactions carried out to mitigate currency risk on expected cash /fl.ligaows in currencies other than the presentation currency connected with the purchase of investment goods in the renewables and infrastructure and networks sectors (new generation digital meters), on operating costs for the supply of cloud services and on revenue from the sale of renewable energy.

The resid-\n\nual exposure in respect of the sale of energy on the spot market not hedged with such contracts is aggregated by uniform risk factors that can be managed with hedging transactions  on  the  market.  Proxy  hedging  techniques can be used for the industrial po/r\\_t.ligafolios when the hedging instruments for the speci/fi.ligac risk factors generating the exposure are not available on the market or are not su/ffi.ligaciently liquid. In addition, Enel uses po/r\\_t.ligafolio hedging techniques to assess oppo/r\\_t.ligaunities for ne/t\\_t.ligaing intercompany exposures.\n\nThe Group mainly uses plain vanilla derivatives for hedging (more speci/fi.ligacally, forwards, swaps, options on commodities, futures, contracts for di/ff.ligaerences).\n\nSome of these products can be indexed to a variety of underlyings (coal, gas, oil, CO 2 , di/ff.ligaerent geographical areas, etc.) and the approaches can be assessed and adapted to speci/fi.ligac needs.\n\nEnel also engages in proprietary trading in order to maintain  a  presence  in  the  Group's  reference  energy  commodity  markets.  These  operations  consist  in  taking  on exposures in energy commodities (oil products, gas, coal, CO 2 ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates and electricity) using /fi.liganancial derivatives and physical contracts traded on regulated and over-thecounter markets, optimizing pro/fi.ligats through transactions carried out on the basis of expected market developments.

Other risks include the reputational and /fi.liganancial risks associated with signi/fi.ligacant exposures to a single counterpa/r\\_t.ligay or groups of related customers, or to counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies operating in the same sector or in the same geographical area.\n\nAccordingly, the exposure to credit and counterpa/r\\_t.ligay risk is a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the following types of transactions:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nthe sale and distribution of electricity and gas in free and regulated markets and the supply of goods and services (trade receivables in respect of non-Group debtors);\n\ntrading activities that involve the physical exchange of assets or transactions in /fi.liganancial instruments (the commodity po/r\\_t.ligafolio);\n\ntrading in derivatives, bank deposits and, more generally, /fi.liganancial instruments (the /fi.liganancial po/r\\_t.ligafolio).\n\nIn order to minimize credit and counterpa/r\\_t.ligay risk, credit  exposures  are  managed  at  the  region/country/global business line level by di/ff.ligaerent units, thereby ensuring the necessary segregation of risk management and control activities. Monitoring the consolidated exposure is carried out by Enel SpA.\n\nIn addition, at the Group level the policy provides for the use of uniform criteria - in all the main regions/countries/ global business lines and at the consolidated level - in measuring commercial credit exposures in order to promptly identify any deterioration in the quality of outstanding receivables and any mitigation actions to be taken.\n\nThe policy for managing credit and counterpa/r\\_t.ligay risk associated with commercial activities provides for a preliminary assessment of the creditwo/r\\_t.ligahiness of counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies and the adoption of mitigation instruments, such as obtaining collateral or unsecured guarantees.\n\nIn addition, the Group unde/r\\_t.ligaakes transactions to factor receivables without recourse, which results in the complete derecognition of the corresponding assets involved in the factoring, as the risks and rewards associated with them have been transferred.\n\nFinally, with regard to /fi.liganancial and commodity transactions, risk mitigation is pursued with a uniform system for assessing counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies at the Group level, including im-\n\nThe impact on pre-tax pro/fi.ligat of shifts of +15% and -15% in the price curve for the main commodities that make up the fuel scenario and the basket of formulas used in the contracts is mainly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the change in the price of electricity, gas and petroleum products and, to a lesser extent, of CO 2 . The impact on equity of the same shifts in the price curve is primarily due to changes in the price of electricity, petroleum products and, to a lesser extent, CO 2 . The Group's exposure to changes in the prices of other commodities is not material.",

The method of recognizing the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.\n\nHedge accounting is applied to derivatives entered into in order to reduce risks such as interest rate risk, currency risk, commodity price risk (including Vi/r\\_t.ligaual PPAs) and net investments in foreign operations when all the criteria provided by IFRS 9 are met.\n\nAt  the  inception  of  the  transaction,  the  Group  documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy. The Group also documents its assessment, both  at  hedge  inception  and  on  an  ongoing  basis,  of whether hedging instruments are highly e/ff.ligaective in o/ff.ligasetting changes in fair values or cash /fl.ligaows of hedged items. For cash /fl.ligaow hedges of forecast transactions designated as hedged items, the Group assesses and documents that they are highly probable and present an exposure to changes in cash /fl.ligaows that a/ff.ligaect pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\npa/r\\_t.ligaies; the net fair value of these derivatives is included in the representation of the Group's net /fi.liganancial debt.\n\nDepending on the nature of the risk exposure, the Group designates derivatives as either:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nfair value hedges;\n\ncash /fl.ligaow hedges.\n\nFor more details about the nature and the extent of risks arising from /fi.liganancial instruments to which the Group is exposed, please see note 49 'Risk management'.\n\nTo be e/ff.ligaective a hedge relationship shall meet all of the following criteria:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nexistence of an economic relationship between hedging instrument and hedged item;\n\nthe e/ff.ligaect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes resulting from the economic relationship;\n\nthe hedge ratio de/fi.liganed at initial designation shall be equal to the one used for risk management purposes (i.e., same quantity of the hedged item that the entity actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses to hedge the quantity of the hedged item).\n\nBased on the IFRS 9 requirements, the existence of an economic relationship is evaluated by the Group through a qualitative assessment or a quantitative computation, depending on the following circumstances:",

This method compares changes in fair value of the hedging instrument and the hypothetical derivative between the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date and the inception date.\n\nThe main causes of hedge ine/ff.ligaectiveness can be the following:\n\n\u00b7\n\nbasis di/ff.ligaerences (i.e., the fair value or cash /fl.ligaows of the hedged item depend on a variable that is di/ff.ligaerent from\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nthe variable that causes the fair value or cash /fl.ligaows of the hedging instrument to change);\n\ntiming di/ff.ligaerences (i.e., the hedged item and hedging instrument occur or are se/t\\_t.ligaled at di/ff.ligaerent dates);\n\nquantity or notional amount di/ff.ligaerences (i.e., the hedged item  and  hedging  instrument  are  based  on  di/ff.ligaerent quantities or notional amounts);\n\nother risks (i.e., changes in the fair value or cash /fl.ligaows of a derivative hedging instrument or hedged item relate to risks other than the speci/fi.ligac risk being hedged);\n\ncredit risk (i.e., the counterpa/r\\_t.ligay credit risk di/ff.ligaerently impact the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments and hedged items).\n\nThe macroeconomic context became pa/r\\_t.ligaicularly unstable in 2022, due to the con/fl.ligaict between Russia and Ukraine, impacting raw material supply chains and causing high price volatility, especially in the energy sector. In this context, the commodity risk was managed e/ff.ligaectively and did not have a signi/fi.ligacant impact on the soundness of hedging relationships, also thanks to the solidity of the integrated po/r\\_t.ligafolio models used in the main European areas in which the Group operates and the geographical diversi/fi.ligacation of our sources of supply. Even credit risk was essentially una/ff.ligaected, as the Group's main trading counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies have a high credit rating or are adequately secured by bank or insurance guarantees.\n\nThe con/fl.ligaict and the di/ffi.ligacult macroeconomic conditions had only a limited impact on the management of interest rate and exchange rate risk, being insu/ffi.ligacient to directly  and  signi/fi.ligacantly  in/fl.ligauence  the  valuation  of  derivative instruments and the outcome of e/ff.ligaectiveness checks of hedges. The volatility that bu/ff.ligaeted /fi.liganancial markets was o/ff.ligaset by risk mitigation actions using derivative /fi.liganancial instruments.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nFair value hedges are used to protect the Group against exposures to changes in the fair value of assets, liabilities or /fi.ligarm commitment a/t\\_t.ligaributable to a pa/r\\_t.ligaicular risk that could a/ff.ligaect pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives that qualify and are designated as hedging instruments are recognized in the income statement, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged item that are a/t\\_t.ligaributable to the hedged risk. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting,  the  adjustment  to  the  carrying  amount  of  a hedged item for which the e/ff.ligaective interest rate method is used is amo/r\\_t.ligaized to pro/fi.ligat or loss over the period to maturity.",

        "page_content": "## Cash /fl.ligaow hedges\n\nCash /fl.ligaow hedges are applied in order to hedge the Group exposure to changes in future cash /fl.ligaows that are a/t\\_t.ligaributable to a pa/r\\_t.ligaicular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or a highly probable transaction that could a/ff.ligaect pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\nThe e/ff.ligaective po/r\\_t.ligaion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash /fl.ligaow hedges is recognized in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ine/ff.ligaective po/r\\_t.ligaion is recognized immediately in the income statement.\n\nAmounts accumulated in equity are reclassi/fi.ligaed to pro/fi.ligat or loss in the periods when the hedged item a/ff.ligaects pro/fi.ligat or loss (for example, when the hedged forecast sale takes place).\n\nIf the hedged item results in the recognition of a non-/fi.liganancial asset (i.e., prope/r\\_t.ligay, plant and equipment or inventories, etc.) or a non-/fi.liganancial liability, or a hedged forecast transaction for a non-/fi.liganancial asset or a non-/fi.liganancial liability becomes a /fi.ligarm commitment for which fair value hedge accounting is applied, the amount accumulated in equity (i.e., hedging reserve) shall be removed and included in the initial amount (cost or other carrying amount) of the\n\nasset or the liability hedged (i.e., 'basis adjustment'). When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognized when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognized in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was repo/r\\_t.ligaed in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement. For hedge relationships using forwards as a hedging instrument, where only the change in the value of the spot element  is  designated  as  the  hedging  instrument,  accounting for the forward element (pro/fi.ligat or loss vs OCI) is de/fi.liganed case by case. This approach is actually applied by the Group for hedging of currency risk on renewables assets.\n\nConversely, for hedge relationships using cross currency interest rate swaps as hedging instruments, the Group separates foreign currency basis spread, in designating the hedging derivative, and present them in other comprehensive income (OCI) as hedging costs.\n\nWith speci/fi.ligac regard to cash /fl.ligaow hedges of commodity risk, in order to improve their consistency with the risk management strategy, the Enel Group applies a dynamic hedge accounting approach based on speci/fi.ligac liquidity requirements (the so-called liquidity-based approach).\n\nThis approach requires the designation of hedges through the use of the most liquid derivatives available on the market and replacing them with others that are more e/ff.ligaective in covering the risk in question.\n\nConsistent with the risk management strategy, the liquidity-based approach allows the roll-over of a derivative by replacing it with a new derivative, not only in the event of expiry but also during the hedge relationship, if and only if the new derivative meets both of the following requirements:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nit represents a best proxy of the old derivative in terms of ranking;\n\nit meets speci/fi.ligac liquidity requirements.\n\nSatisfaction of these requirements is veri/fi.ligaed qua/r\\_t.ligaerly. At the roll-over date, the hedge relationship is not discontinued. Accordingly, sta/r\\_t.ligaing from that date, changes in the e/ff.ligaective fair value of the new derivative will be recognized in equity (the hedging reserve), while changes in the fair value of the old derivative are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss.\n\n## Reform of benchmarks for the determination of interest rates - IBOR reform\n\nOverview\n\nInterbank O/ff.ligaered Rates ('IBORs') are benchmark rates at which banks can borrow funds on the interbank market on an unsecured basis for a given period ranging from overnight to 12 months, in a speci/fi.ligac currency.\n\nIn recent years there have been a number of cases of manipulation of these rates by the banks contributing to their calculation. For this reason, regulators around the world have begun a sweeping reform of interest rate benchmarks that includes the replacement of some benchmarks with alternative risk-free rates (the IBOR reform).\n\nThe Group's main exposure is based on Euribor and USD LIBOR.\n\nEuribor is still considered compliant with the European Benchmarks  Regulation  (BMR)  and  this  permits  market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipants to continue to use it for both existing and new contracts.\n\nIn line with the most recent guidance issued by the major regulatory bodies:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nthe 1-month, 3-month and 6-month USD LIBOR benchmarks will become unrepresentative after June 30, 2023 and the alternative reference rate will be the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR);\n\nthe 1-month, 3-month and 6-month GBP LIBOR benchmarks will become unrepresentative after December 31, 2021 and the alternative reference rate will be the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA).\n\nAs a result of the IBOR reform, a number of temporary exceptions to the rules on hedge relationships have been allowed in implementation of the amendments to IFRS 9 issued in September 2019 (Phase 1) and August 2020 (Phase 2) to address, respectively:",

In addition, a number of contractual amendments have already been implemented in contracts previously indexed to GBP LIBOR in 2021 and others will be amended in 2023 on the basis of the evolution of the IBOR reform and market practice.\n\nDebt and derivatives\n\nThe  Group's  /fl.ligaoating  rate  debt  is  mainly  benchmarked against  Euribor  and  USD  LIBOR  and  is  almost  entirely hedged using /fi.liganancial derivatives.\n\nAt the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date, the Group is planning to take no action with regard to Euribor since, as stated above, this benchmark has been comprehensively reformed to comply with the European Benchmarks Regulation. Despite the continuity with Euribor, replacement clauses may be required and could therefore be implemented by the Group in the new contracts in accordance with the evolution of accepted market practice.\n\nDuring 2022, the Group obtained new US dollar loans indexed to SOFR. The main focus over the coming months will be how to change existing USD LIBOR to USD SOFR exposures and how to use the new, alternative risk-free rates for new /fi.liganancial transactions.\n\nThe Group's derivative instruments are managed through contracts that are mainly based on framework agreements de/fi.liganed by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA).\n\nThe ISDA has revised its standardized contracts in light of the IBOR reform and amended the choices for /fl.ligaoating rates within the 2006 ISDA de/fi.liganitions to include replacement clauses that would apply upon the permanent discontinuation of speci/fi.ligac key benchmarks. These changes took effect on January 25, 2021. Transactions represented in the 2006 ISDA de/fi.liganitions carried out on January 25, 2021 or later include adjusted /fl.ligaoating-rate options (e.g., the choice of /fl.ligaoating rate with replacement clause), while transactions completed before that date (previous derivative contracts) continue to be based on the 2006 ISDA de/fi.liganitions.\n\nFor this reason, the ISDA published an IBOR Fallback Protocol to facilitate multilateral amendments to include the amended de/fi.liganitions.\n\nThe Group is assessing whether to: (i) adopt that protocol in the light of its exposure and developments in the IBOR reform or (ii) adjust in advance any contracts impacted bilaterally by the reform.\n\nHedge relationships\n\nAt the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date, hedged items and hedging instruments are primarily indexed to Euribor, USD LIBOR and SONIA.\n\nThe Group has assessed the impact of unce/r\\_t.ligaainty engendered by the IBOR reform on hedge relationships at December 31, 2022 with reference to both hedging instruments and hedged items. Both the hedged items and the hedging instruments will change their parameterization from interbank market-based benchmarks (IBORs) to alternative risk-free rates (RFRs) as a result of the contractual amendments that will take e/ff.ligaect in the coming years. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, unce/r\\_t.ligaainty remains as to how the replacement will take place with regard to both hedging instruments and hedged items indexed to USD LIBOR. The Group manages the unce/r\\_t.ligaainty associated with these hedge relationships by continuing to apply the temporary exceptions provided for in the amendments to IFRS 9 issued in September 2019 (Phase 1). It was therefore felt that the benchmark indices for determining the interest rates on which the cash /fl.ligaows of the hedged items or the hedging instruments are based would not change as a consequence of the IBOR reform. The exception was applied for the following hedge relationship requirements:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nestablish whether the future hedged cash /fl.ligaows will arise assess the economic relationship between the hedged\n\nitem and the hedging instrument.\n\nThe hedge relationships impacted may become ine/ff.ligaective a/t\\_t.ligaributable to di/ff.ligaerent replacements of existing benchmarks with alternative risk-free benchmarks. In any case, the Group will seek to implement the replacements at the same time.\n\nIn addition, the Group changed the reference to GBP LIBOR in its interest rate hedging instruments used in cash /fl.ligaow hedge relationships with the new, economically equivalent, SONIA benchmark at the end of 2021. Consequently, the Group no longer applies the amendments to IFRS 9 issued in September 2019 (Phase 1) to these hedge relationships and, consequently, is applying the amendments to IFRS 9 issued in August 2020 (Phase 2), modifying the formal designation of the hedge relationship as required by the IBOR reform and without considering this event as a termination of the hedge relationship.\n\ndetermine if a forecast transaction is highly probable; in a discontinued cash /fl.ligaow hedge relationship;",

Cross currency interest rate swaps with a total amount of \u20ac258 million expired, while new derivatives amounted to \u20ac7,500 million, of which \u20ac6,936 million in respect of bond issues denominated in British pounds and US dollars in 2022. In addition, following the novation of a bond in US dollars from Enel Finance International to Enel Finance America, cross currency interest rate swaps of \u20ac662 million were terminated early. The amount also re/fl.ligaects developments in the exchange rate of the euro against the main other currencies and the e/ff.ligaect of amo/r\\_t.ligaization, which caused their notional amount to increase by \u20ac714 million.\n\nThe notional amount of currency forwards at December 31, 2022 amounted to \u20ac9,126 million (\u20ac6,019 million at De-\n\ner 31, 2021), an increase of \u20ac3,107 million. The exposure to currency risk, especially that associated with the US dollar, is mainly due to purchases of natural gas, purchases of fuel and cash /fl.ligaows in respect of investments. Changes in the notional amount are connected with a greater exposure to exchange rate risk, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular towards the US dollar, resulting from the increase in natural gas prices and the recovery in the generation of electricity from coal.\n\nFair value hedge derivatives\n\nThe following table repo/r\\_t.ligas net gains and losses recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss, re/fl.ligaecting changes in the fair value of fair value hedge derivatives and the hedged item that are a/t\\_t.ligaributable to currency risk for 2022 and the previous year.\n\n| Millions of euro                  | 2022 Net gain/(loss)   | 2021 Net gain/(loss)   |\n|-----------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Interest rate hedging instruments | (119)                  | 9                      |\n| Hedged item                       | 129                    | (8)                    |\n| Ine/ff.ligaective po/r\\_t.ligaion  | 10                     | 1                      |\n\nThe following table shows the impact of fair value hedges of currency risk in the statement of /fi.liganancial position at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\n\n| Millions of euro                           |                  | at Dec. 31, 2022                                                                 |                  | at Dec. 31, 2021                                                                 |\n|--------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                            | Notional  amount | Carrying  amount Fair value used  to measure  ine/ff.ligaectiveness  in the year | Notional  amount | Carrying  amount Fair value used  to measure  ine/ff.ligaectiveness  in the year |\n| Cross currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS) | 1,097            | (84) (87)                                                                        | 672              | 42 37                                                                            |\n\nThe following table shows the impact of the hedged item of fair value hedges in the statement of /fi.liganancial position at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.\n\nMillions of euro\n\nat Dec. 31, 2022\n\n## at Dec. 31, 2021\n\n|                                                       |   Carrying  amount | Cumulative  adjustment of  fair value of  hedged item   |   Fair value used  to measure  ine/ff.ligaectiveness  in the year | Carrying  amount   | Cumulative  adjustment of  fair value of  hedged item   | Fair value used  to measure  ine/ff.ligaectiveness  in the year   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fixed-rate borrowings/bonds in foreign currencies     |                525 | (109)                                                   |                                                                70 | 639                | 35                                                      | (40)                                                              |\n| Floating-rate borrowings/bonds in foreign  currencies |                449 | (10)                                                    |                                                                13 | -                  | -                                                       | -                                                                 |\n| Total                                                 |                974 | (119)                                                   |                                                                83 | 639                | 35                                                      | (40)                                                              |",

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value\n\nThe Group determines fair value in accordance with IFRS 13 whenever such measurement is required by the IFRS as a recognition or measurement criterion.\n\nFair value is de/fi.liganed as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction, between market pa/r\\_t.ligaicipants, at the measurement date (i.e., an exit price).\n\nThe best proxy of fair value is market price, i.e., the current publicly available price actually used on a liquid and active market.\n\nThe fair value of assets and liabilities is classi/fi.ligaed in accordance with the three-level hierarchy described below, depending on the inputs and valuation techniques used in determining their fair value:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nLevel 1, where the fair value is determined on the basis of quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date;\n\nLevel 2, where the fair value is determined on the basis of inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (such as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices);\n\nmillion and \u20ac16 million, respectively.\n\nThese amounts include transactions managed within the trading po/r\\_t.ligafolios and transactions that, although established for hedging purposes, did not meet the requirements for hedge accounting.\n\nThe 'other' category includes hedges using carried out on guarantees of origin and green ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates, i.e., incentive mechanisms for the production of electricity from renewable sources. In addition to commodity price risk, the Group companies have to manage the risk of /fl.ligauctuations in the price of these ce/r\\_t.ligai/fi.ligacates which were recently affected by greater market volatility compared with the past, due to the increasing market a/t\\_t.ligaention to environmental sustainability issues.\n\n\u00b7\n\nLevel 3, where the fair value is determined on the basis of unobservable inputs.\n\nThis note also provides detailed disclosures concerning the valuation techniques and inputs used to pe/r\\_f.ligaorm these measurements.\n\n## To that end:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nrecurring fair value measurements of assets or liabilities are those required or permi/t\\_t.ligaed by the IFRS in the statement of /fi.liganancial position at the close of each period; non-recurring fair value measurements are those required or permi/t\\_t.ligaed by the IFRS in the statement of /fi.liganancial position in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular circumstances.\n\nFor general information or speci/fi.ligac disclosures on the accounting treatment of these circumstances, please see note 2 'Accounting policies'.\n\n52.1 Assets measured at fair value in the\n\nstatement of /fi.liganancial position\n\nThe following table shows, for each class of assets measured at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis in the statement of /fi.liganancial position, the fair value measurement at the end of the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period and the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurements of those assets are classi/fi.ligaed.",

Contingent assets and liabilities\n\nThe following repo/r\\_t.ligas the main contingent assets and liabilities at December 31, 2022, which are not recognized in the consolidated /fi.liganancial statements as they do not meet the requirements provided for in IAS 37.\n\nBrindisi Sud thermal generation plant - Ash\n\ndispute - Italy\n\nWith regard to the criminal investigation initiated by the Public Prosecutor's O/ffi.ligace of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Lecce in 2017 concerning the use of /fl.ligay ash in the cement industry, the Brindisi Sud power plant was involved in a criminal investigation involving accused individuals and Enel Produzione (EP) pursuant to Legislative Decree 231 of June 8, 2001, that resulted in the issue of a preventive seizure order that allowed operation of the plant as well as the seizure of EP assets and receivables up to an amount of about \u20ac500 million. The seizures were subsequently revoked following the positive outcome of testing by the independent expe/r\\_t.ligas appointed by the investigating magistrate, which con/fi.ligarmed the non-hazardous nature of the ash, /fi.liganding it suitable for use in the cement-making process, as well as the appropriateness of the operation of the plant. Subsequently, a pre-trial hearing was conducted in 2021, following which the pre-trial hearing judge granted petitions to pa/r\\_t.ligaicipate in the trial as civil plainti/ff.liga /fi.ligaled by the City of Brindisi, which quanti/fi.ligaed damages at about \u20ac27 million, requesting a provisional award of \u20ac8 million, and by the Region of Puglia, which has not yet quanti/fi.ligaed the damages requested. The pre-trial hearing judge remanded all of the defendants before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Brindisi. At the hearing of May 26, 2022, the cou/r\\_t.liga, in upholding the objection raised by EP that the preliminary hearing of October 22, 2021, held without the necessary presence of the pa/r\\_t.ligaies, should be declared void, declared the hearing and the instrument ordering commi/t\\_t.ligaal for trial void and submi/t\\_t.ligaed the trial documentation to the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Lecce for a new preliminary hearing. At the following hearing of October 7, 2022, which was held as summary judgement at the request of the defendant, the cou/r\\_t.liga issued its ruling acqui/t\\_t.ligaing all of the defendants of the charges because 'the alleged o/ff.ligaense did not occur'. The ruling also acqui/t\\_t.ligaed EP as the administrative o/ff.ligaense alleged under the provisions of Legislative Decree 231/2001 had not occurred as there were no predicate o/ff.ligaenses, in conformity with the position of the Public Prosecutor and the defense.\n\nEnel, Enel Energia and Servizio Ele/t\\_t.ligarico\n\nNazionale antitrust proceeding - Italy\n\nOn May 11, 2017, the Competition Authority announced the beginning of proceedings for alleged abuse of a dominant position against Enel SpA (Enel), Enel Energia SpA (EE) and Servizio Ele/t\\_t.ligarico Nazionale SpA (SEN). The proceeding was initiated on the basis of complaints /fi.ligaled by the Italian As-\n\nsociation of Energy Wholesalers and Traders (AIGET) and the company Green Network SpA (GN), as well as a number of complaints from individual consumers.\n\nOn December 20, 2018 the Competition Authority issued its /fi.liganal ruling, with which it levied a /fi.ligane of about \u20ac93 million on all three Group companies, for violation of A/r\\_t.ligaicle 102  of  the  Treaty  on  the  Functioning  of  the  European Union (TFEU).\n\nThe main disputed conduct consisted in abuse of a dominant position by the three companies (to the bene/fi.ligat in particular of EE) who allegedly used the privacy consent given by SEN consumers, to the detriment of competing traders. With regard to other allegations made with the measure to initiate the proceeding, concerning the organization and pe/r\\_f.ligaormance of sales activities at physical locations (Enel Points and Enel Point Pa/r\\_t.liganer Shops) and winback policies repo/r\\_t.ligaed by GN, the Competition Authority reached the conclusion that the preliminary /fi.ligandings did not provide su/ffi.ligacient evidence of any abusive conduct on the pa/r\\_t.liga of Enel Group companies.\n\nThe companies involved challenged the measures of the Competition Authority before the Lazio Regional Administrative  Cou/r\\_t.liga,  which  with  a  decision  /fi.ligaled  on  October 17, 2019 pa/r\\_t.ligaially upheld the appeals /fi.ligaled by SEN and EE, sho/r\\_t.ligaening the period of abuse and requiring the Competition Authority to recalculate the penalty in accordance with the criteria speci/fi.ligaed in the ruling. With a measure dated November 27, 2019, the Competition Authority set the recalculated penalty at \u20ac27,529,786.46.\n\nThe rulings of the Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga were challenged on appeal before the Council of State. With an order of July 20, 2020, the Council of State suspended the ruling and ordered that the issue be submi/t\\_t.ligaed for a preliminary ruling before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) pursuant to A/r\\_t.ligaicle 267 of the TFEU, formulating a number of questions aimed at clarifying the interpretation of the concept of 'abuse of a dominant position' to be applied to the present case.\n\nWith a ruling of May 12, 2022, the CJEU provided the requested interpretation and, subsequently, on December 1, 2022, the Council of State, in application of the guidelines set out by the CJEU, fully voided the /fi.ligane levied by the Competition Authority and, upholding the arguments presented by the companies, denied that any abuse of position had occurred.\n\nHydroelectric concessions - Italy\n\nItalian  regulations  governing  large-scale  hydroelectric concessions were most recently modi/fi.ligaed by the 'Simpli/fi.ligacations Decree' (Decree Law 135 of 2018 rati/fi.ligaed with Law 12 of February 11, 2019), which introduced a series of innovations regarding the granting of such concessions upon their expiry and the valorization of the assets and works",

This legislation also introduced a number of changes in the ma/t\\_t.ligaer of concession fees, establishing a /fi.ligaxed and variable component of fees, as well as an obligation to provide free power to public bodies (220 kWh of power for each kW of average nominal capacity of the facilities covered by the concession). In implementation of this national law and under speci/fi.ligac enabling authority, various regions (Lombardy, Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, the Province of Trento, Calabria and Basilicata) enacted regional laws.\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the regions of Lombardy, Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna, in application of these new regulations, requested payment from Enel Green Power Italia and Enel Produzione of the dual-component fee and the monetization of the free power.\n\nEnel Green Power Italia and Enel Produzione challenged the /fi.ligarst implementing acts issued under the individual regional laws and the subsequent payment notices of fees and the monetization of free electricity supplies before the  Regional  Administrative  Cou/r\\_t.liga  and  Regional  Water Resources Cou/r\\_t.liga (of Lombardy, Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna), asking that they be declared void and raising the question of constitutional illegitimacy of both the national law and the regional laws. The Regional Administrative Cou/r\\_t.liga and then the Council of State, at the appeal stage, deferred their jurisdiction in favor of the Superior Public Water Resources Cou/r\\_t.liga, before which Enel Green Power Italia and Enel Produzione resumed the disputes, which are now at the preliminary stage.\n\nThe companies initiated the proceedings by complaining that the regional implementing acts - as well as the regional legislation which they implement - were constitutionally illegitimate, /fi.ligarst for violation of national legislation and various primary principles protected both by the Italian Constitution and European law concerning legitimate expectations, prope/r\\_t.ligay rights, reasonableness, private initiative, and concessions, where:\n\n\u00b7\n\nthey provide for retroactive application to valid large diversion concessions of the dual-component fee and the obligation to supply free power or its /fi.liganancial equivalent;\n\n\u00b7 they order the monetization of the obligation to supply free energy, which is not envisaged in the national law. Fu/r\\_t.ligahermore, the introduction by the regions of these new obligations to pay the new dual-component fee (divided into a /fi.ligaxed component and a variable component) and to supply a ce/r\\_t.ligaain annual quantity of electricity free of charge in the form of payment of the associated monetary value, which is also to be paid by the holders of valid concessions that have not yet expired, creates an unexpected and unreasonable /fi.liganancial imbalance in the concession relationships. This circumstance is in evident contrast with the principles of reasonableness, propo/r\\_t.ligaionality and legitimate expectation of concession fees, compliance with\n\nwhich is required by constitutional case law if, in the context of long-term relationships, pejorative modi/fi.ligacations are introduced.\n\nBoth the national law and the regional implementing legislation violate Community principles and constitutional principles such as prope/r\\_t.ligay rights, the principle of legal ce/r\\_t.ligaainty, and the freedom of enterprise. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the rules do not expressly provide for the transfer of the business unit from the outgoing to the successor concession holder, and also establish inadequate criteria for the valorization of the works to be transferred, which threatens to create what is essentially a mechanism for expropriation, in violation of constitutional principles.\n\nFinally, the Council of Ministers had challenged a number of the regional implementing laws before the Constitutional Cou/r\\_t.liga, claiming the violation of various constitutional principles. Enel Green Power Italia pa/r\\_t.ligaicipated in the aforementioned proceedings (together with a number of trade associations and other sector operators) concerning constitutional legitimacy unde/r\\_t.ligaaken by the government against the Province of Trento and the Regions of Lombardy, Piedmont and Basilicata. The Council of Ministers subsequently withdrew the appeals as the complaints of illegitimacy  they  brought  were  resolved  by  subsequent regional  laws.  The  Constitutional  Cou/r\\_t.liga  therefore  extinguished the proceedings, with the consequent cancellation of the related interventions by Enel Green Power Italia, despite the fact that the la/t\\_t.ligaer concerned di/ff.ligaerent constitutionality issues than those raised by the Council of Ministers.\n\nAntitrust proceeding 12461 EE - Contract\n\nrenewals\n\nOn December 13, 2022, the Competition Authority noti/fi.ligaed Enel Energia SpA ('Company' or 'EE') and six other companies (Hera, A2A, Acea, Eni Plenitude, Engie, Edison) that it had initiated a proceeding for unfair commercial practices, contesting the violation of ce/r\\_t.ligaain provisions of the Consumer Code and A/r\\_t.ligaicle 3 of Decree Law 115 of August 9, 2022 (the so-called 'second Aid Decree') of August 10, 2022, rati/fi.ligaed with Law 142 of September 21, 2022. Similar proceedings had previously been initiated against four other operators (Iren, Iberdrola, E.ON and Dolomiti).\n\nIn pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the Competition Authority, acting on the basis of repo/r\\_t.ligas received and without any preliminary investigation, argued that EE had sent its customers, in the period from May to October 2022, notices of price changes that were allegedly generic and omissive to the extent that they did not specify the expiry date of the /fi.liganancial conditions subject to renewal and represented a unwarranted exercise of ius variandi in modi/fi.ligacation of the /fi.liganancial conditions of the supply relationship, in violation of the aforementioned A/r\\_t.ligaicle 3 of the second Aid Decree.\n\nWith the measure initiating the procedure, the Competition Authority simultaneously prohibited on a precaution-",

This principle was also recognized by the Government, which, with the Milleproroghe Decree of December 29, 2022, established that A/r\\_t.ligaicle 3 of the second Aid Decree shall not apply to the contractual clauses that allow an electricity and natural gas supply company to update the contractual /fi.liganancial conditions upon expiry of the same, in compliance with the contractual terms of notice and without prejudice to the right of withdrawal of the counterpa/r\\_t.ligay. The Milleproroghe Decree also extended the duration of the prohibition to June 30, 2023.\n\nFollowing the pronouncement of the Council of State and the aforementioned clarifying legislative intervention, the Competition  Authority,  with  a  new  precautionary  measure of December 30, 2022, ordered the pa/r\\_t.ligaial upholding of the original precautionary measure and con/fi.ligarmed the prohibition on changes or renewals of the /fi.liganancial conditions of expiring contracts for which the expiry date was not speci/fi.ligacally identi/fi.ligaed or in any case predeterminable in the associated notice sent to the customer.\n\nEE /fi.ligaled an appeal for additional reasons, whose hearing, together with all the various appeals lodged by other operators, took place on February 22, 2023 and the publication of the ruling is pending.\n\nBEG litigation - Italy, France, Luxembourg\n\nFollowing an arbitration proceeding initiated by BEG SpA (BEG) in Italy, Enelpower SpA (Enelpower) obtained a ruling in its favor in 2002, which was upheld by the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Cassation in 2010, which entirely rejected the petition for damages with regard to alleged breach by Enelpower of an agreement concerning the assessment of the possible construction of a hydroelectric power station in Albania. Subsequently, BEG, acting through its subsidiary Albania BEG Ambient Shpk (ABA), /fi.ligaled suit against Enelpower and Enel SpA (Enel) in Albania concerning the ma/t\\_t.ligaer, obtaining a ruling from the District Cou/r\\_t.liga of Tirana on March 24, 2009, upheld by the Albanian Cou/r\\_t.liga of Cassation, ordering Enelpower and Enel to pay to/r\\_t.ligaious damages of about \u20ac25 million for 2004 as well as an unspeci/fi.ligaed amount of tortious damages for subsequent years. Following the ruling, Albania BEG Ambient demanded payment of more than \u20ac430 million.\n\nOn November 5, 2016, Enel and Enelpower /fi.ligaled a petition with the Albanian Cou/r\\_t.liga of Cassation, asking for the ruling issued by the District Cou/r\\_t.liga of Tirana on March 24, 2009 to be voided. The proceeding is still pending.\n\nWith a ruling of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal of Rome of March 7, 2022, the fu/r\\_t.ligaher proceedings unde/r\\_t.ligaaken by Enel and Enelpower  before  the  Cou/r\\_t.liga  of  Rome  were  concluded, having sought recognition of BEG's liability for having circumvented the arbitration award rendered in Italy in favor of Enelpower through the aforementioned initiatives unde/r\\_t.ligaaken by the subsidiary ABA. With the ruling, the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal of Rome upheld the ruling of /fi.ligarst instance rendered by the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Rome on June 16, 2015, which had denied the petition in the proceeding.\n\nOn May 20, 2021, the European Cou/r\\_t.liga of Human Rights (ECHR) issued a ruling with which it decided the appeal brought by BEG against the Italian State for violation of A/r\\_t.ligaicle 6.1 of the European Convention on Human Rights. With this decision, the Cou/r\\_t.liga denied BEG's request to reopen the above arbitration proceedings, and also rejected BEG's claim for pecuniary damages amounting to about \u20ac1.2 billion due to the absence of a causal link with the disputed conduct, granting it only \u20ac15,000.00 in non-pecuniary damages.\n\nNonetheless, on December 29, 2021, BEG, with an action that the company and its legal counsel deemed unfounded and specious, also decided to sue the Italian State before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Milan, to demand, as a consequence of the ECHR ruling, damages for to/r\\_t.ligaious liability in an amount of about \u20ac1.8 billion. In this case, BEG also involved Enel and Enelpower by way of a claim of joint and several liability. With an order of June 14, 2022, the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Milan, in accepting the objection of territorial incompetence raised by the State A/t\\_t.ligaorney, declared its incompetence to hear the dispute in favor of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Rome, the cou/r\\_t.liga exclusively competent to hear the causes in which the Italian State is involved, ordering BEG to pay the costs of the proceedings in favor of the defendants.

The /fi.ligarst appearance hearing is set for May 9, 2023.

Enel SpA and Enelpower SpA challenged the suit. Following the beginning of the case before the Tribunal de Grande Instance , between 2012 and 2013 Enel France was served with a number of ' Saisie Conservatoire de Cr\u00e9ances ' (orders for the precautionary a/t\\_t.ligaachment of receivables) in favor of ABA to conserve any receivables of Enel in respect of Enel France.\n\nOn January 29, 2018, the Tribunal de Grande Instance issued a ruling in favor of Enel and Enelpower, denying ABA the recognition and enforcement of the Tirana cou/r\\_t.liga's ruling in France for lack of the requirements under French law for the purposes of granting exequatur. Among other issues, the Tribunal de Grande Instance ruled that: (i) the Albanian ruling con/fl.ligaicted with an existing decision (the arbitration ruling of 2002) and that (ii) the fact that BEG sought to obtain in Albania what it was not able to obtain in the Italian arbitration proceeding, resubmi/t\\_t.ligaing the same claim through ABA, represented fraud.\n\nSubsequently, with a ruling of May 4, 2021, the Paris Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal denied the appeal by ABA in full, fully upholding the non-compatibility of the Albanian ruling with the arbitration award of 2002 determined by the TGI, ordering it to reimburse Enel and Enelpower \u20ac200,000.00 each for legal costs.\n\nOn June 21, 2021, ABA /fi.ligaled an appeal with the Cour de Cassation against the ruling of the Paris Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal. Enel and Enelpower have appeared in cou/r\\_t.liga and the hearing for the /fi.liganal discussion of the case is set for March 28, 2023.\n\nEnel initiated a separate proceeding to obtain release of the precautionary a/t\\_t.ligaachments granted to ABA and which are no longer valid as a result of the appeal ruling. With an order of June 16, 2022, the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Paris ordered the release of the precautionary a/t\\_t.ligaachments while also ordering ABA to pay Enel a total of about \u20ac146,000 in damages and legal costs. ABA challenged the aforementioned release order, requesting its suspension as a precautionary measure. The request for precautionary suspension was rejected on November 23, 2022 and the appeal continues in the trial cou/r\\_t.liga. At the same time, Enel is taking the necessary actions for credit recovery.\n\n## The Netherlands\n\nAt the end of July 2014, ABA /fi.ligaled suit with the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Amsterdam to render the ruling of the Albanian cou/r\\_t.liga enforceable in the Netherlands.\n\nFollowing an initial ruling of June 29, 2016, in favor of ABA, in a ruling of July 17, 2018, the Amsterdam Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal upheld the appeal advanced by Enel and Enelpower, ruling that the Albanian judgment cannot be recognized and enforced in the Netherlands, as it was arbitrary and manifestly unreasonable and therefore contrary to Dutch public order. Subsequently, the proceeding before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal continued with regard to the subordinate question raised by ABA with which it asked the Dutch cou/r\\_t.liga to rule on the merits of the dispute in Albania and in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular the alleged to/r\\_t.ligaious liability of Enel and Enelpower in the failure to build the power plant in Albania. On December 3, 2019, the Amsterdam Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal issued a de/fi.liganitive ruling in which it fully quashed the trial cou/r\\_t.liga judgment of June 29, 2016, rejecting any claim made by ABA, thereby con/fi.ligarming the denial of recognition and enforcement of the Albanian ruling in the Netherlands. The Cou/r\\_t.liga came to this conclusion after a/ffi.ligarming its jurisdiction over ABA's subordinate claim and re-analyzing the merits of the case under Albanian law, /fi.liganding no to/r\\_t.ligaious liability on the pa/r\\_t.liga of Enel and Enelpower. As a result of the decision of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal, Enel and Enelpower are therefore not liable to pay any amount to ABA, which was in fact ordered by the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal to reimburse the companies for the losses incurred in illegitimate conservative seizures, to be quanti/fi.ligaed as pa/r\\_t.liga of a speci/fi.ligac procedure, and the costs of the trial and appeal proceedings.\n\nOn July 16, 2021 the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga completely rejected ABA's appeal of the rulings of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal, ordering it to reimburse cou/r\\_t.liga costs. The decision of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Appeal has thus become /fi.liganal.\n\n## Luxembourg\n\nIn Luxembourg, again at the initiative of ABA, J.P. Morgan Bank Luxembourg SA was also served with an order for a number of precautionary seizures of any receivables of both Enel Group companies in respect of the bank.\n\nIn parallel ABA /fi.ligaled a claim to obtain enforcement of the ruling of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Tirana in Luxembourg. Owing to a number of procedural delays, the proceeding is still in the initial stages and no ruling has been issued.\n\n## United States and Ireland\n\nIn 2014, ABA had initiated two proceedings requesting execution of the Albanian sentence before the cou/r\\_t.ligas of the State of New York and Ireland, which both ruled in favor of Enel and Enelpower, respectively, on February 23 and February 26, 2018. Accordingly, there are no lawsuits pending in Ireland or New York State.\n\nEnvironmental incentives - Spain\n\nWith the Decision of November 27, 2017 on the issue of environmental  incentives  for  thermal  power  plants  (the 'Decision'), the European Commission reached the preliminary conclusion that the environmental incentive for coal",

On March 2, 2018, the Commission's Directorate-General for Competition has initiated a formal enquiry pursuant to A/r\\_t.ligaicle 108, paragraph 2, of the TFEU, in order to establish whether the incentive in question constituted state aid compatible with the internal market. The formal enquiry pursuant to A/r\\_t.ligaicle 108 of the TFUE is still open. On April 13, 2018, Endesa Generaci\u00f3n SA, acting as an interested third pa/r\\_t.ligay, submi/t\\_t.ligaed comments contesting this interpretation. Subsequently, on September 8, 2021, the appeal of the decision lodged by Gas Natural (now Naturgy) with the General Cou/r\\_t.liga of the European Union was denied. The ruling was appealed by Naturgy and EDP Espa\u00f1a before the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). Endesa Generaci\u00f3n has /fi.ligaled a request to pa/r\\_t.ligaicipate in the proceeding and, with an order of June 1, 2022, the CJUE allowed that pa/r\\_t.ligaicipation. Endesa Generaci\u00f3n then /fi.ligaled its briefs in the proceedings initiated by Naturgy and EDP Espa\u00f1a on July 8 and 13, 2022, respectively.\n\nSocial Bonus - Spain\n\nIn relation to the various /fi.liganancing schemes for the Social Bonus adopted by the Spanish Government - in relation to which on December 21, 2021, the Tribunal Supremo had declared inapplicable the scheme envisaged in A/r\\_t.ligaicle 45, paragraph 4 of Spain's Electricity Industry Law no. 24 of December 26, 2013 (LSE) for incompatibility with A/r\\_t.ligaicle 3.2 of Directive 2009/72/EC of the European Parliament, in line with the decision issued in this regard by the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on October 14, 2021 - with ruling no. 212/2022 of February 21, 2022 the Tribunal Supremo also ruled on the appeals /fi.ligaled by Endesa SA, Endesa Energ\u00eda SAU and Energ\u00eda XXI Comercializadora de Referencia SLU (Endesa) and other companies in the energy sector against the third scheme for /fi.liganancing the Social Bonus, and for co-/fi.liganancing with government authorities of the supply to vulnerable consumers, envisaged under A/r\\_t.ligaicle 45, paragraph 4 of LSE, Royal Decree Law 7/2016 of December 23 and Royal Decree 897/2017 of October 6.\n\nWith the ruling, the Tribunal Supremo , pa/r\\_t.ligaially allowing the appeals, found that (i) the aforesaid regime was inapplicable; (ii) A/r\\_t.ligaicles 12 to 17 of Royal Decree 897/2017 of 6 October are inapplicable and void, and (iii) the appellants were entitled to be compensated for the amounts paid to /fi.liganance the Social Bonus and provide co-/fi.liganancing with government authorities, and to reimbursement of all costs incurred to ful/fi.ligall the obligations set out in this mechanism, deducting any amounts transferred to customers, where applicable. In the absence of voluntary compliance by the authorities, on November 10, 2022 the companies /fi.ligaled a petition for\n\nenforcement of the ruling, requesting payment of the related amounts; the proceeding is currently pending.\n\n'Endesa I and II' industrial relations\n\ndispute - Spain\n\nWith e/ff.ligaect from January 1, 2019, Endesa noti/fi.ligaed the workers and their union representatives that the 4th Collective Bargaining  Agreement  must  be  considered  terminated under the terms of the 'framework guarantee contract' and the 'agreement on the voluntary suspension or resolution of employment contracts in the period 2013-2018', applying from that date the provisions of general labor law, as well as the applicable legal criteria established in the ma/t\\_t.ligaer. Yet, the interpretative di/ff.ligaerences between Endesa and the trade union representatives regarding the e/ff.ligaects of the resolution of the 4th Collective Bargaining Agreement with regard, in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, to the social bene/fi.ligats granted to retired personnel, led to the initiation of a suit by the unions represented in the company. On March 26, 2019, the cou/r\\_t.liga of /fi.ligarst instance issued a ruling in favor of Endesa, but the unions appealed against this decision before the Tribunal Supremo .\n\nOn July 7, 2021, the Tribunal Supremo issued a de/fi.liganitive ruling denying the appeals lodged by the aforementioned unions against the ruling of the cou/r\\_t.liga of /fi.ligarst instance, af/fi.ligarming  that  social  bene/fi.ligats  (including  those  relating  to electricity prices) originate exclusively in the collective bargaining agreements, both for employees currently in service and those who have retired, as well as for their family members, with the consequence that the termination of such agreements (as happened in the case of the 4th Collective Bargaining Agreement) produces the general contractual regulation of the conditions established therein for employees currently in service and. for those who have retired and their family members, the de/fi.liganitive extinction of all their rights, until new regulations (which came with the 5th Endesa Collective Bargaining Agreement).\n\nIn parallel, numerous individual suits have been /fi.ligaled by sta/ff.liga and former employees who had agreed to pa/r\\_t.ligaicipate in termination incentive agreements in order to obtain judicial con/fi.ligarmation that the termination of the 4th Endesa Collective Bargaining Agreement did not a/ff.ligaect them. The majority of these proceedings, initially suspended pending the de/fi.liganition of the collective action pending before the Tribunal Supremo , were rolled together to incorporate the outcome of the ruling of the la/t\\_t.ligaer, that, regarding a 'collective dispute', would have the value of res judicata in respect of individual proceedings concerning the same issue.\n\nMeanwhile, on January 21, 2020, the arbitration award was issued on the arbitration submi/t\\_t.ligaed before the Servicio Interconfederal de Mediaci\u00f3n y Arbitraje (SIMA) with a view to resolving the main issues concerning the 5th Endesa Collective Bargaining Agreement with the company.

On the same date, Endesa also signed two fu/r\\_t.ligaher collective bargaining agreements (a 'framework guarantee contract' and an 'agreement on voluntary measures to suspend or terminate employment contracts') with all the unions present in the company. On June 17, 2020, the 5th Endesa Collective Bargaining Agreement was published in the Spanish O/ffi.ligacial Journal ( Bolet\u00edn O/fi.ligacial del Estado ), taking full e/ff.ligaect.\n\nOn December 30, 2020, the Audiencia Nacional noti/fi.ligaed Endesa a new petition for a 'collective dispute' initiated by three trade unions with minority representation /fi.ligaled on December 1, 2020, concerning the cancellation of some 'derogatory provisions' of the 5th Endesa Collective Bargaining Agreement. The plainti/ff.ligas claim that the contested 'derogatory provisions' would imply the illegitimate abolition of social bene/fi.ligats and economic rights of workers. Endesa considers these provisions to be fully legitimate, in line with the arguments made during proceeding concerning the reduction of social bene/fi.ligats for retired personnel. With a ruling of November 15, 2021, the petitions of the plainti/ff.liga unions were rejected, with veri/fi.ligacation of the legitimacy of the 5th Endesa Collective Bargaining Agreement. The ruling was appealed by the trade unions before the Tribunal Supremo and the proceeding is currently under way.\n\nGNL Endesa Generaci\u00f3n SA arbitration\n\nproceeding - Spain\n\nIn the course of an arbitration proceeding to review the price of a long-term supply contract for lique/fi.ligaed natural gas (LNG) initiated by Endesa Generaci\u00f3n SA, the defendant, an LNG production company, /fi.ligaled a counterclaim demanding payment of some $1 billion. The amount of the claim could be revised by the plainti/ff.liga depending on market developments in months up to the completion of arbitration proceeding, which is scheduled for the 2nd Qua/r\\_t.ligaer of 2023. The company believes that this counterclaim is unfounded and late and external legal counsel believes it is highly unlikely to be upheld.\n\nFurnas-Tractebel litigation - Brazil\n\nIn 1998 the Brazilian company CIEN (now Enel CIEN) signed an agreement with Tractebel for the delivery of electricity from Argentina through its Argentina-Brazil interconnection line. As a result of Argentine regulatory changes introduced as a consequence of the economic crisis in 2002, Enel CIEN was unable to make the electricity available to Tractebel.\n\nIn October 2009, Tractebel sued Enel CIEN, which submitted its defense. Enel CIEN cited force majeure as a result of the Argentine crisis as the main argument in its defense. Out of cou/r\\_t.liga, Tractebel has indicated that it plans to acquire 30% of the interconnection line involved in the dispute. With a ruling of February 16, 2023, the cou/r\\_t.liga of /fi.ligarst instance denied the grounds of the claim submi/t\\_t.ligaed\n\nby Tractebel against Enel CIEN. The time limit for appealing that ruling is currently pending. The amount involved in the dispute is estimated at about R$658 million (about \u20ac117 million), plus damages to be quanti/fi.ligaed.\n\nFor analogous reasons, in May 2010 Furnas had also /fi.ligaled suit against Enel CIEN for failure to deliver electricity, requesting payment of about R$571.6 million (about \u20ac91 million), in addition to unspeci/fi.ligaed damages, seeking to acquire ownership (in this case 70%) of the interconnection line. The proceeding was decided in Enel CIEN's favor with a ruling of the Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a with a de/fi.liganitive ruling of October 18, 2019, which denied all of the claims of Furnas.\n\nCibran litigation - Brazil\n\nCompanhia  Brasileira  de  Antibi\u00f3ticos  (Cibran)  has  /fi.ligaled six suits against the Enel Group company Ampla Energia e Servi\u00e7os SA (today Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Rio de Janeiro) to obtain damages for alleged losses incurred as a result of the interruption of electricity service by the Brazilian distribution company between 1987 and 2002, in addition to non-pecuniary damages. The Cou/r\\_t.liga ordered a uni/fi.ligaed technical appraisal for those cases, the /fi.ligandings of which were pa/r\\_t.ligaly unfavorable to Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Rio de Janeiro. The la/t\\_t.ligaer challenged the /fi.ligandings, asking for a new study, which led to the denial of pa/r\\_t.liga of Cibran's petitions. Cibran subsequently challenged the /fi.ligandings of the new study, but without success.\n\nThe /fi.ligarst suit, /fi.ligaled in 1999 and regarding the years from 1995 to 1999, was adjudicated with a ruling of the cou/r\\_t.liga of /fi.ligarst instance against Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Rio de Janeiro. Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Rio de Janeiro appealed the ruling and the appeal was upheld by the Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a , which denied all of Cibran's claims. The ruling became de/fi.liganitive on August 24, 2020.\n\nWith regard to the second case, /fi.ligaled in 2006 and regarding the years from 1987 to 1994, on June 1, 2015, the cou/r\\_t.ligas issued a ruling ordering Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Rio de Janeiro to pay R$96,465,103 (about \u20ac23 million) plus interest in pecuniary damages and R$80,000 (about \u20ac19,000) in non-pecuniary damages. On July 8, 2015, Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Rio de Janeiro appealed the decision with the Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a of Rio de Janeiro, which on November 6, 2019 issued a ruling on merits granting Ampla's petition and denying all of Cibran's claims. On November 25, 2019, Cibran /fi.ligaled an appeal against the ruling of the Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a of Rio de Janeiro, which was preliminarily denied for formal reasons on September 10, 2020. On January 29, 2021, Cibran appealed ( agravo de instrumento ) the decisions before the Superior Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a (STJ), which was denied on June 8, 2021. On June 22, 2021, Cibran /fi.ligaled an appeal ( agravo interno ) with the STJ, which was denied on March 24, 2022.

The proceedings are currently pending.\n\nANEEL litigation - Brazil\n\nIn 2014, Eletropaulo (today Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o S\u00e3o Paulo) initiated an action before the Brazilian federal cou/r\\_t.ligas seeking to void the administrative measure of the Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Energia El\u00e9trica (ANEEL, the national electricity agency), which in 2012 retroactively introduced a negative coef/fi.ligacient to be applied in determining rates for the following regulatory period (2011-2015). With this provision, ANEEL ordered  the  restitution  of  the  value  of  some  components of the network previously included in rates because they were considered non-existent and denied Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o S\u00e3o Paulo's request to include additional components in rates. The administrative measure of ANEEL was challenged and on September 9, 2014 it was suspended on a precautionary basis. The /fi.ligarst-instance proceeding is still in its preliminary stages and the value of the suit is about R$1.3 billion (about \u20ac241 million).\n\nEndicon - Brazil\n\nOn October 17, 2021 Endicon (former Enel service provider in Brazil) /fi.ligaled a lawsuit against Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Rio de Janeiro and Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Cear\u00e1 in which it seeks total damages of approximately R$435 million (about \u20ac77 million) for pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages incurred in connection with ce/r\\_t.ligaain events allegedly a/t\\_t.ligaributable to Group companies, which occurred during the execution of the contracts between the pa/r\\_t.ligaies, and from the abusive exercise of contractual rights by the la/t\\_t.ligaer, which is alleged to have produced a loss on the management of the contracts. On May 10, 2022, in upholding the appeals /fi.ligaled by the two Group companies, the precautionary measure that had been previously noti/fi.ligaed to the companies and immediately suspended was de/fi.liganitively revoked. It had required them to (i) publicly announce the material facts of the dispute and (ii) record a contingency in the /fi.liganancial statements of the companies in relation to the dispute. In the meantime, on December 2, 2021, Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Rio de Janeiro and Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Cear\u00e1 presented their defenses in the proceedings on the merits, which continue in the /fi.ligarst instance.\n\nSocrel - Brazil\n\nEnel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o S\u00e3o Paulo has been sued by Servi\u00e7os de Eletricidade and Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es Ltda (Socrel) for damages for losses caused by an alleged unlawful termination of contract by the Group company that involved a series of contracts between the pa/r\\_t.ligaies, which would have caused Socrel's liquidity crisis. Following an expe/r\\_t.liga repo/r\\_t.liga issued during the proceedings, Socrel's request was quanti/fi.ligaed at R$295 million (about \u20ac52 million). The proceeding is currently pending before the cou/r\\_t.liga of /fi.ligarst instance.\n\nExtraordinary 2022 rate revision (Cear\u00e1) -\n\nBrazil\n\nOn April 19, 2022, the Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Energia El\u00e9trica (ANEEL) issued resolution no. 3.026/2022 with which it authorized an average 24.85% rate increase for 2022 for the electricity distribution services pe/r\\_f.ligaormed by Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o  Cear\u00e1.  Both  private  individuals  and  public institutions  have  challenged  this  resolution  before  the Federal Regional Cou/r\\_t.liga of the district of Cear\u00e1, for a total of six proceedings requesting, on precautionary basis, the cancellation of the e/ff.ligaects of the resolution and, on a permanent basis, the voidance of the resolution itself, arguing that the rate increase is illegitimate. In all proceedings, Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Cear\u00e1 has contested the petitioners' claims, arguing the legitimacy of the rate adjustment. On June 21, 2022, the Federal Regional Cou/r\\_t.liga rejected the precautionary request and joindered the six proceedings in a single proceeding in consideration of fact that the relief sought and the cause of action are the same. On September 23, 2022, Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o Cear\u00e1 also submi/t\\_t.ligaed that, as a result of ce/r\\_t.ligaain legislative measures,",

The estimated value of the proceeding has not been determined.\n\nGasAtacama Chile - Chile\n\nIn January 2020, the appeal proceeding was completed for the administrative /fi.ligane levied in August 2016 by the Superintendencia de Electricidad y Combustibles (SEC) against GasAtacama Chile (now Enel Generaci\u00f3n Chile) concerning the information provided to the CDEC- SING ( Centro de Despacho Econ\u00f3mico de Carga ) in relation to the variables of the Technical Minimum and the Minimum  Operation  Time  at  the  Atacama  power  station. Upon completion of the proceeding, the amount of the /fi.ligane was reduced from approximately $6 million to about $432,000 and the amount was paid by the company.\n\nIn relation to the issue mentioned above, a number of operators of the Sistema Interconectado del No/r\\_t.ligae Grande (SING), including Aes Gener SA, El\u00e9ctrica Angamos SA and Engie Energ\u00eda Chile SA, sued GasAtacama Chile seeking damages of about \u20ac58 million (the former two) and about \u20ac150  million  (the  other  operators).  The  aforementioned disputes have been pa/r\\_t.ligaially combined into a single proceeding and are currently pending (after the resumption of the proceeding following the lifting of the national emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the cou/r\\_t.liga served the provision that determines the substantial facts and issues of the trial, the preliminary investigation phase is completed and the proceeding continues its course).\n\nEl Quimbo - Colombia\n\nA number of legal actions (' acciones de grupo ' and ' acciones populares ') brought by residents and /fi.ligashermen in the a/ff.ligaected area are pending with regard to the El Quimbo project for the construction by Emgesa (now Enel Colombia) of a 400 MW hydroelectric plant in the region of Huila (Colombia). More speci/fi.ligacally, the /fi.ligarst collective action, currently in the preliminary stage, was brought by around 1,140 residents of the municipality of Garz\u00f3n, who claim that the construction of the plant would reduce their business revenue by 30%. A second action was brought, between August 2011 and December 2012, by residents and businesses/associations of /fi.ligave municipalities of Huila claiming damages related to the closing of a bridge (Paso El Colegio). With regard to acciones populares , or class action lawsuits, in 2008 a suit was /fi.ligaled by a number of residents of the area demanding, among other things, that the environmental permit be suspended. As pa/r\\_t.liga of this action, on September 11, 2020, the Huila Cou/r\\_t.liga issued a pa/r\\_t.ligaially unfavorable ruling against Emgesa, sentencing it to ful/fi.ligall the obligations already provided for in the environmental license. Both the Autoridad Nacional de Licencias Ambientales (ANLA) and Emgesa challenged this decision before the Council of State. On\n\nSeptember 20, 2022, ANLA's appeal was denied because it had been /fi.ligaled late. The proceeding continues in relation to Emgesa's appeal.\n\nAnother acci\u00f3n popular was brought by a number of /fi.ligash farming companies over the alleged impact that /fi.ligalling the Quimbo basin would have on /fi.ligashing in the Betania basin downstream from Quimbo. After a number of precautionary rulings, on February 22, 2016, the Huila Cou/r\\_t.liga issued a ruling allowing generation to continue for six months. The cou/r\\_t.liga ordered Emgesa to prepare a technical design that would ensure compliance with oxygen level requirements and to provide collateral of about 20,000,000,000 Colombian pesos (about \u20ac5.5 million).\n\nThe  Huila  Cou/r\\_t.liga  subsequently  extended  the  six-month time limit, and therefore, in the absence of contrary cou/r\\_t.liga rulings the Quimbo plant is continuing to generate electricity as the oxygenation system installed by Emgesa has so far demonstrated that it can maintain the oxygen levels required by the cou/r\\_t.liga. On March 22, 2018, ANLA and CAM jointly presented the /fi.liganal repo/r\\_t.liga on the monitoring of water quality downstream of the dam of the El Quimbo hydroelectric plant. Both authorities con/fi.ligarmed the compliance of Emgesa with the oxygen level requirements. After the pa/r\\_t.ligaies had /fi.ligaled briefs, on January 12, 2021, it was learned that the ruling of /fi.ligarst instance of the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Huila had been issued (it was subsequently noti/fi.ligaed to the company on February 1, 2021). The ruling, while acknowledging that the oxygenation system implemented by Emgesa had mitigated the risks associated with the protection of fauna in the Bethany basin, imposed a series of obligations on the environmental authorities involved, as well as on Emgesa itself. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, the latter is required to implement a decontamination project to ensure that the water in the basin does not generate risks for the /fl.ligaora and fauna of the river, which will be subject to veri/fi.ligacation by ANLA, and to make permanent the operation of the oxygenation system, adapting it to comply with the parameters established by ANLA. On March 4, 2021, Emgesa challenged the appeal ruling before the Council of State.\n\nOn December 31, 2021, the Council of State ruled that Emgesa's appeal was admissible. The proceeding is continuing at the appeal level.\n\nNivel de Tensi\u00f3n\n\nUno\n\nproceedings - Colombia\n\nThis dispute involves an ' acci\u00f3n de grupo ' brought by Centro M\u00e9dico de la Sabana hospital and other pa/r\\_t.ligaies against Codensa (now Enel Colombia) seeking restitution of allegedly excess rates. The action is based upon the alleged failure of Codensa to apply a subsidized rate that they claim the users should have paid as Tensi\u00f3n Uno category users (voltage of less than 1 kV) and owners of infrastructure, as established in Resolution no. 82/2002, as amended by Resolution no. 97/2008.

In a decision issued in November 2017, the arbitration board ruled in Chucas' favor, granting recognition of the additional costs incurred in the amount of about $113 million (about \u20ac91 million) and legal costs and found that Chucas was not liable to pay the /fi.ligands to ICE. ICE appealed the arbitration ruling before the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga and on September 5, 2019 Chucas was noti/fi.ligaed of the ruling pa/r\\_t.ligaially upholding ICE's appeal to void the arbitration ruling for a number of formal procedural reasons. On September 11, 2019, Chucas /fi.ligaled a ' recurso de aclaraci\u00f3n y adici\u00f3n ' with the same cou/r\\_t.liga and it was pa/r\\_t.ligaially upheld on June 8, 2020. The Cou/r\\_t.liga's decision expanded on the ruling of September 5, 2019 with information concerning the admission of evidence deposited by Chucas without, however, modifying the decision concerning the voidance of the arbitration award.\n\nOn July 14, 2020, Chucas /fi.ligaled a new request for arbitration with the AMCHAM CICA for a preliminary estimated amount of about $240 million. On August 14, 2020, ICE /fi.ligaled its response, requesting the dismissal of the proceeding for lack of jurisdiction on the pa/r\\_t.liga of the arbitration tribunal. The request for dismissal was denied by AMCHAM CICA. In parallel, ICE /fi.ligaled precautionary appeals to the Tribunal Contencioso Administrativo against Chucas and the AMCHAM CICA seeking to suspend the arbitration proceedings. While these appeals were preliminarily upheld, they were subsequently denied. In May 2021, Chucas /fi.ligaled its arbitration request complete with preliminary demands, quantifying the value of its claim at about $362 million (about \u20ac305 million). In June 2021, ICE /fi.ligaled its defense, continuing to asse/r\\_t.liga a lack of jurisdiction. ICE has not made a counterclaim. On August 4, 2021, the arbitration tribunal rejected ICE's claim of lack of jurisdiction. The ma/t\\_t.ligaer has subsequently been submi/t\\_t.ligaed for consideration to the /fi.ligarst section of the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga and the arbitration proceedings was suspended.\n\nOn May 12, 2022, with a measure that was noti/fi.ligaed to the company on July 28, 2022, the /fi.ligarst section of the Supreme\n\nCou/r\\_t.liga ruled that the arbitration tribunal was incompetent to hear the dispute. On August 8, 2022, Chucas /fi.ligaled an extraordinary appeal against this ruling, the overall resolution of which is expected for mid-2023. The arbitration proceeding is suspended.\n\nKino arbitration - Mexico\n\nOn September 16, 2020, Kino Contractor SA de Cv (Kino Contractor), Kino Facilities Manager SA de Cv (Kino Facilities) and Enel SpA (Enel) were noti/fi.ligaed of a request for arbitration /fi.ligaled by Parque Solar Don Jos\u00e9 SA de Cv, Villanueva Solar SA de Cv and Parque Solar Villanueva Tres SA de Cv (together, 'Project Companies') in which the Project Companies alleged the violation (i) by Kino Contractor of ce/r\\_t.ligaain provisions of the EPC Contract and (ii) by Kino Facilities of ce/r\\_t.ligaain provisions of the Asset Management Agreement,  both  contracts  concerning  solar  projects owned by the three companies /fi.ligaling for arbitration.\n\nEnel, which is the guarantor of the obligations assumed by Kino Contractor and Kino Facilities under the above contracts, has also been called into the arbitration proceeding, but no speci/fi.ligac claims have been /fi.ligaled against it. The Project Companies, in which Enel Green Power SpA is a non-controlling shareholder, are controlled by CDPQ Infraestructura Pa/r\\_t.ligaicipaci\u00f3n SA de Cv (which is controlled by Caisse de D\u00e9p\u00f4t et Placement du Qu\u00e9bec) and CKD Infraestructura M\u00e9xico SA de Cv. After the request for arbitration and the related response from the defendants, the pa/r\\_t.ligaies exchanged fu/r\\_t.ligaher introductory briefs, in which the /fi.liganancial claim of the counterpa/r\\_t.ligaies was updated to about $135 million, while Kino Facilities has not continued its counter-claim. The hearing was held in October 2022 and the /fi.liganal phase is currently pending. The issuance of the arbitration award is expected by mid-2023.\n\nAllianz - No/r\\_t.ligah America\n\nOn May 18, 2022, High Lonesome Wind Project LLC was sued in New York Superior Cou/r\\_t.liga by Allianz Risk Transfer Ltd for about $203 million concerning an alleged liability accrued by the company, as of February 2020, in connection with a Proxy Revenue Swap. The claim is being contested in its entirety. The proceedings are currently pending before the Southern District Cou/r\\_t.liga in New York.\n\nGastalsa - Peru\n\nIn 2011, Empresa de Gas de Talara SA (Gastalsa) /fi.ligaled a claim before the Civil Cou/r\\_t.liga of Talara requesting to revoke the measure that canceled the concession of natural gas granted to it in the Parinas district, the Province of Talara and the Depa/r\\_t.ligament of Piura, and the consequent transfer of the gas pipeline owned by Enel Generaci\u00f3n Piura SA (EGPIURA) to Gastalsa itself.\n\nOn January 6, 2022, the cou/r\\_t.liga pa/r\\_t.ligaially upheld the Gastalsa claim.

The above means that the economic value of the gas pipeline, currently owned by EGPIURA (which supplies natural gas to the Malacas thermal power station) is to be estimated for transfer to Gastalsa.\n\nOn August 2, 2022, the Sala Civil de la Co/r\\_t.ligae Superior de Justicia de Sullana ruled against Gastalsa in the second-level appeal, referring the case to the cou/r\\_t.liga of /fi.ligarst instance for a new decision. As a result of that decision, on September 9, 2022, the precautionary measure issued earlier was revoked.\n\nIn the meantime, in July 2022, the Constitutional Cou/r\\_t.liga had granted the petition of the system operator, an interested third pa/r\\_t.ligay, acknowledging that the original petition of Gastalsa had been /fi.ligaled after the time limit.

In November 2011 the trial cou/r\\_t.liga ruled in favor of SE, whereupon the PPO appealed the decision.\n\nIn parallel with the PPO action, VV also /fi.ligaled a number of suits, asking in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular for the voidance of the VEG Operating Agreement. On December 12, 2014, VV withdrew unilaterally from the VEG Operating Agreement, notifying its termination on March 9, 2015, for breach of contract. On March 9, 2015, the decision of the appeals cou/r\\_t.liga overturned the ruling of the trial cou/r\\_t.liga and voided the contract as pa/r\\_t.liga of the action pursued by the PPO. SE lodged an extraordinary appeal against that decision before the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga. At a hearing of June 29, 2016, the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga denied the appeal and SE then appealed the ruling to the Constitutional Cou/r\\_t.liga, which denied the appeal on\n\n## January 18, 2017.\n\nIn addition, SE lodged a request for arbitration with the Vienna International Arbitral Centre (VIAC) under the VEG Indemnity Agreement. Under that accord, which had been signed as pa/r\\_t.liga of the privatization between the National Prope/r\\_t.ligay Fund (now MH Manazment - MHM) of the Slovak Republic and SE, the la/t\\_t.ligaer was entitled to an indemnity in the event of the early termination of the VEG Operating Agreement for reasons not a/t\\_t.ligaributable to SE. On June 30, 2017, the arbitration cou/r\\_t.liga issued its ruling denying the request of SE.\n\nIn parallel with this arbitration proceeding launched by SE, both VV and MHM /fi.ligaled two suits in the Slovakian cou/r\\_t.ligas to void the VEG Indemnity Agreement owing to the alleged connection of the la/t\\_t.ligaer with the VEG Operating Agreement. These proceedings were joindered and, on September 27, 2017, the Cou/r\\_t.liga of Bratislava denied the request of the plainti/ff.ligas for procedural reasons. Both VV and MHM appealed that decision, and both the appeals were denied upholding the trial cou/r\\_t.liga decision in favor of SE. VV /fi.ligaled an extraordinary appeal ( dovolanie ) against that decision on March 9, 2020, with the Supreme Cou/r\\_t.liga, to which SE replied with a brief submi/t\\_t.ligaed on June 8, 2020. SE also /fi.ligaled an appeal before the Slovak Constitutional Cou/r\\_t.liga, which was denied on July 29, 2021.

Between December 2022 and January 2023 both SE and VV /fi.ligaled appeals against the rulings relating to the years 2010 and 2013, and on January 19, 2023 SE also /fi.ligaled an appeal against the ruling relating to the year 2009;\n\nas regards the proceeding relating to the year 2012, on February 2, 2023 SE was noti/fi.ligaed of the appeal ruling upholding the ruling of /fi.ligarst instance denying of both VV's claim and SE's counterclaim.

Under the special rules then in force, subject to maintaining the bond until 2008, the interest paid by Ampla to its subsidiary was not subject to withholding tax in Brazil.\n\nHowever, the /fi.liganancial crisis of 1998 forced the Panamanian company to re/fi.liganance itself with its Brazilian parent, which for that purpose obtained loans from local banks. The tax authorities considered this /fi.liganancing to be the equivalent of the early extinguishment of the bond, with the consequent loss of entitlement to the exemption from withholding tax.\n\nIn December 2005, Ampla Energia e Servi\u00e7os carried out a spin-o/ff.liga that involved the transfer of the residual FRN debt and the associated rights and obligations to Ampla Investimentos e Servi\u00e7os SA.\n\nOn November 6, 2012, the C\u00e2mara Superior de Recursos Fiscais (the highest level of administrative cou/r\\_t.ligas) issued a ruling against Ampla, for which the company promptly asked that body for clari/fi.ligacations. On October 15, 2013, Ampla was noti/fi.ligaed of the denial of the request for clari/fi.ligacation ( embargo de declara\u00e7\u00e3o ), thereby upholding the previous adverse decision. The company provided security for the debt and on June 27, 2014 continued litigation before the ordinary cou/r\\_t.ligas ( Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a ).\n\nIn December 2017, the cou/r\\_t.liga appointed an expe/r\\_t.liga to ex-\n\namine the issue in greater detail in suppo/r\\_t.liga of the future ruling. In September 2018, the expe/r\\_t.liga submi/t\\_t.ligaed a repo/r\\_t.liga, requesting additional documentation.\n\nIn December 2018, the company provided the additional documentation and is awaiting the cou/r\\_t.liga's assessment of the arguments and documents presented.\n\nThe amount involved in the dispute at December 31, 2022 was about \u20ac246 million.\n\n## PIS/COFINS/ICMS - Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o S\u00e3o Paulo\n\nIn March 2017, the Supremo Tribunal Federal of Brazil (STF) ruled on the calculation of the PIS and COFINS taxes, con/fi.ligarming the argument that the ICMS Imposto sobre Circula\u00e7\u00e3o de Mercadorias e Servi\u00e7os (tax on the circular of goods and services) was not included in the calculation basis of the PIS and COFINS.\n\nIn May 2021, the STF established that the ruling would have e/ff.ligaect from the judgment of March 2017, except for taxpayers who had /fi.ligaled an appeal before that date.\n\nThe Group's Brazilian companies a/ff.ligaected by the STF ruling had already initiated legal action in their respective federal regional cou/r\\_t.ligas. Subsequently, the la/t\\_t.ligaer noti/fi.ligaed them of the /fi.liganal decision, recognizing the right to deduct the ICMS applied to their operations from the calculation basis of the PIS and COFINS. Since the excess payment of the PIS and COFINS taxes had been transferred to /fi.liganal customers, at the same time as the recognition of these recoverable taxes, a liability in respect of those customers was recognized in the same amount, net of any costs incurred or to be incurred in the legal proceedings. These liabilities represent an obligation to reimburse the recovered taxes to /fi.liganal customers.\n\nIn this regard, Enel Distribui\u00e7\u00e3o S\u00e3o Paulo initiated two proceedings that led to rulings in its favor. These regarded the periods from December 2003 to December 2014 and from January 2015 onwards. With regard to the second proceeding, the Federal Union /fi.ligaled an action of rescission against the company, disputing the fact that pa/r\\_t.liga of the period in question (prior to March 2017) would be adversely impacted by the STF ruling of May 2021.\n\nIn May 2022, the company challenged this action and will defend its actions through the various levels of the cou/r\\_t.liga system.\n\nThe estimated amount involved in the proceeding at December 31, 2022 was about \u20ac206 million.\n\n## IRPJ/CSLL - Eletropaulo\n\nOn October 5, 2021, Eletropaulo received an assessment notice from the Brazilian tax authorities contesting the deductibility for income tax purposes ( Imposto sobre a  Renda das Pessoas Jur\u00eddicas - IRPJ and Contribui\u00e7ao Social sobre o Lucro L\u00edquido - CSLL) of the amo/r\\_t.ligaization of the increased values generated by extraordinary corporate transactions carried out before the acquisition of the company by the Enel Group. The contested period runs from 2017 to 2019.",

The amount involved in the dispute at December 31, 2022 was about \u20ac137 million.\n\n## PIS - Eletropaulo\n\nIn July 2000, Eletropaulo /fi.ligaled suit seeking a tax credit for PIS  ( Programa  Integra\u00e7\u00e3o  Social )  paid  in  application  of regulations  (Decree  Laws  2.445/1988  and  2.449/1988) that were subsequently declared unconstitutional by the Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF). In May 2012, the Superior Tribunal de Justi\u00e7a (STJ) issued a /fi.liganal ruling in favor of the company that recognized the right to the credit.\n\nIn 2002, before the issue of that favorable /fi.liganal ruling, the company had o/ff.ligaset its credit against other federal taxes. This behavior was contested by the federal tax authorities but the company, claiming it had acted correctly, challenged in cou/r\\_t.liga the assessments issued by the federal tax authorities. Following defeat at the initial level of adjudication, the company appealed.\n\nThe amount involved in the dispute at December 31, 2022 was about \u20ac123 million.\n\n## ICMS - Ampla, Coelce and Eletropaulo\n\nThe States of Rio de Janeiro, Cear\u00e1 and S\u00e3o Paulo issued a number of tax assessments against Ampla Energia e Servi\u00e7os  SA  (for  the  years  1996-1999  and  2007-2017), Companhia Energ\u00e9tica do Cear\u00e1 (2003, 2004, 2006-2012, 2015  and  2016)  and  Eletropaulo  (2008-2021),  challenging the deduction of ICMS Imposto sobre Circula\u00e7\u00e3o de Mercadorias e Servi\u00e7os (tax on the circular of goods and services) in relation to the purchase of ce/r\\_t.ligaain non-current assets. The companies challenged the assessments, arguing that they correctly deducted the tax and asse/r\\_t.ligaing that the assets, the purchase of which generated the ICMS, are intended for use in their electricity distribution activities.\n\nThe companies are continuing to defend their actions at the various levels of adjudication.\n\nThe amount involved in the disputes totaled approximately \u20ac95 million at December 31, 2022.\n\n## Withholding Tax - Endesa Brasil\n\nOn November 4, 2014, the Brazilian tax authorities issued an assessment against Endesa Brasil SA (now Enel Brasil SA) alleging the failure to apply withholding tax to payments of allegedly higher dividends to non-resident recipients.\n\nMore speci/fi.ligacally, in 2009, Endesa Brasil, as a result of the /fi.ligarst-time application of the IFRS, had derecognized goodwill, recognizing the e/ff.ligaects in equity, on the basis of the correct  application  of  the  accounting  standards  it  had adopted. The Brazilian tax authorities, however, asse/r\\_t.ligaed - during an audit - that the accounting treatment was incorrect and that the e/ff.ligaects of the derecognition should have been recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss. As a result, the corresponding amount (about \u20ac202 million) was re-\n\nassi/fi.ligaed as a payment of income to non-residents and, therefore, subject to withholding tax of 15%.\n\nIt should be noted that the accounting treatment adopted by the company was agreed with the external auditor and also con/fi.ligarmed by a speci/fi.ligac legal opinion issued by a local /fi.ligarm.\n\nFollowing unfavorable rulings from the administrative cou/r\\_t.ligas, the company is continuing to defend its actions in cou/r\\_t.liga and the appropriateness of the accounting treatment.\n\nThe overall amount involved in the dispute at December 31, 2022 was about \u20ac69 million.\n\n## ICMS - Coelce\n\nThe  State  of  Cear\u00e1  has  /fi.ligaled  various  tax  assessments against Companhia Energ\u00e9tica do Cear\u00e1 SA (Coelce) over the years (for tax periods from 2005 to 2014), contesting the determination of the deductible po/r\\_t.ligaion of the ICMS Imposto sobre Circula\u00e7\u00e3o de Mercadorias e Servi\u00e7os (tax on the circular of goods and services) and in pa/r\\_t.ligaicular the method of calculation of the pro-rata deduction with reference to the revenue deriving from the application of a special rate envisaged by the Brazilian government for the sale of electricity to low-income households ( Baixa Renda ). The company has appealed the individual assessments, arguing that the tax deduction was calculated correctly. The company is defending its actions in the various levels of jurisdiction.\n\nThe overall amount involved in the dispute at December 31, 2022 was about \u20ac55 million.\n\n## PIS - Eletropaulo\n\nIn  December  1995,  the  Brazilian  government  increased the rate of the federal PIS ( Programa Integra\u00e7\u00e3o Social ) tax from 0.50% to 0.65% with the issue of a provisional measure (Executive Provisional Order).\n\nSubsequently, the provisional measure was re-issued /fi.ligave times before its de/fi.liganitive rati/fi.ligacation into law in 1998. Under Brazilian legislation, an increase in the tax rate (or the establishment of a new tax) can only be ordered by law and take e/ff.ligaect 90 days after its publication.\n\nEletropaulo therefore /fi.ligaled suit arguing that an increase in the tax rate would only have been e/ff.ligaective 90 days after the last Provisional Order, claiming that the e/ff.ligaects of the /fi.ligarst four provisional measures should be considered void (since they were never rati/fi.ligaed into law). This dispute ended in April 2008 with recognition of the validity of the increase in the PIS rate sta/r\\_t.ligaing from the /fi.ligarst provisional measure.\n\nIn May 2008, the Brazilian tax authorities /fi.ligaled a suit against Eletropaulo to request payment of taxes corresponding to the rate increase from March 1996 to December 1998. Eletropaulo has fought the request at the various levels of adjudication, arguing that the time limit for the issue of the notice of assessment had lapsed. In pa/r\\_t.ligaicular, since more than /fi.ligave years have passed since the taxable event (December 1995, the date of the /fi.ligarst provisional measure) without issuing any formal instrument, the right of the tax",

The proceedings are still pending while the amounts subject to dispute have been covered by a bank guarantee.\n\nWith regard to the request of the O/ffi.ligace of the A/t\\_t.ligaorney General of the Brazilian National Treasury Depa/r\\_t.ligament to replace the bank guarantee with a deposit in cou/r\\_t.liga, the cou/r\\_t.liga of second instance granted the petition. The company therefore replaced the bank guarantee with a cash deposit and /fi.ligaled a clari/fi.ligacation motion against the related decision, which is currently awaiting a decision.\n\nThe overall amount involved in the dispute at December 31, 2022 was about \u20ac45 million.\n\n## FINSOCIAL - Eletropaulo\n\nFollowing a /fi.liganal ruling issued by the Federal Regional Cou/r\\_t.liga on September 11, 2011, Eletropaulo was recognized the right to compensation for ce/r\\_t.ligaain FINSOCIAL credits (social contributions) relating to sums paid from September 1989 to March 1992.\n\nDespite the expiration of the relative statute of limitations, the Federal Tax Authority contested the determination of some credits and rejected the corresponding o/ff.ligase/t\\_t.ligaing, issuing tax assessments that the company promptly challenged in the administrative cou/r\\_t.ligas, defending the legitimacy of its calculations and actions.\n\nAfter an unfavorable ruling at /fi.ligarst instance, the company /fi.ligaled an appeal before the administrative cou/r\\_t.liga of second instance.\n\nThe overall amount involved in the dispute at December 31, 2022 was about \u20ac43 million.\n\nTax litigation in Spain\n\n## Income tax - Enel Iberia, Endesa and subsidiaries\n\nIn 2018, the Spanish tax authorities completed a general audit involving the companies of the Group pa/r\\_t.ligaicipating in the Spanish tax consolidation mechanism. This audit, which began in 2016, involved corporate income tax, value added tax and withholding taxes (mainly for the years 2011 to 2014).\n\nWith reference to the main claims, the companies involved have challenged the related assessments at the /fi.ligarst administrative level ( Tribunal Econ\u00f3mico-Administrativo Central - TEAC), defending the correctness of their actions.\n\nOn April 4, 2022, the TEAC rejected the appeal and the companies are continuing to defend their actions in cou/r\\_t.liga ( Audiencia Nacional ).\n\nWith regard to the disputes concerning corporate income tax, the issues for which an unfavorable outcome is con-\n\nsidered possible amounted to about \u20ac133 million at December 31, 2022:\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\nEnel Iberia is defending the appropriateness of the criterion adopted for determining the deductibility of capital losses deriving from stock sales (around \u20ac88 million) and ce/r\\_t.ligaain /fi.liganancial expense (around \u20ac15 million);\n\nEndesa and its subsidiaries are mainly defending the appropriateness of the criteria adopted for the deductibility of ce/r\\_t.ligaain /fi.liganancial expense (about \u20ac24 million) and costs for decommissioning nuclear power plants (about \u20ac6 million).\n\nIn 2021, the Spanish tax authorities concluded a new general audit for the years from 2015 to 2018. The companies involved challenged the related assessments at the /fi.ligarst level of administrative adjudication (TEAC), arguing that they had acted correctly.\n\nIn relation to the main dispute regarding corporate income tax, which concerned the deductibility of ce/r\\_t.ligaain /fi.liganancial charges, the dispute for which an adverse outcome is considered possible has a value of about \u20ac222 million at December 31, 2022 (Enel Iberia \u20ac210 million and Endesa SA \u20ac12 million).\n\n## Income tax - Enel Green Power Espa\u00f1a SL\n\nOn June 7, 2017, the Spanish tax authorities issued a notice of assessment to Enel Green Power Espa\u00f1a SL, contesting the treatment of the merger of Enel Uni\u00f3n Fenosa Renovables SA ('EUFER') into Enel Green Power Espa\u00f1a SL in 2011 as a tax neutral transaction, asse/r\\_t.ligaing that the transaction had no valid economic reason.\n\nOn July 6, 2017, the company appealed the assessment at the /fi.ligarst administrative level ( Tribunal Econ\u00f3mico-Administrativo Central - TEAC), defending the appropriateness of the tax treatment applied to the merger. The company has provided  the  suppo/r\\_t.ligaing  documentation  demonstrating the synergies achieved as a result of the merger in order to prove the existence of a valid economic reason for the transaction. On December 10, 2019, the TEAC denied the appeal and the company is continuing to defend its actions in cou/r\\_t.liga ( Audiencia Nacional ).\n\nThe overall amount involved in the dispute at December 31, 2022 was about \u20ac100 million.\n\nTax litigation in Italy\n\n## Withholding Tax - Enel Servizio Ele/t\\_t.ligarico Nazionale\n\nAs a result of a tax audit initiated in March 2018 and following a subsequent investigation conducted with questionnaires submi/t\\_t.ligaed to the banks involved as assignees in ce/r\\_t.ligaain transfers of receivables from Servizio Ele/t\\_t.ligarico Nazionale SpA (SEN) in respect of mass market customers under a framework agreement, on December 19, 2018, the Revenue Agency Regional Directorate of Lazio Large Taxpayers O/ffi.ligace, noti/fi.ligaed the company of an assessment in respect of the alleged violation of withholding tax obli-",

Future accounting standards\n\nThe  following  provides  a  list  of  accounting  standards, amendments and interpretations that will take e/ff.ligaect for the Group after December 31, 2022.\n\n\u00b7\n\n' Amendments to IAS 1 - Classi/fi.ligacation of Liabilities as Current  or  Non-current ',  issued  in  January  2020.  The amendments regard the provisions of IAS 1 concerning the presentation of liabilities. More speci/fi.ligacally, the changes clarify:\n\n- the criteria to adopt in classifying a liability as current or non-current, specifying the meaning of right of an entity to defer se/t\\_t.ligalement and that that right must exist at the end of the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period;\n\n- that the classi/fi.ligacation is una/ff.ligaected by the intentions or expectations of management about when the entity will exercise its right to defer se/t\\_t.ligalement of a liability;\n\n- that the right to defer exists if and only if the entity satis/fi.ligaes the terms of the loan at the end of the repo/r\\_t.ligaing period, even if the creditor does not verify compliance until later; and\n\n- that se/t\\_t.ligalement regards the transfer to the counterpar-\n\nty of cash, equity instruments, other assets or services. The amendments will take e/ff.ligaect, subject to endorsement, for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024. (62)\n\n'Amendments to IAS 1 - Non-current Liabilities with Covenants', issued in October 2022. IAS 1 requires classi/fi.ligacation of liabilities as non-current only where an entity has a right to defer se/t\\_t.ligalement in the 12 months following the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date. The amendments of the standard improve disclosure when the right to defer se/t\\_t.ligalement of a liability for at least 12 months is subject to compliance with covenants and specify that the classi/fi.ligacation of the liability as current or non-current at the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date is not a/ff.ligaected by covenants that must be complied with subsequent to the repo/r\\_t.ligaing date.\n\nThe amendments will take e/ff.ligaect, subject to endorsement, for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2024. ' Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 - Disclosure of Accounting Policies ', issued in February 2021. The amendments are intended to suppo/r\\_t.liga entities in deciding which accounting policies to disclose in the /fi.liganancial statements. The amendments to IAS 1 require companies to disclose their material accounting policy information rather than their signi/fi.ligacant accounting policies. A guide on how to apply the concept of materiality to disclosures on accounting policies is provided in the amendments to IFRS Practice Statement 2. The amendments will take e/ff.ligaect for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023.\n\n'Amendments to IAS 8 - De/fi.liganition of Accounting Estimates' , issued in February 2021. The amendments clarify how companies should distinguish changes in accounting policies from changes in accounting estimates. The de/fi.liganition of changes in accounting estimates has been replaced with a de/fi.liganition of accounting estimates as 'monetary amounts in /fi.liganancial statements that are subject to measurement unce/r\\_t.ligaainty'. The amendments will take e/ff.ligaect for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023.\n\n'Amendments to IAS 12 - Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction ',  issued  in  May  2021.  The  amendments  require entities to recognize deferred tax on transactions that at initial recognition give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary di/ff.ligaerences. The amendments will take e/ff.ligaect for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. 'Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 - Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its Associate or Joint Venture', issued in September 2014.

The standard introduces di/ff.ligaerent models for calculating the costs of insurance and reinsurance. The standard will take e/ff.ligaect for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The Group has recalculated the impact of the /fi.ligarsttime application of IFRS 17 at January 1, 2022 and the total impact at December 31, 2022 is estimated as a positive change of up to \u20ac30 million, mainly due to the discounting of reserves.\n\n' Amendments to IFRS 16 - Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback ', issued in September 2022. The amendments require the seller-lessee to measure the right-of-use asset arising from a sale and leaseback transaction in propo/r\\_t.ligaion to the previous carrying amount of the asset involved in the arrangement and in line with the retained right-of-use. Consequently, the seller-lessee will be allowed to recognize only the amount of any capital gain or loss relating to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor. The amendments do not prescribe speci/fi.ligac measurement requirements  for  liabilities  deriving  from  a  leaseback. However, they include examples that illustrate the initial and subsequent measurement of the liability by including variable payments that do not depend on an index or a rate. This representation is a depa/r\\_t.ligaure from the general accounting model required by IFRS 16, in which variable payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized through pro/fi.ligat or loss in the period in which the event or condition that determines these payments occurs. In this regard, the seller-lessee will have to develop and apply an accounting policy to determine the lease payments such that any amount of retained right-of-use gain or loss is not recognized.\n\nThe amendments will take e/ff.ligaect, subject to endorsement, for annual periods beginning January 1, 2024. In conformity with 'IAS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors', retrospective application is permi/t\\_t.ligaed for sale and leaseback transactions entered into after the date of initial application of IFRS 16.\n\nThe Group is assessing the potential impact of the future application of the new provisions.\n\n## 59.

At the same time, Enel also announced, through a separate notice, the launch of voluntary tender o/ff.ligaers to repurchase for cash and subsequently cancel, for a total aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount raised from the New Securities, any-and-all of the \u20ac750 million equity-accounted perpetual hybrid bond with /fi.ligarst call date in August 2023, as well as pa/r\\_t.liga of the outstanding $1,250 million hybrid bond due September 2073 with call date in September 2023, subject to satisfaction of a number of conditions.\n\n## Enel announces the results of the tender o/ff.ligaer on the perpetual hybrid bond denominated in euros\n\nWith the conclusion of the voluntary tender o/ff.ligaer launched on  January  9,  2023 and  expired  on January 16,  2023, on January 18, 2023 Enel announced that it will repurchase  for  cash  its  outstanding  perpetual  hybrid  bond denominated in euros for an aggregate nominal amount of \u20ac699,970,000.00.  Taking  into  account  the  principal amount raised through the issue of new securities and the principal amount of securities purchased in connection with the tender o/ff.ligaer for the euro-denominated bond, the capped maximum acceptance amount ('Capped Maximum  Amount')  for  the  concurrent  tender  o/ff.ligaer  for  its $1,250 million hybrid bond due September 2073 with call date in September 2023 has been removed.\n\n## Enel announces the results of the tender o/ff.ligaer on the perpetual hybrid bond denominated in euros\n\nAs a consequence of the removal of the capped maximum acceptance amount ('Capped Maximum Amount') on the dollar-denominated  bond  -  as  announced  on  January 18, 2023 - Enel has accepted for purchase all of the offers validly tendered on the dollar-denominated bond by the Early Tender Deadline for a total nominal amount of $411,060,000.\n\n## Enel launches a \u20ac1.5 billion sustainability-linked bond\n\nOn  February  14,  2023,  Enel  Finance  International  NV launched a dual-tranche sustainability-linked bond for institutional investors for a total of \u20ac1.5 billion.

The  statement  also  affirmed  that  the appropriateness  of  the  administrative  and  accounting  procedures  used  in  the preparation of the separate financial statements of the Company had been verified in an assessment of the internal control system for financial reporting (supported by the findings of the independent testing performed by a qualified external advisor) and that the assessment of the internal control system did not identify any material issues. An analogous statement was prepared for the consolidated financial statements for 2022 of the Enel Group;\n\n- \u00b7 we monitored the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control system, primarily through constant participation of the head of the Audit department of the Company in the meetings of the Board of Statutory Auditors and holding about half of the meetings jointly with the Control and Risk Committee, as well as through periodic meetings with the  body  charged  with  overseeing  the  operation  of  and  compliance  with  the organizational  and  management  model  adopted  by  the  Company  pursuant  to Legislative Decree 231/2001. In the light of our examination and in the absence of significant issues, there are no reasons to doubt the adequacy and effectiveness of the internal control and risk management system. In February 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company expressed an analogous assessment of the situation and also noted, in November 2022, that the main risks associated with the strategic targets set out in the 2023-2025 Business Plan were compatible with the management of the Company in a manner consistent with those targets;\n- \u00b7 in 2022 no petitions were received by the Board of Auditors nor did we receive any complaints concerning circumstances deemed censurable pursuant to Article 2408 of the Italian Civil Code;\n- \u00b7 we  monitored  the  effective  implementation  of  the  Corporate  Governance  Code, verifying  the  compliance  of  Enel's  corporate  governance  arrangements  with  the recommendations of the Code.

This is a best practice that the Board of Statutory Auditors intended to adopt even in the absence of a specific recommendation of the Corporate Governance Code,  a  'peer-to-peer  review'  approach,  i.e.,  the  assessment  not  only  of  the functioning of the body as a whole, but also of the style and content of the contribution provided by each of the auditors. The approach adopted in performing the board review for 2022  and the findings  of that review are described in detail in the report on corporate governance and ownership structure for 2022.\n\nDuring 2022, the Board of Statutory Auditors also participated in an induction program, characterized by specific studies to update directors and statutory auditors on cyber security and risk governance issues. The Board of Statutory Auditors suggests that with each turnover of the corporate bodies, an induction program be conducted in order to provide  an in-depth overview of the structural characteristics and operation  of the Group;\n\n- \u00b7 we monitored the application of the provisions of Legislative Decree 254 of December 30, 2016 (hereinafter 'Decree 254') concerning the disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by certain large undertakings and groups. In performing that activity, we monitored the adequacy of the organizational, administrative, reporting and control system established by the Company in order to enable the accurate representation in the consolidated non-financial statements for 2022 of the activity of the Enel Group, its results and its impacts in the non-financial areas referred to in",

Those rules (which can be consulted on the corporate website) contain appropriate provisions directed at subsidiaries to enable Enel to comply  with  statutory  public  disclosure  requirements,  pursuant  to  Article  114, paragraph 2, of the Consolidated Law on Financial Intermediation ;\n- \u00b7 in 2002 the Company also adopted (and has subsequently updated, most recently in February 2021) a Code of Ethics (also available on the corporate website) that expresses the commitments and ethical responsibilities involved in the conduct of business, regulating and harmonizing corporate conduct in accordance with standards of maximum transparency and fairness with respect to all stakeholders;\n- \u00b7 with regard to the provisions of Legislative Decree 231 of June 8, 2001  -  which introduced into Italian law a system of administrative (in fact criminal) liability for companies for certain types of offences committed by its directors, managers or employees on behalf of or to the benefit of the company - since July 2002 Enel has adopted a compliance program consisting of a 'general part' and various 'special parts' concerning the difference offences specified by Legislative Decree 231/2001 that the program is intended to prevent. For a description of the manner in which the model has been adapted to the characteristics of the various Italian companies of the Group, as well as a description of the purposes of the 'Enel Global Compliance Program' for the Group's foreign companies, please see the Report on Corporate Governance and Ownership  Structure  for  2022.  The  structure  that  monitors  the  operation  and compliance with the program and is responsible for updating it is a collegial body. This body, appointed in July 2020, is still composed of three external members who jointly have specific professional expertise on corporate organization matters and corporate criminal law. The Board of Statutory Auditors received adequate information on the main activities carried out in 2022  by  that body, including in meetings with its members. Our examination of those activities found no facts or situations that would require mention in this report;\n- \u00b7 in 2022, the Board of Statutory Auditors issued a favorable opinion (at the meeting of February  2, 2022) on the 2022  Audit Plan, in accordance with the provisions of Recommendation 33, letter c) of the Corporate Governance Code;",

The design of these remuneration instruments is in line with best practices as it complies with the principle of establishing a link with appropriate financial and non-financial performance targets and pursuing the creation of shareholder value over the medium and long term. The proposals to the Board of Directors concerning such forms of compensation and the determination of the  associated  parameters  were  prepared  by  the  Nomination  and  Compensation Committee, which is made up entirely of independent directors, drawing on the findings of  benchmark  analyses,  including  at  the  international  level,  conducted  by  an independent consulting firm. In addition, the second section of the  Remuneration Report  contains,  in  compliance  with  the  applicable  CONSOB  regulations,  specific disclosures on the remuneration received in 2022 by the members of the oversight body and by key management personnel (in aggregate form for the latter).\n\nThe  Board  of  Statutory  Auditors  also  supervised  the  process  of  preparing  the remuneration policy for 2023, described in full in the first section of the Remuneration Report, without finding any critical issues. In particular, oversight activity examined the consistency of the various measures envisaged by that policy with (i) the provisions of Directive (EU) 2017/828 as transposed into Italian law, (ii) the recommendations of the Italian Corporate Governance Code, as well as (iii) the results of the benchmark analysis carried out, including at the international level, by an independent consulting firm that the Nomination and Compensation Committee elected to engage.\n\nAs indicated in the first section of the Remuneration Report, during the preparation of the remuneration policy for 2023, the Board of Statutory Auditors - taking account of the recommendations in this regard by the Corporate Governance Code - asked the independent consulting firm to conduct an additional benchmark analysis to ascertain the adequacy of the remuneration paid to the members of the oversight body. This analysis was performed on the basis of the data reported in the documentation published on the occasion of 2022 shareholders' meetings by issuers belonging to a peer group composed - unlike that used for the analogous analysis concerning the\n\n<!-- image -->",

The functions that the Italian legal system assigns to the Board of Statutory Auditors differentiate the latter from the bodies with oversight functions provided for in the onetier and two-tier governance systems commonly adopted in other countries. For the purpose of identifying the peer group, the consultant, in agreement with the Board of Statutory Auditors, decided to exclude certain industrial companies belonging to the FTSE-MIB index that have concentrated ownership structures, while evaluating some companies in the FTSE-MIB index operating in the financial services industry.\n\nThe analysis showed that, on the basis of the data as at December 31, 2021, Enel exceeds the peer group in terms of capitalization, is above the ninth decile in terms of revenue and slightly below the ninth decile in terms of number of employees.\n\nThe same analysis also found that - against Enel's very high positioning compared with the companies included in the panel in terms of capitalization, revenue and number of employees - the remuneration of the Chairman of the Board of Statutory Auditors and of the other Statutory Auditors is below the peer group median for the Chairman and in line with the median for the other standing Statutory Auditors. The analysis also found that in 2021, on average, the boards of statutory auditors of the companies belonging to the panel were composed of four standing auditors compared with the three standing members of Enel's Board of Statutory Auditors, and held 26 meetings compared with the 28 meetings held by Enel's Board of Statutory Auditors.\n\nOn the basis of the analysis, it therefore emerged that the competitiveness of the remuneration envisaged for the Chairman and the other standing members of Enel's Board of Statutory Auditors is similar to the positioning of the non-executive directors of Enel with regard to the remuneration paid to them in their capacity as directors (net of attendance fees, which at Enel are not envisaged for participation in board meetings but are paid by some of the peer group companies used for the purpose of preparing the 2023 policy for directors' remuneration).\n\nThe analysis found that the positioning of the amount of remuneration paid to the Chairman and the standing members of the Board of Statutory Auditors is substantially in line with that currently paid by the larger of the peer group companies in which the Ministry  for  the  Economy  and  Finance  holds  a  significant  direct  and/or  indirect investment.\n\nHowever, the consultant noted that to correctly assess the appropriateness of the remuneration envisaged for the members of the Board of Statutory Auditors, an overall assessment of the effort required by the position would be advisable.",

This analysis shows that the average remuneration per meeting of the directors is more than three times greater than that of the members of the Board of Statutory Auditors.\n\nThe Board of Statutory Auditors' oversight activity in 2022 was carried out in 24 meetings and with participation in the 16 meetings of the Board of Directors and participation in the annual Shareholders' Meeting, and, through the Chairman or one or more of its members, in the 14  meetings of the Control and Risk Committee (held jointly with the Board of Statutory Auditors), in the 11 meetings of the Nomination and Compensation Committee, in the 1 meeting of the Related Parties Committee and in the 6 meetings of the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee, for a total of 86  meetings. The delegated magistrate of the State Audit Court participated in the meetings of the Board of Statutory Auditors and those of the Board of Directors.\n\nDuring the course of this activity and on the basis of information obtained from KPMG SpA, no omissions, censurable facts, irregularities or other significant developments were found that would require reporting to the regulatory authorities or mention in this report.\n\n## Finally, the Board of Statutory Auditors notes that:\n\n- \u00b7 in 2021 and until March 31, 2022, the health emergency associated with the COVID19 pandemic was still under way in Italy. Through that date, Italian authorities maintained a number of limitations on freedom of movement within the country to contain the contagion, among other things imposing bans on gatherings.  In this context, the Board of Statutory Auditors, in the light of the measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, held some of its meetings - as long as the state of emergency was in place -  exclusively with the use of audio/video conference systems by all participants, which nevertheless ensured their identification and the exchange of documentation - in accordance with the provisions of Article 25.4 of the bylaws - and, more generally, the full performance of the oversight body's functions;\n- \u00b7 the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, as well as the instability of commodity prices, in particular those of gas, strongly influenced operations in 2022. Among other things, we note the sale of the equity investment  in Enel Russia PJSC and the challenges of managing hedging operations for  price fluctuations in the energy markets and the related cash collateral (margin requirements). In this regard, the SACE-secured credit facility referred to earlier strengthened the Enel Group liquidity position. For these and",

Revenue accrued between the date of the last meter reading and the year-end is based on estimates of the daily consumption of individual customers, primarily determined on their historical information, adjusted to reflect the climate factors or other matters that may affect the estimated consumption.\n\nThese estimates are very complex given the nature of underlying assumptions.\n\nTherefore, we believe that the recognition of revenue from the supply of electricity and gas not yet invoiced is a key audit matter.\n\nOur audit procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 understanding the process for the recognition of revenue from the supply of electricity and gas not yet invoiced;\n- \u00b7 assessing the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of controls, including IT controls, deemed material for the purposes of our audit, including by involving our IT specialists;\n- \u00b7 performing substantive procedures on the electricity and gas volumes considered in the estimation;\n- \u00b7 checking the accuracy of the selling prices used in the estimation;\n- \u00b7 comparing the estimates recognised in the consolidated financial statements with the subsequent actual figures;\n- \u00b7 assessing the appropriateness of the disclosures provided in the notes about the revenue from the supply of electricity and gas not yet invoiced.\n\n## Responsibilities of the parent's directors and board of statutory auditors ('Collegio Sindacale') for the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe directors are responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards endorsed by the European Union and the Italian regulations implementing article 9 of Legislative decree no. 38/05 and, within the terms established by the Italian law, for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nThe directors are responsible for assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern and for the appropriate use of the going concern basis in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and for the adequacy of the related disclosures. The use of this basis of accounting is appropriate unless the directors believe that the conditions for liquidating the parent or ceasing operations exist, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Collegio Sindacale is responsible for overseeing, within the terms established by the Italian law, the group's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion.

We also:\n\n- \u00b7 identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
