In 2022, we achieved all four of our consolidated financial targets. Our financial results reflected strong mobile and fixed customer growth and higher direct contribution within\n\nmobility and fixed data services, along with a larger contribution from DLCX, while we continued to invest strategically to enhance our network leadership position and digitization strategy. See Section 1.4 in the MD&A for a detailed description of our results.\n\n## Caution regarding forward-looking statements summary\n\nThis annual report contains forward-looking statements including statements relating to our 2023 targets, environmental and sustainability targets, expected performance and plans for powering our success, and multi-year dividend growth program. By their nature, forward-looking statements do not refer to historical facts and require the Company to make assumptions and predictions, and are subject to inherent risks. There is significant risk that the forward-looking statements will not prove to be accurate and there can be no assurance that TELUS will achieve its targets or performance goals or maintain its multi-year dividend growth program. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, as a number of factors (such as the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory developments and government decisions, the competitive environment, disruptive technology, security and data protection risks, and risks relating to our team) could cause actual future performance and events to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, this document is subject to the disclaimer and qualified by the assumptions (including assumptions on which our 2023 annual targets and guidance are based and regarding semi-annual dividend increases through 2025), qualifications and risk factors as set out in Management's discussion and analysis in this report, especially Sections 9 and 10, and in other TELUS public disclosure documents and filings with securities commissions in Canada (on SEDAR at sedar.com ) and in the United States (on EDGAR at sec.gov ). Except as required by law, TELUS disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements, and reserves the right to change, at any time at its sole discretion, its current practice of updating annual targets and guidance. Statements regarding our 2023 targets are presented for the purpose of assisting our investors and others in understanding certain key elements of our expected 2023 financial results, as well as our objectives, strategic priorities and business outlook.

Overall, we enabled $ 6.6 million in humanitarian and emergency relief in 2022, through cash and in-kind contributions from TELUS, our team members, our customers and TELUS Friendly Future Foundation (TFFF).\n\nExemplifying our long-standing commitment to give where we live, TELUS, our team members and retirees donated $ 125 million in cash, in-kind contributions, time and support programs in 2022 to charitable and community organizations, representing approximately five per cent of our pre-tax profits - far exceeding the North American average of one per cent. Moreover, our 2022 TELUS Days of Giving mobilized over 65,000 members of our TELUS family, helping to drive 1.44 million volunteer hours globally.

We also expanded our national, next-generation 5G network to reach 83 per cent of the Canadian population, powering Canada's economy and making our lives easier, safer and healthier through increased speeds, reliability and capacity.\n\nThese investments have amplified the superiority of TELUS' networks, which have earned multi-year recognition for speed, network quality, user experience and expansiveness from independent third-party organizations. Notably, global analytics company, Opensignal, recognized TELUS with five industry awards in the year for both our 4G and 5G networks, making TELUS Canada's most awarded network by Opensignal for the 11th consecutive time. Similarly, TELUS was honoured with three awards from U.S.-based Ookla in 2022, including being named North America's Fastest Mobile Network according to results from Speedtest by Ookla. Moreover, Canada-based Tutela recognized our wireless network with four national awards for Excellent Consistent Quality, Core Consistent Quality, 5G Excellent Consistent Quality and 5G Core Consistent Quality. Likewise, our wireline network also received praise, ranking as the fastest nationwide internet service provider (ISP) in Canada among major ISPs by U.S.-based PCMag for the third consecutive year.\n\nWhy does this matter? Because reliable networks are the backbone of digital economies, enabling positive outcomes for all of us. TELUS' global-best networks drive economic growth, innovation and job creation, while ensuring that everyone can stay connected to what matters most, including healthcare, safe and healthy food, online education, friends and family, and the flexibility to work remotely; all with the attendant environmental benefits.\n\nOur networks are the engine that powers our purpose and brings to life our brand promise, Let's make the future friendly . Every day, TELUS helps grow the number of familysupporting jobs, nurtures the health and well-being of citizens and lifts up marginalized communities. Indeed, your Company has connected 342,000 individuals through our four Connecting for Good programs, providing vital support for low-income families and seniors, at-risk youth, people living with disabilities, individuals experiencing homelessness and Indigenous women surviving violence.\n\n## Bu/i.ss01/l.ss08d/i.ss01ng mean/i.ss01ngfu/l.ss08 re/l.ss08at/i.ss01onsh/i.ss01ps w/i.ss01th Ind/i.ss01genous commun/i.ss01t/i.ss01es and organ/i.ss01zat/i.ss01ons\n\nOur team is committed to progressing Reconciliation by forging relationships and expanding connectivity to Indigenous communities.

In 2022, we grew the Fund's portfolio to 26 companies, and to date, we have committed almost $ 40 million in investments to socially innovative startups. Importantly, over 40 per cent of our portfolio companies are led by women and more than 50 per cent are led by Indigenous and racialized founders. Today, the TELUS Pollinator Fund is one of the world's largest corporate impact funds, bolstering TELUS' position as the world leader in social capitalism.\n\nTELUS continues to give back through TFFF, which committed $ 10.6 million in cash donations to 548 charities in 2022, while fundraising $ 3.3 million and securing $ 30 million in investments from the TELUS team to establish a new bursary fund. Since its inception in 2018, TFFF has contributed nearly $ 36 million to communities, supporting the incredible work of our TELUS Community Boards in Canada. Across the globe, TELUS Community Boards have invested $ 100 million in cash donations in more than 8,000 initiatives since 2005, providing support for underserved citizens. In 2022, we expanded the regional reach of three Community Boards in Canada and launched our first U.S. Community Board in North Carolina.\n\n## /R.ss04ecogn/i.ss01z/i.ss01ng our pass/i.ss01onate and purpose-dr/i.ss01ven team at the heart of our success\n\nAt TELUS, we are fortunate to have the best team on the planet.

        "page_content": "These initiatives earned TELUS two gold awards from Excellence Canada in 2022.\n\nYour Company once again achieved world-leading team member engagement of 83 per cent, placing TELUS in the top 10 per cent of Canadian employers and the top quartile of employers, globally. Equally important were our ongoing efforts to build an inclusive culture. In 2022, we created an integrated diversity and inclusion website, accessible to both team members and customers. We also launched an employment strategy to support hiring Indigenous Peoples and delivered allyship learning circles to over 800 team members. We believe that advancing diversity is vital, as increasingly, citizens choose to do business with companies that share their values. By building a team that reflects the beautiful diversity of our society, TELUS has achieved industry-leading results in customer growth and loyalty.\n\n## Grow/i.ss01ng and serv/i.ss01ng the most /l.ss08oya/l.ss08 customer base /i.ss01n our /i.ss01ndustry\n\nUndeniably, your Company's commitment to always put our customers first has earned us the most loyal customer base in our industry. In 2022, we achieved blended mobile phone, PureFibre internet, Optik TV, security and voice churn rates all below one per cent. Moreover, we achieved a postpaid mobile phone churn rate of 0.75 per cent, representing our ninth consecutive year of industry-leading customer loyalty with churn rates of less than one per cent one of the few telecoms in the world to achieve such an accomplishment.\n\nTELUS also recorded over one million new client additions in 2022 - an all-time high and well above our Canadian peers. In mobility, we added 401,000 new mobile phone customers, our strongest year since 2010, along with record-high connected device net additions of 368,000. In fixed, we added a best-ever and industryleading 274,000 new client additions, reflecting strong growth across internet, security and TV. Furthermore, over the last three years through the pandemic period, we have added nearly 2.8 million net new total customer additions, demonstrating the significant economic value we are creating through our superior product portfolio. This industry-leading growth reflects the consistent potency of our operational execution, unmatched bundled product offerings across mobile and home, and team member culture focused on delivering exceptional customer experiences over our globally leading PureFibre and 5G networks. Our efforts to embrace digitization and create simplified customer experiences underpin our success, as demonstrated by consistent growth in usage of the My TELUS app and self-serve digital transactions.\n\n## Ach/i.ss01ev/i.ss01ng cons/i.ss01stent and susta/i.ss01ned /i.ss01ndustry-/l.ss08ead/i.ss01ng bus/i.ss01ness resu/l.ss08ts\n\nOnce again in 2022, your Company achieved strong financial results across our business, as evidenced by our industry-leading operating revenues and Adjusted EBITDA growth of 8.6 and 9.5 per cent, respectively, while net income was up 1.2 per cent. Moreover, cash flow from operations increased by 9.6 per cent and free cash flow was higher by an industry-leading 64 per cent.

These strong results demonstrate TI's position as a trusted advisor for premier digital customer experiences and IT services for its over 650 global clients across key industry verticals, including tech and games, communications and media, eCommerce and fintech, banking, financial services and insurance, consumer goods, healthcare and life sciences, and travel and hospitality. In early 2023, TI closed its acquisition of WillowTree, a full-service digital product provider, further advancing our ambition to continue building TI into a global asset of consequence and scale. Importantly, the acquisition also supports the acceleration of TELUS' ongoing digital transformation and key product development across our business, particularly in health, agriculture and consumer goods.\n\nAs Canadians returned to more pre-pandemic behaviours in 2022, TELUS continued to offer peace of mind through our innovative security and automation services, welcoming an industry-leading 174,000 new security customers through a mix of organic growth and the acquisition of Vivint Smart Home. Impressively, TELUS SmartHome Security led the industry in 2022, responding to 2.3 million high-priority alarms with an average response time under 60 seconds.

Indeed, we are not just a company, but a movement of human beings with a passion for social purpose. Two areas of our business in which we drove meaningful change in 2022 were TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods.\n\nTELUS Health achieved several milestones, including the completion of our historic acquisition of LifeWorks, a world leader in providing digital and in-person solutions that support the mental health and well-being of individuals and their families. We also continued to meaningfully scale our health business in 2022, nearing the $ 1 billion milestone in health services revenue, an increase of 75 per cent, covering 68 million lives through our programs, growing our virtual care members to 4.5 million, and executing more than 580 million digital health transactions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs we worked to improve access to healthcare, we launched our new TELUS Health Virtual Pharmacy service, enabling individuals to manage their prescriptions online, chat with a pharmacist by video or phone, and have medications delivered to their door. We also launched an exciting evolution in our suite of virtual healthcare solutions, TELUS Health MyPet, connecting customers and their pets to veterinary health advice through a mobile app. As we progress into 2023, we will continue to focus intensely on integrating and scaling our global health operations to build the healthiest communities and workplaces on the planet, under the leadership of our new TELUS Health President Sid Kosaraju.\n\nIn addition, TELUS Agriculture evolved to become TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods in 2022, as our team continues to integrate and grow this compelling global business, achieving revenue growth of 24 per cent and reaching $ 354 million in annual revenues. We are creating significant value as the leading provider of agriculture and consumer goods technology solutions around the world, as we advance the sector's efficiency and effectiveness, including food quality production, waste reduction, food and retail execution, and trade promotion optimization, all through data analytics.",

Notably, for the second year in a row, TELUS was recognized as one of the top 10 best business-to-business (B2B) brands in Canada, as our team continues to pursue exciting opportunities with some of Canada's top brands to help businesses thrive in a digital world.\n\nTo support our business customers, we recommitted $ 1 million to #StandWithOwners, shining a spotlight on small business owners. Similarly, we introduced ShopWithOwners.ca , a free online platform where entrepreneurs can reach customers seeking to shop locally. As proud supporters of Canadian business, your Company has committed $ 2.5 million since 2020 to empower owners.\n\n## Outperform/i.ss01ng our peers to rea/l.ss08/i.ss01ze unpara/l.ss08/l.ss08e/l.ss08ed resu/l.ss08ts for shareho/l.ss08ders\n\nTELUS' exceptional performance in 2022 was the culmination of our collective focus on delivering our proven growth strategy, to the benefit of all stakeholders we serve - including you, our investors.\n\nBeginning in 2023, we are targeting a decline in annual capital expenditures to approximately $ 2.6 billion, a significant reduction over 2022, given the conclusion of our accelerated broadband investment program. We expect this will support meaningful and sustainable free cash flow expansion, in concert with ongoing strong EBITDA contribution growth, and value creation across our TI, TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods businesses. Notably, it will also be complemented by the additional revenue and cost benefits that fibre ubiquity and increased digitization will deliver. In addition, in 2023, we have allocated $ 75 million to support the development and monetization of excess real estate assets as a result of copper decommissioning.\n\nOur consistently strong results and transformational investments enable TELUS to create unparalleled longterm value for our shareholders. Thanks to these results, your Company has maintained a robust balance sheet while returning significant capital to investors. Notably, since the beginning of 2000 through January 31, 2023, TELUS has generated a total shareholder return of 705 per cent. This result is double the Toronto Stock Exchange's S&P/TSX Composite Index (TSX) return of 348 per cent and 699 points higher than the return from the MSCI World Telecom Services Index of 5.6 per cent. Moreover, over the past 10 and 15 year time periods, TELUS has surpassed the TSX return by an average of 114 percentage points.\n\n## De/l.ss08/i.ss01ver/i.ss01ng va/l.ss08ue for /i.ss01nvestors and fam/i.ss01/l.ss08/i.ss01es through our d/i.ss01v/i.ss01dend growth program\n\nImportantly, the conclusion of our accelerated broadband investment initiative, coupled with ongoing leading operational and financial performance, will augment the long-term sustainability of our industry-leading dividend growth program, now in its 13th year. Indeed, in 2022, we announced for the fourth time since 2011, the extension of our dividend growth program, targeting annual increases of seven to 10 per cent from 2023 through 2025. Furthermore, we also announced our 23rd dividend increase since 2011, raising our annual dividends declared by approximately seven per cent over 2021. Notably, since 2004, TELUS has returned $ 23 billion to shareholders, including $ 18 billion in dividends and more than $ 5 billion in share purchases, representing $ 16 per share.\n\n## Our team /i.ss01s ded/i.ss01cated to protect/i.ss01ng the p/l.ss08anet our ch/i.ss01/l.ss08dren w/i.ss01/l.ss08/l.ss08 /i.ss01nher/i.ss01t/comma.ss01 as demonstrated by our /l.ss08ong-stand/i.ss01ng h/i.ss01story of meet/i.ss01ng/comma.ss01 or exceed/i.ss01ng/comma.ss01 amb/i.ss01t/i.ss01ous env/i.ss01ronmenta/l.ss08 targets/period.ss01\n\nThis is just one of the ways we support our investors around the world, including individual shareholders, mutual funds and pension plans, and our TELUS team members, who collectively represent our fifth largest shareholder.

Our team is dedicated to protecting the planet our children will inherit, as demonstrated by our long-standing history of meeting, or exceeding, ambitious environmental targets. This leadership was evident in 2022 when TELUS completed our second and third sustainability-linked bond offerings. This sustainable financing structure ties the effective interest rate to the achievement of our long-term, sciencebased, operational greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets, specifically, a 46 per cent reduction in absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from 2019 levels by 2030.",

        "page_content": "Further reinforcing this commitment, we also initiated a campaign to plant our one millionth tree and a program in support of a circular economy - repairing, recycling and reusing wireless devices - saving 3.8 million devices from landfills since 2000.\n\nYour Company reached several sustainability milestones in 2022, including effectively having 90 per cent of our electricity requirements coming from renewable sources, which has also driven millions of dollars in cost savings. Likewise, we officially opened TELUS Sky in Calgary - one of the most technologically innovative and environmentally sustainable developments in North America - and received the Sustainability Excellence Award at the World Sustainability Awards in Germany.\n\nTELUS endorsed the United Nations Global Compact's (UNGC) CEO Water Mandate, a movement that mobilizes business leaders to address global water challenges through corporate water stewardship, in partnership with the United Nations, governments, civil society organizations and other stakeholders. As signatories to the UNGC, TELUS takes action and shares progress in respect of human rights, labour, environmental and anti-corruption practices, reinforcing our commitment to creating stronger, more sustainable communities.\n\nThis commitment extends beyond sustainability, to embracing tax morality as a means of investing in our communities. Since 2000, TELUS has paid approximately $ 54 billion in total tax and spectrum remittances to our federal, provincial and municipal governments. These funds support public works projects and critical national infrastructure, as well as education, healthcare, national defence, cultural pursuits and initiatives that improve the social and economic well-being of our communities.\n\n## Mak/i.ss01ng the future fr/i.ss01end/l.ss08y for peop/l.ss08e around the wor/l.ss08d\n\nAt TELUS, we believe we must all work together to create a brighter tomorrow. In 2022, we continued to meaningfully integrate social purpose into our marketing and communications efforts, while evolving our social media presence, leading to TELUS being the most followed brand on social media across all of our key industry peers.\n\nOur team's efforts throughout the year earned TELUS brand resonance as the world leader in social capitalism. This has resulted in global accolades, including being named the Most Valuable Telco Brand in Canada by Brand Finance at $ 10.1 billion, one of Canada's Most Authentic Brands and Canada's Most Trusted Telecom Brand by Gustavson Brand Trust Index, one of Canada's Best B2B Brands by Report on Business, and the Most Respected Mobile Service Provider in Canada as voted by the Canadian public.\n\n## Sett/i.ss01ng bo/l.ss08d soc/i.ss01a/l.ss08 and f/i.ss01nanc/i.ss01a/l.ss08 targets for 2023 and beyond\n\nAs our team progresses through 2023, we will do so with our hallmark passion for purpose, as reflected by our bold social impact, community giving and financial targets.\n\nFirstly, we will continue to give where we live, guided by our 2023 social impact targets, which include: inspiring our TELUS family to contribute 1.5 million hours of volunteerism, improving outcomes for a cumulative 430,000 low-income Canadians through our Connecting for Good programs, contributing $ 95 million to charitable and community organizations, launching an annual $ 1 million bursary program to support students aspiring to attend post-secondary institutions, and investing a further $ 20 million through the TELUS Pollinator Fund to support socially innovative startups.\n\nSecondly, we anticipate that 100 per cent of our electricity will effectively come from renewable or lowemitting sources by 2025, our operations will be net carbon neutral by 2030 or earlier, we will become a zero-waste company by 2030, and our energy efficiency will improve by 50 per cent from 2019 levels by 2030.\n\nFinally, our industry-leading financial targets for 2023 include growth in consolidated operating revenues and Adjusted EBITDA of up to 14 and 11 per cent, respectively, capital expenditures of approximately $ 2.6 billion, and robust free cash flow of approximately $ 2 billion, up close to 60 per cent.\n\n## Express/i.ss01ng our grat/i.ss01tude for your cont/i.ss01nued patronage and support\n\nThroughout 2022, your Company drove positive outcomes across the globe.

I invite you all to follow my social media channels for updates throughout the coming year, as I highlight our team's social purpose in action and recognize remarkable members of our team.

The Community Board builds on the efforts of our North Carolina team members, who have a rich and meaningful history of giving back across the state.\n\n## /R.ss04evo/l.ss08ut/i.ss01on/i.ss01z/i.ss01ng hea/l.ss08th outcomes\n\nWe continued to leverage our leadership in health technology and wellness solutions to deliver improved health and wellbeing outcomes for citizens around the world.\n\nOur Health for Good\u00ae program continued to expand in 2022 with the launch of the new mobile care clinic, powered by TELUS Health, in partnership with The Alex Community Health Centre in Calgary. Now supporting 23 communities across the country, Health for Good provides primary healthcare and mental health support to people in need and experiencing homelessness. Through our mobile health clinics, we supported over 47,000 patient visits in 2022.\n\nTELUS Health's scale and innovative health solutions were significantly enhanced by our acquisition of LifeWorks in 2022. Together, our combined organizations will enable employers to give employees and their families the tools they need to proactively manage their health and wellness so they can lead their healthiest, most productive lives. Through our innovative healthcare resources and solutions, we are collectively providing well-being support to over 68 million lives, worldwide.\n\n## Lead/i.ss01ng /i.ss01n susta/i.ss01nab/i.ss01/l.ss08/i.ss01ty\n\nSustainability strategies are deeply embedded in all areas of our business as we continue to find innovative ways to lessen our impact on the global environment, including reducing our environmental footprint and making the global food supply more sustainable. Visit telus.com/sustainability for more details.\n\nWe remain on track to achieving our environmental and sustainability targets, which include:\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Improving energy efficiency by 50 per cent from 2019 levels by 2030\n- /bullet.ss01 Effectively procuring 100 per cent of our electricity requirements from renewable or low-emitting sources by 2025\n- /bullet.ss01 Becoming a zero-waste and net carbon neutral company by 2030.\n\n## Invest/i.ss01ng /i.ss01n renewab/l.ss08e energy\n\nTo help us achieve our net carbon neutrality and renewable electricity goals, we entered into virtual power purchase agreements with renewable energy developments in Alberta that produce solar and wind powered electricity. These facilities became operational in 2022, which means all of our electricity needs in Alberta are effectively being met by solar or wind sources. These renewable energy investments enable us to grow our core business sustainably while powering our networks from cleaner electricity sources. In fact, 90 per cent of our electricity requirements in Canada were effectively procured from renewable or low-emitting sources in 2022.\n\n## L/i.ss01nk/i.ss01ng f/i.ss01nanc/i.ss01ng to env/i.ss01ronmenta/l.ss08 performance\n\nDuring 2022, we completed two offerings of sustainabilitylinked bonds, once again linking our financing directly to achieving sustainability targets. The bonds tie our cost of borrowing to TELUS achieving its science-based target to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 46 per cent from 2019 levels by 2030. If we miss the target, remaining interest payments will increase.\n\n## /R.ss04educ/i.ss01ng e/l.ss08ectron/i.ss01c waste\n\nAs we work toward becoming a zero-waste company, we continually look for ways to reduce, recycle and reuse. Through our innovative programs, customers can trade in, repair or donate used devices. In 2022, we upcycled 244,000 devices through our Bring-It-Back\u00ae and trade-in programs and provided more than 3,860 devices through our Mobility for Good program, thus saving over 40 metric tonnes of GHG emissions.\n\n## Demonstrat/i.ss01ng good governance and /i.ss01ntegr/i.ss01ty\n\nWe continually pursue best-in-class corporate governance practices and ensure greater transparency and integrity in all our actions.

To provide guidance on our Reconciliation commitments, in 2022 we introduced an Indigenous Advisory Council, made up of Indigenous leaders and subject-matter experts.\n\nWe continue to hold ourselves accountable to the actions we set in our 2021 Indigenous Reconciliation Action Plan (IRAP). For example, in 2022 we worked with Indigenous educator Chastity Davis-Alphonse, Tla'amin and T\u015dilhqot'in Nations, to develop a Truth and Reconciliation virtual learning program, offering team members an opportunity to learn about Canadian history through an Indigenous lens.

We also launched the Digital Witness Blanket in partnership with the Canadian Museum for Human Rights and Indigenous artist Carey Newman (Hayalthkin'geme), enabling users to bear witness to the experiences of residential school Survivors. As well, in November 2021, we established the TELUS Indigenous Communities Fund, and have committed $ 300,000 to 15 Indigenous-led community programs supporting food security, cultural revitalization, and health, mental health and well-being. A complete update on our IRAP commitments can be found in our 2022 Indigenous Reconciliation and Connectivity Report at telus.com/reconciliation .\n\nWe continue to collaborate with Indigenous governments and organizations to deliver advanced broadband connectivity to Indigenous communities within our service area. In partnership with Indigenous governments, TELUS connected an additional 12 Indigenous lands to our advanced broadband internet service in 2022. Now, more than 83 per cent of homes, small businesses and government buildings on Indigenous lands can access high-speed internet and participate in digital tools.\n\n## Foster/i.ss01ng d/i.ss01vers/i.ss01ty\n\nOur commitment to diversity and inclusion is at the core of our culture and central to our leadership in social capitalism. We recognize that in all areas of our business, different perspectives, experiences and backgrounds bring innovative ways of thinking that help us drive better decision-making, insights and solutions.\n\nWe continue to foster a culture of diversity and inclusion within our team, including our Board of Directors. Currently, six of our 14 independent directors are women (43 per cent), and three of our independent directors represent a visible minority or are Indigenous.\n\nIn 2022, we achieved a score of 85 per cent on our inclusion index, first launched in 2021, indicating a strong sense of inclusion and belonging among team members. This result demonstrates our ability to encourage, harness and value diversity of thought, driven by the diversity of our teams and our inclusive team culture that enables team members to be their best selves. A key driver is the continued enthusiasm shown by team members in embracing the enriched learning opportunities available in the evolved diversity and inclusion learning space we launched in 2022, including topics on being more inclusive, respectful workplace, unconscious bias, allyship, microaggressions, anti-racism, and many more.\n\n## Innovat/i.ss01ng w/i.ss01th data respons/i.ss01b/l.ss08y\n\nTo ensure we continue to manage data responsibly while upholding our stringent privacy and data governance standards, we proactively pursue best practices for data collection and protection.\n\nIn 2022, we evolved our approach to data privacy and security assessments with the data enablement plan, which unifies our data reviews into a single process. A key component of this evolution is the introduction of more than 300 in-business data stewards, who are team members specially trained to support their business units. This collaborative approach makes data assessments faster and more effective and empowers business units to be active participants in the enablement of responsible\n\ndata use.\n\n## Cu/l.ss08t/i.ss01vat/i.ss01ng our wor/l.ss08d-/l.ss08ead/i.ss01ng cu/l.ss08ture\n\nWe believe that building and sustaining a strong ethical culture is the shared commitment and responsibility of all team members and ensures decisions are made with the highest level of integrity, transparency and respect.\n\nIn 2022, all of our team members were required to complete an integrity attestation, demonstrating their ongoing commitment to integrity and confirming their understanding of our code of ethics and conduct, respectful workplace, security and privacy policies.\n\nWe continue to provide an EthicsLine for anonymous and confidential questions or complaints on internal control and other issues related to integrity. Calls are handled by an independent agency, offering multi-language services to internal and external callers 24 hours a day. For the 20th consecutive year, none of the calls reported to the Ethics Office in 2022 involved officers or team members with a significant role in internal control over financial reporting.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Social capitalism is when a for-profit organization uses its core business to make the world a better place. It is not socialism, charity or philanthropy. Rather, it is when companies take responsibility and accountability to address pressing social issues with its products and services. Purpose-driven organizations like ours effectively align and embed financials, disclosures, climate change targets, diversity and more, into strategy and operations, ensuring we are both responding to the demands of today and preparing for the world of tomorrow.\n\nAt TELUS, our social purpose is to leverage our globalleading technology and compassion to drive social change and enable remarkable human outcomes.

Since 2013, we have connected three million households and businesses in British Columbia, Alberta and Eastern Quebec to TELUS PureFibre, the most advanced broadband technology in the world, and our ultra-fast 5G network now covers approximately 83 per cent of the population, revolutionizing the way people work and play.\n\nBy br/i.ss01ng/i.ss01ng h/i.ss01gh-speed and re/l.ss08/i.ss01ab/l.ss08e networks to remote areas/comma.ss01 we are enab/l.ss08/i.ss01ng peop/l.ss08e to thr/i.ss01ve /i.ss01n the/i.ss01r commun/i.ss01t/i.ss01es and are support/i.ss01ng mean/i.ss01ngfu/l.ss08 hea/l.ss08th/comma.ss01 educat/i.ss01on/comma.ss01 econom/i.ss01c and cu/l.ss08tura/l.ss08 outcomes that w/i.ss01/l.ss08/l.ss08 be fe/l.ss08t for generat/i.ss01ons/period.ss01\n\nKnown for its superior symmetrical upload and download speeds and reliability, TELUS PureFibre is also Canada's most sustainable internet technology, requiring up to five times fewer watts per gigabit than copper. Making good on our commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we are accelerating our strategy to retire our legacy copper network in communities within our TELUS PureFibre footprint. In addition to vastly enhancing customer experiences, our copper decommissioning program is unlocking significant operating and cost efficiencies, including helping to deliver higher product penetration within the home, increased digital self-serve capabilities, better customer loyalty results and lower cost to serve.\n\nFurthermore, as we continue to retire our legacy copper network and reduce our overall network footprint requirements, we are actively capitalizing on this freed up land, enabling us to redevelop and monetize certain real estate assets within our footprint. Ultimately, our real\n\nestate portfolio will be a mix of commercial, residential rental and industrial sites, helping to enhance the vibrancy of communities and optimizing the usage and sustainability of neighbourhoods where people live and work. This is another example of how we are using digital transformation to create synergistic work across our business, while optimizing investments and enabling meaningful outcomes for our communities.\n\nFor those living outside our TELUS PureFibre footprint, we continue to advocate for responsible and effective spectrum policy that will allow us to bring leading mobility connectivity to rural, remote and Indigenous areas. By bringing high-speed and reliable networks to remote areas, we are enabling people to thrive in their communities and are supporting meaningful health, education, economic and cultural outcomes that will be felt for generations.\n\n## What are your areas of focus to support cont/i.ss01nued growth across consumer so/l.ss08ut/i.ss01ons/question.ss01\n\nZa/i.ss01nu/l.ss08 Maw/j.ss01/i.ss01 EVP and President, Consumer Solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTELUS empowers Canadians with exceptional experiences on our award-winning network, keeping them connected to what matters most through simple, personalized and reliable solutions.

These bond offerings support TELUS' commitment to environmental sustainability by linking our financing to the achievement of our ambitious environmental targets. As one of the leading issuers of SLBs in Canada, TELUS is positioned at the forefront of sustainability practices, leveraging behaviour-based financing to advance sustainability goals and welcome new ESG-focused investors.\n\n## Transformat/i.ss01ona/l.ss08 /i.ss01nvestments\n\nOver the past decade, our team has successfully leveraged the historically low interest rate environment, recognizing it as an opportunity to accelerate our growth strategy, including our generational investments in TELUS PureFibre. In 2022, we continued our pursuit of network excellence, accessibility and reliability by investing strategically in the expansion of our PureFibre and 5G networks and completing our accelerated broadband build-out. We invested nearly $ 3.5 billion in 2022, further strengthening our competitive position while driving strong profitable customer growth, realizing operational efficiencies and delivering cash flow benefits that will be sustainable over the long term.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs the Global Executive Sponsor of Spectrum, our TELUS resource group for members of the LGBTQ2+ community, Doug believes in empowering team members to bring their whole selves to work and demonstrates his commitment by participating in the Pride Parade every year along with his family.\n\n## D/i.ss01fferent/i.ss01ated by our h/i.ss01gh-growth techno/l.ss08ogy-or/i.ss01ented vert/i.ss01ca/l.ss08s\n\nAt TELUS, our financial strength is supported by the power of our highly differentiated asset mix and underscored by our determination to help address the world's most pressing social issues. At the beginning of 2023, TELUS International's digital services portfolio was greatly enhanced by the acquisition of WillowTree, significantly expanding its ability to support and accelerate our ongoing digital transformation and key product development, particularly within our health and agriculture and consumer goods businesses.\n\nIn health, we continue to meaningfully scale our operations, leveraging our suite of innovative digital health solutions and clinical services to improve outcomes for citizens through access to better healthcare information and empower people to live healthier lives. Health services revenue grew by 75 per cent in 2022, and our $ 2.2 billion acquisition of LifeWorks in September accelerated our transformative vision for employerbased healthcare. As one of the largest global providers of digital-first health and wellness services, TELUS Health is now positioned to support corporate clients across more than 160 countries, and is currently providing coverage for 68 million lives around the world. In 2023, we will focus on integrating LifeWorks into TELUS Health. We expect to realize significant synergies, and we plan to leverage TELUS International's",

By delivering revenue growth of 24 per cent in 2022 and rapidly expanding its assets and capabilities, this business is creating significant value for TELUS as a leading global provider of technology solutions for the agriculture and consumer goods sectors. TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods is now wellpositioned to connect participants across the entire value chain, from seed growers to food and consumer goods retailers, and enable them to make timely and informed business decisions, driven by data analytics.\n\n## Industry-/l.ss08ead/i.ss01ng customer /l.ss08oya/l.ss08ty\n\nCustomer growth in 2022 remained strong with a record 1,043,000 new mobile and fixed customer connections. We are also pleased to report leading customer loyalty results, as evidenced by an unprecedented churn rate of less than one per cent within mobile phone, PureFibre internet, Optik TV, security and voice services. Since the beginning of 2020, we have added nearly 2.8 million new customer connections, outpacing our closest peer by nearly two times - a reflection of our superior portfolio of bundled solutions, leading customer loyalty and long-standing commitment to our communities.\n\n## De/l.ss08/i.ss01ver/i.ss01ng va/l.ss08ue for our shareho/l.ss08ders\n\nIn 2022, we delivered strong financial results that were in line with our guidance for the year. Indeed, operating revenues grew by 8.6 per cent to $ 18.3 billion, net income grew by 1.2 per cent to $ 1.7 billion and Adjusted EBITDA increased by 9.5 per cent to $ 6.6 billion. Furthermore, cash flow from operations increased by nearly 10 per cent to $ 4.8 billion, while free cash flow increased by 64 per cent to nearly $ 1.3 billion, surpassing our original target for 2022.\n\nOur strong and sustained operational and financial performance is supported by our robust balance sheet and liquidity position. We have a strong debt maturity schedule, with the average term to maturity of our long-term debt now at more than 12 years, and only $ 500 million coming due in 2023. Importantly, the average cost of our long-term debt remained low, at 4.03 per cent, and 86 per cent of our debt is fixed. Our balance sheet will be further reinforced in 2023 with a meaningful increase in free cash flow, driven by strong EBITDA growth and a significant reduction in capital expenditures. Our robust balance sheet and leading growth profile support our well-established dividend growth program, now in its 13th year. During 2022, we increased our dividend twice, as planned, and extended our dividend growth program through 2025, targeting annual growth of seven to 10 per cent.\n\nANNUAL /R.ss04EPO/R.ss04T/thinspace/bullet.ss01 33\n\n## At TELUS/comma.ss01 our f/i.ss01nanc/i.ss01a/l.ss08 strength /i.ss01s supported by the power of our h/i.ss01gh/l.ss08y d/i.ss01fferent/i.ss01ated asset m/i.ss01x and underscored by our determ/i.ss01nat/i.ss01on to he/l.ss08p address the wor/l.ss08d/quoteright.ss01s most press/i.ss01ng soc/i.ss01a/l.ss08 /i.ss01ssues/period.ss01\n\n## Look/i.ss01ng to the future\n\nWe remain highly confident in our long-term strategy and sustainable growth trajectory. We have set ambitious consolidated financial targets for 2023, including growth in operating revenues of 11 to 14 per cent, Adjusted EBITDA of 9.5 to 11 per cent, capital expenditures of approximately $ 2.6 billion and free cash flow of approximately $ 2.0 billion. In addition, we also intend to invest $ 75 million in 2023 towards delivering on our strategy of developing certain real estate assets within our footprint. Our ability to begin this initiative reflects the early successes of our copper decommissioning program and we anticipate our portfolio of real estate holdings to increase over time as we develop a mix of commercial, residential rental and industrial sites.\n\nOur global leadership in social capitalism and unwavering commitment to building shareholder value, as well as an ambitious growth profile for TELUS International, TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods, will enable us to continue making a world of difference for our customers, investors and communities around the world in 2023 and beyond.\n\nBest regards,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nANNUAL /R.ss04EPO/R.ss04T/thinspace/bullet.ss01 33\n\n<!-- image -->",

Forward-looking statements include any statements that do not refer to historical facts. They include, but are not limited to, statements relating to our objectives and our strategies to achieve those objectives, our plans and expectations regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and responses to it, our expectations regarding trends in the telecommunications industry (including demand for data and ongoing subscriber base growth), and our financing plans (including our multiyear dividend growth program). Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the words assumption , goal , guidance , objective , outlook , strategy , target and other similar expressions, or future or conditional verbs such as aim , anticipate , believe , could , expect , intend , may , plan , predict , seek , should , strive and will . These statements are made pursuant to the 'safe harbour' provisions of applicable securities laws in Canada and the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 .\n\nBy their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties and are based on assumptions, including assumptions about future economic conditions and courses of action. These assumptions may ultimately prove to have been inaccurate and, as a result, our actual results or other events may differ materially from expectations expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements. Our general outlook and assumptions for 2023 are presented in Section 9 General trends, outlook and assumptions, and regulatory developments and proceedings in this Management's discussion and analysis (MD&A).\n\nRisks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or other events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made herein and in other TELUS filings include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Regulatory matters including: changes to our regulatory regime (the timing of announcement or implementation of which are uncertain) or the outcomes of proceedings, cases or inquiries relating to its application, including but not limited to those set out in Section 9.4 Communications industry regulatory developments and proceedings in this MD&A, such as the potential for government to allow consolidation of competitors in our industry or conversely for government to intervene with the intent of further increasing competition, for example, through mandated wholesale access; the potential for additional government intervention on pricing; federal and provincial consumer protection legislation; a new policy direction to the CRTC; the introduction in Parliament of new federal privacy legislation that could materially expand or alter the scope of consumer privacy rights, include significant administrative monetary penalties and a privacy right of action, and implement a new regulatory regime for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the private sector, with significant enforcement powers; amendments to existing federal legislation; potential threats to unitary federal regulatory authority over communications in Canada; potential threats to the CRTC's ability to enforce competitive safeguards such as the Standstill Rule and the Wholesale Code , which aims to ensure the fair treatment by vertically integrated firms of rival competitors operating as both broadcasting distributors and programming services; regulatory action by the Competition Bureau or other regulatory agencies; spectrum allocation and compliance with licences, including our compliance with licence conditions, changes to spectrum licence fees, spectrum policy determinations such as restrictions on the purchase, sale, subordination, use and transfer of spectrum licences, the cost and availability of spectrum and timing of spectrum allocation, and ongoing and future consultations and decisions on spectrum licensing and policy frameworks, auctions and allocation; draft legislation permitting the government to restrict the use in telecommunications networks of equipment made by specified companies, potentially including Huawei and ZTE; draft legislation imposing new cybersecurity reporting requirements; the request by the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry to telecommunications service providers, including TELUS, to improve network resiliency; restrictions on non-Canadian ownership and control of the common shares of TELUS Corporation (Common Shares) and the ongoing monitoring of, and compliance with, such restrictions; unanticipated changes to the current copyright regime, which could impact obligations for internet service providers or broadcasting undertakings; and our ability to comply with complex and changing regulation of the healthcare and medical devices industry in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including as an operator of health clinics. The jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as the contracts that we enter into (particularly contracts entered into by TELUS International (Cda) Inc. (TELUS International or TI)), require us to comply with, or facilitate our clients' compliance with, numerous, complex and sometimes conflicting legal regimes, both domestically and internationally. See TELUS International's financial performance which impacts our financial performance below.\n- /bullet.ss01 The COVID-19 pandemic including its impacts on our customers, suppliers and vendors, our team members and our communities, as well as changes resulting from the pandemic to our business and operations.\n- /bullet.ss01 Competitive environment including: our ability to continue to retain customers through an enhanced customer service experience that is differentiated from our competitors, including through the deployment and operation of evolving network infrastructure; intense competition, including the ability of industry competitors to successfully combine a mix of new service offerings, in some cases under one bundled and/or discounted monthly rate, along with their existing services; the success of new products, services and supporting systems, such as home automation, security and Internet of Things (IoT) services for internet-connected devices; continued intense competition across all services among telecommunications companies, cable companies, other communications companies and over-the-top (OTT) services, which, among other things, places pressures on current and future\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n40 /bullet.ss01\n\naverage revenue per subscriber per month (ARPU), cost of acquisition, cost of retention and churn rates for all services, as do market conditions, government actions, customer usage patterns, increased data bucket sizes or flat-rate pricing trends for voice and data, inclusive rate plans for voice and data, and availability of Wi-Fi networks for data; consolidation, mergers and acquisitions of industry competitors; subscriber additions, losses and retention volumes; our ability to obtain and offer content on a timely basis across multiple devices on mobile and TV platforms at a reasonable cost as content costs per unit continue to grow; vertical integration in the broadcasting industry resulting in competitors owning broadcast content services, and timely and effective enforcement of related regulatory safeguards; TI's ability to compete with professional services companies that offer consulting services, information technology companies with digital capabilities, and traditional contact centre and business process outsourcing companies that are expanding their capabilities to offer higher-margin and higher-growth digital services; in our TELUS Health business, our ability to compete with other providers of employee and family assistance programs, benefits administration, electronic medical records and pharmacy management products, claims adjudicators, systems integrators and health service providers, including competitors with a vertically integrated mix of health services delivery, IT solutions and related services, global providers that could achieve expanded Canadian footprints, and providers of virtual healthcare services, preventative health services and personal emergency response services; and in our TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods business, our ability to compete with focused software and IoT competitors.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Technology including: reduced utilization and increased commoditization of traditional fixed voice services (local and long distance) resulting from impacts of OTT applications and mobile substitution; a declining overall market for TV services, resulting in part from content piracy and signal theft, a rise in OTT direct-to-consumer video offerings and virtual multichannel video programming distribution platforms; the increasing number of households with only mobile and/or internet-based telephone services; potential decline in ARPU as a result of, among other factors, substitution by messaging and OTT applications; substitution by increasingly available Wi-Fi services; and disruptive technologies, such as OTT IP services, including software-defined networks in the business market that may displace or cause us to reprice our existing data services, and self-installed technology solutions.\n\nChallenges to our ability to deploy technology including: high subscriber demand for data that challenges wireless networks and spectrum capacity levels and may be accompanied by increases in delivery cost; our reliance on information technology and our ability to continually streamline our legacy systems; the roll-out, anticipated benefits and efficiencies, and ongoing evolution of wireless broadband technologies and systems, including video distribution platforms and telecommunications network technologies, broadband initiatives (such as fibre-to-the-premises (FTTP), wireless small-cell deployment and 5G wireless); availability of resources and our ability to build out adequate broadband capacity; our reliance on wireless network access agreements, which have facilitated our deployment of mobile technologies; our choice of suppliers and those suppliers' ability to maintain and service their product lines, which could affect the success of upgrades to, and evolution of, technology that we offer; supplier limitations and concentration and market power for products such as network equipment, TELUS TV\u00ae and mobile handsets; our expected longterm need to acquire additional spectrum capacity through future spectrum auctions and from third parties to address increasing demand for data, and our ability to utilize spectrum we acquire; deployment and operation of new fixed broadband network technologies at a reasonable cost and the availability and success of new products and services to be rolled out using such network technologies; network reliability and change management; and our deployment of self-learning tools and automation, which may change the way we interact with customers.\n\nCapital expenditure levels and potential outlays for spectrum licences in auctions or purchases from third parties affect and are affected by: our broadband initiatives, including connecting more homes and businesses directly to fibre; our ongoing deployment of newer mobile technologies, including wireless small cells that can improve coverage and capacity; investments in network technology required to comply with laws and regulations relating to the security of cyber systems, including bans on the products and services of certain vendors; investments in network resiliency and reliability, including measures to address changes in usage resulting from restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; the allocation of resources to acquisitions and future spectrum auctions held by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED), including the announcement of a second consultation on the auctioning of the 3800 MHz spectrum, which the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry stated is expected to take place in 2023, and the millimetre wave spectrum auction, which is expected to commence in 2024. Our capital expenditure levels could be impacted if we do not achieve our targeted operational and financial results or if there are changes to our regulatory environment.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Operational performance and business combination risks including: our reliance on legacy systems and our ability to implement and support new products and services and business operations in a timely manner; our ability to manage the requirements of large enterprise deals; our ability to implement effective change management for system replacements and upgrades, process redesigns and business integrations (such as our ability in a timely manner to successfully complete and integrate acquisitions into our operations and culture, complete divestitures or establish partnerships and realize expected strategic benefits, including those following compliance with any regulatory orders); our ability to identify and manage new risks inherent in new service offerings that we may provide, including as a",

Our business plans and growth could be negatively affected if existing financing is not sufficient to cover our funding requirements.\n- /bullet.ss01 Real estate matters including risks associated with our real estate investments, such as financing risks and uncertain future demand, occupancy and rental rates, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLower than planned free cash flow could constrain our ability to invest in operations, reduce leverage or return capital to shareholders, and could affect our ability to sustain our dividend growth program through 2025 and any further dividend growth programs. This program may be affected by factors such as the competitive environment, fluctuations in the Canadian economy or the global economy, our earnings and free cash flow, our levels of capital expenditures and spectrum licence purchases, acquisitions, the management of our capital structure, regulatory decisions and developments, and business continuity events. Quarterly dividend decisions are subject to assessment and determination by our Board of Directors based on our financial position and outlook. Common Shares may be purchased under our normal course issuer bid (NCIB) when and if we consider it opportunistic, based on our financial position and outlook, and the market price of our Common Shares. There can be no assurance that our dividend growth program or our NCIB will be maintained, unchanged and/or completed.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 The economy including: the state of the economy in Canada, which may be influenced by economic and other developments outside of Canada, including potential outcomes of future policies and actions of foreign governments and the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as public and private sector responses to the pandemic; expectations regarding future interest rates; inflation; unemployment levels; effects\n\nof volatility in oil prices; effects of low business spending (such as reducing investments and cost structure); pension investment returns and factors affecting pension benefit obligations, funding and solvency discount rates; fluctuations in exchange rates of the currencies of various countries in which we operate; sovereign credit ratings and effects on the cost of borrowing; the impact of tariffs on trade between Canada and the United States; and global implications of the dynamics of trade relationships among major world economies.\n\nAbility to successfully implement cost reduction initiatives and realize planned savings, net of restructuring and other costs, without losing customer service focus or negatively affecting business operations.

Factors that may affect TI's financial performance are described in TI's public filings available on SEDAR and EDGAR and may include: intense competition from companies offering similar services; attracting and retaining qualified team members to support its operations; TI's ability to grow and maintain profitability if changes in technology or client expectations outpace service offerings and internal tools and processes; TI maintaining its culture as it grows; effects of economic and geopolitical conditions on its clients' businesses and demand for its services; the significant portion of TI's revenue that is dependent on a limited number of large clients; continued consolidation in many of the verticals in which TI offers services resulting in potential client loss; adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on TI's business and financial results; the adverse impact on TI's business if certain independent contractors were classified as employees, and the costs associated with defending, settling or resolving any future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the independent contractor classification; TI's ability to successfully identify, complete, integrate and realize the benefits of acquisitions and manage associated risks; cyberattacks or unauthorized disclosure resulting in access to sensitive or confidential information and data of its clients or their end customers, which could have a negative impact on its reputation and client confidence; TI's business not developing in ways it currently anticipates due to negative public reaction to offshore outsourcing, proposed legislation or otherwise; ability to meet client expectations regarding its content moderation services being adversely impacted due to factors beyond its control and its content moderation team members suffering adverse emotional or cognitive effects in the course of performing their work; and TI's short history operating as a separate, publicly traded company. TELUS International's primary functional and reporting currency is the U.S. dollar and the contribution to our consolidated results of positive results in our digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International (DLCX) segment may be offset by any strengthening of the Canadian dollar (our reporting currency) compared to the U.S. dollar, the European euro, the Philippine peso and the currencies of other countries in which TI operates. The trading price of the subordinate voting shares of TI (TI Subordinate Voting Shares) may be volatile and is likely to fluctuate due to a number of factors beyond its control, including actual or anticipated changes in profitability; general economic, social or political developments; changes in industry conditions; changes in governance regulation; inflation; low trading volume; the general state of the securities markets; and other material events. TI may choose to publicize targets or provide other guidance regarding its business and it may not achieve such targets. Failure to do so could also result in a decline in the trading price of the TI Subordinate Voting Shares. A decline in the trading price of the TI Subordinate Voting Shares due to these or other factors could result in a decrease in the fair value of TI multiple voting shares held by TELUS.\n\nThese risks are described in additional detail in Section 9 General trends, outlook and assumptions, and regulatory developments and proceedings and Section 10 Risks and risk management in this MD&A.

The generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that we use are International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and Canadian GAAP. In this MD&A, the term IFRS refers to these standards. In our discussion, we also use certain non-GAAP and other specified financial measures to evaluate our performance, monitor compliance with debt covenants and manage our capital structure. These measures are defined, qualified and reconciled with their nearest GAAP measures, as required by National Instrument 52-112, Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures Disclosure , in Section 11.1 .

Our information filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States, including Form 40-F, is available on EDGAR (sec.gov). Additional information about our TELUS International (Cda) Inc. (TELUS International or TI) subsidiary, including discussion of its business and results, can be found in its public filings available on SEDAR and EDGAR.\n\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that all relevant information is gathered and reported to senior management on a timely basis, so that appropriate decisions can be made regarding public disclosure. This MD&A and the Consolidated financial statements were reviewed by our Audit Committee and authorized by our Board of Directors (Board) for issuance on February 9, 2023.\n\nIn this MD&A, unless otherwise indicated, results for the year ended December 31, 2022 are compared with results for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n## 1/period.ss012 The env/i.ss01ronment /i.ss01n wh/i.ss01ch we operate\n\nThe success of our business and the challenges we face can best be understood with reference to the environment in which we operate, including broader economic factors that affect our customers and us, and the competitive nature of our business operations.\n\nEst/period.ss01 4%\n\n2022 Canad/i.ss01an te/l.ss08ecom /i.ss01ndustry growth\n\n18/period.ss010 m/i.ss01/l.ss08/l.ss08/i.ss01on\n\nTELUS te/l.ss08ecom subscr/i.ss01ber connect/i.ss01ons\n\n## $18/period.ss014 b/i.ss01/l.ss08/l.ss08/i.ss01on\n\nTELUS 2022 operat/i.ss01ng revenues and other /i.ss01ncome\n\n$1/period.ss019 b/i.ss01/l.ss08/l.ss08/i.ss01on 6/period.ss017 %\n\nTELUS Corporat/i.ss01on Common Share 2022 d/i.ss01v/i.ss01dends dec/l.ss08ared and growth per share\n\n## COVID-19\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, which emerged in the first quarter of 2020, continued to have a global impact throughout 2022. We expect the pandemic to continue to affect our operations for at least the first quarter of 2023 and possibly thereafter. This will depend on both domestic and international factors, such as rates of vaccination and booster doses, as well as the potential proliferation of COVID-19 variants of concern. We are committed to prioritizing the health and safety of team members and customers.\n\nWith respect to TELUS International, we currently expect that a majority of team members will return to traditional work environments in offices and delivery locations over time when it has been deemed safe to do so by local governments and healthcare officials. However, the extent and timing of such return is expected to vary significantly by geography and practices within each office and delivery location.\n\n## Canadian telecommunications industry\n\nAs the pandemic lingered, Canadians continued to adjust to new norms, such as changes in business models and consumer behaviour, while economic growth carried on into 2022. Throughout the year, the connectivity provided by the telecommunications industry was important in maintaining economic and social activity, providing positive outcomes for Canada. We estimate that Canadian telecommunications industry revenues (including TV revenue and excluding equipment and media revenue) grew by approximately 4% in 2022, with industry mobile network revenue growth of approximately 6.8%. Mobile revenues continued to account for the largest portion of telecommunications sector revenues as Canadians consumed more mobile data than ever, enabled by the speed",

We estimate that the Canadian mobile phone industry added approximately 1.7 million net new subscribers in 2022, compared to an estimate of approximately 1.2 million in 2021. With respect to fixed products and services, we estimate the Canadian consumer high-speed internet penetration rate grew by approximately one percentage point to 91% in 2022, and subscriber growth is expected to remain steady. Industry internet revenue growth continued, as many Canadians relied on high-speed internet for work and entertainment at home and increased the speed of their service packages. Conversely, the shift from the traditional television landscape to alternative forms of media also continued. Competitive pressures continued in both the consumer and business markets for fixed products and services, while declines in higher-margin fixed legacy voice and data services were ongoing, mainly attributable to technological substitution. (See Section 9 General trends, outlook and assumptions, and regulatory developments and proceedings , Section 10.4 Competitive environment and Section 10.16 The economy .)\n\n## TELUS technology solutions (TTech)\n\nAcross TTech, we are leveraging our leading technology and compassion to enable remarkable human outcomes. Our long-standing commitment to putting our customers first across the full range of our solutions spanning mobile, data, IP, voice, television, entertainment, video and security, delivered over our award-winning networks, has made us a distinct leader in customer service excellence and loyalty. The accolades we have earned over the years from independent, industry-leading network insight firms highlight the speed, reliability and expansiveness of our leading networks, reinforcing our commitment to provide Canadians with access to superior technology that connects us to the people, resources and information\n\nthat matter most. The healthcare industry continues to move toward digitization of everyday functions within the healthcare ecosystem. We are helping Canadians and others live healthier lives by leveraging technology that enables access to health information and delivers improved health outcomes with solutions such as employer-focused healthcare. We are also developing innovative technology solutions to help feed the world, putting data to work for customers in the agriculture, food and consumer goods sectors. This efficient and effective collaboration helps ensure the quality and safety of food and consumer goods.\n\n## Digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International (DLCX)\n\nTechnology is transforming the way businesses interact with their customers at an accelerating pace and scale and, across industries, customer experience has become a critically important competitive differentiator. DLCX clients and their customers have more information and more choices than ever before, and their expectations surrounding brand experiences and the speed at which companies must process and respond to customer interactions are changing rapidly. The proliferation of mobile devices, social media platforms and other methods of digital interaction has enabled customers to access information 24/7 and engage with companies through multiple digital channels. The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated the use of digital channels as the first, and sometimes only, point of customer interaction. Customers value a consistent and personalized experience across every channel when interacting with the companies that serve them. Businesses face pressure to engage with their customers across digital and human channels, and seek to do so by combining technology with an authentic human experience that demonstrates a genuine commitment to customer satisfaction.\n\n## Economic estimates\n\nOur estimates regarding our economic and operational environment, including economic growth, unemployment and housing starts, serve as important inputs for the assumptions on which our targets are based. The extent of the impact these estimates will have on us, and the timing of that impact, will depend upon the actual outcomes in specific sectors of the Canadian economy.\n\n|         | Economic

The acquisition immediately enabled the opportunity for health services to operate and grow internationally through long-standing corporate relationships globally, with notable areas of focus in employee health and wellness programs, mental and physical health solutions, pensions and benefits management, and retirement solutions.\n\nThis transaction establishes a compelling offering for employers that will allow them to provide the best wellness experience for their employees in order to enhance talent acquisition and retention, while improving business performance.

The US$900 million of senior unsecured 3.40% U.S. Dollar Sustainability-Linked Notes will mature on May 13, 2032. This bond offering supports our commitment to environmental sustainability by linking our cost of financing to the achievement of ambitious environmental, social and governance (ESG) targets.

Our second SLB in Canada, and third globally, solidifies us as one of the largest SLB issuers in Canada, affirming our position as a leader in social capitalism.\n\n## Multi-year dividend growth program\n\nOn May 6, 2022, we announced our intention to target ongoing semiannual dividend increases, with the annual increase in the range of 7 to 10%, from 2023 through to the end of 2025. This announcement further extends our dividend program, which was originally announced in May 2011 and extended for three additional years in each of May 2013, May 2016 and May 2019. Dividend decisions will continue to be subject to our Board's assessment and the determination of our financial situation and outlook on a quarterly basis. There can be no assurance that we will maintain a dividend growth program through 2025.

See Section 11.1 Non-GAAP and other specified financial measures .\n- 2 Capital expenditures include assets purchased, excluding right-of-use lease assets, but not yet paid for, and consequently differ from Cash payments for capital assets, excluding spectrum licences, as reported in the Consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 31 of the Consolidated financial statements for further information.\n- 3 The sum of active mobile phone subscribers, connected device subscribers, internet subscribers, residential voice subscribers, TV subscribers and security subscribers, measured at the end of the respective periods based on information in billing and other source systems. Effective January 1, 2022, on a prospective basis, following an in-depth review of our definition of a subscriber, we adjusted our connected devices subscriber base to remove 34,000 subscribers within a legacy reporting system. During the second quarter of 2022, we adjusted our cumulative security subscriber connections to add approximately 75,000 subscribers as a result of a business acquisition.\n\n## Operating highlights\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Consolidated Operating revenues and other income increased by $1.2 billion in 2022.\n\nService revenues increased by $1.4 billion in 2022. TTech service revenue growth was driven by growth in health services revenues, higher mobile network revenues, an increase in data service revenues and growth in agriculture and consumer goods service revenues. Increased DLCX revenues resulted from growth from both expanded services for existing clients and growth from new clients.\n\nEquipment revenues increased by $33 million in 2022, driven by growth in fixed equipment revenues, partly offset by lower mobile equipment revenues.\n\nOther income decreased by $300 million in 2022, largely reflecting the non-recurrence of the $410 million gain on the disposition of our financial solutions business in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding the effect of this disposition, Other income increased by $110 million in 2022, reflecting the reversal of provisions for contingent consideration related to business acquisitions, decreases in provisions arising from business acquisition-related written put options, a gain on acquisition of control of LifeWorks, and higher gains on investments.\n\nFor additional details on Operating revenues and other income, see Section 5.4 TELUS technology solutions segment and Section 5.5 Digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International segment .",

        "page_content": "- /bullet.ss01 Operating income decreased by $120 million in 2022. (See Section 5.3 Consolidated operations for additional details.)\n\nEBITDA, which includes restructuring and other costs, other equity (income) losses related to real estate joint ventures and the gain on disposition of our financial solutions business, increased by $116 million in 2022.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA, which excludes restructuring and other costs, other equity (income) losses related to real estate joint ventures and the gain on disposition of our financial solutions business, increased by $574 million in 2022. This reflected: (i) higher mobile network revenues; (ii) increased fixed data service revenues; (iii) an increase in our DLCX segment contribution; (iv) higher other income, excluding our prior year gain on the sale of our financial solutions business; and (v) contribution from our acquisition of LifeWorks on September 1, 2022. These factors were partly offset by: (i) higher employee benefits expense; (ii) higher costs related to the scaling of our digital capabilities; (iii) continued declines in fixed legacy voice and data services revenues; (iv) lower TV margins; and (v) bad debt expense returning to pre-pandemic levels, driven by macroeconomic pressures compared to the prior period, which saw historically low bad debt expense. (See Section 5.3 Consolidated operations for additional details.)\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Income before income taxes increased by $44 million in 2022 as a result of lower Financing costs, which more than offset lower Operating income. The decrease in Financing costs largely resulted from the virtual power purchase agreements unrealized change in forward element and capitalized long-term debt interest costs for 3500 MHz spectrum licences. (See Financing costs in Section 5.3 .)\n- /bullet.ss01 Income tax expense increased by $24 million in 2022. The effective income tax rate increased from 25.5% to 26.0% in 2022, largely due to adjustments recognized in the current period for income taxes of prior periods.\n- /bullet.ss01 Net income attributable to Common Shares decreased by $40 million in 2022, reflecting the after-tax impacts of lower Operating income and lower Financing costs.\n- Adjusted Net income excludes the effects of restructuring and other costs, income tax-related adjustments, other equity (income) losses related to real estate joint ventures, virtual power purchase agreements unrealized change in forward element, long-term debt prepayment premium, and the gain on disposition of our financial solutions business. Adjusted Net income increased by $210 million or 14.7% in 2022.\n- /bullet.ss01 Basic EPS decreased by $0.07 or 5.7% in 2022, reflecting the after-tax impacts of lower Operating income and lower Financing costs, as well as the effect of a higher number of Common Shares outstanding.\n\nAdjusted basic EPS excludes the effects of restructuring and other costs, income tax-related adjustments, other equity (income) losses related to real estate joint ventures, virtual power purchase agreements unrealized change in forward element, long-term debt prepayment premium, and the gain on disposition of our financial solutions business. Adjusted basic EPS increased by $0.10 or 9.3% in 2022.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Dividends declared per Common Share were $1.3557 in 2022, an increase of 6.7% from 2021. On February 8, 2023, the Board declared a first quarter dividend of $0.3511 per share on our issued\n\nand outstanding Common Shares, payable on April 3, 2023, to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2023. The first quarter dividend increased by $0.0237 per share or 7.2% from the $0.3274 per share dividend declared one year earlier, consistent with our multi-year dividend growth program described in Section 4.3 Liquidity and capital resources .\n\n- /bullet.ss01 During 2022, our total telecom subscriber connections increased by 1,084,000 or 6.4%. This reflected an increase of 4.3% in mobile phone subscribers, 15.7% in connected device subscribers, 6.3% in internet subscribers, 4.7% in TV subscribers and 21.6% in security subscribers, partly offset by a decline of 2.4% in residential voice subscribers. (See Section 5.4 TELUS technology solutions segment for additional details.)\n\n## Liquidity and capital resource highlights\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Cash provided by operating activities increased by $423 million in 2022, primarily driven by growth in EBITDA, lower income taxes paid and other working capital changes, partly offset by an increase in interest paid. (See Section 7.2 Cash provided by operating activities .)\n- /bullet.ss01 Cash used by investing activities decreased by $58 million in 2022, largely attributable to the effect of the fourth quarter 2021 payments for the 3500 MHz spectrum licences acquired in the 2021 spectrum auction, partly offset by: (i) an increase in cash payments for business acquisitions; (ii) an increase in cash payments for capital assets, excluding spectrum licences; and (iii) the effect of the proceeds on the 2021 disposition of our financial solutions business. Acquisitions increased by $1,079 million in 2022, primarily reflecting the acquisition of LifeWorks. Capital expenditures decreased by $26 million in 2022, primarily due to a planned slowdown of fibre build consistent with our annual build target. (See Section 7.3 Cash used by investing activities .)\n- /bullet.ss01 Cash provided by financing activities decreased by $105 million in 2022, primarily reflecting the effects of the first quarter 2021 equity issuance and the first quarter 2021 proceeds from the TI initial public offering, partly offset by an increase in our issuances of long-term debt, net of redemptions and repayment. (See Section 7.4 Cash provided by financing activities .)\n- /bullet.ss01 Net debt to EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs ratio was 3.63 times at December 31, 2022, up from 3.17 times at December 31, 2021, as the effect of the increase in net debt exceeded the effect of the increase in EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs, notwithstanding the COVID-19 pandemic impacts that have reduced EBITDA. As at December 31, 2022, the acquisition of spectrum licences increased the ratio by approximately 0.47 and business acquisitions over the past 12 months increased the ratio by approximately 0.20, while business dispositions over the same period decreased the ratio by approximately 0.28. (See Section 4.3 Liquidity and capital resources and Section 7.5 Liquidity and capital resource measures .)\n- /bullet.ss01 Free cash flow increased by $497 million in 2022, primarily reflecting higher EBITDA and lower income taxes paid, partly offset by an increase in cash interest paid and the timing related to device subsidy repayments and associated revenue recognition and our TELUS Easy Payment\u00ae device financing program. Our definition of free cash flow, for which there is no industry alignment, is unaffected by accounting changes that do not impact cash, such as IFRS 15 and IFRS 16.",

        "page_content": "## 1/period.ss014 Performance targets (key performance measures)\n\nIn 2022, we achieved all four of our consolidated financial targets. Our original targets were announced on February 10, 2022. On November 4, 2022, we updated our financial targets for the acquisition of LifeWorks, which closed on September 1, 2022, and for lower mobile equipment revenue, as well as to account for TELUS International's updated outlook.\n\nWe met our consolidated operating revenues target. Growth in our mobile phones and connected devices subscriber bases and improved ARPU were contributing factors. We also experienced growth in fixed data service revenues resulting from increased internet and data services, in addition to internet, security and TV subscriber growth, and business acquisitions. DLCX operating revenues increased, due to expanded services for existing clients and growth from new clients. Although mobile equipment revenue decreased, fixed equipment revenue improved, attributable to higher sales volumes. Health services revenues also increased, driven by business acquisitions, including LifeWorks, as well as organic growth.\n\nWe achieved our Adjusted EBITDA target as a result of higher mobile network revenue, reflecting growth in our mobile phones and connected devices subscriber bases and improved ARPU. Higher fixed data\n\nservices revenues also contributed to the achievement of this target, driven by growth in our internet, security and TV subscriber bases and business acquisitions. Additionally, increased DLCX contribution as well as the contribution from our LifeWorks acquisition supported target achievement.\n\nOur free cash flow target was met, attributable to EBITDA growth and strong cash flow management, including our disciplined focus on profitable loading and effective inventory management to drive strong growth in customer net additions.\n\nOur capital expenditures in 2022 met our consolidated target, as we continued our investments in our broadband build to connect more homes and businesses directly to our fibre-optic infrastructure, enabling us to further expand our broadband footprint including in many rural and Indigenous communities. In addition, we accelerated investments in our 5G network build, allowing us to expand coverage to approximately 83% of the Canadian population at December 31, 2022. Other capital investments enabled us to support continuing subscriber growth, deliver on our digitization strategy, diversify our product offerings, and enhance our systems reliability and operational efficiency.\n\nOur capital structure financial policies and report on financing and capital structure management plans are included in Section 4.3 .\n\nThe following scorecard compares TELUS' performance to our consolidated 2022 targets.\n\n| Scorecard                                          | 2022 performance                         | 2022 performance          | 2022 performance   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|\n|                                                    | Consolidated targets/one.numr and growth | Actual results and growth | Result             |\n| Operating revenues                                 | Approximately 8%/one.numr a              | $18.3 billion  8.6%       |                    |\n| Net income/two.numr                                | n/a                                      | $1.7 billion  1.2%        | n/a                |\n| Adjusted EBITDA                                    | Growth of 9 to 10%/one.numr b            | $6.6 billion  9.5%        |                    |\n| Cash provided by operating activities/two.numr     | n/a                                      | $4.8 billion  9.6%        | n/a                |\n| Free cash flow                                     | Approximately $1.3 billion/one.numr c    | $1.3 billion              |                    |\n| Capital expenditures (excluding spectrum licences) | Approximately $3.475 billion/one.numr d  | $3.472 billion            |                    |\n\n- 1 Represents the 2022 revised targets that were announced on November 4, 2022 to reflect the inclusion of our acquisition of LifeWorks, lower mobile equipment revenue and TELUS International's updated outlook.\n- a.

        "page_content": "We made the following key assumptions when we announced the 2022 targets in February 2022.\n\n## Assumptions for 2022 targets and results\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Our economic assumptions are based on a composite of estimates from Canadian banks and other sources. Our original assumptions for 2022 economic growth in Canada, B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec were 4.3%, 4.2%, 4.4%, 4.5% and 3.7%, respectively.\n\nIn our first quarter 2022 MD&A, we revised our 2022 assumptions for economic growth in Canada, B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec to 3.9%, 4.1%, 5.1%, 3.8% and 3.1%, respectively. In our third quarter 2022 MD&A, we further revised our 2022 assumptions for economic growth in Canada, B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec to 3.2%, 2.9%, 4.7%, 3.1% and 3.4%, respectively.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 With respect to annual unemployment rates, our original assumptions for 2022 in Canada, B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec were 6.1%, 5.2%, 7.1%, 6.1% and 5.3%, respectively.\n\nIn our first quarter 2022 MD&A, we revised our 2022 assumptions for the annual unemployment rate in Canada, B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec to 5.4%, 4.8%, 6.4%, 5.8% and 4.4%, respectively. In our third quarter 2022 MD&A, we further revised our 2022 assumptions for the annual unemployment rate in Canada, B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec to 5.4%, 4.9%, 5.8%, 5.7% and 4.5%, respectively.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 With respect to the pace of housing starts, our original assumptions for 2022 on an unadjusted basis in Canada, B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec were 224,000 units, 39,000 units, 30,000 units, 83,000 units and 55,000 units, respectively.\n\nIn our first quarter 2022 MD&A, we revised our 2022 assumptions for the pace of housing starts on an unadjusted basis in Canada, B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec to 240,000 units, 40,000 units, 32,000 units, 87,000 units and 59,000 units, respectively. In our third quarter 2022 MD&A, we further revised our 2022 assumptions for the pace of housing starts on an unadjusted basis in Canada, B.C., Alberta, Ontario and Quebec to 258,000 units, 39,000 units, 37,000 units, 87,000 units and 61,000 units, respectively.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Our original assumption for 2022 restructuring and other costs was approximately $150 million. In our third quarter 2022 MD&A, we revised our 2022 assumption for restructuring and other costs to approximately $200 million to reflect the inclusion of our LifeWorks acquisition and other integration costs associated with business acquisitions.

We are focused on driving innovation and making generational investments to deliver state-of-the-art broadband solutions in an increasingly digital society.\n- /bullet.ss01 Broadband consumer and business networks\n- /bullet.ss01 We launched our 4G LTE network in 2012, and today it covers 99% of Canada's population. This network evolved in 2017 to adopt LTE-A technology, which now covers more than 96% of Canada's population and offers peak theoretical speeds of up to 1.5 Gbps. Our LTE CAT-M1 IoT network covers 96% of Canada's population. See Leveraging TELUS' world-leading technology to drive superior growth across mobile, home and business services in Section 3 Corporate priorities for additional information.\n- /bullet.ss01 We have made significant investments in heterogeneous network (HetNet) technology, one of the key building blocks for 5G. HetNet combines multiple types of cells, such as outdoor macrocells and microcells, as well as indoor pico cells, to enhance coverage and capacity in crowded urban areas and inside buildings. By taking continuous strides to evolve our small-cell technology concurrent with the evolution of network technologies to LTE-A pro (i.e. 4.5G), in 2017, we became the first operator in Canada to introduce licensed assisted access (LAA) small cells for both outdoor and indoor environments, capable of speeds of up to 970 Mbps. In 2019, we continued advancing LAA technology with speeds of up to 1.2 Gbps, and we have deployed more than 400 LAA sites to date.\n- /bullet.ss01 In 2018, we became the first operator globally to introduce LTE FDD massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) 32TRx technology on the 2600 MHz band as part of the LTE-A pro technology evolution, and in 2020, we introduced dual-band massive MIMO technology in the 1900 MHz and AWS bands, also a global first. This technology further enhances the capacity of our wireless infrastructure, enables a stronger customer experience and helps to sustain our long-term wireless leadership.\n- /bullet.ss01 In 2019, we progressed the virtualization of our core network infrastructure with the voice core, providing a stepping stone into 5G service readiness. The network virtualization improves our network scalability, resiliency and cost efficiency.\n- /bullet.ss01 In 2020, we launched our 5G technology capable of speeds of up to 1.7 Gbps.\n- /bullet.ss01 In 2021, we increased the speeds of our 5G network, capable of up to 1.9 Gbps, through the deployment of incremental 5G spectrum.\n- /bullet.ss01 In 2022, our 5G network evolved and is now capable of up to 3 Gbps. Our 5G network covered approximately 83% of Canada's population by December 31, 2022.\n- /bullet.ss01 Our 5G coverage is foundational, as it will enable the advancement of new 5G capabilities such as network slicing, multi-access edge computing (MEC) and low-latency critical communications. A key enhancement to our 5G network in 2021 was the beginning of the deployment of the 3.5 GHz spectrum with MIMO technology. By the end of 2022, our 3.5 GHz footprint reached 40% of the Canadian population.\n- /bullet.ss01 Our investments to deploy our PureFibre technology have brought fibre-optic connectivity further into our infrastructure and directly to homes and businesses. At the end of 2022, approximately 3.0 million homes and businesses in communities across B.C., Alberta and Quebec had access to ultra-fast,\n\nsymmetrical internet speeds of 150 Mbps up to 1 Gbps, and approximately 2.0 million premises in B.C. and Alberta had access to symmetrical internet speeds of up to 2.5 Gbps with TELUS PureFibre. Recognizing the need for highly reliable connectivity with low latency throughput to support emerging services such as virtualized networks and IoT applications, we have also begun rolling out new equipment for enhanced speeds and services.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 We continue to deploy the next evolution of our fixed IP and optical core/edge technology, smart edge architecture. This architecture enables significant automation and per-port cost improvement to support network growth and evolution.\n- /bullet.ss01 We continue to roll out our third-generation national dense wavelength division multiplexing transport backbone (packet transport 3.0) colourless, directionless and contentionless (CDC) network overlay that is connected from B.C. to Quebec and into the U.S. This architecture allows network growth without the need for costly re-generation, enables optimal optical rerouting during a fibre cut and improves network growth costs.\n- /bullet.ss01 In 2022, we continued evolving our PureFibre and HSIA technologies to deliver a superior customer experience, propelling our market leadership in home and business services by launching 2.5 Gbps symmetrical service to major markets in B.C. and Alberta while continuing to bring broadband network speeds to thousands of homes in rural and Indigenous communities in B.C., Alberta and Quebec.\n- /bullet.ss01 In 2022, we continued to bring broadband network speeds to homes in rural and Indigenous communities in B.C., Alberta and Quebec, enabling connectivity to approximately 34,500 premises across 140 communities, including 12 Indigenous lands, and providing 14 kilometres of highway coverage. Cumulative to date, we have enabled 692,000 rural premises with PureFibre across 304 communities, including 144 Indigenous lands.\n- /bullet.ss01 In 2022, we were awarded $257 million in government subsidies that will help bring PureFibre to over 20,000 premises spread across more than 175 rural communities, including over 100 Indigenous lands, between now and 2026. This included a landmark project worth $105 million in funding that we won to support the connection of over 6,000 rural and Indigenous premises in Northwestern Alberta to the PureFibre network by the end of 2026.\n- /bullet.ss01 In 2022, we acquired Fully Managed Inc. to continue building upon our differentiated Business capabilities with cloudbased software and remote network monitoring technology that enables customer assistance without the need for on-site support personnel. This acquisition also included its senior care division, which offers effortless automation for senior care providers looking to modernize critical processes.\n- /bullet.ss01 We continue to evolve our world-class emergency services to harness the power of IP through our implementation of next-generation 9-1-1.\n- /bullet.ss01 We have continued to innovate for our customers through our Optik TV and Pik TV platforms. By investing in the cloudification of video infrastructure and innovative applications, we are continuing to advance our priority of enabling 'anytime, everywhere' access to content and entertainment, thereby continuing to deliver an exceptional customer experience.",

The Common Share dividend payout ratio/one.numr we present in this MD&A is a historical measure utilizing the dividends declared in the most recent four quarters, net of dividend reinvestment plan effects, and free cash flow, and is disclosed for illustrative purposes in evaluating our target guideline. As at December 31, 2022, the ratio was 95%, outside of the objective range, primarily due to: (i) our planned accelerated capital expenditures program to support our broadband capital investments, the build-out of our\n\nTELUS PureFibre infrastructure and the acceleration of our 5G network roll-out; and (ii) the reduction in EBITDA caused by the pandemic. Excluding the effects of our accelerated capital expenditures program of $823 million for the most recent four quarters, as at December 31, 2022, the ratio was 61%.

See Section 11.1 Non-GAAP and other specified financial measures .\n\n## Financing and capital structure management plans for 2023\n\nAt the end of 2022, our senior unsecured debt (excluding unamortized discount) was $21.6 billion. For our long-term debt, the weighted average term to maturity was approximately 12.1 years (excluding commercial paper, TELUS bank credit facilities, the revolving components of the TI credit facility, lease liabilities and other long-term debt). Our weighted average interest rate on long-term debt (excluding commercial paper, TELUS bank credit facilities, the revolving components of the TI credit facility, lease liabilities and other long-term debt) was 4.03% at December 31, 2022, up from 3.72% one year ago. Aside from Short-term borrowings of $100 million, commercial paper of $1.5 billion (US$1.1 billion), the $1.1 billion bank credit facility, of which $1.1 billion was drawn at December 31, 2022 (see Section 7.6 for further details), the utilized revolving component of the TI credit facility (excluding TELUS Corporation) of $179 million (US$132 million) and lease liabilities of $2.3 billion, all of our debt was on a fixed-rate basis.\n\nDuring 2023, we may issue notes to fund spectrum purchases, to accelerate future debt reduction by prepaying certain notes, to refinance maturing debt or to use for general corporate purposes. Anticipated free cash flow and sources of capital are expected to be more than sufficient to meet requirements. For the related risk discussion, see Section 10.14 Financing, debt and dividends .\n\n<!-- image -->",

They have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at a level of reasonable assurance, in ensuring that material information relating to TELUS and its consolidated subsidiaries would be made known to them by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which the MD&A and the Consolidated financial statements were being prepared.\n\n## Internal control over financial reporting\n\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS-IASB and the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission in the United States, as applicable. TELUS' CEO and CFO have assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, in accordance with the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, TELUS' CEO and CFO have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2022, and have certified TELUS' annual filings within our annual report on\n\n## 5 D/i.ss01scuss/i.ss01on of operat/i.ss01ons\n\nThis section contains forward-looking statements, including those with respect to mobile phone average revenue per subscriber per month (ARPU) growth, products and services trends regarding loading and retention spending, equipment margins, subscriber growth and various future trends. There can be no assurance that we have accurately identified these trends based on past results or that these trends will continue, in particular given uncertainty with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic impacts. See Caution regarding forward-looking statements at the beginning of this MD&A.\n\nForm 40-F, as required by the United States' Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 , and TELUS' Annual Information Form, as required by National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers' Annual and Interim Filings .\n\nDeloitte LLP, our auditor, has audited our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.\n\n## Changes in internal control over financial reporting\n\nThere were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting in 2022.\n\n## Limitations on scope of design\n\nIn our assessment of the scope of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have excluded the controls, policies and procedures of LifeWorks, which was acquired on September 1, 2022, the operating results of which are included in the Consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date. The scope limitation is in accordance with National Instrument 52-109 Certification of Disclosure in Issuers' Annual and Interim Filings , which allows an issuer to limit its design of internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures to exclude the controls, policies and procedures of a company acquired not more than 365 days before the end of the financial period to which the certificate relates.\n\nFrom September 1, 2022 (the acquisition date) to December 31, 2022, LifeWorks has contributed revenues of $350 million and generated net loss of $5 million. As at December 31, 2022, LifeWorks' current assets and current liabilities represented approximately 5% and 11% of TELUS' consolidated current assets and current liabilities, respectively, while LifeWorks' non-current assets and non-current liabilities represented approximately 7% and 6% of TELUS' consolidated non-current assets and non-current liabilities, respectively. The amounts recognized for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as at the acquisition date are described in Note 18 of the Consolidated financial statements.\n\n## 5/period.ss011 Genera/l.ss08\n\nOperating segments are components of an entity that engage in business activities from which they earn revenues and incur expenses (including revenues and expenses related to transactions with the other component(s)), the operations of which can be clearly distinguished and for which the operating results, and in particular, Adjusted EBITDA, are regularly reviewed by a chief operating decision-maker to make resource allocation decisions and to assess performance. Effective September 1, 2022, we embarked upon the modification of our internal and external reporting processes, systems and internal controls concurrent with the acquisition and integration of LifeWorks, as referenced in Note 18(b) of the Consolidated financial statements, and correspondingly are assessing our segmented reporting structure. Segmented information in Note 5 of the Consolidated financial statements is regularly reported to our CEO (our chief operating decision-maker).",

The pandemic prevents us, our customers and our suppliers from operating in traditional manners of business in certain areas. While we expect the pandemic to continue to affect our operations and we expect it to continue to do so for at least the first quarter of 2023 and possibly thereafter, we have adapted, and continue to adapt, to future modes of operating.\n\nThe trend of year-over-year increases in consolidated revenue reflects TTech growth, including: (i) mobile network revenue generated from an increase in our subscriber base, including growth of Internet of Things (IoT) connections, supported by the progressive recovery of roaming revenues from COVID-19 impacts; (ii) fixed data services growth across consumer and business lines in internet revenues, TV revenues, home and business security revenues, and other advanced application offerings; (iii) health revenues, including collaborative health records, pharmacy management and virtual pharmacy solutions and our virtual care solutions, as well as employee and family assistance programs\n\nand benefits administration following our acquisition of LifeWorks Inc. (LifeWorks) in the third quarter of 2022; and (iv) agriculture and consumer goods services growth driven by business acquisitions and our digital solutions and data analytics. Increasing consolidated revenue has been partly offset by declining equipment revenue attributed to lower volumes of new contracts from the improving durability of devices, growing adoption of device financing arrangements and suppressed handset contract volumes. Consolidated revenue has also been affected by other pandemic impacts, such as the temporary closure of our TELUS Health Care Centres in 2020, which began operating at reduced volume in 2021 and the early part of 2022, a reduction in health benefits management claims resulting from reduced activity, and business customers faced with reduced and/or closed operations. Consolidated revenue would also be impacted by inflationary pressures and monetary policy. Increased internet and data services and TV service revenues are being generated by subscriber growth and higher internet revenue per customer. There has also been increased customer adoption of our home and business security services and we have been successfully",

For additional information on mobile and fixed revenue and subscriber trends, see Section 5.4 TELUS technology solutions segment . LifeWorks has not had a material impact on trends over the past eight quarters, as it was acquired on September 1, 2022.\n\nYear-over-year increases in consolidated revenue also reflect growth in DLCX revenue from a combination of organic external customer growth and business acquisitions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe trend of year-over-year increases in Goods and services purchased reflects increased expenses to support growth in our DLCX business, our subscriber base and business acquisitions; increased fixed data product costs of sales associated with a growing subscriber base; experienced and anticipated higher operating costs associated with growth related to scaling our health offerings, agriculture and consumer goods services and digital capabilities; and inflationary pressures. TELUS International AI Data Solutions (TIAI) utilizes contracted labour in servicing its customers as compared to solely utilizing employees, and these contracted services have contributed to year-over-year increases in Goods and services purchased.\n\nThe trend of year-over-year increases in net Employee benefits expense reflects increases in the number of employees related to business acquisitions, including those supporting revenue growth in our DLCX segment, health offerings, agriculture and consumer goods offerings and our other complementary businesses. This has been partly offset by moderating salaries expense resulting from reductions in the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) domestic employees, excluding business acquisitions, related in part to absorbed vacancies as we continued to digitize our customer service. We experienced year-over-year increases in net Employee benefits expense in 2022 related to merit-based compensation increases, including an April 2022 compensation program increase.\n\nThe trend of year-over-year increases in Depreciation and amortization reflects increases related to capital assets acquired in business acquisitions; growth in capital assets in support of the expansion of our broadband footprint, including our generational investment to connect homes and businesses to TELUS PureFibre and 5G technology coverage; and growth in internet, TV and security subscriber loading.\n\nThe investments in our fibre-optic technology also support our technology strategy to improve coverage and capacity, including the ongoing buildout of our 5G network.\n\nThe trend of general year-over-year increases in Financing costs reflects greater long-term debt outstanding, mainly associated with our investments in spectrum, fibre and mobile technology, as well as business acquisitions. Financing costs include a long-term debt prepayment premium of $10 million in the third quarter of 2021. Moreover, Financing costs are net of capitalized interest related to spectrum licences acquired during the 600 MHz spectrum auction, which we commenced deploying into our existing network in 2021, and during the 3500 MHz spectrum auction. Financing costs also include Interest accretion on provisions (asset retirement obligations and written put options) and Employee defined benefit plans net interest. Additionally, for the eight periods shown, Financing costs include varying amounts of foreign exchange gains or losses, varying amounts of interest income and, effective for the second quarter of 2022, virtual power purchase agreements unrealized change in forward element.\n\nThe trend in Net income reflects the items noted above, as well as adjustments recognized in the current periods for income taxes of prior periods. Historically, the trend in basic EPS has reflected trends in Net income.

        "page_content": "## Fourth quarter recap\n\nResults for the fourth quarter of 2022 (three-month period ended December 31, 2022) are discussed in our February 9, 2023 news release and are compared with results from the fourth quarter of 2021 (threemonth period ended December 31, 2021).\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Consolidated Operating revenues and other income were $5,058 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $186 million.\n- /bullet.ss01 Service revenues were $4,286 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of $481 million. TTech service revenue growth was driven by: (i) growth in health services revenues driven by business acquisitions, including our acquisition of LifeWorks on September 1, 2022, as well as organic growth; (ii) higher mobile network revenues, including growth in our mobile phone and connected devices subscriber bases, in addition to increased mobile phone ARPU; (iii) an increase in data service revenues, driven by business acquisitions, internet and security subscriber growth, higher revenue per internet customer and TV subscriber growth; and (iv) growth in agriculture and consumer goods services revenues. These factors were partly offset by: (i) continued declines in fixed legacy voice and data services revenues; and (ii) lower TV revenues due to an increased mix of customers selecting smaller TV combination packages and technological substitution. Growth in DLCX operating revenues resulted from expanded services for existing clients and growth from new clients. In DLCX, on a year-over-year basis, the favourable currency impact from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar more than offset the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the European euro, which had an unfavourable foreign currency impact on European euro-denominated operating results.\n- /bullet.ss01 Equipment revenues were $737 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of $81 million, driven by higher mobile equipment revenues that reflected higher contract volumes attributable to successful efforts during the seasonal promotional periods and the impact of higher-value smartphones in the sales mix, as well as higher fixed equipment revenues from increased sales volumes and lower discounts on business and consumer premises equipment.\n- /bullet.ss01 Other income was $35 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, a decrease of $376 million, largely reflecting the non-recurrence of the $410 million gain on the disposition of our financial solutions business in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding the effect of this disposition, Other income increased by $34 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting a decrease in provisions arising from business acquisition-related written put options and higher gains on investments.\n- /bullet.ss01 Consolidated operating expenses were $4,389 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of $569 million.\n- /bullet.ss01 Goods and services purchased were $2,082 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of $200 million, driven by: (i) higher costs associated with business acquisitions, as well as costs associated with scaling our health and agriculture and consumer goods businesses; (ii) higher mobile equipment sales expense resulting from higher mobile handset contract volumes, in addition to higher-value smartphones in the sales mix; (iii) DLCX business growth, which included higher contractor costs from expansion in TIAI and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian\n\ndollar on a year-over-year basis; (iv) higher non-labour-related restructuring costs; (v) higher product and service costs supporting growth across our subscriber connections, including TV subscribers; (vi) higher costs related to the scaling of our digital capabilities, inclusive of increased subscription-based licences; and (vii) bad debt expense returning to pre-pandemic levels, driven by macroeconomic pressures compared to the prior period, which saw historically low bad debt expense. These increases were partly offset by lower advertising and promotional costs.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Employee benefits expense was $1,378 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of $270 million, largely due to: (i) higher compensation and benefit costs resulting from an increase in the number of employees related to business acquisitions; (ii) merit-based compensation increases; and (iii) increased employee benefits expense in our DLCX segment, driven by business growth, and foreign exchange impacts caused by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar more than offsetting other foreign currencies weakening against the U.S. dollar, partly mitigated by lower share-based compensation due to a decrease in the TI share price. These factors were partly offset by higher capitalized labour costs.\n- /bullet.ss01 Depreciation was $589 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of $44 million, primarily due to growth in capital assets over the past 12 months, including our expanded broadband footprint and business acquisitions, as well as asset retirement activity, which generated accelerated depreciation on those assets.\n- /bullet.ss01 Amortization of intangible assets was $340 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of $55 million, arising from business acquisitions and higher expenditures associated with the intangible asset base over the past 12 months.\n- /bullet.ss01 Financing costs were $322 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of $130 million, mainly due to the following factors:\n- /bullet.ss01 Interest expense was $265 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of $75 million, largely resulting from the change in gross interest expense on long-term debt, excluding lease liabilities. Gross interest expense on long-term debt, excluding lease liabilities, was $234 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of $66 million, primarily driven by an increase in average long-term debt balances out standing, attributable in part to business acquisitions.\n- /bullet.ss01 Virtual power purchase agreements unrealized change in forward element was an expense of $38 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, and represents the estimated unrealized amount recorded from our virtual power purchase agreements (VPPAs) with renewable energy projects as of December 31, 2022.\n- /bullet.ss01 Foreign exchange losses were $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, a change of $26 million, primarily reflecting changes in the value of the European euro relative to the Canadian dollar, as well as the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar.\n- /bullet.ss01 Income tax expense was $82 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, a decrease of $115 million. The effective tax rate increased from 22.9 to 23.5% in the fourth quarter of 2022, primarily due to the non-taxable portion of the gain on the disposition of our financial solutions business, which was partially offset by lower adjustments to prior period income taxes.",

This reflects: (i) higher mobile network revenues, including growth in our mobile phone and connected devices subscriber bases, in addition to ARPU growth; (ii) increased fixed data services revenues driven by business acquisitions, internet and security subscriber growth, higher revenue per internet customer and TV subscriber growth; (iii) contribution from our acquisition of LifeWorks on September 1, 2022; (iv) an increase in our DLCX segment contribution; and (v) higher other income, excluding our prior year gain on sale of our financial solutions business. These factors were partly offset by: (i) higher employee benefits expense; (ii) higher costs related to the scaling of our digital capabilities, inclusive of increased subscription-based licences; (iii) continued declines in fixed legacy voice and data services revenues; (iv) lower TV margins due to rising content costs, an increased mix of customers selecting smaller TV combination packages and technological substitution; and (v) bad debt expense returning to pre-pandemic levels.\n- /bullet.ss01 Net income attributable to Common Shares was $248 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, a decrease of $396 million, reflecting the after-tax impacts of lower Operating income and higher Financing costs. Adjusted Net income excludes the effects of restructuring and other costs, income tax-related adjustments, other equity (income) losses related to real estate joint ventures, virtual power purchase agreements unrealized change in forward element, and the gain on disposition of our financial solutions business. Adjusted Net income in the fourth quarter of 2022 was $333 million, an increase of $2 million or 0.6%.\n- /bullet.ss01 Basic EPS was $0.17 in the fourth quarter of 2022, a decrease of $0.30, reflecting the after-tax impacts of lower Operating income and higher Financing costs, as well as the effect of a higher number of Common Shares outstanding. Adjusted basic EPS excludes the effects of restructuring and other costs, income tax-related adjustments, other equity (income) losses related to real estate joint ventures, virtual power purchase agreements unrealized change in forward element, and the gain on disposition of our financial solutions business. Adjusted basic EPS was $0.23 in the fourth quarter of 2022, unchanged compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.\n- /bullet.ss01 Cash provided by operating activities was $1,126 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of $230 million, largely driven by growth in Adjusted EBITDA and lower restructuring and other costs disbursements net of expense, related to improving our overall cost structure and operational efficiency.\n- /bullet.ss01 Cash used by investing activities was $854 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, a decrease of $1,135 million, largely attributable to the effect of the fourth quarter 2021 payments for the 3500 MHz spectrum licences acquired in the 2021 spectrum auction, partly offset by the effect of the proceeds on the 2021 disposition of our financial solutions business. Capital expenditures were $660 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, a decrease of $249 million. This decrease was driven by TTech, which experienced $239 million of the decrease, mainly due\n- to a planned slowdown of fibre build consistent with our annual build target, compared to the acceleration of investments in 2021, as well as a reduction in the purchase of proprietary software licenses.\n- /bullet.ss01 Cash used by financing activities was $738 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of $690 million, primarily reflecting greater redemptions and repayment of long-term debt, net of issuances.\n- /bullet.ss01 Free cash flow was $323 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, an increase of $280 million, primarily reflecting the reduction in capital expenditures.\n\n## 5/period.ss013 Conso/l.ss08/i.ss01dated operat/i.ss01ons\n\nThe following is a discussion of our consolidated financial performance.

(See Long-term debt issued and Redemptions and repayments of long-term debt in Section 7.4 .)\n- /bullet.ss01 Capitalized long-term debt interest, excluding lease liabilities, is in respect of debt incurred for the purchase of spectrum licences during the 3500 MHz spectrum auction held in June to July 2021 by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED).\n- /bullet.ss01 In the third quarter of 2021, we recorded a long-term debt prepayment premium of $10 million before income taxes related to the early redemption of all of our $1 billion Notes, Series CT.\n- /bullet.ss01 Employee defined benefit plans net interest decreased by $18 million in 2022, primarily due to the decrease in the defined benefit plan deficit as at December 31, 2021 to $190 million (net of the plan asset ceiling limit of $179 million), compared to the defined benefit plan deficit of $913 million (net of the plan asset ceiling limit of $123 million) one year earlier, partly offset by an increase in the discount rate.\n- /bullet.ss01 Foreign exchange gains changed by $22 million in 2022, primarily reflecting changes in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, as well as the European euro relative to the Canadian dollar.\n- /bullet.ss01 Virtual power purchase agreements unrealized change in forward element represents the estimated unrealized amount recorded from our VPPAs with renewable energy projects as of December 31, 2022.

The pandemic prevents us, our customers and our suppliers from operating in the normal course of business in certain areas, and we expect it to continue to affect our operations and we expect it to continue to do so for at least the first quarter of 2023 and possibly thereafter. For example, with the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 variants, seasonal fluctuations in the spread of COVID-19, global population vaccine uptake, and government and land border restrictions, consumer and business travel volumes are uncertain, which impacts roaming revenues. As well, some of our business customers have been experiencing, and in some instances continue to experience, reduced and/or closed operations. Additionally, our health and wellness offerings have been impacted, as TELUS Health Care Centres operated at reduced volumes throughout 2021 and the early part of 2022. Impacts directly associated with the pandemic, such as the reduction of roaming revenues and health services (including TELUS Health Care Centres and health benefits management offerings) may be temporary in nature, and these services and related revenues may return to pre-pandemic levels. TTech revenue would also be impacted by inflationary pressures and monetary policy.",

        "page_content": "The historical trend over the past eight quarters in mobile network revenue primarily reflects growth in our mobile phone subscriber base, as well as an increase in IoT connections. Supplementing this, the trend of mobile phone ARPU growth is buttressed by the progressive recovery of international roaming revenues from pandemic impacts, which is also ameliorating domestic ARPU declines. Furthermore, overall domestic ARPU declines are largely attributable to changing industry dynamics, as customers have been able to gain access to higher network speeds and larger allotments of data for a given price point.\n\nMobile equipment revenue has been declining as a result of lower volumes of new contracts due to: (i) the improving durability and increasing cost of popular devices that result in customers deferring upgrades; (ii) growing adoption of device financing arrangements, which provide transparency of full device cost details and result in customers deferring device upgrades; and (iii) the effects of the pandemic on customers, the industry and the Canadian economy. These factors are offset by an increase of higher-value smartphones in the sales mix.\n\nThe general trend of year-over-year increases in mobile phone subscriber net additions is attributable to: (i) our low churn rate, which reflects our customers first efforts, upgrade volume programs and our focus on building, maintaining and enhancing our reliable, high-quality network; (ii) the success of our promotions, including the bundling of our mobility and home services; (iii) the effects of market growth arising from a growing population, changing population demographics and an increasing number of customers with multiple devices; and (iv) continuous improvements in the speed, performance and reliability of our network, as well as our enhanced digital capabilities. Additionally, the pandemic has caused customers to change their behaviour, for instance by reducing travel and making fewer visits to retail outlets, thereby reducing churn.\n\nOur connected device subscriber base has been growing, primarily in response to our expanded IoT offerings. Our spectrum investments and capital expenditures on network improvements increase capacity, reliability and coverage, allowing us to grow revenue through net additions of new mobile phone and connected devices subscribers.\n\nGrowth in our internet subscriber base has been supported by our continued investments in building out our fibre-optic infrastructure, supplemented by our low customer churn rate. The total number of TV subscribers has increased (in contrast to market-reported declines in traditional television viewing habits), reflecting net subscriber additions in response to our diverse and flexible product offerings, combined with our low customer churn rate. Our security subscriber base growth is increasing as a result of organic growth and business acquisitions, including our acquisition of Vivint Smart Home, Inc. (Vivint) in the second quarter of 2022. Our home services growth is also attributable to the adoption of our bundling of home services, as well as the bundling of mobility and home services to meet the demand for multiple services per home. Adoption increases our services per home and positively impacts churn for most services, in addition to the effectiveness of our self-install and virtual install models. Residential voice subscriber losses have decelerated as a result of the success of our bundled services and lower-priced offerings, as well as strong retention efforts to mitigate the ongoing substitution to mobile and internet-based services.\n\nThe trend of growing fixed data services revenues is attributable to the sustained demand for faster internet speeds and larger bandwidth, as well as our diverse suite of TV, home and business security offerings and other advanced applications, which are enabled by investments in our fibre-optic footprint. The trend of declining legacy fixed voice revenues is due to technological substitution and intensification of competition in the small and medium-sized business market; however, we are mitigating this trend with our bundled product offerings, lower-priced offerings and successful retention efforts. The migration of business product and service offerings to IP services and the entry of new competitors have yielded inherently lower margins compared to some legacy business product and service offerings; however, we are continually refining and diversifying our portfolio of innovative business offerings.\n\nThe trend of growth in health services revenues has been propelled by the acquisition of LifeWorks in the third quarter of 2022, as well as our organic health offerings, which include: virtual care and virtual pharmacy solutions, collaborative health records, health benefits management, personal health monitoring solutions, and employee and family assistance programs and benefits administration. The LifeWorks acquisition immediately enabled the opportunity for health services to operate and grow internationally through long-standing corporate relationships globally, with notable areas of focus in employee health and wellness programs, mental and physical health solutions, pensions and benefits management, and retirement solutions. Inclusive of LifeWorks, we are well-positioned to continue improving health and wellness outcomes for people around the world. Our competencies and assets in health, combined with the trend in digitization and automation, position us well to bolster the global healthcare system in a complementary fashion. With our technology heritage, we see the trend moving the healthcare system to improved efficiency and outcomes through better insights. We also believe Canadians will have greater control of their healthcare outcomes through the integration of disparate data (better flow of information across the system) and consent-based management. While the pandemic disrupted the operations of our TELUS Health Care Centres throughout 2021 and the early part of 2022, our diversified virtual care offerings continued to grow to meet the healthcare needs of Canadians and drive better health outcomes, including the accelerated adoption of virtual consultations, as reflected in the growing number of virtual care members. Our health benefits management solution is affected by the number of lives covered and the number of benefit claims, which were disrupted by the pandemic.\n\nThe trend of growth in agriculture and consumer goods services is attributable to business acquisitions, as well as an expansion of our solutions and organic growth in an effort to meet the growing demand for digital solutions in the agriculture industry. Through our global team and cloud-based solutions, we are able to service our diverse client base, including growers, producers, agronomists, advisors, processors and retailers, by helping to drive more effective and agile decision-making that will address changing consumer demands, improve profitability and generate a better flow of information across the value chain. This improves the safety and sustainability of our food system, as well as the way other goods are produced, distributed and consumed.",

We continue to focus on profitable growth and away from lower economic loading in the mobile phone market, while continuing to focus on executing customers first initiatives and retention programs, and our leading network quality.\n- /bullet.ss01 Mobile phone ARPU was $58.10 in 2022, an increase of $1.03 or 1.8%, largely due to roaming improvements as a result of increased international travel volumes. Roaming improvements were partially offset by: (i) lower overage revenues as customers continue to adopt larger or unlimited data and voice allotments in their rate plans; (ii) the impact of the competitive environment putting pressure on base rate plan prices in the current and prior periods; and (iii) a greater uptake of family discounts and bundling credits we offer to our customers, which helps us drive lower churn and greater lifetime value across our mobile and fixed products and services.\n- /bullet.ss01 Connected device net additions were 368,000 in 2022, an increase of 30,000, attributable to successful promotions of consumer and non-IoT connected devices during the seasonal promotional periods. Overall, connected devices net additions are driven by our IoT connections.\n- /bullet.ss01 Internet net additions were 142,000 in 2022, a decrease of 7,000, reflecting a modestly higher churn rate compared to relatively low churn rates during heightened pandemic restrictions in the prior year, in addition to the impact of macroeconomic pressures on consumer purchasing decisions. These factors were partly offset by our success in driving strong gross additions through bundled product offerings.\n- /bullet.ss01 TV net additions were 60,000 in 2022, an increase of 10,000, mainly attributable to our diverse offerings and strong loading in the business market, partly offset by a modestly higher churn rate due to the factors discussed above for internet.\n- /bullet.ss01 Residential voice net losses were 27,000 in 2022, compared to net losses of 41,000 in 2021. The residential voice subscriber losses continue to reflect the trend of substitution to mobile and internetbased services, largely mitigated by our expanding fibre footprint and bundled product offerings, as well as our strong retention efforts, including lower-priced offerings.",

Our continued focus on connecting more homes and businesses directly to fibre, expanding and enhancing our addressable high-speed internet and Optik TV footprint, and bundling these services together, contributed to combined internet, TV and security subscriber growth of 376,000 over the past 12 months, including the addition of 75,000 customers from our second quarter 2022 acquisition of Vivint.\n- /bullet.ss01 Healthcare lives covered were 67.7 million as of the end of 2022, an increase of 47.1 million over the past 12 months, mainly due to the addition of 36.9 million lives covered from our third quarter acquisition of LifeWorks, as well as healthy post-acquisition growth from population increases across all of our regions. Organically, lives covered also increased due to continued demand for virtual solutions, an increase in coverage related to elective health services, and an increase in value-added services, including vaccination solutions.\n- /bullet.ss01 Virtual care members were 4.5 million as of the end of 2022, an increase of 1.7 million over the past 12 months, attributable to the continued adoption of virtual solutions that keep Canadians and others safely connected to health and wellness care.\n- /bullet.ss01 Digital health transactions were 580.5 million in 2022, an increase of 29.4 million, largely driven by higher adjudication transactions, as plan members continue to increase their use of elective health services with pandemic restrictions easing, as well as an increase in healthcare lives covered.\n\n## Operating revenues and other income - TTech segment\n\n| Years ended December 31   ($ in millions)                      | 2022   | 2021   | Change   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Mobile network revenue                                         | 6,591  | 6,208  | 6.2 %    |\n| Mobile equipment and   other service revenues                  | 2,132  | 2,124  | 0.4 %    |\n| Fixed data services/one.numr                                   | 4,351  | 4,135  | 5.2 %    |\n| Fixed voice services                                           | 793    | 843    | (5.9) %  |\n| Fixed equipment and   other service revenues                   | 481    | 41 1   | 17.0 %   |\n| Health services                                                | 913    | 521    | 75.2 %   |\n| Agriculture and consumer  goods services                       | 354    | 286    | 23.8 %   |\n| Operating revenues   (arising from contracts   with customers) | 15,615 | 14,528 | 7.5 %    |\n| Other income/two.numr                                          | 120    | 420    | (71.4) % |\n| External Operating revenues  and other income/two.numr         | 15,735 | 14,948 | 5.3 %    |\n| Intersegment revenues                                          | 17     | 18     | (5.6) %  |\n| TTech Operating revenues   and other income/two.numr           | 15,752 | 14,966 | 5.3 %    |\n\nTTech Operating revenues and other income increased by $786 million in 2022.

This was partly offset by lower mobile handset contract volumes as a result of changes in customer preferences to hold onto devices for longer periods of time, and a greater mix of bring-yourown-device customer additions. Overall, throughout most of the year, switching activity was largely muted industry-wide, with the exception of the fourth quarter of 2022.",

        "page_content": "Fixed data services revenues increased by $216 million in 2022. The increase was driven by: (i) increased internet and data service revenues, reflecting a 6.3% increase in our internet subscribers over the past 12 months, in addition to higher revenue per customer as a result of internet speed upgrades, internet rate plans with larger allotted data amounts, and rate changes; (ii) business acquisitions; and (iii) increased revenues from home security driven by expanded services and customer growth of 21.6% over the past 12 months. This growth was partially offset by: (i) the impact of the fourth quarter 2021 disposition of our financial solutions business; (ii) lower TV revenues, reflecting an increased mix of customers selecting smaller TV combination packages and technological substitution, largely moderated by subscriber growth of 4.7% over the past 12 months; and (iii) the ongoing decline in legacy data service revenues.\n\nFixed voice services revenues decreased by $50 million in 2022, reflecting the ongoing decline in legacy voice revenues as a result of technological substitution and price plan changes. Declines were partly mitigated by the success of our bundled product offerings, retention efforts and the migration from legacy to IP services offerings.\n\nFixed equipment and other service revenues increased by $70 million in 2022, reflecting higher sales volumes and lower discounts on business and consumer premises equipment, along with higher other services revenue.\n\nHealth services revenues increased by $392 million in 2022, driven by: (i) our acquisition of LifeWorks on September 1, 2022; (ii) higher revenues\n\nas a result of the continued adoption of our virtual solutions, inclusive of organic growth and business acquisitions; and (iii) growth in health benefits management services, with plan members continuing to increase their use of elective health services, as well as an increase in the number of lives covered, partly offset by rate changes associated with a contract renewal.\n\nAgriculture and consumer goods services revenues increased by $68 million in 2022, largely reflecting the impacts of business acquisitions, particularly with increased revenues from Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)-based revenue management software for consumer goods manufacturers, in addition to organic contributions from increased animal health pharmacy and research revenues. Our agriculture and consumer goods revenues are largely earned in U.S. dollars, and in 2022 compared to 2021, the Canadian dollar weakened against the U.S. dollar, resulting in higher reported revenues in the year.\n\nOther income decreased by $300 million in 2022, largely reflecting the non-recurrence of the $410 million gain on disposition of our financial solutions business in the fourth quarter of 2021. Excluding the effect of this disposition, Other income increased by $110 million in 2022, reflecting the reversal of provisions for contingent consideration related to business acquisitions, decreases in provisions arising from business acquisition-related written put options, a gain on acquisition of control of LifeWorks, and higher gains on investments.\n\nIntersegment revenues represent services provided to the DLCX segment that are eliminated upon consolidation, together with the associated DLCX expenses.\n\n## Direct contribution - TTech segment\n\n|                                                             | Mobile products and services   | Mobile products and services   | Mobile products and services   | Fixed products and services/one.numr   | Fixed products and services/one.numr   | Fixed products and services/one.numr   | Total TTech   | Total TTech   | Total TTech   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Years ended December 31 ($ in millions)                     | 2022                           | 2021                           | Change                         | 2022                                   | 2021                                   | Change                                 | 2022          | 2021          | Change        |\n| Revenues                                                    |                                |                                |                                |                                        |                                        |                                        |               |               |               |\n| Service                                                     | 6,697                          | 6,297                          | 6.4 %                          | 6,582                                  | 5,928                                  | 11.0 %                                 | 13,279        | 12,225        | 8.6 %         |\n| Equipment                                                   | 2,026                          | 2,042                          | (0.8) %                        | 310                                    | 261                                    | 18.8 %                                 | 2,336         | 2,303         | 1.4 %         |\n| Operating revenues (arising from  contracts with customers) | 8,723                          | 8,339                          | 4.6 %                          | 6,892                                  | 6,189                                  | 11.4 %                                 | 15,615        | 14,528        | 7.5 %         |\n| Expenses                                                    |                                |                                |                                |                                        |                                        |                                        |               |               |               |\n| Direct expenses                                             | 2,792                          | 2,802                          | (0.3) %                        | 2,101                                  | 1,771                                  | 18.7 %                                 | 4,893         | 4,572         | 7.0 %         |\n| Direct contribution                                         | 5,931                          | 5,537                          | 7.1 %                          | 4,791                                  | 4,418                                  | 8.4 %                                  | 10,722        | 9,956         | 7.7 %         |\n\n- 1 Includes health services and agriculture and consumer goods services.\n\nThe direct expenses included in the direct contribution calculations in the preceding table represent a component of the Goods and services purchased and Employee benefits expense totals included in the table below and have been calculated in accordance with the accounting policies used to prepare the totals presented in the financial statements.

As our service delivery centres are located in multiple geographic regions, the varying degrees of severity and recovery efforts from the pandemic in the countries where we operate has required us to evolve and adapt our business operations. As of the date of this report, many of our team members continue to work remotely, as they have since the onset of the pandemic, and in some cases we have thoughtfully and strategically returned team members to delivery locations. Over the past few quarters, we were able to largely mitigate the negative impact on our financial condition, financial performance and operating cash flows by taking steps to strategically grow our client base and contain costs. While we expect the pandemic to continue to affect our operations and our clients into 2023 and possibly thereafter, these impacts reflect our new operating environment.\n\nThe trend over the past eight quarters of increases in DLCX revenue reflects both the growth in our organic customer base and the scale-up of new service programs provided to existing external customers. The higher revenue also includes revenue from internal services provided to the TTech segment.\n\nGoods and services purchased and Employee benefits expense have increased in correspondence with increases in our team member base as a result of growing service volumes from both our existing and new customers (including the expansion of our service offerings), increases in external labour to support the growth in our digital business, increases in our software licensing costs associated with our growing team member base, and increases in administrative expenses to support growth in the overall business and business acquisitions.\n\nDepreciation and amortization have increased, reflecting growth in our capital assets, which is supporting the expansion of our sites required to service the increased customer demand.\n\n## DLCX operating indicators\n\n| Years ended December 31 ($ in millions)     | 2022   | 2021   | Change   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Operating revenues   by industry vertical   |        |        |          |\n| Tech and games                              | 1,495  | 1,256  | 19.0 %   |\n| Communications and media                    | 757    | 674    | 12.3 %   |\n| eCommerce and fintech                       | 370    | 324    | 14.2 %   |\n| Banking, financial services   and insurance | 216    | 121    | 78.5 %   |\n| Travel and hospitality                      | 98     | 78     | 25.6 %   |\n| All others                                  | 278    | 301    | (7.6) %  |\n|                                             | 3,214  | 2,754  | 16.7 %   |\n| Operating revenues   by geographic region   |        |        |          |\n| Europe                                      | 1,146  | 1,153  | (0.6) %  |\n| North America                               | 808    | 629    | 28.5 %   |\n| Asia-Pacific                                | 770    | 575    | 33.9 %   |\n| Central America                             | 490    | 397    | 23.4 %   |\n|                                             | 3,214  | 2,754  | 16.7 %   |\n\nRevenue from our tech and games industry vertical increased by $239 million to $1,495 million in 2022, reflecting continued growth within our existing clients and the addition of new clients. Revenue from our communications and media industry vertical increased by $83 million to $757 million, driven primarily by more services provided to the TTech segment. Revenue from the eCommerce and fintech industry vertical increased by $46 million to $370 million in 2022, which was primarily attributable to new clients and growth within our existing client base. Revenue from the banking, financial services and insurance vertical increased by $95 million to $216 million in 2022, driven by the addition of a leading global financial institution. Revenue from the travel and hospitality industry vertical increased by $20 million to $98 million in 2022, which was primarily attributable to new clients and growth within our existing client base. Across all of our verticals, the reported revenue growth rates were positively impacted by the strengthening U.S. dollar to Canadian dollar movements compared to the same period in the prior year, which was partially offset by the unfavourable European euro to U.S. dollar currency movements.\n\nWe serve our clients, who are primarily domiciled in North America, from multiple delivery locations across four geographic regions. In addition, our TIAI clients are largely supported by crowdsourced contractors that are globally dispersed and not limited to the physical locations of our delivery centres.

The increase was offset, in part, by the lower average exchange rates across a variety of currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, and by lower share-based compensation expense associated with the lower average share price of TELUS International during 2022, resulting in a lower expense on liability-accounted awards.\n\n## EBITDA - DLCX segment\n\n| Years ended December 31   ($ in millions, except margins)   |   2022 |   2021 | Change   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| EBITDA                                                      |  709   |  555   | 27.7 %   |\n| Add restructuring and other   costs included in EBITDA      |   60   |   38   | n/m      |\n| Adjusted EBITDA/one.numr                                    |  769   |  593   | 29.5 %   |\n| EBITDA margin/two.numr (%)                                  |   22.1 |   20.2 | 1.9 pts. |\n| Adjusted EBITDA margin/two.numr (%)                         |   23.9 |   21.6 | 2.3 pts. |\n\n- 1 For certain metrics, there are definitional differences between TELUS and TELUS International reporting. These differences largely arise from TELUS International adopting definitions consistent with practice in its industry.\n- 2 These are non-GAAP and other specified financial measures. See Section 11.1 Non-GAAP and other specified financial measures .\n\nDLCX EBITDA increased by $154 million or 27.7% in 2022. DLCX Adjusted EBITDA increased by $176 million or 29.5% in 2022. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 2.3 percentage points in 2022. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA margin in 2022 was due primarily to the lower share-based compensation expense resulting from the lower average share price of TELUS International.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures - DLCX segment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Years ended December 31 ($ in millions)              | 2022    | 2021    | Change   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|----------|\n| Adjusted EBITDA                                      | 769     | 593     | 29.5 %   |\n| Capital expenditures                                 | ( 1 35) | ( 1 26) | 7.1 %    |\n| Adjusted EBITDA less   capital expenditures/one.numr | 634     | 467     | 35.8 %   |\n\n- 1 See Section 11.1 Non-GAAP and other specified financial measures .\n\nDLCX Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures increased by $167 million in 2022.

This is compared to business acquisition activity in 2021 that included the acquisition of Blacksmith Applications Holdings Inc. and other individually immaterial business acquisitions complementary to our existing lines of business.\n- /bullet.ss01 Advances to, and investment in, real estate joint ventures and associates represented a net change of $25 million, predominantly related to 2021 investments in associates that did not recur in 2022.\n- /bullet.ss01 Proceeds on disposition decreased by $492 million in 2022, primarily due to the 2021 disposition of our financial solutions business.\n- /bullet.ss01 Investment in portfolio investments and other increased by $66 million, primarily from investments in a greater number of portfolio investments in 2022 and an increase of capital inventory.\n\n## Capital expenditure measures\n\n| Years ended December 31   ($ millions, except capital intensity)          | 2022   | 2021   | Change   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Capital expenditures/one.numr                                             |        |        |          |\n| TELUS technology solutions   (TTech) segment                              | 3,337  | 3,372  | (1.0) %  |\n| Digitally-led customer experiences -  TELUS International (DLCX)  segment | 135    | 126    | 7.1 %    |\n| Consolidated                                                              | 3,472  | 3,498  | (0.7) %  |\n| TTech segment capital   expenditure intensity/two.numr (%)                | 21     | 23     | (2) pts. |\n| DLCX segment capital   expenditure intensity/two.numr (%)                 | 4      | 5      | (1) pt.  |\n| Consolidated capital   expenditure intensity/two.numr (%)                 | 19     | 20     | (1) pt.  |\n\nConsolidated capital expenditures decreased by $26 million in 2022. TTech drove $35 million of this decrease in 2022, primarily due to a planned slowdown of fibre build consistent with our annual build target, compared to the acceleration of investments in 2021. Meanwhile, we reprioritized our capital spend to: (i) support accelerated investments in our 5G network; (ii) scale our health product offerings and capabilities, including our recent acquisition of LifeWorks on September 1, 2022, as well as to support business integration; and (iii) enhance our product and digital development to finalize our multi-year increase in system capacity and reliability as announced on March 25, 2021. By December 31, 2022, our 5G network covered over 30.8 million Canadians, representing approximately 83% of the population.\n\nOn March 25, 2021, we announced that we intended to accelerate\n\n$1.5 billion of capital spending in 2021 and 2022, with up to $750 million of accelerated capital in 2021 and the remainder brought forward into 2022. Accelerated capital invested during 2022 was $823 million. This spend has enabled: (i) the acceleration of premises to be connected to our fibre network; (ii) the acceleration of our copper-to-fibre migration program; (iii) the expansion of our fibre build to a number of additional communities, including many rural and Indigenous communities; (iv) the advancement of our 5G network build, which covered approximately 83% of the Canadian population at December 31, 2022; and (v) progress with the implementation of our digital strategy, and enhancement of products that will bolster both long-term revenue growth and operating expense efficiency.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Effective with the dividends paid on October 1, 2019, we offered Common Shares from Treasury at a discount of 2%. Cash payments for dividends increased by $143 million in 2022, which reflected higher dividend rates under our dividend growth program (see Section 4.3 ) and an increase in the number of shares outstanding. This was partly offset by a higher discounted DRISP issuance. During 2022, our DRISP plan trustee acquired Common Shares for $658 million.\n\nIn January 2023, we paid dividends of $317 million to the holders of Common Shares and the trustee acquired dividend reinvestment Common Shares from Treasury for $185 million, totalling $502 million.\n\n## Issue (repayment) of short-term borrowings, net\n\nIn the second quarter of 2022, we drew down amounts advanced to us from an arm's-length securitization trust to finance working capital. This was further drawn down earlier in the third quarter of 2022 before being repaid later in the third quarter of 2022. There were no material draws or repayments in 2021.\n\n## Long-term debt issued and Redemptions and repayment of long-term debt\n\nIn 2022, long-term debt issued increased by $5,380 million, while redemptions and repayment of long-term debt increased by $3,077 million. These changes were primarily composed of:\n\n- /bullet.ss01 A net decrease in commercial paper outstanding, including foreign exchange effects, of $442 million to a balance of $1.5 billion (US$1.1 billion) at December 31, 2022, from a balance of $1.9 billion (US$1.5 billion) at December 31, 2021. Our commercial paper program, when utilized, provides low-cost funds and is fully backstopped by the revolving credit facility (see Section 7.6 Credit facilities ).\n- /bullet.ss01 A decrease in net draws on the TELUS International (TI) credit facility, including foreign exchange effects, of $148 million. As at December 31, 2022, net draws due to a syndicate of financial institutions (excluding TELUS Corporation) were US$689 million, whereas as at December 31, 2021, net draws were US$854 million.

The amount has an effective average interest rate of 5.3% through January 2023.\n- /bullet.ss01 The repayment upon maturity of $249 million of Series 5, 9.65% debentures of TELUS Communications Inc. (TCI) due April 2022.\n\nBy comparison, in 2021, long-term debt issued increased by $9 million, while redemptions and repayment of long-term debt increased by $1,109 million. These changes were primarily composed of:\n\n- /bullet.ss01 A net increase in commercial paper outstanding, including foreign exchange effects, of $372 million from a balance of $731 million (US$574 million) at December 31, 2020.\n- /bullet.ss01 A decrease in net draws on the TI credit facility, including foreign exchange effects, of $742 million.

Additionally, the weighted average cost of our long-term debt (excluding commercial paper, TELUS bank credit facilities, the revolving components of the TI credit facility, lease liabilities and other long-term debt) was 4.03% at December 31, 2022, an increase from 3.72% at December 31, 2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Shares of subsidiary issued and sold to (purchased from) non-controlling interests, net\n\nIn the second quarter of 2022, we acquired shares of TELUS International from a non-controlling interest. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we acquired additional shares of TELUS International by way of market purchases. In connection with the TI initial public offering in the first quarter of 2021, we received net cash proceeds of $827 million.\n\n## Other\n\nIn the first quarter of 2022, we incurred debt issuance costs in connection with the issuance of our senior unsecured 3.40% U.S. Dollar Sustainability-Linked Notes in the first quarter of 2022. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2022, we incurred debt issuance costs in connection with the above-mentioned September 13, 2022 three-tranche note issuance. In the fourth quarter of 2022, TELUS International incurred costs related to the amendment and expansion of its credit facility. The total of these other costs in 2022 was lower than the total of the equity issuance costs in the first quarter of 2021 in connection with our issuance of 51 million Common Shares and debt issuance costs in 2021 related to two issuances of notes.\n\n## 7/period.ss01 5 L/i.ss01qu/i.ss01d/i.ss01ty and cap/i.ss01ta/l.ss08 resource measures\n\nNet debt was $24.2 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of $3.6 bill ion compared to one year earlier, resulting mainly from: the draw-down of the unsecured non-revolving $1.1 billion bank credit facility; the third quarter 2022 three-tranche issuance of $2.0 billion of notes as described in Section 7.4 ; and the first quarter 2022 issuance of US$900 million of sustainability-linked notes as described in Section 7.4 . These factors were partially offset by: a decrease in commercial paper outstanding; repayment upon maturity of Series 5, 9.65% debentures of TCI in the second quarter of 2022; and greater Cash and temporary investments.\n\nFixed-rate debt as a proportion of total indebtedness , which excludes lease liabilities and other long-term debt, was 86% as at December 31, 2022, down from 87% one year earlier. The decrease was primarily due to draws on the unsecured non-revolving $1.1 billion bank credit facility maturing July 9, 2024, which is classified as floating-rate debt in this calculation, as well as the repayment upon maturity of Series 5, 9.65% debentures of TCI in the second quarter of 2022. This was partially offset by: (i) the third quarter 2022 three-tranche issuance of $2.0 billion of notes as described in Section 7.4 ; (ii) the first quarter 2022 issuance of US$900 million of sustainability-linked notes as described in Section 7.4 ; (iii) a decrease in commercial paper outstanding, which is classified as floating-rate debt in this calculation; and (iv) a decrease in net draws due to a syndicate of financial institutions (excluding TELUS Corporation) on the TI credit facility, which is non-recourse to TELUS Corporation.\n\nOur Net debt to EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs ratio supports our financial objective of maintaining investment-grade credit ratings, which facilitates reasonable access to capital. This ratio was 3.63 times, as measured at December 31, 2022, up from 3.17 times one year earlier. As at December 31, 2022, this ratio remains outside of the long-term objective range of 2.20 to 2.70 times, resulting from prior issuances of incremental debt, primarily due to the acquisition of spectrum licences, as spectrum is our largest indefinite life asset, and business acquisitions, partially offset by growth in EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs. EBITDA was reduced by COVID-19 pandemic impacts. As at December 31, 2022, the acquisition of spectrum licences increased the ratio by approximately 0.47 and business acquisitions over the past 12 months increased the ratio by approximately 0.20, while business dispositions decreased the ratio by approximately 0.28. Our recent acquisitions of spectrum licences have increased our national spectrum holdings and represent an investment to extend our network capacity to support continuing growth in demand for data, as well as growth in our mobile subscriber base. Given the cash demands of the 2019 600 MHz, the 2021 3500 MHz and upcoming spectrum auctions, as well as the inability to predict impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the assessment of the guideline and timing of return to the objective range remains to be determined; however, it is our intent to return to a ratio below 2.70 times in the medium term (following the 2021, and upcoming 2023 and 2024, spectrum auctions), consistent with our long-term strategy. While this ratio exceeds our long-term objective range, we are well in compliance with the leverage ratio covenant in our credit facilities, which states that we may not permit our leverage ratio to exceed 4.25 to 1.00 at December 31, 2022 (see Section 7.6 Credit facilities ).",

An increase in income before borrowing costs and income taxes increased the ratio by 0.1, while an increase in borrowing costs decreased the ratio by 0.4.\n\nEBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs interest coverage ratio for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2022 was 7.8 times, down from 8.4 times one year earlier. Growth in EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs increased the ratio by 0.2 and an increase in net interest costs decreased the ratio by 0.8. EBITDA for the twelvemonth period ended December 31, 2022 was reduced by COVID-19 pandemic impacts.\n\nCommon Share dividend payout ratios: Actual Common Share dividend payout decisions will continue to be subject to our Board's assessment of our financial position and outlook, as well as our long-term Common Share dividend payout objective range of 60 to 75% of prospective free cash flow. So as to be consistent with the way we manage our business, our\n\nCommon Share dividend payout ratio is presented as a historical measure calculated as the sum of the dividends declared in the most recent four quarters for Common Shares, as recorded in the financial statements, net of dividend reinvestment plan effects, divided by the sum of the most recent four quarters' free cash flow amounts for interim reporting periods. For fiscal years, the denominator is annual free cash flow. The historical measure for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2022 is presented for illustrative purposes in evaluating our target guideline. As at December 31, 2022, the ratio was outside of the objective range, primarily due to: (i) our planned accelerated capital expenditures program to support our broadband capital investments, the build-out of our TELUS PureFibre infrastructure and the acceleration of our 5G network roll-out; and (ii) the reduction in EBITDA caused by the pandemic. Excluding the effects of our accelerated capital expenditures program of $823 million for the four most recent quarters, as at December 31, 2022, the ratio was 61%.\n\nTI intends to retain all available funds and any future earnings to support operations and to finance the growth and development of its business.",

Subsequently, on January 3, 2023, available liquidity from the TI credit facility was $371 million, following conditions precedent being met relating to TI's acquisition of WillowTree. In addition, we had $500 million available under our trade receivables securitization program (see Section 7.7 Sale of trade receivables ). We are well within our objective of generally maintaining at least $1 billion of available liquidity.\n\n## TELUS credit facilities\n\nWe have a $2.75 billion (or U.S. dollar equivalent) unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions, expiring April 6, 2026. The revolving credit facility is used for general corporate purposes, including the backstop of commercial paper, as required. As at December 31, 2022, we had an unsecured non-revolving $1.1 billion bank credit facility, maturing July 9, 2024, with a syndicate of financial institutions, which is to be used for general corporate purposes. As at December 31, 2022, we had drawn $1.1 billion on the non-revolving bank credit facility, with an effective average interest rate of 5.3% through January 2023.\n\n## TELUS revolving credit facility at December 31, 2022\n\n| ($ millions)                       | Expiry        | Size   | Drawn   | Outstanding  undrawn letters  of credit   | Backstop for  commercial  paper program   | Available  liquidity   |\n|------------------------------------|---------------|--------|---------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Revolving credit facility/one.numr | April 6, 2026 | 2,750  | -       | -                                         | (1,458)                                   | 1,292                  |\n\nOur credit facilities contain customary covenants, including a requirement that we not permit our consolidated leverage ratio to exceed 4.25 to 1.00 and that we not permit our consolidated coverage ratio to be less than 2.00 to 1.00 at the end of any financial quarter. As at December 31, 2022, our consolidated leverage ratio was 3.63 to 1.00 and our consolidated coverage ratio was 7.85 to 1.00. These ratios are expected to remain well within the covenants. There are certain minor differences in the calculation of the leverage ratio and coverage ratio under the revolving credit facility, as compared with the calculation of Net debt to EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs and EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs interest coverage. Historically, the calculations are substantially similar other than the covenant includes in EBITDA the unrealized effects of non-currency risk-related derivative financial instruments that are held for trading (see Note 4(h) of the Consolidated financial statements). The covenants are not impacted by revaluation, if any, of Property, plant and equipment, Intangible assets or Goodwill for accounting purposes. Continued access to our credit facilities is not contingent on maintaining a specific credit rating.\n\n## Commercial paper\n\nTELUS Corporation has an unsecured commercial paper program, which is backstopped by our revolving credit facility, enabling us to issue commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate equivalent amount at any one time of $2.0 billion (US$1.5 billion maximum) as at December 31, 2022. Foreign currency forward contracts are used to manage currency risk arising from issuing commercial paper denominated in U.S. dollars. The commercial paper program is to be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, capital expenditures and investments. Our ability to reasonably access the commercial paper market in the U.S. is dependent on our credit ratings (see Section 7.8 Credit ratings ).\n\n## TELUS International credit facility\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, TELUS International (Cda) Inc. had a credit facility, secured by its assets, expiring on January 3, 2028, with a syndicate of financial institutions, including TELUS Corporation. The TI credit facility is comprised of US$800 million (TELUS Corporation as approximately 7.2% lender) revolving components and amortizing US$1.2 billion (TELUS Corporation as approximately 7.2% lender) term loan com ponents. The TI credit facility is non-recourse to TELUS Corporation. The outstanding revolving components and term loan components had a weighted average interest rate of 6.7% as at December 31, 2022.\n\nThe term loan components are subject to an amortization schedule which requires that 5% of the principal advanced be repaid each year of the term of the agreement, with the balance due at maturity.\n\nConcurrent with the acquisition of WillowTree, TI drew down US$363 million and US$600 million of its available credit facility revolving components and term loan components, respectively.\n\n## Other letter of credit facilities\n\nAt December 31, 2022, we had $119 million of letters of credit outstanding issued under various uncommitted facilities; such letter of credit facilities are in addition to the ability to provide letters of credit pursuant to our committed revolving bank credit facility. Available liquidity under various uncommitted letters of credit facilities was $186 million at December 31, 2022.\n\n## Other long-term debt\n\nOther liabilities bear interest at 3.35%, are secured by the AWS-4 spectrum licences associated with these other liabilities and a real estate holding, and are subject to amortization schedules, so that the principal is repaid over the periods to maturity, the last period ending March 31, 2035.",

The agreement is in effect until December 31, 2024, and available liquidity was $500 million as at December 31, 2022. (See Note 22 of the Consolidated financial statements.) Sales of trade receivables in securitization transactions are recognized as collateralized Short-term borrowings and thus do not result in our de-recognition of the trade receivables sold.\n\n## 7/period.ss01 8 Cred/i.ss01t rat/i.ss01ngs\n\nIn November 2022, Fitch Ratings, Standard & Poor's Rating Services and DBRS Ltd. each downgraded TELUS Corporation's issuer rating and the rating of our senior unsecured notes to BBB (stable outlook) from BBB high (or equivalent).\n\nWe believe adherence to most of our stated financial policies (see Section 4.3 ), coupled with our efforts to maintain a constructive relationship with banks, investors and credit rating agencies, continue to provide reasonable access to capital markets. (See discussion of risks in Section 10.14 Financing, debt and dividends .)\n\nTCI is required to maintain a credit rating of at least BB by DBRS Ltd. or the securitization trust may require the sale program to be wound down prior to the end of the term.

Excluding the TI credit facility and including cash and temporary investments of $974 million, we had available liquidity of approximately $2.8 billion at December 31, 2022 (see Section 11.1 Non-GAAP and other specified financial measures ). This adheres to our objective of generally maintaining at least $1 billion of available liquidity.

        "page_content": "## Claims and lawsuits\n\nA number of claims and lawsuits (including class actions and intellectual property infringement claims) seeking damages and other relief are pending against us and, in some cases, other mobile carriers and telecommunications service providers. As well, we have received notice of, or are aware of, certain possible claims (including intellectual property infringement claims) against us and, in some cases, other mobile carriers and telecommunications service providers. (See the related risk discussion in Section 10.17 Litigation and legal matters .)\n\nIt is not currently possible for us to predict the outcome of such claims, possible claims and lawsuits due to various factors, including: the preliminary nature of some claims; uncertain damage theories and demands; an incomplete factual record; uncertainty concerning legal theories and procedures and their resolution by the courts, at both the trial and the appeal levels; and the unpredictable nature of opposing parties and their demands.\n\nHowever, subject to the foregoing limitations, management is of the opinion, based upon legal assessments and information presently available, that it is unlikely that any liability, to the extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise, would have a material effect on our financial position and the results of our operations, including cash flows, with the exception of the items disclosed in Note 29(a) of the Consolidated financial statements. This is a significant judgment for us (see Section 8.1 Critical accounting estimates and judgments ).\n\n## Indemnification obligations\n\nIn the normal course of operations, we provide indemnification in conjunction with certain transactions. The terms of these indemnification obligations range in duration. These indemnifications would require us to compensate the indemnified parties for costs incurred as a result of failure to comply with contractual obligations, or litigation claims or statutory sanctions, or damages that may be suffered by an indemnified party. In some cases, there is no maximum limit on these indemnification obligations. The overall maximum amount of an indemnification obligation will depend on future events and conditions and therefore cannot be reasonably estimated. Where appropriate, an indemnification obligation is recorded as a liability. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of the related transactions, historically we have not made significant payments under these indemnifications.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, we had no liability recorded in respect of our indemnification obligations.\n\n## Status of labour negotiations\n\nIn 2021, we commenced collective bargaining with the Telecommunications Workers Union, United Steelworkers Local 1944 (TWU), to renew a collective agreement that expired on December 31, 2021; the contract covered approximately 17% of our Canadian workforce as at December 31, 2022. The expired contract remains in effect while the parties are bargaining, until a new agreement is reached.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the parties participated in conciliation with an appointed federal conciliator following the TWU's application to the Federal Minister of Labour for assistance in negotiations. The TWU subsequently held a ratification vote on TELUS' offer, which resulted in 65% of union members voting against accepting the proposed contract. Should a new collective agreement not be reached, there is the risk of a labour disruption after all legal pre-conditions have been met. As a labour disruption could occur in multiple forms, the operational and financial impacts of a labour disruption on us are not practicably determinable currently. See Section 10.11 for further details.\n\n## 7/period.ss0110 Outstand/i.ss01ng share /i.ss01nformat/i.ss01on\n\n3\n\n8\n\n| Outstanding shares (millions)           | December 31,  2022   | January 31,  2023   |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n| Common Shares                           | 1,431                | 1,438               |\n| Common Share options                    | 3                    |                     |\n| Restricted share units - equity-settled | 8                    |                     |\n\n## 7/period.ss011 1 Transact/i.ss01ons between re/l.ss08ated part/i.ss01es\n\n## Transactions with key management personnel\n\nOur key management personnel have authority and responsibility for overseeing, planning, directing and controlling our activities and consist of our Board of Directors and our Executive Team.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect: the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; and the reported amounts and classification of income and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our critical accounting estimates and significant judgments are generally discussed with the Audit Committee each quarter.\n\nRefer to Note 1 of the Consolidated financial statements for further information on our critical accounting estimates, including examples of the significant estimates and judgments that we make, and their relative significance and degree of difficulty, as illustrated in the graphic included in Note 1 .\n\n## General\n\n- /bullet.ss01 In determining our critical accounting estimates, we consider trends, commitments, events or uncertainties that we reasonably expect to materially affect our methodology or assumptions. Our statements in this MD&A regarding such consideration are made subject to the Caution regarding forward-looking statements .\n- /bullet.ss01 In the normal course, we make changes to assumptions underlying all critical accounting estimates so that they reflect current economic conditions, updated historical information used to develop the assumptions, and changes in our credit ratings, where applicable. Unless indicated otherwise in the discussion below, we expect that no material changes in overall financial performance and financial statement line items would arise either from reasonably likely changes in material assumptions underlying the estimate or from selection of a different estimate from within a range of valid estimates.\n- /bullet.ss01 Our critical accounting estimates affect the Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income, and the Consolidated statements of financial position, as follows:\n\n## Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income\n\n|                                               |                                       | Operating expenses             | Operating expenses          | Operating expenses   | Operating expenses                  |                  |                                                            |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Consolidated statements of financial position | Operating  revenues and  other income | Goods and  services  purchased | Employee  benefits  expense | Depreciation         | Amortization  of intangible  assets | Financing  costs | Employee defined  benefit plans   re-measurements/one.numr |\n| Intangible assets, net, and Goodwill, net     |                                       |                                |                             |                      | X/two.numr                          |                  |                                                            |\n| Employee defined benefit pension plans        |                                       |                                | X                           | X/three.numr         | X/three.numr                        | X                | X                                                          |\n| Property, plant and equipment, net            |                                       |                                |                             | X                    |                                     |                  |                                                            |\n| Provisions for asset retirement obligations   |                                       | X                              |                             | X                    |                                     | X                |                                                            |\n| Provisions related to business combinations   | X                                     |                                |                             |                      |                                     | X                |                                                            |\n| Investments                                   | X                                     |                                |                             |                      |                                     |                  |                                                            |\n| Accounts receivable                           |                                       | X                              |                             |                      |                                     |                  |                                                            |\n| Contract assets                               | X                                     | X                              |                             |                      |                                     |                  |                                                            |\n| Inventories                                   |                                       | X                              |                             |                      |                                     |                  |                                                            |\n\n- 1 Other comprehensive income - Item never subsequently reclassified to income.\n- 2 Accounting estimate, as applicable to Intangible assets with indefinite lives relates to spectrum holdings.\n- 3 Accounting estimate impact due to internal labour capitalization rates.\n- /bullet.ss01 All critical accounting estimates are uncertain at the time an estimate is made and affect the following Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income line items: Income taxes (except for estimates about Goodwill) and Net income. Similarly, all critical accounting estimates affect the following Consolidated statements of financial position line items: Current assets (Income and other taxes receivable), Current liabilities (Income and other taxes payable), Deferred income taxes and Common equity (retained earnings) and Non-controlling interests. The discussion of each critical accounting estimate does not differ between our two segments, TELUS technology solutions (TTech) and digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International (DLCX), unless explicitly noted.\n\n## Intangible assets, net; Goodwill, net; and Property, plant and equipment, net\n\n## General\n\n- /bullet.ss01 The Intangible assets, net, line item represents approximately 35% of Total assets as at December 31, 2022 (36% as at December 31, 2021). Included in Intangible assets are spectrum licences, which represent approximately 23% of Total assets as at December 31, 2022 (25% as at December 31, 2021).\n- /bullet.ss01 The Goodwill, net, line item represents approximately 17% of Total assets as at December 31, 2022 and approximately 15% of Total assets as at December 31, 2021.\n- /bullet.ss01 The Property, plant and equipment, net, line item on our Consolidated statements of financial position represents approximately 32% of Total assets as at December 31, 2022 and approximately 33% of Total assets as at December 31, 2021.",

        "page_content": "- /bullet.ss01 If our estimates of the useful lives of assets were incorrect and/or our estimates of the acquisition-date fair value of property, plant, equipment and intangible assets acquired in business combinations were incorrect, we could experience increased or decreased charges for amortization or depreciation in the future. If the future were to differ adversely from our best estimate of key economic assumptions and associated cash flows were to materially decrease, we could potentially experience future material impairment charges in respect of our Property, plant and equipment assets, Intangible assets or Goodwill. If Intangible assets with indefinite lives were determined to have finite lives at some point in the future, we could experience increased charges for amortization of Intangible assets. Such charges in and of themselves do not result in a cash outflow and would not immediately affect our liquidity.\n\n## The recoverability of Intangible assets with indefinite lives; the recoverability of Goodwill\n\n- /bullet.ss01 The carrying values of Intangible assets with indefinite lives and Goodwill are periodically tested for impairment, and this test represents a significant estimate for us.\n- /bullet.ss01 The recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units' assets have been determined based on a fair value less costs of disposal calculation. There is a material degree of uncertainty with respect to the estimates of the recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units' assets, given the necessity of making key economic assumptions about the future. The fair value less costs of disposal calculation uses future cash flows and growth projections; associated economic risk assumptions and estimates of the likelihood of achieving key operating metrics and drivers; estimates of future generational infrastructure capital expenditures; and the future weighted average cost of capital.\n- /bullet.ss01 See Note 18(f) of the Consolidated financial statements for further discussion of methodology and sensitivity testing.\n\n## The estimated useful lives of assets; the recoverability of tangible assets\n\n- /bullet.ss01 The estimated useful lives of most assets are determined by a continuing program of asset life studies. The recoverability of assets with finite lives is significantly impacted by the estimated useful lives of assets.\n- /bullet.ss01 Assumptions underlying the estimated useful lives of assets include the timing of technological obsolescence, competitive pressures and future infrastructure utilization plans.\n\n## Employee defined benefit pension plans\n\nCertain actuarial and economic assumptions used in determining defined benefit pension costs, accrued pension benefit obligations and pension plan assets\n\n- /bullet.ss01 We review industry practices, trends, economic conditions and data provided by actuaries when developing assumptions used in the determination of defined benefit pension costs and accrued pension benefit obligations. Pension plan assets are generally valued using market prices; however, some assets are valued using market estimates when market prices are not readily available. Actuarial support is obtained for interpolations of experience gains and losses that affect the employee defined benefit plan actuarial gains and losses and accrued pension benefit obligations. The discount rate used to determine the accrued benefit obligation is based upon the yield on long-term, high-quality, fixed-term investments. The discount rate is set annually at the end of each calendar year,\n\nat a minimum, based upon yields on long-term corporate bond indices in consultation with actuaries. Future increases in compensation are based upon the current benefits policies and economic forecasts. We have examined our respective pension obligation and current service cost durations and observed an approximate 10-year difference in duration. As individual discount rates more accurately reflect the obligation and current service cost, commencing in 2016, we applied a dual discount rate methodology.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 On an annual basis, at a minimum, the defined benefit pension plan assumptions are assessed and revised as appropriate. Assumptions used in determining defined benefit pension costs, accrued pension benefit obligations and pension plan assets include life expectancy, discount rates, market estimates and rates of future compensation increases. Material changes in overall financial performance and financial statement line items would arise from reasonably likely changes in the material assumptions underlying this estimate, since certain assumptions may have been revised to reflect updated historical information and updated economic conditions. See Note 15 of the Consolidated financial statements for further analysis.\n- /bullet.ss01 This accounting estimate related to employee defined benefit pension plans is in respect of components of the Operating expenses line item, Financing costs line item and Other comprehensive income line item on our Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income. If the future were to adversely differ from our best estimate of assumptions used in determining defined benefit pension costs, defined benefit obligations accrued and pension plan assets, we could experience future increased (or decreased) defined benefit pension expense, financing costs and charges to Other comprehensive income.\n\n## Income tax assets and liabilities\n\nThe amount and composition of income tax assets and income tax liabilities, including the amount of unrecognized tax benefits\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Assumptions underlying the composition of income tax assets and liabilities are based upon an assessment of the technical merits of tax positions. Income tax benefits on uncertain tax positions are recognized only when it is more likely than not that the ultimate determination of the tax treatment of a position will result in the related benefit being realizable; however, this does not mean that tax authorities cannot challenge these positions. Income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount that is expected to be realized or incurred upon ultimate settlement with taxation authorities. Such assessments are based upon the applicable income tax legislation, regulations, interpretations and jurisprudence, all of which in turn are subject to change and interpretation.\n- /bullet.ss01 Current income tax assets and liabilities are estimated based upon the amount of income tax that is calculated as being owed to taxation authorities, net of periodic instalment payments. Deferred income tax liabilities are composed of the tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as the income tax effect of undeducted income tax losses. The timing of the reversal of temporary differences is estimated and the income tax rate substantively enacted for the periods of reversal is applied to the temporary differences. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are based upon the amounts recorded in the financial statements and are, therefore, subject to accounting estimates that are inherent in those balances. The tax basis of assets and liabilities,",

        "page_content": "as well as the amount of undeducted income tax losses, is based upon the assessment and measurement of tax positions, as noted above. Assumptions as to the timing of reversal of temporary differences include expectations about the future results of operations and future cash flows. The composition of income tax liabilities is reasonably likely to change from period to period because of changes in the estimation of these significant uncertainties.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 This accounting estimate is in respect of material asset and liability line items on our Consolidated statements of financial position comprising less than 1% of Total assets as at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and approximately 8% of Total liabilities and owners' equity as at December 31, 2022 (9% as at December 31, 2021). If the future were to adversely differ from our best estimate of the likelihood of tax positions being sustained, the amount of tax expected to be incurred, the future results of operations, the timing of reversal of deductible temporary differences and taxable temporary differences, and the tax rates applicable to future years, we could experience material current income tax adjustments and deferred income tax adjustments. Such current and deferred income tax adjustments could result in an increase or acceleration of cash outflows at an earlier time than might otherwise be expected.\n\n## Provisions for asset retirement obligations\n\n## Certain economic assumptions used in provisioning\n\n## for asset retirement obligations\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Asset retirement obligation provisions are recognized for statutory, contractual or legal obligations, normally when incurred, associated with the retirement of Property, plant and equipment (primarily certain items of outside plant and mobile site equipment) when those obligations result from the acquisition, construction, development and/or normal operation of the assets. The obligations are measured initially at fair value, determined using present value methodology, and the resulting costs are capitalized as a part of the carrying value of the related asset.\n- /bullet.ss01 On an annual basis, at a minimum, assumptions underlying the provisions for asset retirement obligations include expectations about inflation, discount rates and any changes in the amount or timing of the underlying future cash flows, which may span numerous decades. Material changes in financial position would arise from reasonably likely changes in the material assumptions underlying this estimate, since certain assumptions may have been revised to reflect updated historical information and updated economic conditions. The capitalized asset retirement cost is depreciated on the same basis as the related asset, and the discount accretion is included in the Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income as a component of Financing costs.\n- /bullet.ss01 This accounting estimate is in respect of the asset retirement obligations component of the Provisions line item on our Consolidated statements of financial position, and this component comprises approximately 1% of Total liabilities and owners' equity as at December 31, 2022 (1% as at December 31, 2021). If the provisions for asset retirement obligations were to be inadequate, we could experience a charge to Goods and services purchased in the future. A charge for an inadequate asset retirement obligation provision would result in a cash outflow proximate to the time that the asset retirement obligation is satisfied.\n\n## Provisions related to business combinations\n\n## Provisions for written put options\n\n- /bullet.ss01 In connection with certain business acquisitions, we have established provisions for written put options in respect of non-controlling interests. We provide written put options to the remaining selling shareholders under which they could put the remaining non-controlling interests at, or after, a specified date. The acquisition-date fair values of the puttable shares held by the non-controlling shareholders are recorded as provisions.\n- /bullet.ss01 On an annual basis, at a minimum, the provisions for written put options are assessed and revised as appropriate. The provisions for written put options have been determined based on the net present values of estimated future earnings results; there is a material degree of uncertainty with respect to the estimates of future earnings results, given the necessity of making significant economic assumptions about the future. The amounts of provisions for written put options are reasonably likely to change from period to period because of changes in the estimation of future earnings and foreign exchange rate movements.\n- /bullet.ss01 This accounting estimate is in respect of the provisions for written put options related to the non-controlling interests component of the Provisions line item on our Consolidated statements of financial position, and this component comprises less than 1% of Total liabilities and owners' equity as at December 31, 2022 and 2021. If the provisions for written put options were to be inadequate, we could experience a charge to Other income in the future. A charge for an inadequate written put option provision would result in a cash outflow proximate to the time that the written put option is exercised.\n\n## Investments\n\n## The recoverability of long-term investments\n\n- /bullet.ss01 We assess the recoverability of our long-term investments on a regular, recurring basis. The recoverability of investments is assessed on a specific-identification basis, taking into consideration expectations about future performance of the investments and comparison of historical results to past expectations.\n- /bullet.ss01 The most significant assumptions underlying the recoverability of long-term investments are related to the achievement of future cash flow and operating expectations. Our estimate of the recoverability of long-term investments could change from period to period due to the recurring nature of the recoverability assessment and due to the nature of long-term investments (we do not control the investees).\n- /bullet.ss01 Investments are included in the Other long-term assets line item on our Consolidated statements of financial position, which itself comprises approximately 4% of Total assets as at December 31, 2022 (2021 - 4%). If the allowance for recoverability of long-term investments were to be inadequate, we could experience an increased charge to Other income or Other comprehensive income depending on the financial asset classification. Such a provision for recoverability of long-term investments does not result in a cash outflow.",

        "page_content": "## Accounts receivable\n\n## General\n\n- /bullet.ss01 When determining our allowance for doubtful accounts, we consider the business area that gave rise to the Accounts receivable, conduct a statistical analysis of portfolio delinquency trends and perform specific account identification.\n- /bullet.ss01 These accounting estimates are in respect of the Accounts receivable line item and the Unbilled customer finance receivables line within the Other long-term assets line item on our Consolidated statements of financial position, which together comprise approximately 7% of Total assets as at December 31, 2022 (7% as at December 31, 2021). If the future were to differ adversely from our best estimates of the fair value of the residual cash flows and the allowance for doubtful accounts, we could experience an increase in doubtful accounts expense in the future. Such doubtful accounts expense in and of itself does not result in a cash outflow.\n\n## The allowance for doubtful accounts\n\n- The estimate of our allowance for doubtful accounts could materially change from period to period because the allowance is a function of the balance and composition of Accounts receivable, which can vary on a month-to-month basis. The variability of the balance of Accounts receivable arises from the variability of the amount and composition of Operating revenues and other income and from the variability of Accounts receivable collection performance. /bullet.ss01\n\n## Contract assets\n\n## General\n\n- We maintain allowances for lifetime expected credit losses related to contract assets. Current economic conditions, historical information (including credit agency reports, if available), and the line of business from which the contract asset arose are all considered when determining impairment allowances. The same factors are considered when determining whether to write off amounts charged to the impairment allowance for contract assets against contract assets. /bullet.ss01\n\n## The impairment allowance\n\n- These accounting estimates are in respect of the Contract assets line items on our Consolidated statements of financial position, which comprise approximately 2% of Total assets as at December 31, 2022 and 2021. If the future were to differ adversely from our best estimates of the fair value of the residual cash flows and the impairment allowance for contract assets, we could experience an increase in the impairment allowance for contract assets against contract assets in the future. Such impairment allowance in and of itself does not result in a cash outflow. /bullet.ss01\n\n## Inventories\n\n## The allowance for inventory obsolescence\n\n- /bullet.ss01 We determine our allowance for inventory obsolescence based upon expected inventory turnover, inventory aging, and current and future expectations with respect to product offerings.\n- /bullet.ss01 Assumptions underlying the allowance for inventory obsolescence include future sales trends and offerings and the expected inventory requirements and inventory composition necessary to support these future offerings. Our estimate of the allowance for inventory obsolescence could change materially from period to period due to changes in product offerings and the level of consumer acceptance of those products.\n- /bullet.ss01 This accounting estimate is in respect of the Inventories line item on our Consolidated statements of financial position, which comprises approximately 1% of Total assets as at December 31, 2022 and 2021. If the allowance for inventory obsolescence were to be inadequate, we could experience a charge to Goods and services purchased in the future. Such an inventory obsolescence charge does not result in a cash outflow.\n\n## 8/period.ss012 Account/i.ss01ng po/l.ss08/i.ss01cy deve/l.ss08opments\n\nRefer to Note 2 of the Consolidated financial statements for a description of current and future changes in accounting policies, including standards, interpretations and amendments to standards and interpretations in the reporting period not yet effective and not yet applied.",

Mobile and data services continue to drive ongoing industry growth. Additionally, consumer communications and data consumption behaviours continue to demonstrate a strong preference for data-rich applications and data-intensive devices, including smartphones and tablets. From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 through fiscal 2021, revenue growth across the telecommunications industry was limited, particularly related to roaming revenue due to travel restrictions and changing consumer behaviour associated with travelling. However, with the easing of COVID-19-related travel restrictions in 2022, the industry experienced roaming volumes returning to pre-pandemic period levels, particularly within the consumer segment, supporting higher roaming revenues in 2022 that were above pre-pandemic levels.\n\n## Mobile products and services\n\nWe estimate that in 2022, the Canadian mobile industry experienced mobile network revenue growth of approximately 6.8%, which we believe was attributable to ongoing customer growth and increased roaming revenues due to the ongoing recovery after the first two years of the pandemic. We estimate that the Canadian mobile phone industry added approximately 1.7 million net new subscribers in 2022 (inclusive of TELUS' mobile phone additions), compared to an estimate of approximately 1.2 million in 2021 for the industry. This was supported by immigration and population growth; the trend toward multiple devices; the expanding functionality of data and related applications; and the ongoing adoption of mobile devices and services. Various public health measures in place during the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 led to pent-up demand for mobile devices in 2022. We estimate that the Canadian mobile phone penetration rate increased to over 102% in 2022, with further increases in penetration expected in 2023. By comparison, the mobile phone penetration rate in the United States is well over 100%, while in Europe and Asia it is even higher, suggesting an opportunity for continued growth in Canada. TELUS' mobile network revenue increased by 6.2% in 2022, and TELUS mobile products and services direct contribution increased by 7.1%.\n\nIn 2022, the Canadian mobile market continued to recover from the challenges related to the pandemic. Growth in blended average revenue per subscriber unit per month (ARPU) had been moderating as carriers migrated their customer bases to unlimited data plans. However, pandemic impacts, particularly related to roaming, had subsided as consumer segment travel volumes largely returned to pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, with members of the workforce returning to traditional work environments, workers offloading their mobile device traffic onto Wi-Fi had moderated, resulting in increased domestic chargeable data usage. The Canadian mobile market continued to experience increased levels of competition nationally. This high level of competitive intensity has led\n\nto continued declines in chargeable data usage and larger allotments of data, in addition to other factors, such as: the popularity of data sharing plans; more frequent customer-friendly data usage notifications; and an evolving shift in the customer mix towards non-traditional mobile devices and tools such as video chats. These factors, combined with increases in overall data usage, which is expected to grow dramatically with the ongoing commercialization of 5G, led to widespread adoption and promotion of unlimited data plans and device financing plans by all national carriers. The build-out of 5G network infrastructure continued in 2022, with 5G coverage of approximately 80% of the Canadian population by the national carriers at the end of 2022, compared to approximately 70% at the end of 2021. For TELUS, our accelerated 5G investments are underpinned by our accelerated broadband build program, which was pre-funded by our equity offering in March 2021 and continued in 2022. Our long-standing commitment to network excellence is reflected in multiple independent third-party awards and recognition received in 2022, including from independent global analytics company Opensignal and U.S.-based Ookla, each for six consecutive years, and from Canadian-based Tutela, for four years in a row.\n\nWe continue to work diligently to better monetize robust growth in data services, while simultaneously delivering a strong value-for-money proposition and leading customer service to our customers. To this end, we are focusing intensively on profitable customer growth and strong ARPU performance through our consistent strategic execution of premium smartphone loading, which includes driving higher-value data and share plan adoption, as well as flexible product offerings, including bundling our mobility and home services. Moreover, we are focusing on the other levers available to us in an environment of moderating ARPU growth and expanding 5G network infrastructure, to ensure we continue to deliver on our TELUS technology solutions (TTech) EBITDA growth objectives, including:\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Evolving our approach to mobile plans and device sales with the availability of Unlimited data plans on our 5G network, TELUS Easy Payment device financing, TELUS Family Discount offerings and wide selection of certified pre-owned devices, which have resulted in simplification for both customers and team members, while supporting growth in digital transactions and improved recovery of handset costs\n- /bullet.ss01 Monetizing our expanding 5G network by driving customer step-ups to higher-value unlimited data plans along with using speed tiers to encourage customer adoption of faster 5G speeds; launch of Koodo Pick Your Perks, giving customers the opportunity to add a free feature of their choosing, driving ARPU step-ups; in addition to marketing our innovative product and service offerings, including the launch of Stream+, a premium streaming bundle that combines Netflix Premium, Apple TV+ and discovery+\n- /bullet.ss01 Continuing to drive volume growth through high-quality loading on the back of strong ongoing industry growth, including 5G device upgrades\n- /bullet.ss01 Seeking new sources of wireless revenue, such as Internet of Things (IoT) or Internet of Everything, machine-to-machine (M2M) and security applications in the business-to-business (B2B) market, including health, agriculture and smart cities",

Physical distancing requirements impacted traditional fixed installations, as installers were not entering customers' premises. Conversely, with large numbers of workers and students working and learning from home, demand for fixed products and services surged, with traffic levels reaching historic levels during the pandemic. Although the consumer high-speed internet market is maturing, with a penetration rate of approximately 90% in Western Canada and 91% across Canada at the end of 2022, subscriber growth is expected to continue over the coming years. The four major cable-TV companies had an estimated 7.54 million internet subscribers at the end of 2022 (48% market share down 0.6 percentage points), from approximately 7.38 million subscribers at the end of 2021. Meanwhile, telecommunications companies had approximately 7.92 million internet subscribers (51% market share - up 0.7 percentage points), from approximately 7.55 million at the end of 2021. We continue to make gains in market share as a result of the ongoing expansion of our TELUS PureFibre infrastructure and the pull-through of subscribers from our IP-based TELUS TV services (Optik TV and Pik TV), including our bundled mobility and home services, as well as significant growth in home security and automation. Our ongoing focus on fibre to the premises or home (FTTP/FTTH) has allowed us to connect approximately 3.0 million households and businesses in B.C., Alberta and Eastern Quebec as of December 31, 2022 to our TELUS PureFibre technology. Similar to our accelerated 5G investments, our investments to expand our fibre footprint are supported by our accelerated broadband build program, which commenced in 2021 and continued into 2022, while capital expenditures on a consolidated basis are expected to decline significantly in 2023. Additionally, we received recognition from PCMag as the fastest internet service provider (ISP) in Canada among major ISPs for the third consecutive year.\n\nWhile Canadians still watch conventional TV, digital platforms are playing an increasingly important role in the broadcasting industry and in respect of content. Popular online video services are providing Canadians with more choice about where, when and how to access video content. In 2022, Canadian IP TV providers increased their subscriber base by an estimated 4% to 3.4 million, or 34% of market share, up from 32% at the end of 2021, through expanded network\n\ncoverage, enhanced differentiated service and bundled offerings, and marketing and promotions focused on IP TV. Despite this IP TV growth, the combined cable-TV and satellite-TV subscriber penetration rate was unchanged. We estimate that the four major cable-TV companies had approximately 4.8 million TV subscribers or a 48% market share at the end of 2022, flat compared to 48% at the end of 2021.\n\nIn recent years, three of the largest Canadian cable-TV companies have launched new TV services based on the Comcast X1 TV platform, including Shaw, Rogers and Quebecor's Videotron brand. Our IP-based Optik TV platform continues to offer numerous service advantages compared to this cable platform, including: flexible pricing plans and packaging available to all customers; picture clarity and quality; content depth and breadth, including multicultural and hard-to-find shows from abroad, as well as speciality options such as wellness and entertainment; the number of ways customers can access content, including wireless set-top boxes, Restart TV, higher-capacity PVR and the Optik TV app, which offers more than twice as many live TV channels at home or on the go compared to our largest Western Canadian cable competitor. The TELUS PureFibre network was named the number one network for streaming Netflix for 17 consecutive months prior to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (based on the Netflix ISP Speed Index rankings for Canadian providers released monthly, as of March 2020) and we are the only Canadian carrier to consistently achieve a number one ranking for each month from August 2020 to December 2022 for the newly revamped index. We continue to offer more on-demand content and more over-the-top (OTT) content with Netflix, YouTube, Prime Video (included in the Amazon Prime membership), hayu, TED Talks and the National Film Board of Canada, and we are the multicultural content leader in Western Canada.\n\nThe national Canadian telecom providers continue to acquire and develop capabilities in home security and automation. Through various acquisitions, including the Canadian operations of Vivint Smart Home, Inc. in 2022, ADT Security Services Canada, Inc. in 2019, and other smaller tuck-ins, we have furthered our commitment to leverage the power of technology to bring state-of-the-art convenience, control and safety into the lives, homes and businesses of more Canadians to become Canada's leading security and home automation provider. Security also provides opportunities to offer attractive bundled solutions and advance our connected home strategy while accelerating our entry into the market for smart home and automation and physical and cybersecurity business solutions. Our SmartHome Security and TELUS Secure Business service offerings complement our industry-leading customer service and build on our strategy and commitment to leverage our world-leading wireless and PureFibre network, enabling us to enhance connected home, business, security, IoT, cybersecurity, smart buildings, smart cities and health services for customers in Canada.\n\nCanada's four major cable-TV companies had an estimated base of approximately 2.8 million telephony subscribers at the end of 2022. This represents a national consumer market share of approximately 41%, down compared to approximately 42% at the end of 2021. Telecommunications companies had an estimated 3.4 million telephony subscribers at the end of 2022, representing a market share of approximately 49%, relatively flat compared to approximately 49% at the end of 2021. Technological substitution by mobile services is continuing to erode the number of residential voice subscribers and associated local and long distance revenues, as expected.",

        "page_content": "## TELUS Health\n\nIn 2022, we continued to drive strong growth within our industryleading health business, complemented by the September 2022 acquisition of LifeWorks, as well as the ongoing adoption of our unique and innovative portfolio of health and well-being offerings across the health ecosystem. Health services revenue increased by 75.2% to $913 million in 2022. At a time when demand for health and well-being services has never been higher, the combination of TELUS Health and LifeWorks is improving health outcomes and providing better preventive health and wellness experiences for people worldwide. Employers are leading an evolution in healthcare - from prevention to care delivery representing a significant global growth opportunity for TELUS Health. We are simplifying our offerings for the market by bringing employee and family assistance programs (EFAP), mental health and well-being solutions together.\n\nAdditionally, the Canadian healthcare industry is expected to continue to realize strong growth in future years, based on an aging population in Canada, an increasing emphasis on chronic disease management, and the potential benefits that technology can deliver in terms of efficiency and effectiveness within the sector. Prior to the pandemic, the healthcare industry saw an emerging trend for physicians and other healthcare professionals to use smartphones and connected devices to access patient records from remote locations. Since the COVID-19 lockdown measures were first put into place in 2020, adoption of healthcare technology has accelerated, as clinicians have adapted to primarily virtual and tele-medicine-based practices, resulting in the overall Canadian healthcare technology market growing at a double-digit pace, well beyond the rate initially predicted at the beginning of 2020. The digitization of everyday functions within the health ecosystem, combined with increased and pervasive broadband network connectivity, provides a unique opportunity to support the development and delivery of even more advanced health and wellness applications to benefit Canadians and improve health and well-being outcomes. Along with digital healthcare delivery, TELUS Health is supporting the delivery of EFAP through digital enhancements. With these added solutions, TELUS Health is providing meaningful interventions to improve employee outcomes in mental and physical well-being.\n\n## TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods\n\nThe global agriculture industry and global food industry are estimated to have an overall value of approximately $12 trillion and $9 trillion, respectively. It is estimated that global food supplies will need to increase by as much as 70% over the next 30 years, simply to keep pace with a world whose population is growing in numbers and in wealth. The agricultural sector historically has been antiquated with minimal change in business practices and limited software solutions to drive valuable data insights to make processes more efficient. With increasing pressures from our growing population, consumer packaged goods companies, retailers and producers around the globe are leveraging new, innovative digital technologies to manage their operations efficiently. Access to data insights can provide our customers, and the larger value chain, with significant resource, time and cost savings, while improving the safety, quality, traceability and sustainability of outputs. We continue to advance our position to transform producer-to-consumer outcomes by targeting the most urgent needs across the value chain.\n\n## Digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International (DLCX)\n\nIn 2022, TI continued to win business with both new and existing clients, driving solid organic growth while maintaining leading margins. With more than 650 clients, TI partners with major global and disruptive brands, with a focus on designing, building and delivering premium digital solutions. With exposure to industry verticals such as tech and games, eCommerce and fintech, as well as more traditional industries, such as banking, financial services and insurance, TI is positioned for continued long-term success. TI's end-to-end capabilities address multiple client needs, including digital customer experience management, digital transformation of IT and customer experience systems, as well as neweconomy services such as digital trust and safety and AI data services. The necessity of moderating content on digital platforms has prompted enterprises to seek out specialized services that can help them accommodate changes in a dynamic, uncertain and often highly regulated environment driven by user-generated content. The demand for AI data services historically has been driven by large technology companies; however, demand from other enterprises is growing as AI adoption increases. In early 2023, TI completed its acquisition of WillowTree, a premier, full-service digital product provider focused on end-user experiences, such as native mobile applications and unified web interfaces. The acquisition of WillowTree brings key tech talent, including digital strategists, designers, engineers and project managers, and diversity to TI's portfolio of next-generation solutions, and further augments its digital product offerings and innovative client-centric software development capabilities.\n\n## 9/period.ss012 Te/l.ss08ecommun/i.ss01cat/i.ss01ons /i.ss01ndustry genera/l.ss08 out/l.ss08ook and trends\n\n## Mobile products and services\n\nMobile growth continues to be driven by increasing data usage and adoption, including: higher-value smartphones, unlimited data offerings, shared family data plans, and growth in IoT and M2M devices. In addition, consumers continue to replace fixed access with mobile access and related data services. These trends are expected to continue to drive a growing demand for mobile data services for the foreseeable future, particularly as the industry continues to shift to 5G. Industry ARPU is expected to continue growing at a more moderate rate than 2022, compared to periods prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly considering that roaming revenues have returned to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nWhile LTE and LTE advanced (LTE-A) technologies increase download speeds, encourage data usage and enhance the customer experience, growth in data traffic poses challenges to mobile access technology. To better manage this data traffic, Canadian providers continue to evolve their networks and deploy spectrum to support the shift to 5G. In 2022, the industry, including TELUS, began to operationalize 3500 MHz spectrum acquired in 2021, enabling faster data speeds and increased capacity. We expect the 3800 MHz and millimetre wave (mmWave) spectrum auctions held by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) to commence in 2023 and 2024, respectively, and these will be important to the expansion of 5G networks.\n\nIoT technologies connect communications-enabled devices via wireless technologies, allowing them to exchange key information and share processes. Advanced platforms and networks are already in place",

        "page_content": "in industries such as healthcare, utilities, agriculture and fleet management, with deployment ongoing in other sectors, including smart cities, vehicle insurance, retail, food services, consumer utilities, and connected vehicles. These and other industries are looking to IoT, combined with other applications, to digitally transform themselves and generate value from their connections. IoT represents a meaningful opportunity for growth in mobility products and services, with secure connectivity, customer value, productivity and efficiency. While IoT applications generally have lower ARPU when sold as a stand-alone product, they tend to generate high service volumes with low or no subsidy costs, thereby supporting both revenue growth and margins. In 2022, we added 368,000 connected devices, bringing our connected device subscriber base to approximately 2.5 million, up 15.7% from 2021.\n\n5G has begun to play a mainstream role in technology evolution and innovation globally, and is an important component of meeting Canada's and TELUS' social impact-oriented efforts to further bridge the digital divide and connect rural Canadians. Investing in 5G will drive capital expenditure savings by allowing us to provide high-speed mobile internet services in less urban areas, as well as improved cost savings and innovative services in industrial automation, transportation and telehealth. Driven by significantly faster speeds, lower latencies, improved reliability and attractive economics, 5G will enable a host of new applications: for businesses, 5G will create opportunities for enhanced productivity, virtual work and profitability; for industries, 5G will enable remote operations, industrial control and manufacturing automation; for consumers, home automation, autonomous vehicles, and wireless-to-the-home connectivity with speeds comparable to fixed access technologies; for healthcare, converged solutions for hospitals, clinics and remote patient monitoring - and potentially medical procedures; and for agriculture and consumer goods, autonomous farm equipment, precision agronomy, food traceability and real-time data insights. 5G is essential to the future of a global digital economy, including Canada's, and is expected to generate significant innovation, growth and productivity. 5G wireless technology is up to 100 times faster than 4G LTE technology. As the 5G ecosystem evolves, it will move from a non-stand-alone core, based on the existing 4G LTE infrastructure, to a stand-alone core, which makes use of cloud-based technology, enabling new functionality through the capacity to support more connected devices and ultra-low latency. In 2022, we started to see 5G stand-alone adoption from early adopters globally. The industry expects to see functionality and 5G stand-alone adoption progress further in 2023.\n\nDelivering a robust and reliable 5G experience for Canadians will require complementary spectrum bands to support the needs of a diverse subscriber base, consisting of a portfolio of low, mid and high-band spectrum. Low-band spectrum, such as 600 MHz, covers wide areas and penetrates buildings effectively, thus improving coverage in urban and suburban areas. This low-band spectrum will play a vital role in bringing 5G to Canadians and as such, it is an important resource for Canada, as wireless operators build out 5G in rural areas. High-band spectrum, such as mmWave, can deliver up to 100 times faster than 600 MHz spectrum; however, it does not have the same coverage characteristics to penetrate well into buildings or cover wide areas. This high-bandwidth spectrum and the associated faster connection speeds will help unlock new technologies, such as virtual and augmented reality, and provide a fibre-like experience for fixed wireless access. Mid-band spectrum, such as the 3500 MHz and 3800 MHz bands, is important to the 5G ecosystem,\n\nas it balances both speed and coverage characteristics. This spectrum will be integral to low-latency communications services, including autonomous monitoring, fixed wireless access and vehicle-to-everything communication. Trials have shown mid-band spectrum to be key for broader 5G coverage and capacity and is increasingly being used globally for 5G coverage. The 3500 MHz and 3800 MHz spectrum bands are globally recognized as key for 5G networks. All of the national carriers in Canada commenced rolling out their initial 5G services in 2020 and accelerated the roll-out in 2021 and 2022, and are expected to continue in the years ahead as spectrum is auctioned and deployed, along with the roll-out of new 5G technologies. See Section 9.4 Communications industry regulatory developments and proceedings for further details on upcoming spectrum auctions.\n\n## Fixed products and services\n\nThe fixed telecommunications market is expected to remain very competitive in 2023. Technology substitution, including the growth of mobile and voice over IP (VoIP) services, is expected to continue to replace higher-margin legacy voice revenues, while digital streaming services and other online content providers are expected to impact traditional linear TV services. In our incumbent operating areas of B.C. and Alberta, it is estimated that in 2022, 63% of households no longer had a fixed line and 39% of households no longer had a linear TV service. We are a key provider of these substitution services and the decline in this legacy business is continuing as expected, although residential voice losses continued to slow in 2022, reflecting our success in bundling our home solutions and services. Our long-standing growth strategy remains focused on mobile, data and IP-centric fixed capabilities.\n\nThe popularity of viewing TV and on-demand content anywhere, particularly on handheld devices, is expected to continue to grow as customers adopt services that enable them to view content on multiple screens. Streaming media providers continue to enhance OTT and direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming services in order to compete for a share of viewership, as viewing habits and consumer demand evolve. Studies suggest that approximately 80% of Canadians subscribe to, or have access to, paid OTT video service subscriptions in Canada at the end of 2022. The launch of streaming TV services is expected to continue in Canada.\n\nConventional TV content providers are monitoring OTT developments and evolving their content and market strategy to compete with these new offerings. Bell Media offers a content streaming service through its expanded Crave offering. We view OTT as an opportunity to add further capabilities to our linear and on-demand assets, providing customers with flexible options to choose the content they want and encourage greater customer use of our high-speed internet and mobile services and to limit customer frustration at needing to have a multitude of subscriptions, and continue to partner with and offer services from a wide range of OTT providers. With our launch of Stream+, customers can enjoy their favourite shows and movies in the comfort of their home or while on-the-go, powered by our award-winning mobile network.\n\nConsistent with facilities-based competition, telecommunications companies continue to make significant capital investments in broadband networks, with a focus on FTTP to maintain and enhance their ability to support enhanced IP-based services and higher broadband speeds. Cable-TV companies continue to evolve their cable networks with DOCSIS-related bandwidth enhancements and node splitting. Although this platform increases speed in the near term and is cost-efficient,",

        "page_content": "it does not offer the same advanced capabilities as FTTP over the longer term, such as fast symmetrical upload and download speeds. At the end of 2022, our fibre-optic infrastructure was available to approximately 3.0 million homes and businesses. Advances in LTE mobile technology and our extensive LTE infrastructure also allow us to target otherwise underserved areas with a fixed mobile solution, and 5G is expected to enhance these capabilities.\n\nOur broadband investments, including the build-out of our FTTP broadband network and our premium differentiated IP-based Optik TV service, as well as lower-cost Pik TV service, home security and automation and integrated bundled service offerings, which also encompass mobility, consumer healthcare and cybersecurity, continue to enhance our competitive position relative to our competitors. Our bundled offerings drive higher product intensity with our customers and lead to improved customer loyalty results.\n\nIn the business market (enterprise and small and medium-sized businesses, or SMB), the convergence of IT and telecommunications, facilitated by the ubiquity of IP, continues to shape the competitive environment, with non-traditional providers increasingly blurring the lines of competition and business models. Cable-TV companies continue to make investments to better compete in the highly contested SMB space. Telecommunications companies like TELUS are providing network-centric managed applications that leverage their significant FTTP investments, while IT service providers are bundling network connectivity with their proprietary software as service offerings. The pandemic continued to negatively impact our SMB customer base in 2022, although to a lesser extent than in 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe development of IP-based platforms providing combined IP voice, data and video solutions creates potential cost efficiencies that compensate, in part, for the loss of margins resulting from the migration from legacy to IP-based services. New opportunities exist for integrated solutions, as well as business process and IT outsourcing, that could have a greater business impact than legacy telecommunications services. Data security represents both a challenge and an opportunity for TELUS to provide customers with our data security solutions. Increasingly, businesses are looking to partner with their communications service provider to address their business goals and challenges, and to tailor cloud-based solutions for their needs that leverage telecommunications in ways not imagined a decade ago. Cloud computing is changing service delivery to always-on and everything-as-a-service, and strong growth is expected in this area. We offer Network-as-a-Service capabilities for businesses with the option of an IT network as a service over the internet, mirrored across multiple locations, based on a self-serve platform that reduces deployment cycles and reliance on IT specialists. Our home and business security offerings are powered by our broadband network and integrate the latest smart devices to improve the lives of Canadians.\n\nAs the industry evolves to 5G mobile technologies in the coming years, we expect to be operating on, and providing services over, a more converged network. The lines between fixed access and mobile access will continue to blur, as the way we deliver services to customers - and the way our customers use those services - continues to evolve. As our broadband network continues to expand and 5G is further commercialized in the coming years, we expect to benefit from the flexibility of being able to select the most efficient way to deliver services across our footprint. 5G is also expected to be a solution for fixed wireless access in certain areas within our incumbent footprint.\n\n## TELUS Health\n\nThrough TELUS Health, we are leveraging our position as the leading end-to-end provider of digital health and well-being solutions in Canada and our expanding broadband network technologies such as fibre and 5G to increase access, integration and effectiveness for our innovative health and wellness tools and applications across the primary and preventative care ecosystem in order to continue positioning ourselves for anticipated strong continued growth domestically and internationally. These solutions include virtual care applications, personal health records to empower self-management of healthcare data, electronic drug prescriptions with online insurance validation by the physician, and home health monitoring devices and data capture with caregiver oversight. Operating under TELUS Health Virtual Care, our national, employer-focused virtual care services allow patients 24/7 bilingual and unlimited access to healthcare practitioners for the mental and physical care they need, from anywhere in the country. In September 2022, we significantly expanded TELUS Health's vision of employer-focused healthcare with the acquisition of LifeWorks. This acquisition solidified TELUS Health as a global leader in EFAP and data-driven preventive health, wellness and mental healthcare. Focused on a digital-first but not digital-only model of care, combining with LifeWorks allows us to focus on scale, our global profile, and quality health and well-being outcomes. This acquisition not only reinforces LifeWorks' Canadian and global operations, but also leverages our significant TELUS and TELUS International footprint to enable cross-selling opportunities, extending an enhanced suite of TELUS Health product offerings globally.\n\nIn Canada, our TELUS Health MyCare application is transforming consumer access to healthcare. With innovative AI-powered preventative health app features (available in English and French) such as the Symptom Checker, Monitor and Health Check, users can get information about their health and, if required, speak directly to a licensed physician with the convenience of a smartphone in multiple languages across B.C., Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario. TELUS Health MyCare also has two physical clinics in B.C. and one in Quebec to augment our digital first approach. Together, these virtual care solutions and capabilities are empowering Canadians to better manage their health and get the care and information they need when it is convenient for them - a huge step forward in the evolution of Canada's healthcare system from the current status quo. In 2020, TELUS Health enabled Canadian practitioners to conduct virtual visits with their patients by integrating patient videoconferencing into its electronic medical records (EMR) offering across Canada. This capability has been augmented by the acquisition of InputHealth Systems Inc. and its Collaborative Health Record (CHR) - a cloud-based solution that strengthens the physician-patient relationship with a full suite of tools for collaboration, patient engagement, automation and data optimization. Since the onset of the pandemic, these virtual care solutions have experienced accelerated adoption, easing pressure on the healthcare system, and strong growth in virtual care is expected to continue. Market activities and trends throughout the year have validated TELUS Health's long-standing presence in the healthcare market and assumptions about the business' primary growth areas and path forward, reinforcing our focus on employee health and virtual care. In January 2022, we officially launched TELUS Health Virtual Pharmacy, a patient-focused service designed to improve medication management by ensuring timely delivery of prescriptions direct to a patient's home, providing unlimited access to virtual pharmacist consults, and offering tools to help manage",

See Section 10.3 Regulatory matters .\n\nThe following is a summary of certain significant communications industry regulatory developments and proceedings relevant to our telecommunications business and our industry. This summary is not intended to be a comprehensive legal analysis or description of all of the specific issues described. Although we have indicated those issues for which we do not currently expect the outcome of a development or proceeding to be material to us, there can be no assurance that the expected outcome will occur or that our current assessment of its likely impact on us will be accurate. See Section 10.3 Regulatory matters .\n\n## Radiocommunication licences and spectrum-related matters\n\nISED regulates, among other matters, the allocation and use of radio spectrum in Canada and licenses radio apparatus, frequency bands and/ or radio channels within various frequency bands to service providers and private users. The department also establishes the terms and conditions that may attach to such radio authorizations, including restrictions on licence transfers, coverage obligations, research and development obligations, annual reporting, and obligations concerning mandated roaming and antenna site sharing with competitors.\n\n## Decision on amendments to SRSP-520, Technical requirements for fixed and/or mobile systems, including flexible use broadband systems, in the band 3450-3650 MHz\n\nOn November 18, 2021, ISED issued its decision on amendments to the 3500 MHz technical requirements due to its concern that 5G equipment operating on 3500 MHz spectrum may have the potential to cause interference with radio altimeters on aircraft. The decision included limiting use in areas around major airports and restricting the transmission of energy above the horizon. ISED projected next steps, including a future consultation, should Canadian or global developments and studies merit further changes to the technical rules as they relate to the radio altimeter protection issue. There is a risk that this decision could have a material impact on TELUS depending on how long they remain in application.\n\n## mmWave spectrum auction to support 5G\n\nOn June 5, 2019, ISED released its Decision on Releasing Millimetre Wave Spectrum to Support 5G , repurposing several tranches of mmWave spectrum for mobile use. On June 6, 2022, ISED issued its Consultation on a Policy and Licensing Framework for Spectrum in the 26, 28 and 38 GHz bands, which is the first step in setting the auction framework rules, including competitive measures for these mmWave bands. There is a risk that the auction rules will favour certain carriers over us and impact our ability to acquire an adequate quantity of mmWave spectrum. ISED maintains its projection that the mmWave auction will commence in 2024.\n\n## 3800 MHz spectrum auction to support 5G\n\nThe 3800 MHz spectrum band is seen as an extension to the 3500 MHz band. On May 21, 2021, ISED released its Decision on the Technical and Policy Framework for the 3650-4200 MHz Band and Changes to the Frequency Allocation of the 3500-3650 MHz Band , which will make 250 MHz of spectrum available for auction. The 3800 MHz spec trum will only be cleared and available by March 2025 in urban areas and March 2027 in many rural areas. Certain rural areas (in Northwest Territories, Yukon and Nunavut, and northern parts of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and Newfoundland and Labrador) are still deemed satellite-dependent areas and this spectrum is considered encumbered for mobile use in these areas. On June 30, 2022, ISED released its Decision on a Policy and Licensing Framework for Spectrum in the 3800 MHz Band , which defines the auction rules and conditions of licence for the 3800 MHz band. The auction framework includes a 100 MHz cap across the 3500 MHz and 3800 MHz bands. In 38 of the 172 licence areas, only 50 MHz of unencumbered spectrum is available and the remaining 200 MHz will be encumbered by coexistence with satellite earth stations. The limited amount of unencumbered spectrum may impact our ability to acquire an adequate quantity of 3800 MHz band spectrum in satellite-dependent areas. The deadline for receipt of applications and financial deposits for participation in the 3800 MHz spectrum auction is July 25, 2023. Auction bidding is scheduled to start October 24, 2023.\n\n## Regulatory and federal government reviews\n\nThe CRTC and the federal government have initiated public proceedings to review various matters. A number of key proceedings are discussed below.\n\n## Proposed acquisition of Shaw by Rogers\n\nIn March 2021, Rogers Communications Inc. and Shaw Communications Inc. announced their agreement for Rogers to acquire Shaw. In addition to approval by shareholders of Shaw, the acquisition requires approvals by the Competition Bureau, the CRTC and the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry.\n\nOn March 24, 2022, the CRTC issued a decision approving, with conditions, the transfer to Rogers of effective control of the broadcasting undertakings licensed to Shaw. The Public Interest Advocacy Centre and the National Pensioners Federation petitioned Cabinet to overturn the CRTC approval, but Cabinet dismissed this petition on June 23, 2022.\n\nThe Commissioner of Competition brought an application to the Competition Tribunal to block the transaction. Rogers and Shaw have also announced a transaction to divest Shaw's Freedom Mobile assets to Quebecor and argued the application before the Competition Tribunal on the basis of this divestiture. The Competition Tribunal heard the Commissioner's application in November and December 2022 and on December 31, 2022, the Competition Tribunal dismissed the Commissioner's application. The Commissioner appealed the Tribunal decision, and the appeal was dismissed by the Federal Court of Appeal on January 24, 2023. The Commissioner stated he will not seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nOn October 25, 2022, the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry dismissed the application for approval of the transfer of the Shaw spectrum licences to Rogers, but the Minister has not made",

It remains possible that the Minister could make (or decline to make) other regulatory changes, or impose behavioural remedies, that could materially affect us directly or affect the industry as a whole. It is also possible that this acquisition could trigger further consolidation in the industry. Until all relevant governmental authorities complete their reviews and make a determination on whether to allow the acquisition and, if so, under what conditions, it is too early to determine the impact of these reviews on us.\n\n## Review of mobile wireless services\n\nOn April 15, 2021, the CRTC released its decision in the Wireless Regulatory Framework Review . The CRTC determined that Bell, Rogers, TELUS and SaskTel must provide wholesale mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) access to facilities-based regional wireless providers in areas where those providers hold a mobile wireless spectrum licence. MVNO access is based on commercially negotiated rates and will be phased out after seven years. On October 25, 2022, the CRTC released Telecom Decision CRTC 2022-288, where it made determinations on the draft terms and conditions of the MVNO tariffs of Bell, Rogers and TELUS, and required the carriers to update their respective tariffs for Commission approval. Bell, Rogers and TELUS are required to have MVNO service operational within 30 days of final Commission tariff approval. Companies desiring MVNO access are entitled to commence negotiations as of the date of the decision and the CRTC expects that the first MVNO agreements are to be completed within 90 days of final tariff approval. We are working to implement the new MVNO and other requirements, including updating our domestic roaming tariff to include the provision of seamless roaming. The impact of this decision on us will be dependent on the commercial rates that are negotiated for MVNO access.\n\nWe were also granted leave to appeal two determinations from this decision to the Federal Court of Appeal: (i) the requirement for the national mobile carriers, including us, to offer seamless roaming as an additional condition under which the existing mandated wholesale roaming service must be offered; and (ii) the ruling that sections 43 and 44 of the Telecommunications  Act do not provide the CRTC with jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes involving mobile wireless transmission facilities. The appeal was heard in December 2022 and remains under reserve. If we are successful on appeal, we anticipate it will be easier for us to deploy our 5G infrastructure, in particular on municipal property.\n\nApplication to seek a review of domestic wholesale roaming rates On May 19, 2022, Bragg Communications Inc., Cogeco Communications Inc., Videotron Ltd., Xplornet Communications Inc. and Xplore Mobile Inc. filed a joint application to the CRTC seeking a review of the tariffed rates currently charged by Rogers, Bell and TELUS for domestic wholesale roaming, claiming that the current rates are no longer just and reasonable. We have filed an answer to this application demonstrating why such a review is not warranted at this time. The impact of this application is dependent upon whether the CRTC decides to undertake a review of mandated roaming rates and to what extent there are any changes for current tariffed rates.\n\n## Wireline wholesale services follow-up\n\nOn July 22, 2015, the CRTC released Review of wholesale wireline services and associated policies , Telecom Regulatory Policy CRTC 2015-326 (TRP 2015-326). The major component of this decision was that the CRTC ordered the introduction of a disaggregated wholesale highspeed access (HSA) service for ISP competitors. This includes access to FTTP facilities.\n\nOn June 11, 2020, the CRTC released Call for comments - Appropriate network configuration for disaggregated wholesale high-speed access services , Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC 2020-187, where it is examining the appropriate network and service configurations for the disaggregated wholesale HSA service regime for all wholesale HSA service providers across the country. This process, which took the place of the previous follow-up proceedings, is now closed. Until the CRTC issues its decision, it is too early to determine the impact of this proceeding on us.\n\n## Draft policy direction to CRTC\n\nOn May 26, 2022, the Governor in Council released a draft policy direction to the CRTC and commenced a consultation to solicit comments from the public. The draft direction would repeal the two existing policy directions, but retain certain elements, including requirements concerning competition, investment and affordability. The draft direction would require the CRTC to take certain steps, including to mandate the provision of aggregated wholesale high-speed internet access until there is sufficient competition to no longer require it, as well as to consider extending the seven-year time period during which users of the CRTC's MVNO mandate are required to build their own facilities. We filed submissions and are awaiting a decision. We are unable to assess the materiality of the draft direction until we see its final form and know whether it will be implemented.\n\n## New draft cybersecurity legislation\n\nOn June 14, 2022, the federal government introduced Bill C-26, An Act respecting cyber security, amending the Telecommunications Act and making consequential amendments to other Acts . The legislation would amend the Telecommunications Act to, among other things, allow the Governor in Council to prohibit telecommunications service providers from using equipment from designated companies in their networks. In practice, this will allow the federal government to ban the use of Huawei and ZTE equipment in our network and impose penalties for non-compliance, and the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry stated that the government intends to use its powers under Bill C-26, if passed, to, among other things, require the removal of existing Huawei and ZTE 5G equipment by June 28, 2024. The legislation would also create a new statute, the Critical Cyber Systems Protection Act (CCSPA). The CCSPA would require designated federally regulated corporations to maintain cybersecurity plans, impose reporting requirements and impose penalties for non-compliance. Bill C-26 received first reading on June 14, 2022. If we are ultimately subject to an order requiring us to remove a significant amount of equipment from our network, the effect could be material.\n\n## Government of Canada request to improve Canadian network resiliency\n\nAs a result of a July 8, 2022 Rogers network outage, on July 11, 2022, the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry held a meeting with representatives of Bell, Eastlink, Rogers, SaskTel, Shaw, Videotron and TELUS to discuss improving the resiliency of networks across Canada.",

        "page_content": "The Minister requested that these carriers enter into a formal agreement to ensure mutual assistance during any future outages, emergency roaming and communications protocols to ensure that the public and authorities are well informed during future network disruptions. A memorandum of understanding (MOU) on these issues was signed by various carriers, including TELUS, with an effective date of September 9, 2022. Among other things, the MOU requires that wireless service providers with overlapping network coverage areas sign reciprocal emergency roaming agreements within nine months of September 9, 2022. The CRTC posed requests for information to Rogers about the outage and the CRTC Chair stated that the CRTC plans to launch proceedings to examine reporting of major outages and measures to enhance network resiliency. ISED is also conducting further steps via the Canadian Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee to examine network resiliency. We will fully participate in all follow-up initiatives as required. It is too early to determine if these initiatives will have a material impact until they are concluded.\n\n## Nova Scotia 911 legislation\n\nIn November 2022, Nova Scotia passed amendments to the Emergency 911 Act and the Emergency Management Act that, among other things, require telecommunications service providers to take certain actions to prevent certain outages, to inform stakeholders, and to refund customers in the case of certain outages. These amendments have received royal assent but have not been proclaimed into force. Most of the obligations of telecommunications service providers are to be set out in regulations, which have yet to be made by the Governor in Council. Until the regulations are made, it is too early to determine the impact of this legislation on us.\n\n## CRTC proceeding regarding potential barriers to the deployment\n\nof broadband-capable networks in underserved areas in Canada On December 10, 2019, the CRTC issued Call for comments regarding potential barriers to the deployment of broadband-capable networks in underserved areas in Canada , Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC 2019-406. In this proceeding, the CRTC sought comment on barriers that service providers and communities face in building new facilities, or interconnecting to or accessing existing facilities, and in extending networks into underserved areas in order to offer universal service objective-level services. The CRTC has specifically identified access to affordable transport services and efficient use of support structures as potential barriers. The record of the proceeding is now closed and we anticipate a decision this year. It is too early to determine the impact of the proceeding on us.\n\n## CRTC proceeding regarding access to poles owned by Canadian carriers\n\nOn October 30, 2020, the CRTC issued Call for comments regarding potential regulatory measures to make access to poles owned by Canadian carriers more efficient , Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC 2020-366. The CRTC commenced the proceeding further to comments in the proceeding initiated by Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC 2019-406 that untimely and costly access to poles owned by Canadian carriers has negative impacts on broadband deployment, particularly in areas with limited or no access to broadband-capable networks. In the most recent proceeding, the CRTC is considering, among other issues, authorization delays, make-ready costs, spare capacity reservations, joint use agreements and the potential for improved dispute resolution. The proceeding is now closed and we are awaiting a decision.\n\nUntil we receive a decision, we are unable to determine the impact of the proceeding on us.\n\n## CRTC review of rate setting for wholesale telecommunications services\n\nOn April 24, 2020, the CRTC issued Call for comments - Review of the approach to rate setting for wholesale telecommunications services , Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC 2020-131. In this proceeding, the CRTC is seeking comment on whether to change its methodology of setting wholesale rates and, if so, how. The CRTC has stated its intent to use the proceeding to establish a more transparent and efficient rate-setting process. It is too early to determine the impact of the proceeding on us.\n\n## CRTC review of deadlines for transition to next-generation 9-1-1 service\n\nOn June 14, 2021, the CRTC issued Telecom Decision CRTC 2021-199, Establishment of new deadlines for Canada's transition to next-generation 9-1-1 (NG9-1-1), where the CRTC stipulated revised implementation for NG9-1-1 service in Canada. The CRTC directed NG9-1-1 network providers, including us, to establish their NG9-1-1 networks, complete all NG9-1-1 production onboarding activities, and be ready to provide NG9-1-1 voice service by transiting live NG9-1-1 traffic, wherever public safety answering points have been established in a particular region, by March 1, 2022. Consistent with this directive, we are now transiting live NG9-1-1 traffic over our NG9-1-1 network, but full implementation of NG9-1-1 in our NG9-1-1 territory is contingent on interconnections with 9-1-1 call centres, and such implementation is dependent upon local government authorities. We continue our work to fully implement NG9-1-1.\n\n## Development of a network-level blocking framework to limit botnet traffic\n\nOn June 23, 2022, the CRTC released Development of a network-level blocking framework to limit botnet traffic and strengthen Canadians' online safety , Compliance and Enforcement and Telecom Decision CRTC 2022-170. The Commission has asked its technical working group, the CRTC Interconnection Steering Committee, to examine the issue and produce a report within nine months about how ISPs can implement network blocking of malicious botnet traffic. Parties will have an opportunity to comment on the report prior to the Commission rendering any further determinations. The outcome is not expected to be material.\n\n## Credit card processing fee tariff application\n\nIn August 2022, we filed a tariff notice seeking approval from the CRTC to levy a process fee for payments made by credit card in respect of non-forborne services. The application pertains only to non-forborne services; CRTC approval is not required to charge credit card processing fees for payments for forborne services (such as wireless services). On December 8, 2022, the CRTC issued Telecom Order CRTC 2022-335 denying our application to introduce the credit card processing fee for rate-regulated services in Alberta and B.C. In its Order, the Commission stated that it objects, on policy grounds, to the charging of a processing fee. Additionally, and although our application to the CRTC was confined to rate-regulated services, the CRTC stated that further regulatory action would be considered if we do not cease charging processing fees or if the practice becomes more widespread in the industry. If further regulatory action is taken, it is possible the CRTC could prevent us from charging credit card processing fees for all telecommunications services, including forborne services, or otherwise constrain pricing flexibility for telecommunications services.",

The Digital Charter Implementation Act, 2022 proposes to enact the Consumer Privacy Protection Act (replacing the existing private sector privacy legislation and implementing new consumer privacy rights, enhanced enforcement powers and a private right of action), the Personal Information and Data Protection Tribunal Act (a new adjudicative body to provide independent oversight on enforcement activities by the regulator) and the Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (a new regulatory regime for the use of AI in the private sector, using a risk-based framework supported by extensive enforcement powers). The bill proposes significant changes to federal privacy legislation in Canada; however, until the bill is passed in its final form, we are unable to determine the materiality of the proposed changes.\n\n## Amendments to Quebec's public and private sector privacy law\n\nOn September 22, 2021, the Quebec National Assembly passed An Act to modernize legislative provisions as regards the protection of personal information , which received assent the same day. Extensive new requirements governing the collection, use and disclosure of the personal information of individuals in Quebec will be phased in over three years. The Act also creates a new enforcement regime with significant criminal fines and administrative monetary penalties for certain infractions and a private right of action with minimum statutory punitive damages. The full impact of the Act is not yet known because some key provisions, such as those relating to AI, have to be further elaborated through government regulations and interpretive guidance from the regulator. The materiality of the change cannot be fully assessed at this time.\n\n## Ontario introduces bill to change handling of personal health information\n\nOn April 14, 2022, the Pandemic and Emergency Preparedness Act, 2022 received royal assent. The Act amends the Personal Health Information Protection Act to empower the government to make regulations specifying the following: acceptable electronic formats for access rights to personal health information (PHI); the circumstances persons or entities may collect, use and disclose PHI; the security requirements; the disclosure requirements; and additional categories of persons or entities, who can collect, use or disclose PHI. The materiality of the change cannot be fully assessed before the regulations are available.\n\n## Proposed subsidy increases for Northwestel\n\nOn November 2, 2020, the CRTC initiated the first phase of a review of its regulatory framework for Northwestel Inc. and the state of telecommunications services in Canada's North in Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC 2020-367. On January 20, 2021, a number of interveners proposed large subsidy increases to Northwestel and other companies providing service in Canada's North. On June 8, 2022, the CRTC released Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC 2022-147 initiating the second phase of this review, leaving open the potential for subsidy increases. On October 24, 2022, the CRTC added three TELUS communities (High Level, Alberta, Atlin, B.C. and Fort St. John, B.C.) to the scope of the proceeding. A decision is unlikely before 2024. The impact of this proceeding is not expected to be material.\n\n## Consultation on amendments to the Competition Act\n\nIn February 2022, ISED announced its intention to undertake a review of the Competition Act , beginning with immediate, targeted amendments to the Act. The targeted amendments received royal assent on June 23, 2022 and included: (i) addition of a new provision to protect workers from agreements between employers that fix wages and restrict job mobility; (ii) addition of a new provision regarding 'drip pricing' to both the civil and criminal prohibition on false or misleading representations; (iii) addition of an expanded list of factors to be considered when assessing the competitive impact of mergers, business practices and competitor collaborations; (iv) amendments to clarify an 'anti-competitive act' for abuse of dominance; (v) amendments to provide access by private parties to the Competition Tribunal if they are directly and substantially affected by the conduct of another party; and (vi) introduction of an anti-avoidance provision to the notifiable transactions provisions of the Competition Act . In November 2022, ISED commenced a consultation seeking input on amendments to the Competition Act . The further consultations were commenced by the issuance of a discussion paper entitled The Future of Competition Policy in Canada in November 2022, soliciting feedback from the public until February 27, 2023. ISED has outlined five areas of focus for the consultation: (i) merger review; (ii) unilateral conduct; (iii) competitor collaborations; (iv) deceptive marketing; and (v) administration and enforcement of the law.\n\n## Broadcasting and content-related issues\n\n## Review of the Telecommunications Act, the Radiocommunication Act and the Broadcasting Act\n\nOn January 29, 2020, the Broadcasting and Telecommunications Legislative Review Panel released its final report entitled Canada's Communications Future: Time to Act . The report contains 97 recommendations to update legislation governing broadcasting, telecommunications and radiocommunication for the Government of Canada to consider. Further to the report, on November 3, 2020, the government introduced Bill C-10 to amend the Broadcasting Act . On June 21, 2021, Senate debate of Bill C-10 was cut short upon the proroguing of Parliament and the calling of the federal election. On February 2, 2022, the government introduced Bill C-11, which is largely the same as its predecessor Bill C-10, that seeks to: bring streaming services that operate over the internet expressly within the scope of the Broadcasting Act ; provide the CRTC with new and expanded regulatory powers to implement a modernized regulatory framework that addresses declining levels of support for Canadian content over the past several years; and provide a more sustainable source of support for Canadian content going forward. Bill C-11 is currently awaiting final approval at the House of Commons, having passed third reading at the Senate in early February 2023. Until Bill C-11 is finalized, and the CRTC provides clarity on how it intends to implement the new legislation, it is too early to determine if it will have a material impact on us.",

        "page_content": "## Review of the Copyright Act and consultations on copyright reform to address specific issues\n\nThe Copyright Act 's last statutorily mandated review was launched in 2017 and resulted in reports from the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology and the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage being presented to the House of Commons in the summer of 2019. The parliamentary review led to further government consultations (described below) launched in 2021 to explore specific issues raised during the review, such as how to modernize the copyright framework for online intermediary liability, AI and IoT. The timeline for potential changes to the Copyright Act is uncertain, although the next statutorily mandated review was supposed to be launched in 2022 and it is unclear whether or how this might impact the timeline for comprehensive copyright reform legislation. In the meantime, the federal government has made smaller changes to the Copyright Act , such as the inclusion in the 2022 budget of proposed amendments to extend the term of copyright by 20 years, which was required to satisfy Canada's obligations under the CanadaUnited States-Mexico Agreement. The policy approach for copyright has traditionally been based on a balance between the rights of copyright owners and user rights, and as a result, the impact of this proceeding is not expected to be material.\n\nOn April 14, 2021, ISED announced the launch of a consultation to modernize the copyright framework for online intermediaries. The consultation builds on the work done in 2018 and 2019 as part of the parliamentary review of the Copyright Act . ISED sought comments on a broad range of issues, including the role of intermediaries in policing online copyright infringement, how to remunerate rights holders for the use of their content on online platforms, and what types of enforcement tools (such as website-blocking orders) should be available against intermediaries. We participated in this consultation and filed joint comments with other ISPs on May 31, 2021. Among other things, the comments advocated for a continuation of existing government policy that provides ISPs with unconditional safe harbour protection for the potentially infringing activities of their customers. It is too early to tell whether this consultation will have a material impact on us.\n\n## Consultation on the government's proposed approach to address harmful content online\n\nOn July 29, 2021, the government launched a consultation on its proposed approach to address harmful content online. The government's proposals largely target social media and content platforms, but a few proposals would also have impacted ISPs. Accordingly, we participated in this consultation and filed joint comments with other ISPs on September 25, 2021. Among other things, the joint comments advocated that the legal framework for addressing harmful online content should not create undue obligations or liability for telecommunications carriers, and that requirements to block access to content online or to provide subscriber information should continue to require judicial orders. In March 2022, the government established an expert advisory group on online safety, with a mandate to provide the Minister of Canadian Heritage with advice on how to design the legislative and regulatory framework to address harmful content online and how to best incorporate the feedback received during the national consultation held from July to September 2021. Following the publication of the group's report, the government conducted further consultations with stakeholder groups regarding the advice it received from the expert advisory group. No timeline has been set for a bill to be tabled and no legislation was proposed in 2022. The impact of this consultation is not expected to be material.\n\nOn July 19, 2021, the government announced a consultation to modernize the copyright framework applicable to AI and IoT. The government's objectives were to support innovation and investment in AI and other digital and emerging technologies, support Canada's cultural industries and preserve the incentive to create and invest provided by the economic rights set out in the Act, and support competition and marketplace needs regarding IoT devices and other software-enabled products. We participated in this consultation and filed joint comments with other ISPs on September 17, 2021. Among other things, the joint comments advocated that no changes should be made to the Copyright Act that would unduly burden or create potential liability risks for ISPs. Similar to the broader Copyright Act review, the impact of this proceeding is not expected to be material.",

Risk oversight and management processes are integral to our risk governance and strategic planning practices.\n\n## Risk governance, oversight and culture\n\nWe maintain strong risk governance and oversight practices, with risk oversight responsibilities outlined in the policy manual for our Board of Directors (Board). Our Board is responsible for ensuring that material risks to our business are identified, and for overseeing the implementation of systems and processes that effectively identify, monitor and manage material risks.\n\nOur risk governance culture starts with clear risk management leadership and transparent communications, supported by our Board and Executive Team. In our approach to risk governance, accountability for the management of risks and reporting of risk information is clearly defined. Training and awareness programs, appropriate resources and risk champions help to ensure that we have the risk management competencies necessary to support effective decision-making across the organization. Ethics are integral to our risk governance culture, and our code of ethics and conduct directs team members to meet the highest standards of integrity in all business decisions and actions.\n\n## Responsibilities for risk management\n\nWe take a multi-level approach to managing risks, sharing responsibility across the organization and recognizing that agile and effective risk management is integral to the achievement of our strategic and operational objectives. The first line of assurance is executive and operating management, and these team members are expected to integrate risk management into core decision-making processes (including strategic planning processes) and day-to-day operations. We have risk management and compliance functions across the organization, in areas that include Finance, Legal, Data and Trust (which includes Privacy), Security and other business operational areas, and these form the second line of assurance. These teams establish policies, provide guidance and expertise, and work collaboratively with management to monitor the design and operation of controls. Internal Audit is the third line of assurance, providing independent assessments of the effectiveness and efficiency of risk management and controls across all areas of our business.\n\n## Risk and control assessment process\n\nEvents within and outside of TELUS present both risks and opportunities. We strive to avoid taking on undue risk and we work to ensure alignment of risks with business strategies, objectives, values and risk tolerances; we also seek to take advantage of opportunities that may emerge and, in so doing, we consider the impacts of our decisions on our many stakeholders. We strive to proactively mitigate our risk\n\nTELUS enterpr/i.ss01se r/i.ss01sk governance and management\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nexposures through performance planning, operational management and risk response strategies, which can include mitigating, transferring, retaining and/or avoiding risks.\n\nWe have in place multi-level enterprise risk and control assessment processes that solicit and incorporate insights from leaders across all areas of TELUS and enable us to track multi-year trends in key and emerging risks and our control environment. A comprehensive annual risk and control assessment is conducted with senior leaders and an annual assessment is completed by Board members to provide perspective on key enterprise risks. Results of the assessments are shared with senior management, our Board and Audit Committee, and inform the development of our risk-focused internal audit program. These risk assessments are also incorporated into our strategic planning, operational risk management and performance management processes. In addition, key enterprise risks are reviewed on a quarterly basis in order to capture and communicate any changes, and detailed risk assessments are conducted for various risk management, strategic and operational initiatives throughout the year.",

The significance of these risks is such that they, alone or in combination, may have material impacts on our operations, results, reputation and brand, as well as the approaches taken by investment analysts when evaluating or valuing TELUS as an investment. These risks and the associated risk mitigation activities are addressed in the following sections.\n\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the spread of the novel coronavirus associated with COVID-19 to be a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and its subsequent effects have impacted our customers, suppliers, our team members and our communities, and have led to changes in our business and operations, including the levels of demand for, and supply of, the products and services that we offer and the channels through which we offer them. While high vaccination rates have enabled the reopening of many areas of the economy, uncertainty remains and is continuing to affect customer behaviour, in addition to the global after-effects of the pandemic, including difficult general economic conditions, such as heightened inflation, an economic downturn\n\nand the likelihood of a recession. Risks and uncertainties that could affect our business results and the market prices of our debt and equity securities, including those of our TELUS International (Cda) Inc. (TELUS International or TI) subsidiary, and that could also be heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic or by any future pandemic or similar event include, but are not limited to, the risks described in Section 10 .\n\nAlthough we believe the measures we take to identify and mitigate risks are reasonable, there can be no expectation or assurance that they will effectively mitigate or fully address the risks described, or that new developments and risk exposures will not materially affect our operations or financial results. Despite our efforts to implement controls in our domestic and international operations, there can be no assurance that these controls will prove to be effective in all instances. Forwardlooking statements in this section and elsewhere in this MD&A are based on the assumption that our risk mitigation and control measures will be effective. See Caution regarding forward-looking statements . We consider our exposure to risk in four categories: strategic, operational, financial and compliance.\n\n## Strategic risks and opportunities\n\nThese strategic risks arise from uncertainties that may affect the nature and focus of our enterprise strategic objectives and our ability to sustain profitable revenue growth.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Potential impact                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Mitigations                                                      | Mitigations                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| We operate in a number of highly regulated industries and   are therefore subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations  domestically and internationally.

        "page_content": "## 10/period.ss013 /R.ss04egu/l.ss08atory matters\n\n## Risk category: Strategic\n\nThe regulatory regime under which we operate, including the laws, regulations, and decisions in regulatory proceedings and court cases, reviews, appeals, policy announcements and other developments, such as those described in Section 9.4 Communications industry regulatory developments and proceedings , imposes conditions on the products and services that we provide and the ways in which we provide them. The regulatory regime sets out, among other matters, rates, terms and conditions for the provision of telecommunications services, licensing of broadcast services, licensing of spectrum and radio apparatus, and restrictions on ownership and control by non-Canadians.\n\nThe allocation and use of spectrum in Canada are governed by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED), which establishes spectrum allocation policies, determines spectrum auction frameworks, issues licences for use and sets radio authorization conditions.\n\nCanadian ownership and control requirements, including restrictions on the ownership of the common shares of TELUS Corporation (Common Shares) by non-Canadians, are imposed by the Canadian Telecommunications Common Carrier Ownership and Control Regulations under the Telecommunications Act (collectively, the Telecommunications Regulations) and the Direction to the CRTC (Ineligibility of Non-Canadians) , as ordered by the Governor in Council pursuant to the Broadcasting Act (the Broadcasting Direction).\n\nWe have multiple businesses that in addition to operating in Canada, also operate in other international jurisdictions, such as our TI subsidiary and our TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods businesses, that must comply with the laws, regulations and decisions in all of the jurisdictions in which they operate. These jurisdictions, as well as the contracts that we enter into (particularly those of our TI subsidiary and our TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods businesses), require us to comply with, or facilitate our customers' and clients' compliance with, numerous complex and sometimes conflicting legal regimes, both domestically and internationally. Recent TELUS acquisitions in the health and agriculture sectors have expanded TELUS' footprint in the international regulatory environment, with more significant exposure to the risks associated with laws and regulations that are complex, proliferating and changing rapidly, at times in conflicting ways. These laws and regulations address a number of aspects of our business operations, including, but not limited to, anti-corruption measures, internal financial control and disclosure obligations, data privacy and protection, standards for wages and hours of work, employment and labour relations, trade protections and restrictions, import and export control, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, data and transaction processing security, payment card industry data security standards, records management, usergenerated content hosted on websites we operate, data residency, corporate governance, anti-trust and competition measures, team member and third-party complaints, telemarketing regulations, telephone consumer regulations, nuisance and fraud call regulations, government affairs and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. Our customers and clients are also located around the world, and the laws and regulations that apply to their business operations include, among others, U.S. federal laws and regulations; state laws on third-party administration services, utilization review services, data privacy and protection telemarketing services; and state laws on debt collection in the United States, collectively enforced by numerous federal and\n\nstate government agencies and attorneys general; as well as similar consumer protection laws in other countries in which our subsidiaries' clients are based. Failure to provide services in a manner that complies with any such requirements could result in breaches of contracts with our subsidiaries' clients. The application of these laws and regulations to our subsidiaries' clients is often unclear, and the laws and regulations of different jurisdictions may at times conflict. The global nature of our operations increases the difficulty of compliance. For example, in many countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is not uncommon to engage in business practices that are prohibited by regulations applicable to us or our subsidiaries' clients, including Canada's Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act and the U .S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act . We cannot provide assurance that the actions of our subsidiaries' clients or their customers will not violate our internal policies or Canadian or U.S. laws. Compliance with these laws and regulations may also be challenged by the shift to remote working arrangements that was initiated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, payment card industry and Health Insurance and Portability and Accountability Act guidance is evolving in light of these global remote working arrangements, giving rise to uncertainty about additional costs and our ability to comply with these evolving standards.\n\nIn Canada, federal and provincial privacy laws are changing, with a trend toward more stringent requirements and greater enforcement powers. The federal government has proposed Bill C-27, which would replace the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act with stricter regulations and significant order-making powers and fines. Bill C-27 also proposes the regulation of artificial intelligence (AI) and data used in association with AI, with significant order-making powers and fines. AI is used extensively in TELUS' operations, products and services. Bill C-27 could increase the risk and burden related to AI use. In September 2021, the province of Quebec passed amendments to the Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector , which will phase in major changes and new regulatory requirements in areas such as notice, consent, data breach notification and the use of automated decision systems over a three-year period. In September 2023, the amendments will put in place a new enforcement regime, which includes substantial fines, administrative monetary penalties and a private right of action with minimum statutory damages. Similarly, British Columbia, Ontario and a number of other provinces are considering privacy reforms that could lead to a more fragmented regulatory landscape in Canada.\n\nWe have acquired a number of businesses and entered into areas in the Canadian health sector that are highly regulated and also expose us to risks related to the quality of care and provision of insured/uninsured services. The operations of our health business are subject to various federal and provincial laws and regulations, as well as policies, guidelines and directives issued by regulatory and administrative bodies, such as medical associations, provincial colleges of physicians and other associations governing the practice of health professionals (the holders of licences and permits to provide healthcare services) that we engage for the delivery of our services. In the case of virtual care, the related laws, regulations, policies, guidelines and directives are evolving and thus are subject to differences in interpretation and application.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nChanges to the regulatory regime under which we operate, including changes to laws and regulations and ownership rules or the enactment of laws or regulations by provinces or municipalities that threaten",

        "page_content": "unitary federal regulatory authority over telecommunications in Canada, could materially and adversely affect our business. These changes may increase our costs, restrict or impede the way we provide our services, limit the range of services we provide, and otherwise cause us to reduce our capital and operational expenditures, including investment in network technologies, and alter customer perceptions of our operations. The further regulation of our broadband, mobile and other operations and any related regulatory decisions could also restrict our ability to compete in the marketplace and limit the return we can expect to achieve on past and future investments in our network. Such changes may not be anticipated or, when they are anticipated, our assessment of their impact on us and our business may not prove to be accurate.\n\nOur ability to provide competitive services, including our ability to enhance our current services and offer new services on a timely basis, is also dependent on our ability to obtain access to new spectrum licences at a reasonable cost as they are made available. The revocation of, or a material limitation on obtaining, spectrum licences could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, including the quality and reliability of our network and service offerings, as well as our financial condition.\n\nGovernment or regulatory actions with respect to certain countries or suppliers may also impact us, and other Canadian telecommunications carriers generally, and may have material non-recurring incremental cost consequences for us.\n\nOverall, compliance with laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions globally may involve significant costs, consume significant time and resources or require changes in our business practices that result in reduced revenue and profitability. We may also face burdensome and expensive governmental investigations or enforcement actions regarding our compliance. Non-compliance could result in fines, damages, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our team members, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, damage to our reputation, restrictions on our ability to process information, allegations by our customers that we have not satisfied our contractual obligations, or other unforeseen consequences. In addition, we are required under various laws to obtain and maintain accreditations, permits and/or licences for the conduct of our business in all jurisdictions in which we have operations and, in some cases, in which our customers receive our services, including the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia. If we do not maintain our accreditations, licences or other qualifications to provide our services, or if we do not adapt to changes in legislation or regulation, we may have to cease operations in the relevant jurisdictions and may not be able to provide services to existing customers or attract new customers. Our failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nIf Bill C-27 becomes law in its current form, it could materially expand prescriptive privacy requirements, significantly raise our risk profile in light of greater enforcement powers, and broaden most of the current transparency requirements and access rights. The availability of implied consent and the ability to use anonymized data may also be reduced. If Bill C-27 does not become law, Canada may lose adequacy with European Union (EU) privacy legislation, adding to the challenges involved with cross-border data transfers between Canada and EU states of personal information related to our customers, employees and suppliers. With respect to AI, the specific impact of C-27 cannot be determined at this time because many of the details are left to the regulation-making process.\n\nBill C-27 is currently in second reading in the House of Commons and is expected to go to a Committee of the House for a detailed study early in 2023. The EU assessment of the adequacy of Canada's privacy law is in its preliminary stages. The Quebec Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector may impact our operations when the next phase of the Act comes into effect in September 2023. The provisions may impact many business processes and documents, imposing new obligations in relation to plain language disclosures and transparency (especially with respect to profiling technologies and automated decision systems and minors' data). We are assessing these impacts and preparing our compliance program.\n\nChanges to the regulatory regimes under which we operate our health business, including enactment of laws, regulations and policies, guidelines or directives issued by regulatory and administrative bodies, such as medical associations, colleges of physicians and other associations governing health professionals, could adversely affect the reputation, brand, financial results and operations of this business. As it relates to our virtual care business, uncertainty regarding regulatory regimes and the anticipated regulatory changes that may be enacted by governments could have adverse effects on our business if they result in the revocation of, or significant limitations on, our ability to provide virtual care services to our customers and charge for the provision of those services.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nSignificant regulatory developments and proceedings involving the Government of Canada and its various agencies, as well as governments and regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, continued through 2022. Certain significant regulatory developments and proceedings relevant to our business and industry are highlighted in Section 9.4 . These include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- /bullet.ss01 A draft policy directive to the CRTC released by the Governor in Council which, if implemented, would require the CRTC to mandate the provision of aggregated wholesale high-speed internet access and to consider extending the seven-year period during which service providers operating under the CRTC's mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) mandate are required to build their own facilities.\n- /bullet.ss01 Bill C-26, introduced by the federal government in 2022, which would prohibit the use by telecommunications service providers of equipment from designated companies in their networks and would require designated federally regulated corporations to maintain a cybersecurity plan.\n- /bullet.ss01 A memorandum of understanding among major Canadian communications service providers to ensure network resiliency in the event of an outage, in response to the nationwide Rogers Communications Inc. (Rogers) outage in July 2022.\n- /bullet.ss01 In February 2022, ISED announced its intention to undertake a review of the Competition Act (the Act), beginning with immediate, targeted amendments to the Act, followed by further consultations to consider broader changes to the Canadian regulatory framework for competition. The targeted amendments received royal assent on June 23, 2022 and included:\n- /bullet.ss01 Addition of a new provision to protect workers from agreements between employers that fix wages and restrict job mobility\n- /bullet.ss01 Addition of a new provision regarding drip pricing to both the civil and criminal prohibition of false or misleading representations\n- /bullet.ss01 Addition of an expanded list of factors to be considered when assessing the competitive impact of mergers, business practices and competitor collaborations",

ISED has outlined five areas of focus for the consultation: (i) merger review; (ii) unilateral conduct; (iii) competitor collaborations; (iv) deceptive marketing; and (v) administration and enforcement of the law.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Developments in Rogers' proposed acquisition of Shaw Communications Inc. (Shaw), including the approval by the CRTC of Rogers' application for transfer of the effective control of Shaw broadcasting licences, and the dismissal of the application by the Commissioner of Competition to prohibit the transaction under the Competition Act .\n- /bullet.ss01 The issuance by ISED of a Policy and Licensing Framework for Spectrum in the 3800 MHz Band . This spectrum band has characteristics similar to 3500 MHz and is well suited to provide capacity and coverage to our 5G network. ISED will auction 250 MHz of spectrum in this band (auction is set to start in October 2023) but current users of the spectrum are not required to vacate the band until 2025 to 2027; further, some of this spectrum band will continue to be encumbered by satellite users in northern parts of Canada beyond 2027 (see 3800 MHz spectrum auction to support 5G in Section 9.4 ).\n- /bullet.ss01 Canadian privacy regulators have shown an increased interest in digital health privacy, secondary marketing and digital tracking (particularly location tracking), as demonstrated by recent investigations of Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), joint statements issued by the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (e.g. Securing Public Trust in Digital Healthcare resolution), and strategic planning and findings (e.g. joint investigation into location tracking by an application used by a Canadian multinational coffeehouse and restaurant chain).\n- /bullet.ss01 Private-sector organizations providing healthcare services are under heightened scrutiny from provincial governments, which raises the risk profile of our business model. Expanding the scope of insured services and adding new limitations or restrictions on the provision of all types of care could limit our ability to provide certain services.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nWe advocate at all levels of government, including: our participation in CRTC and federal government proceedings, studies, reviews and other consultations; representations before provincial and municipal governments pertaining to telecommunications issues; legal proceedings impacting our operations at all levels of the courts; and other relevant inquiries (such as those relating to the exclusive federal jurisdiction over telecommunications), as described in Section 9.4 Communications industry regulatory developments and proceedings . We also work with industry associations to promote a pragmatic and balanced approach to privacy legislation and interpretations by regulators at all levels of government that protects privacy, builds trust and supports innovation.\n\nWe will continue to monitor regulatory developments and may reconsider our investment decisions with a view to generating a necessary return on capital. Our risk mitigation strategies for investment decisions\n\nmay include, but are not limited to, reducing capital and operational expenditures and limiting the size of our workforce.\n\nWe continue to strive to comply with all radio authorization and spectrum licence and renewal conditions, and we plan to participate in future spectrum auctions. We continue to advocate with the federal government for fair spectrum auction rules, so that companies like TELUS can bid on an equal footing with other competitors for spectrum blocks available at auction and can purchase spectrum licences offered for sale by competitors. We also continue to strongly advise that preferential treatment is not required and is not in the best interests of Canadians, especially rural Canadians. It is also not in the best interests of regional carriers, including for 5G services, most notably carriers that are currently part of established, sophisticated and well-financed cable companies.\n\nAs it relates to our health business, we monitor new and amended regulations, policies, guidelines and directives to stay ahead of, and plan for, new and evolving requirements. In addition, we have put in place internal governance to ensure oversight of clinical practice across all healthcare operations, to manage compliance with licensing requirements and contractual agreements and to ensure quality of care. We also advocate with the federal and provincial governments for reasonable regulations, in part by participating in market studies and other consultations. Furthermore, we continue to evaluate the current business model and strategic growth areas for our health business. By focusing on growth in areas such as employee family assistance programs, we are able to achieve growth with no additional exposure to risk due to the nature of the products and services and our delivery model.\n\nThe Canadian Telecommunications Common Carrier Ownership and Control Regulations require us to monitor and control the level of non-Canadian ownership of our Common Shares. These powers have been incorporated into our Articles and extended to ensure compliance under the Broadcasting Act .\n\nWe continue to advocate for amendments to Bill C-27 that will reduce unnecessary burdens on our operations, continue to protect the privacy of Canadians and support a positive finding on its adequacy by the EU in the future. We have implemented best practices and processes, such as our data enablement plan, that will facilitate compliance with privacy law reform, including record-keeping to enable us to demonstrate compliance and due diligence if necessary. With respect to Quebec's Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector , we are working with the Quebec government and the Quebec privacy regulator to promote pragmatic regulation-making and interpretations of the law. In anticipation of the next phase of provisions coming into force in September 2023, we are launching a project to implement compliance with those provisions.\n\n## 10/period.ss014 Compet/i.ss01t/i.ss01ve env/i.ss01ronment\n\n## Risk category: Strategic\n\nAs the telecommunications industry continues to evolve, we have expanded our offerings beyond the delivery of voice and data services for consumer and business customers. We offer services in the areas of security and home automation, next-generation digitally-led customer experiences, healthcare, and agriculture and supply chain optimization, both inside and outside Canada (see Competition overview in Section 4.1 ).

        "page_content": "Mobile markets are characterized by aggressive competition from established participants and regional carriers, with competitors using aggressive promotional offers to attract and retain customers.\n\nIn the consumer market, cable companies and other competitors continue to offer a mix of residential local voice over IP (VoIP), long distance, internet access and, in some cases, mobile services under one bundled and/or discounted monthly rate, along with their existing broadcast or satellite-based TV services. Some competitors own and continue to acquire broadcast content assets, and we continue to source content from them for our services.\n\nIn the business market, incumbent facilities-based competitors continue to compete based on network footprint and reliability, while hyperscalers such as Microsoft (Teams, Skype) and other IP voice/ collaborative service providers such as Zoom emphasize price, flexibility and convenience. These service providers do not invest in, or own, networks or other infrastructure but compete directly with video, voice and messaging services across both the consumer and business market segments.\n\nTI competes with professional services companies that offer consulting services, information technology companies with digital capabilities, AI and data labelling service providers, and contact centre and business process outsourcing companies that are expanding their capabilities to offer higher-margin and higher-growth digital services. In addition, the continued growth and evolution of the digital services offered by TI and the markets in which it operates, will also expose our subsidiary to new and different competitors, many of which may have significantly greater market recognition than TI in the markets it is entering, as well as increased competition from existing competitors that are also expanding their services to include digital capabilities. From time to time, clients of TI that are currently using its services may determine that they can provision these services in-house. As a result, TI faces persistent competitive pressure to offer services in a manner that will be viewed by its clients as better and more cost-effective than the in-house provision of those services.\n\nTELUS Health competes with other providers of virtual and clinical care, electronic medical records (EMR) and pharmacy management products, claims adjudicators, systems integrators and other providers of health services, including those that own a vertically integrated mix of health services delivery, IT solutions and related lines of business, as well as global health services providers. With consumer-facing health products, we compete in the provision of virtual healthcare services (with access to general practitioners, nurse practitioners, mental health therapists and dieticians through virtual consultations), preventative health services and personal emergency response services. Additionally, with the acquisition of LifeWorks, TELUS Health competes with providers of employee family assistance programs.\n\nTELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods is a global data science and digital technology business leveraging technology innovation, ingenuity and AI to optimize agricultural production and global and local food and consumer goods supply chains. While we maintain a broad solution set compared to other agriculture and consumer goods technology providers, we compete with focused software and Internet of Things (IoT) competitors, while also facing competitive pressure from recent investments by select customers in their supply chains and vertical integration.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nOur customers' loyalty and their likelihood to recommend TELUS both depend on our ability to provide a customer experience that meets or\n\nexceeds their expectations, a range of relevant products and services, and reliable state-of-the-art networks.\n\nIntense competition from mobile competitors, telephony, data, IP and IT service providers and VoIP-focused competitors in both the consumer and business markets, along with various promotional offers, inclusive bundles and rate plans, places pressures on average revenue per subscriber per month (ARPU), churn rates and costs of acquisition and retention. In addition, technological substitution and technological advances across all key business and market segments have blurred the boundaries between broadcasting, internet services and telecommunications (see Section 10.5 Technology ).\n\nIf TI is unable to compete successfully against companies that offer similar services, or to offer its clients a compelling alternative to the in-house provision of services, the results could include higher client churn rates, service price reductions, revenue loss, pressures on recruitment and retention of team members, and increased marketing and promotional expenses, as well as lower operating margins, which could have a material adverse effect on its business operations, financial performance, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nWe also face intense competition in the provision of health, agriculture and digital technologies and services from companies that offer similar technologies and services. If we are unable to effectively differentiate our offerings in these sectors, our business operations, financial performance, financial condition and cash flows could experience materially adverse impacts, and we may not achieve the benefits of the significant investments that we have made in acquiring, integrating and growing businesses in these sectors.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nOn March 15, 2021, Shaw and Rogers announced an agreement under which Rogers would purchase all of Shaw's issued and outstanding Class A and Class B shares. See Proposed acquisition of Shaw by Rogers in Section 9.4 for additional details. We welcome innovation-based competition that benefits consumers and business customers, and we have confidence in our competitive advantages, including our diverse offerings of products and services, world-leading networks, differentiated delivery channels, customer service excellence, and the social purpose and culture of our world-class team.\n\nIn October 2022, the CRTC issued determinations on certain proposed terms and conditions of the MVNO mandate previously set out in Telecom Regulatory Policy CRTC 2021-130. For more detail, please see Section 9.4 Communications industry regulatory developments and proceedings . This mandate has significant implications for the wireless competitive landscape, as a number of regional operators meet the related requirements. If one or more regional operator(s) utilizes MVNO access as a means to launch wireless offerings, the competitive landscape and market dynamics could be significantly altered.\n\nIn October 2020, the CRTC approved the application from Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX Starlink) to provide low-earth orbit satellite internet service to rural Canadians. In addition, in August 2021, the Government of Canada announced a $1.44 billion investment in Telesat's low-earth orbit satellite constellation. In November 2022, Starlink introduced data caps in North America in order to address network capacity constraints. Globally, other competitors, such as Amazon (Kuiper) and Boeing, are developing capabilities to provide low-earth orbit internet, but many have yet to receive approval to offer those services in Canada.",

        "page_content": "Canadian cable competitors are licensing next-generation TV platforms while continuing to increase the speed of their internet offerings and extend their roll-out of Wi-Fi services in metropolitan areas. Over-the-top (OTT) services, such as Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, Discovery+, Disney+, Netflix, Crave and YouTube, are also competing for share of viewership, which may accelerate the disconnection of current paid TV services or affect subscriber and revenue growth in our TV and entertainment services.\n\nErosion of our customer base for residential voice service and the decline of higher-margin legacy voice revenues are expected to continue, due to ongoing technological substitution by mobile and VoIP services and other competitive pressures. This decline has been partially offset by growth in demand and/or migration of customers to IP-based platforms.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has driven an accelerated adoption of cloud-based solutions (IP voice, collaboration and network-as-a-service (NaaS) offerings) and expedited the shift from legacy operational solutions to next-generation technologies, as businesses adopted solutions that enable remote working arrangements.\n\nNon-traditional competitors such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft are entering the business market, leveraging their global scale to offer low-cost data storage and cloud computing services. In addition, rapidly evolving technologies, such as software-defined networks (SDNs) and virtualized network functions (VNFs), enable the layering of new services in cloud-centric solutions.\n\nIn the markets in which TI competes, competitors are actively building scale through consolidation and enhancing digital capabilities through niche acquisitions. There has also been a continuous rise in employee attrition and labour rates in 2022, in particular at global IT companies, with demand for skilled talent generally driving higher wages worldwide.\n\nIn the markets in which TELUS Health competes, overall market trends see competitors expanding their product and service offerings with new digital solutions, as well as physical clinic openings, partnerships or acquisitions in order to offer clients comprehensive and integrated wellness solutions. However, we believe that our clinical and digital wellness service offerings give us a position of strength in this competitive landscape.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nOur top corporate priority is putting our customers first and earning industry leadership in their likelihood to recommend. To support these efforts, 50% of our 2022 internal corporate scorecard is weighted to team member engagement and customer experience. To enhance customer experience, we continue to invest in our products and services, system and network reliability, team members, and system and process improvements. Additionally, in our product life cycle management processes, we endeavour to add new and innovative products and services through both research and development and acquisitions, enhance our current services with integrated bundled offers, and invest in customerfocused initiatives that improve transparency and simplicity for our customers, all in order to differentiate ourselves from our competition.\n\nOur 4G network technology covers approximately 99% of Canada's population, which has enabled us to establish and maintain a strong position in smartphone and data device selection and expand roaming access to more than 225 global destinations. To compete effectively across customer markets, we offer a wide range of services through our TELUS, Koodo and Public Mobile brands. Each brand has a unique value proposition and web-based channel (see Our capabilities in Section 4.1 and Our major brands and distribution channels in Section 4.2 ).\n\nTELUS' 5G network has been deployed across most major cities in Canada, covering approximately 83% of Canada's population as at December 31, 2022. As we expand our 5G coverage, we will continue to offer a network that is fast and reliable, built in full compliance with all Health Canada safety guidelines, in order to provide our customers with faster speeds, higher capacity and near-instantaneous responsiveness, while also powering smarter cities and supporting the work of first responders, as well as transforming key verticals such as healthcare and agriculture (see Our technology, systems and properties in Section 4.2 ).\n\nWe are continuing to make significant investments in our broadband infrastructure, including connecting more homes and businesses directly to our fibre-optic network and migrating customers from copper-based to fibre-optic services. At December 31, 2022, approximately 3.0 million households and businesses in B.C., Alberta and Eastern Quebec were connected with fibre-optic cable, which provides these premises with immediate access to our fibre-optic infrastructure. This is up from more than 2.7 million households and businesses at December 31, 2021. Our broadband investments extend the reach and functionality of our IP TV services and business and healthcare solutions, and are also enabling a more efficient and timely evolution to a converged 5G network (see Our technology, systems and properties in Section 4.2 ).\n\nOur IP TV and OTT multimedia initiatives support the next generation of IP TV and, importantly, tie our OTT environment to a single platform, which allows us to be agile in the delivery of OTT services, such as Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, Discovery+, Disney+, Netflix, Crave and YouTube, while also reinforcing our leadership position in Western Canada in the provision of high-definition linear channels, video-on-demand services and ultra-high definition 4K HDR content. Our strategy is to aggregate and integrate content and applications and make them accessible for our customers' enjoyment, on a timely basis across multiple devices. We have demonstrated that it is not necessary to own content in order to make it accessible to customers on an economically attractive basis, provided there is timely and strict enforcement of the CRTC's regulatory safeguards. In addition, as more OTT service providers launch new services and offer higher-resolution video over the internet, we continue to make investments in our network. As at December 31, 2022, TELUS PureFibre was still the leader in Canada in the Netflix internet service provider (ISP) Speed Index, a measure of prime-time Netflix performance delivered by a specific group of ISPs around the world, as well as being ranked as the fastest ISP in Canada among major ISPs by U.S.-based PCMag. In 2022, our mobile network was recognized for its coverage, speed, quality or experience by major independent awards providers Opensignal, Ookla and Tutela. In January 2022, we were recognized by Ookla as the operator of the fastest mobile network in North America.\n\nOur SmartHome Security and Secure Business solutions offerings leverage our infrastructure investments and our proven customer experience capabilities to enhance our suite of services with video surveillance and analytics, home and business automation and related safety and security monitoring. These services leverage smartphone applications and our leading PureFibre and wireless networks, while also generating multi-service bundling and retention profiles and opportunities.\n\nWe continue to add to our capabilities in the business market through product development, acquisitions and partnerships and investments in SD-WAN, unified communications, IoT and digital services. We created GoCo, an organization that quickly became one of Canada's leading providers of some of the market's fastest-growing solutions, such as SD-WAN and unified communications. In early 2022, we acquired",

To quickly capture, evaluate and adapt to customer feedback on a global scale, we have built a team with expertise in advanced analytics, AI, machine learning and data management, together with leading digital technologies. We have also built an agile delivery model on a global scale, with substantially all of our delivery locations connected through a carrier-grade infrastructure backed by cloud-based technologies, enabling globally distributed and virtualized teams. However, our primary competitive differentiator is our unique workplace culture, which makes people and a shared set of values a priority in everything we do. We continue to build on this culture of care, ensuring the full engagement of the individuals we choose to join our team - and the clients we choose to work with - as we build and run our business. TI's focus includes organic growth, accelerating digital adoption for all solutions and service offerings, with an emphasis on collaborative innovation. We also continue to consider inorganic mergers and acquisitions, such as our acquisition of WillowTree, as described in Section 10.9 , in executing our growth strategy, adding scale and digital capabilities. In the current evolving labour market, the ability to attract and retain talent is key to operational success at TI. We continue to adapt our models and practices by assessing the regional conditions of the markets we operate in, and by offering proactive compensation and talent programs.\n\nTELUS Health has continued to leverage our systems, proprietary solutions and third-party solutions to extend our growing footprint in healthcare and capture the benefits of investments in health and wellness by governments and employers. Through the acquisition and integration of LifeWorks, the launch of new services and the ongoing enhancement of our portfolio of clinical and digital health offerings, we are entering new markets and further differentiating ourselves from our competitors.\n\nTELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods was launched to help companies improve the reliability of their supply chains, protect their brands and drive efficiency and profitability. As one of the few service providers with a perspective that spans the complete value chain, we expect to be able to differentiate our offerings from those of more narrowly focused competitors.\n\nWe continue to execute our disciplined long-term strategy of investing in our growth areas and delivering on our customers first priority. We intend to continue to market and distribute innovative and differentiated services; offer bundled services across our consumer and business portfolios; invest in our extensive network and systems to support customer service; evolve technologies; invest in our distribution channels, including our digital capabilities; and acquire the use of spectrum to support the development of our service offerings and the expansion of our subscriber base, as well as to address the accelerating growth in demand for data.\n\n## 10/period.ss015 Techno/l.ss08ogy\n\n## Risk category: Strategic\n\nWe are a technology-enabled company and we maintain short-term and long-term strategies to optimize our selection, costs and use of technology, minimize risks and uncertainties and diversify our product and service offerings. Our 5G technology, 4G LTE technology, LTE advanced\n\n(LTE-A) and TELUS PureFibre infrastructure are foundational to our future growth (see Our technology, systems and properties in Section 4.2 ).\n\nAny acceleration of a paradigm shift involving customer adoption of alternative technologies, such as video and voice OTT offerings (e.g. Netflix and FaceTime), IP voice and collaboration services, NaaS, and increasingly available Wi-Fi networks, could negatively affect our revenue streams. For example, Wi-Fi networks are now used to deliver entertainment services to customers outside the home, while OTT content providers are competing for a share of entertainment viewership. OTT technology may also impact the business environment by enabling capabilities that in the past were associated with telecommunications service providers (e.g. cloud-based services and roaming). The proliferation of low-power wide-area (LPWA) IoT networks and services also presents challenges arising from low bandwidth usage, which may put additional pressure on our revenue streams. In addition, we are constantly focused on advances in cybersecurity, in order to identify any opportunities they may offer.\n\nOur open radio access network (ORAN) deployments, combined with core network and cloud-based initiatives, demonstrate our strategic intent to remain at the forefront of 5G network innovation, as well as driving long-term total cost-of-ownership benefits. The risks involved in new ORAN technology deployment are being mitigated by leveraging key strategic partnerships and by recruiting leading subject-matter experts to our development and support roles.\n\nThrough TI, we are a digital customer experience innovator that designs, builds and delivers high-tech, high-touch next-generation solutions, including AI and content moderation.\n\nThrough TELUS Health's services, we are a leading global provider of total health and well-being services capable of delivering physical, mental and financial health solutions, including, but not limited to, pharmacy management, EMRs, electronic health records, personal health records, clinical information systems, remote patient monitoring, virtual care offerings, online claims settlement management software solutions, and online prescription and renewal services.\n\nOur TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods technology solutions meaningfully impact primary production and sustainability across the food value chain, providing value chain participants with powerful solutions that leverage advanced data systems and AI to streamline operations, improve food traceability, and provide consumers with fresher and healthier food.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nOur mobile business depends on deploying technology and maintaining sufficient access to spectrum to support the delivery of our services. Rising data traffic levels and the rapid pace of data device innovation present challenges to providing adequate capacity and maintaining high service levels with competitive cost structures.\n\nOur growth and profitability and the diversity of our revenue sources will depend on our ability to develop and deploy new technologies that help us expand our existing offerings, as well as proactively identifying new revenue streams and improving cost efficiencies in our operations, all while meeting rapidly evolving customer expectations. We may not always be successful in anticipating or responding to our customers' expectations and interests when we adopt evolving technology solutions and integrate these solutions into our offerings, and we may not achieve the intended enhancements or cost reductions in our operations. New services and technologies offered by our competitors may make our service offerings uncompetitive. Failure to innovate, maintain",

Our ongoing investments in 4G LTE technology, including LTE-A technology and new 5G capabilities, allow us to manage new demands for data capacity by more effectively utilizing our spectrum holdings. The evolution to 5G technologies is supported by our investments in our core network, IP network and IP/fibre back-haul to cell sites, including our small-cell infrastructure, as well as our softwareupgradeable radio infrastructure. The 5G expansion is expected to further increase network capacity and speed, reduce delivery costs per megabyte, deliver a superior subscriber experience, and enable innovative new applications for consumers and businesses.\n\nMobile network infrastructure investments will increasingly be directed to systems based on network function virtualization (NFV), which offers greater capacity for computing and storage, higher levels of resiliency and more flexible software design. Our large-scale move to national, geographically distributed private cloud-based facilities that use commercial off-the-shelf computing and storage solutions enables the deployment of broad-scale NFV and SDN technologies. This will allow us to virtualize much of our infrastructure and will also facilitate a common control plane for coordination of our virtualized and non-virtualized network assets. The architecture of our intelligence and content capabilities is located at the edge of our network infrastructure, close to our customers. The distributed smaller-scale computing power and storage deliver services faster while accommodating the need to continually scale the IP/fibre core network infrastructure.\n\nRapid growth of data volumes requires efficient utilization of all our spectrum licences. We have deployed our 4G spectrum holdings expansively, and we began operationalizing our 5G spectrum in 2020, including spectrum in the 600 MHz band. Further, we continue to operationalize our 3500 MHz spectrum holdings and as at December 31, 2022, our 3500 MHz footprint covered 39% of Canada's population. The spectrum licences previously used to support our CDMA access technology have been repurposed for use with LTE and 5G technologies. Our deployment of small-cell technology is helping us achieve a more efficient utilization of our spectrum holdings and mitigate any potential speed and capacity disadvantages created by 3500 MHz availability.\n\nBy leveraging our Wi-Fi service, combined with seamless global IoT connectivity across more than 200 countries and networks, we continue to grow our IoT portfolio, with a focus on expanding our offerings with a wide variety of solutions such as GEOTrac and TELUS Alert and Assist. We are also capitalizing on advanced self-learning technologies and automation (e.g. AI and robotic process automation), which will change the way we manage our operations and support customer experience innovation, as well as presenting new revenue opportunities. In addition, we are maintaining a constant focus on cybersecurity solutions,\n\nrecognizing that cybersecurity, as an ecosystem of technologies and processes working together, may provide greater visibility of risks and guide better security decisions for organizations across Canada.\n\nOngoing investments in fibre to the premises (FTTP), along with decommissioning copper within our fibre footprint, should support the further evolution of IP-based telephony, and as those services evolve, we will continue to assess opportunities to consolidate separate technologies within a single voice service environment. The overall convergence of mobile and fixed services provides opportunities for cost savings and for the rapid development and deployment of new and advanced services. To support this convergence within a common IP-based application environment, we are leveraging modular architectures, lab investments and employee trials. We are partnering with system integrators where appropriate, purchasing hardware that is common to most other North American IP-based technology deployments and introducing virtualization technologies, where feasible. We are also active in a number of standard-setting bodies, such as the Metro Ethernet Forum, in order to advocate for a new IP infrastructure strategy that leverages standards-based functionality, which could allow us to further simplify our network.\n\nWe continue to focus on growing our product and service portfolios in health and agriculture and supply chain technology in sectors where TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods have leading market positions, a robust brand profile and superior product technologies.\n\n## 10/period.ss016 Secur/i.ss01ty and data protect/i.ss01on\n\n## Risk category: Operational\n\nAs a national provider of information and communications services, we have a perspective extending beyond that of individual organizations. We leverage this insight and understanding to monitor and identify security-related trends as they evolve across the wider threat landscape. The risks outlined below reflect both our experience and the trends we have observed in the wider ecosystem.\n\nWe have a number of assets that may be exposed to risks involving intentional threats. These include physical assets that may be exposed to terrorist attacks, vandalism and/or theft, including, but not limited to, cellular towers, distributive copper and fibre cable, corporate stores, network and telephone switch centres, and elements of corporate infrastructure.\n\nCyberattacks that penetrate the network security of our data centres, or any unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, the personal information or confidential data of our customers and clients or their end customers, could have a negative impact on our brand and reputation and customer confidence, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, legal liability, as well as our financial performance. TELUS Health operates data centres and collects and manages data on behalf of customers, including sensitive personal health information, that may move across our interconnected operational and business support systems and networks. Personal health information is known to be a prime target for these forms of attack. Breaches involving personal health information may have significant financial implications, while also damaging our reputation and the trust of our customers, with potential impacts on future health outcomes. In addition to data security risk, the use of sensitive personal information by TELUS or TELUS Health may expose us to the risk of non-compliance with the law where unauthorized, or may compromise perceptions of our brand or ethical standards",

There can be no assurance that such measures will function as expected or will be sufficient to protect our network infrastructure against specific attacks, and there can be no assurance that such measures will successfully prevent or mitigate service interruptions or other security-related incidents. All network infrastructure is vulnerable to rapidly evolving cyberattacks, and our user data and corporate systems and security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties (including malicious cyberattacks), team member error, malfeasance, internal bad actors, a combination of these, or other circumstances. A breach may allow an unauthorized party to obtain access to or exfiltrate our data or the data of our customers or clients. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce team members, users, customers or clients to install malicious software, disclose sensitive information or access credentials, or take other actions that may provide access to our data or the data of our users, customers or clients. Because networking and computing environments are increasing in complexity and the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, become more sophisticated over time, or may be designed to remain dormant until a predetermined event and thus may not be identified until deployed against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or put in place adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security measures occurs (or a breach of the security measures of a third-party vendor, customer or client that can be attributed to our failure or is perceived to be our fault), the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users, customers and clients. Security breaches also expose us to risk involving loss of information, class action or other litigation brought both by customers and clients and by individuals whose information may have been compromised; or to risk involving remediation costs, increased costs for security measures, loss of revenue, damage to our reputation, and potential liability.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nPhysical security threats can expose both our team members and our infrastructure, systems and networks to the risk of incurring significant harm, which could include personal injury, destruction of property and loss of service and/or data.\n\nAlong with the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, we and our partners may also be subject to software, equipment or other system malfunctions that could result in unauthorized access to, or change, loss or destruction of, our data. These malfunctions could compromise the privacy of individuals, including our customers, team members and suppliers, and could expose other sensitive information.\n\nA successful disruption of our systems, networks and infrastructure, or those of third parties, including our suppliers, vendors and partners, may prevent us from providing reliable service, impact the operations of our networks, or lead to the unauthorized interception, destruction,\n\nuse or dissemination of our information or our customers' information. Such disruption, whether physical or digital, or unauthorized access to our data could cause us to lose customers or revenue, incur expenses or experience reputational and goodwill damages. Additionally, such damages could result in us incurring costs arising from investigation efforts, replacement or restoration of assets and potential civil lawsuits or fines imposed by regulatory bodies.\n\nWhile we believe our team members receive appropriate training, if any person, including any of our team members, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches controls or procedures with which we are required to comply in relation to a customer's data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, or if unauthorized access to or disclosure of data in our possession or control occurs, we could be subject to significant liability to our customers, the clients of our TI subsidiary, or the customers of those clients for breaching contractual confidentiality and security provisions or for permitting access to personal information protected by privacy laws, as well as liability and penalties in connection with any violation of applicable privacy laws or criminal prosecution. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer, client or team member data, whether through breach of computer systems, systems failure, team member negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or otherwise, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers and clients and result in liability to individuals whose personal information has been compromised.\n\nSimilarly, unauthorized access to our information systems and networks, or those we develop or manage for our customers and clients, whether by our team members or third parties, could result in negative publicity, damage to our reputation, loss of customers, clients or business, class action or other litigation, costly regulatory investigations and other potential liability.\n\nOur operations, including TELUS Health (through the acquisition of LifeWorks) and TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods, increasingly take place in a variety of international jurisdictions. Global business activities are associated with a more complex regulatory privacy environment and an elevated exposure to compliance risk. The European Union has comprehensive data governance laws with significant enforcement powers, such as penalties based on a percentage of gross global revenues. For example, non-compliance with the European Union General Data Protection Regulation could result in a fine of up to 4% of TELUS' annual global revenues and orders requiring us to stop processing certain personal data. Other jurisdictions in which we operate may also involve exposure to different regulatory and liability risks related to data security issues, such as data breaches. Shifting social perceptions also increase brand risk, as customer expectations around data handling practices and transparency are heightened.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nMajor trends evident in the cybersecurity threat landscape in 2022 included ongoing use of ransomware and supply chain attacks, as well as emerging threats such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict (which resulted in a heightened global state of alert for security organizations) and other geopolitical developments. Supply chain attacks continue to be attractive to cybercriminals, since they can have a significant impact on downstream organizations, which adds to the pressure on the primary target and could permit cybercriminals to apply that pressure against the downstream organizations and make further demands.\n\nWith our perspective and our monitoring capabilities, we have observed that the frequency and sophistication of cyberattacks continue",

These processes are supported by a growing network of trained business data stewards deployed across our operating units. The business data stewards provide more informed practical insight and monitoring for data governance.\n\nIncident response is also a critical component of control within our organization. Our technical capabilities help us identify security-related events, respond to potential threats and adjust our security posture appropriately. Additionally, our approach to cyber-hygiene includes regular vulnerability assessments and the prioritization and remediation of any identified exposure through patching or other mechanisms.\n\nOur security office also works with law enforcement and other agencies to address ongoing threats and disruptions, and provides awareness training to our team members to help them better recognize and report threats.\n\n## 10/period.ss017 Our env/i.ss01ronment\n\n## Risk category: Operational\n\nOur operations, infrastructure and team members are exposed to climate-related physical risks, which include extreme weather events and other natural hazards. We may also be exposed to transition risks related to climate change, such as the impact of changes in policy or the deployment of lower-emission technology.\n\nOur data and voice communications infrastructure, including TI delivery locations in Asia Pacific, Europe and the Americas, may be damaged or disrupted as a result of natural disasters or extreme weather events, including those resulting from or exacerbated by climate change, such as earthquakes, floods, volcano eruptions, heavy rains, winter storms, extreme heat waves, tsunamis and cyclones; epidemics or pandemics; technical disruptions and infrastructure breakdowns, including damage to, or interruption of, electrical grids, transportation systems, communication systems or telecommunication cables; issues with information technology systems and networks, including hardware malfunctions, software vulnerabilities and electronic viruses or other malicious code; accidents and other events, such as fires, floods and failures of fire suppression and detection, heating, ventilation or air conditioning systems; or other events, such as protests, riots, labour unrest, security threats and terrorist attacks. Any of these events may lead to the disruption of information systems and telecommunications services for sustained periods, cause delays and inefficiencies in providing services to clients and potentially result in the closure of our operating sites. They also may make it difficult or impossible for team members to travel to, or work in, our business locations. Some locations may not be well-suited to work-from-home approaches to providing client services due to connectivity, infrastructure or other issues.\n\nCertain areas of our operations are subject to environmental\n\nconsiderations, such as the construction of telecommunications infrastructure, handling and disposing of waste, electronic waste or other residual materials, managing our water use, and responding to spills and releases. The pace at which we can reduce emissions of greenhouse gas (GHG) depends on a variety of factors that can change over time. Our most significant sources of scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions include, but are not limited to, direct energy and indirect energy for use at our owned and leased real estate properties in Canada, cell tower sites and vehicle fleets, as well as remote generator fuel, which is within our operational control but subject to other risks. Some areas of our operations are also subject to evolving and increasingly stringent federal, provincial and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations impose requirements with respect to matters such as the release of certain substances into the environment, corrective and remedial action concerning such releases, protection of sensitive ecosystems and associated wildlife habitat, and the proper handling and management of certain substances, including wastes.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nEvolving public expectations and increasingly stringent laws and regulations could result in increased costs of compliance, while failure to recognize and adequately respond to them could lead to penalties,",

        "page_content": "regulatory scrutiny or damage to our reputation and brand. We may not be able to achieve our targets and objectives with respect to reducing GHG emissions, which may lead to adverse publicity and damage to our reputation. As it relates to our sustainability-linked bonds issued through 2022, failure to achieve our sustainability performance target - a reduction of 46% in our absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2030 from a base year of 2019 - would trigger higher interest payments associated with these bonds through an interest rate step-up.\n\nDamage or destruction that interrupts our provision of services could adversely affect our reputation and our relationships with our customers and clients, and could also cause us to incur additional expenditures to repair or replace damaged equipment or sites. Our resiliency provisions and disaster recovery plans may not be sufficient to support continuity and reliability of service during disruptions or reduce the duration and impact of service outages. While we currently have commercial liability insurance, our insurance coverage may be insufficient or may not provide coverage at all for certain events. Furthermore, we may be unable to secure such insurance coverage at premiums acceptable to us in the future, or such insurance may become unavailable. Prolonged disruption of our services could also entitle our customers and clients to terminate their contracts with us or require us to pay penalties or damages. Any of the above factors may materially adversely affect our business operations, financial performance, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nAlong with the continued and widely shared concerns about climaterelated and other environmental impacts on our business operations, there are growing expectations and evolving global regulatory regimes for the disclosure of environmental and sustainability governance, strategies, metrics and targets, and risk management practices, including climate-related scenario analysis. In its 2022 Status Report, the TCFD stated that the number of organizations expressing support for TCFD had grown to more than 3,800 globally, with many companies having begun to implement TCFD recommendations. Our disclosure aligning with these recommendations can be found in our 2022 AIF.\n\nPotential impacts associated with low levels of non-ionizing radio frequency (RF) emissions from mobile phones and cell towers continue to be a matter of public concern, and will remain a public concern as we deploy 5G technology, with the number of small cells in our infrastructure expected to increase as we continue to upgrade our network.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nWe have in place widely recognized and award-winning business continuity and disaster recovery programs that encompass provisions for monitoring and preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery. These programs enhance the safety of our team members, minimize the potential impact of threats to our facilities, infrastructure and business operations, support the maintenance of service to our customers and help keep our communities connected.\n\nOur EMOC continued to meet periodically to coordinate strategic management of the pandemic and advise on tactical issues such as door-to-door activities, safety measures at our retail locations, and technician safety in the field. COVID-19 case counts are closely monitored so that we can align our operations with public health measures within individual public health agency jurisdictions. These actions are likely to continue in 2023.\n\nThe Corporate Business Continuity Office convened the EMOC to manage the impacts of three events in 2022: COVID-19, the Russian\n\ninvasion of Ukraine, and Hurricane Fiona. Several other weather-related incidents, such as flooding and wildfires, required enhanced monitoring and coordination, but they were successfully managed by specialized operational teams without the need for an EMOC activation.\n\nWe have established an enterprise-wide proactive climate change event preparedness program. This forward-looking program is intended to bolster our network infrastructure and ensure operational resilience in response to the risks and vulnerabilities associated with events that may be driven by climate change. Specific initiatives include structural mitigation, vegetation management, dynamic risk forecast mapping and evolving network build standards that address a rapidly changing climatic environment. This is an ongoing effort, with clearly identified objectives and outcomes that extend several years into the future.\n\nWe continue to move forward on a number of projects and programs to reduce energy use - the primary source of our GHG emissions such as lighting retrofits and network equipment upgrades, along with longer-term initiatives such as our vehicle fleet electrification program, which includes a fit-for-purpose component.\n\nWe are committed to following sustainable and responsible business practices and making decisions that balance economic growth with social and environmental benefits. We have implemented award-winning sustainability and environmental governance practices and related disclosure. The review and monitoring of our approach to environmental, governance and sustainability matters is the responsibility of the Corporate Governance Committee, acting on behalf of our Board. This includes our strategic plans and objectives, as well as our reporting on exposures to climate-related risks. Our Chief Executive Officer and Executive Team exercise oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities and provide approval of the overall strategic direction of our sustainability programs. Our Sustainability and Environmental Compliance team prepares quarterly reports for the Corporate Governance Committee, as well as other updates for the Board as required, on risks, targets and other key performance metrics related to climate change and the environment.\n\nDisclosure in our sustainability and ESG report and other filings contains information pertaining to the governance and management of climate-related risks and opportunities. We conduct scenario analysis to assess the resilience of our corporate strategy in different climate scenarios. Analyzing and disclosing the outcomes under the various scenarios informs our planning and supports our efforts to help mitigate changes in climate, as new climate-related regulations emerge and new technologies evolve. At the same time, these analyses help us identify new opportunities for our business and inform our stakeholders about our approach to managing the new and emerging risks that accompany these opportunities. In 2022, working with a third party, we undertook a comprehensive qualitative scenario analysis assessment of our business operations (excluding upstream and downstream activities). The analysis combined an assessment of transitional climate risks and opportunities and an assessment of physical climate risks and opportunities. Additionally, we have established corporate targets with respect to operational net carbon neutrality, renewable energy, energy efficiency and waste reduction. Included in these are science-based targets, approved by the Science-based Targets initiative, for our scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions. Related action plans include entering into\n\nmultiple virtual power purchase agreements for renewable energy.\n\nAn ISO 14001:2015 certified environmental management system is in place to identify and control environmental impacts associated with our operations and to support compliance with regulatory requirements. We continue to identify new ways to reduce our environmental impact.",

Additionally, a detailed report of our environmental risk mitigation activities and details with respect to our targets can be found in our sustainability and ESG report at telus.com/sustainability .\n\nCanada's federal government is responsible for establishing safe limits for human exposure to RF electromagnetic fields. We are confident that the mobile handsets and devices we sell, and our cell towers and other associated devices, comply, in all material respects, with all applicable Canadian and U.S. government safety standards. We continue to monitor new published studies, government regulations and public concerns about the health impacts of RF exposure. Stakeholder engagement is also ongoing as part of the regulatory process involved in the installation of new cell towers.\n\n## 10/period.ss018 Operat/i.ss01ona/l.ss08 performance and bus/i.ss01ness comb/i.ss01nat/i.ss01on\n\n## Risk category: Strategic\n\nWe will partner, acquire and divest as necessary to accelerate the implementation of our growth strategy. Through the partnerships and acquisitions we pursue, we may seek opportunities to expand the scope of our existing services, add new customers or enter new markets around the world. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify suitable candidates in the future for partnerships, for strategic transactions at acceptable prices or at all, or be able to complete any such transactions.\n\nAs we implement this strategy, we continue to experience rapid growth. We have significantly expanded our operations into new business sectors and geographic markets, and the number of our team members has grown significantly over the past several years. We expect to develop and improve our internal systems in the locations in which we operate in order to address the anticipated continued growth of our business. We are also continuing to look for delivery locations, service offerings and organizations outside of our current geographic operating regions in order to minimize the risks of operating in a limited number of countries and/or expand our capabilities and customer value propositions. However, we may not be able to effectively manage our infrastructure and team member expansion, establish additional delivery locations or hire skilled team members as and when they are required to meet the ongoing needs of our customers and clients and to maintain our current growth trajectory, and we may not be able to extend or improve our internal systems. We also need to manage cultural differences among our team members, which may heighten our exposure to the risk of employment law claims. Our inability to execute our growth strategy, to ensure the continued adequacy of our current systems or to manage our expansion, capital and other resources effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance, financial condition and cash flows.\n\nA substantial amount of the assets and operations of our TI and TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods businesses are located outside of Canada and the United States. With our recent acquisition of LifeWorks, we are also adding to the number of health assets and operations of TELUS Health outside of Canada. In addition, the business strategies of TI, TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods may involve further expansion or development of their business operations in Europe or in emerging market regions, including Asia-Pacific. Due to the international nature of our business operations, we are exposed to various economic, political and other risks associated with doing business globally.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nBusiness combination transactions add complexity to our corporate structure, product and service offerings, and operational systems and processes. If pre-acquisition due diligence is insufficient or ineffective, our investments may not achieve potential synergies or generate strategic growth.\n\nWe may be unable to successfully identify, complete, integrate and realize the benefits of our current or future acquisitions, or manage the associated risks. Consequently, any acquisition we complete may not result in anticipated or long-term benefits or synergies to us, and we may not be able to develop the acquired business in the manner we anticipated.\n\nAcquisitions involve a number of risks, including diversion of management's attention from operating our business, managing our infrastructure and team member expansion, developing our relationships with customers and seeking new revenue opportunities; failure to retain key personnel of acquired companies; legal risks and liabilities associated with an acquisition or an acquired entity's legacy operations that may be unknown or undisclosed and for which we may not be indemnified fully or at all; failure to integrate an acquisition in a timely manner; and in the case of potential acquisitions, our ability to finance the acquisitions on attractive terms or at all, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance, financial condition and cash flows. Future acquisitions may also require that we incur indebtedness or issue equity securities.\n\nWe could also experience financial or other setbacks if transactions encounter unanticipated problems, including problems related to execution, integration or underperformance relative to prior expectations. Due diligence and post-acquisition activities include the review and alignment of team member cultures, accounting policies, treasury policies, corporate policies such as ethics and privacy policies, team member transfers and moves, information systems integration, optimization of service offerings and the establishment of control over new operations. Such activities may not be conducted efficiently and effectively. Our management may not be able to successfully integrate any future acquired business into our operations and culture on the anticipated timeline or at all, or maintain our standards, controls and policies, which could negatively impact the experience of our customers and clients, the optimization of our service offerings and our control over operations, and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial performance, financial condition and cash flows. Consequently, acquisitions may not produce anticipated or long-term benefits or synergies for us, and we may not be able to develop the acquired business in the manner we anticipated.\n\nThe risks associated with doing business globally and in emerging markets may impede the execution of our strategy by limiting the countries and regions in which we are able to expand. The impacts of these risks may also emerge only after we have begun preparations and made investments to provide services in a new country or region. Our exposure to such risks may cause us to incur additional costs to mitigate the potential impact of these risks on our business. As we continue to operate our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on the nature and extent of any such impacts and our ability to anticipate, respond to and effectively manage these impacts. Finally, international trade and political disputes can adversely affect the operations of multinational corporations like TELUS by limiting or disrupting trade and business activity between countries or regions. For example, we may be required to limit or halt operations, terminate customer or client relationships or forgo profitable opportunities in countries which may, in the future,",

Some TI clients have been targeted by, and may in the future be subject to, such sanctions. Additionally, trade disputes between countries may also lead to unexpected operating difficulties in certain countries, including heightened regulatory scrutiny, greater difficulty transferring funds or negative impacts on currency exchanges. All of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial performance, financial condition and prospects.\n\nGiven the rapid rate of technological change, we may also look to partner and invest in emerging opportunities that may not yet be fully viable and established. These investments may require high levels of initial funding and experience low levels of initial adoption, growth and returns, all of which could impact our financial position in the short term.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nOver the course of 2022, we made a number of acquisitions to support our growth strategy. Please refer to Note 18 of the Consolidated financial statements for more information.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nTo support ongoing investment in leading-edge and innovative technology, we have diversified our approach to allow for varied levels of investment, which we determine based on the relative maturity of a technology in its life cycle, its alignment with our strategy and its linkage with our value proposition. Through TELUS Ventures, we invest in line with our commitment to help develop exciting new technologies with the potential to deliver benefits for our customers, stakeholders and shareholders while minimizing risks. In addition, we continue to engage in partnerships that can conduct research and development of leading-edge innovative technology and services in sectors such as healthcare, agriculture and entertainment.\n\nOver the course of time, we have built a disciplined corporate development and ventures expertise, with due diligence and post-acquisition integration planning rigour, reinforced by a well-defined process and governance approach to evaluating investments and acquisitions. Where a larger-scale business combination is contemplated, our teams follow a well-established and collaborative due-diligence review process, with oversight by our senior leadership and Board. In addition, formal post-acquisition processes are in place to support onboarding and engagement, as well as operational integration with our risk monitoring and management practices.\n\nTELUS Health is currently realigning its organizational priorities to ensure that its business model is customer-facing and its operations focus on customers first. The acquisition of LifeWorks is a catalyst for transformation, and TELUS Health has moved at a rapid pace to build a team committed to its forward-looking strategic objective of becoming a leading global healthcare organization.\n\n## 10/period.ss019 Customer serv/i.ss01ce\n\n## Risk category: Operational\n\nOur customers' loyalty, their likelihood to add to the services they engage us for, and their likelihood to recommend us all depend on our ability to provide a service experience that meets or exceeds their expectations and is differentiated from our competitors. Our service delivery teams focus on operational excellence and efficiency, implementing radical simplification, investing in digitization to enhance the customer experience and becoming best-in-class solution advisors, with the objective of safely\n\nminimizing the effort involved for our customers when they interact with us. Having our TI team members assist with customer-serving activities further strengthens our ability to continue delivering exceptional customer service.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nDelivering sub-optimal experiences when our customers engage with us for the provision of services or support may negatively impact customer satisfaction, our portfolio of brands and our ability to grow our customer base, including customers of our telecom businesses, our digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International (DLCX) segment, TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods. Inadequate or inefficient customer interactions (e.g. order taking, support contact, service delivery, billing accuracy, and network and services reliability) may increase customer dissatisfaction and churn rates. Failure to continue to execute effectively on organizational initiatives, such as our solutions advisor support, digitization and simplification, or our customers first priority, may lead to a deterioration in the customer experience we provide. Any significant or prolonged systems and service disruptions or outages may negatively impact customer satisfaction and our brands.\n\nOur corporate sustainability and social purpose initiatives are an important part of our organizational culture and are key factors in attracting and retaining customers and employees and differentiating us from our competitors. If we are unable to meet or exceed the evolving expectations of our customers in these areas or implement high-quality corporate sustainability and social purpose initiatives on a timely basis, and effectively communicate them to our customers, our reputation may suffer, which may negatively impact our ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers.\n\nOur DLCX business has derived a significant portion of its revenue from a limited number of large clients, and we believe this will continue in the near term. A leading social media company was TI's largest external client in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, and accounted for approximately 15% and 18%, respectively, of its revenue in those periods. Additionally, the volume of work performed for specific clients of TI or the revenue it generates can vary from year to year. Any significant reduction in, or elimination of, the use of the services TI provides as a result of client consolidation or our removal from a key client's provider network would reduce TI's revenue and could negatively affect our business. In addition, such consolidation may encourage clients of TI to apply more pressure on our subsidiary to lower the prices it charges for its solutions.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nChanges in customer expectations and preferences, resulting in part from their experiences throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, have had widespread effects on many areas of service delivery. These include a major acceleration of our transformation into a digital-first organization and the proliferation of self-serve capabilities to help our customers. The related impacts have affected our teams around the world, requiring us to be agile in enabling team members to work with customers virtually through our virtual technician model (VTM) and do-it-yourself (DIY) capabilities.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nContinued simplification and digitization, including our ongoing work on conversational interactive voice response and enhanced call-back capabilities, have improved first-time interaction experiences by reducing the number of call transfers and shortening customer wait times. We continue to enhance the reliability and functionality of our websites and applications, while promoting digital engagement to minimize",

This is in conjunction with our focus on further developing our DIY installation and repair program and our VTM, which will generate further internal cost savings and offer greater choice for our customers. We have also invested in our work-from-home capabilities around the world, including additional virtual private network (VPN) capacity, allowing more than 90% of our global workforce to work from home or from alternative locations for the foreseeable future and serve our customers safely.\n\nOur TI subsidiary was created with an intensive focus on customer service excellence, continuous improvement and a values-driven culture with the strategic objective of better serving a growing portfolio of global clients. Through TI, customer care and business services are delivered from within a unified TELUS-wide culture by a flexible team of over 69,000 team members in 28 countries, minimizing business disruptions. In October 2022, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire WillowTree, and the transaction was completed in early January 2023. WillowTree is a full-service digital product provider focused on end-user experiences, such as native mobile applications and unified web interfaces. The acquisition will enhance the premium front-end design and build capabilities that TI offers to its clients.\n\nThrough TELUS Health, we deliver healthcare technology solutions, health and well-being services, and financial and administration products and services to our customers. TELUS Health's employee assistance programs (EAPs) represent a significant global growth opportunity. We are committed to providing employee and family assistance programs (EFAPs) and mental health and well-being solutions to our customers. We have also introduced a hybrid approach to the implementation of our software solutions to better facilitate the delivery of healthcare services to our customers. Throughout 2022, more than 580 million digital health transactions (service utilization) have been recorded.\n\nAs a social capitalism company, we are committed to making a difference by building stronger, healthier communities and ensuring that the most vulnerable among us are not left behind. Through our Connecting for Good programs, we are making our technology accessible for all. Our Internet for Good program is focused on connecting Canadians in need by providing low-cost high-speed internet access for low-income families and seniors, young people leaving foster care, and people with disabilities. In addition, our Mobility for Good program provides subsidized smartphones and plans for young people leaving foster care, low-income seniors and Indigenous women at risk, helping them stay in touch with loved ones, maintain vital support networks and build new lives. Driven by the generosity and passion of our team members, retirees, family and friends, we volunteered 1.4 million hours globally in 2022, helping build stronger communities. Moreover, with the support of the TELUS Friendly Future Foundation and our 13 Canadian TELUS Community Boards, we are helping improve outcomes for over two million youth each year by directing our support to local charities across Canada. Further, our five TI Community Boards and our new TELUS Community Board in North Carolina ensure we support local charities in all of the communities in which we operate around the world. We believe these initiatives strengthen our customers' loyalty and their likelihood to recommend, and are key factors in differentiating\n\nus from our competitors. Additional information on our sustainability and environmental governance practices and related disclosure is included in Section 10.7 Our environment .\n\nWe continue to be ranked favourably in third-party reports based on customer and network experience. In 2022, we were ranked first in speed and recognized for providing the best video experience, best coverage and consistent quality by OpenSignal, Ookla and Tutela, as well as the best nationwide ISP in Canada for the third year in a row by PCMag. This successful performance was the result of continuing to evolve our coverage across Canada, increasing the accessibility of our network, and working to better understand the emerging network methodologies that can enhance coverage, all of which earned TELUS recognition for providing the best network coverage among our competitors.\n\n## 10/period.ss0110 Our systems and processes\n\n## Risk category: Operational\n\nWe are a key provider of essential telecommunications and security services in Canada. Through TI, we provide digital customer experience services to global brands, and through TELUS Health, we ensure optimal care is made possible by combining the power of technology and data with the provision of market-leading experiences. Within TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods, we leverage technology and data to improve the flow of information across the agricultural, food and consumer goods production industries in Canada and internationally. Our success depends on our ability to deliver reliable and continuous services to all of our customers.\n\nWe have a large number of interconnected operational and business support systems. Acquisitions, business combinations and the development and launch of new services typically require significant systems development and integration efforts. Acquisitions may also expose us to potential cybersecurity, privacy and brand risks. As leading-edge services are introduced, they must work with next-generation systems, frameworks and IT infrastructures, while also being compatible with legacy services and support systems. In addition, our large enterprise deals and the contracts our TI subsidiary enters into with its clients may involve complex and multi-faceted customer-specific enterprise requirements, including customized systems and reporting requirements in support of service delivery.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nOur network, technology, infrastructure, supply chains, team members and operations may be materially impacted by disruptions in the functioning of critical infrastructure due to intentional threats (see Section 10.6 Security and data protection ), labour disruptions (see Section 10.11 Our team ), climate-related risks and natural hazards or unintentional threats (see Section 10.7 Our environment ), health threats (such as epidemics or pandemics), competitive threats and geopolitical pressures. Any of these risks or hazards may lead to the disruption of our ability to deliver services to our customers and may also make it difficult or impossible for team members to travel to, or work in, our business locations. Damage or destruction that interrupts our provision of services could adversely affect our brand and reputation, our relationships with our customers and our leadership team's ability to administer and supervise our business operations, and could also cause us to incur substantial additional expenditures to repair or replace damaged equipment or sites. We may also be liable to our customers for any service disruption resulting from such",

Core expertise and competencies in all areas of our organization are in high demand worldwide and our operations and continued growth depend on our ability to hire, retain and develop highly skilled leaders and key personnel. Any of the above factors may adversely affect our business.\n\nAs the complexity of our systems increases, our system stability and availability may be affected. There can be no assurance that any of our proposed IT systems or process change initiatives will be implemented successfully, that they will be implemented in accordance with anticipated timelines, or that sufficient numbers of skilled team members will be available to complete such initiatives and maintain our competitive position in the marketplace. If we fail to implement and maintain appropriate IT systems on a timely basis, fail to create and maintain an effective governance and operating framework to support the management of our teams, or fail to understand and streamline our significant number of legacy systems and proactively meet constantly evolving business requirements, we could experience an adverse impact on our business and financial performance.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nSimilar to other organizations, we rely on third-party cloud-based computing services to deliver our IT services through either softwareas-a-service (SaaS) or infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) solutions. While this can result in benefits in terms of our speed to market, reliability, performance and agility, it requires adjustments to our operations and may increase the potential for service disruptions. Operational support processes and vendor negotiations must take into account that the delivery of hardware and software services may occur outside of our own infrastructure, and therefore controls need to be incorporated into our operational support processes and tools.\n\nIn addition, we routinely have numerous integration activities, complex system and process change initiatives, and development projects underway.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, we expanded our VPN capacity in order to ensure stability, productivity and security for team members working from home and from alternative locations, and we accelerated the purchase and deployment of a new VPN system, improving connection capacity and reliability while enhancing security measures. For clients of our TI's subsidiary, to the extent possible, we redirected customer volumes away from facilities impacted by local government-mandated temporary site closures to locations that were less affected. We have also equipped the majority of our customer-serving TI team members to provide remote support to clients, as they have done since the onset of the pandemic, and in some cases we have carefully and strategically had team members return to work on-site. In addition, the TI AI Data Solutions (TIAI) business utilizes the services of a crowd-sourced provider base that is geographically dispersed across the globe.\n\nWe have established a next-generation business support systems (BSS)/operational support systems (OSS) framework, based on the telecommunications industry's TeleManagement Forum standards, which separates BSS and OSS from underlying network technologies. This decouples the introduction and ongoing evolution of new network technologies from the provision of customer services, so both can evolve independently, enabling us to optimize network investments while limiting the impact on customer services. For example, we can deploy vendor technologies and SaaS and IaaS capabilities to avoid custom development where possible. We deployed this BSS/OSS framework concurrently with our fibre roll-out and legacy copper migration, and continue to use the framework for our 5G roll-out. As we make significant investments in system resiliency and network reliability in support of our ongoing customers first initiatives, the framework will allow us to advance and extend these systems and networks independently and more rapidly than we have been able to historically.\n\nFor each new large enterprise deal, we look to leverage systems and processes developed for previous contracts while incorporating other elements as required, using a controlled methodology to draft a new custom solution and following standard industry practices for project management and systems support. We have release and change management policies, processes and controls in place that are based on industry best practices. In general, we strive to ensure that system development and process changes are prioritized, and we apply a project management approach to such initiatives that includes appropriate risk identification and contingency planning, scope and change control, and resource and quality management. We conduct reasonable functional, performance and revenue assurance testing, as well as capturing and applying any lessons learned. Where a change involves major system and process conversions, we often shift our business continuity planning and emergency management operations centre to a heightened state of readiness in advance of the change.\n\nConsistent with best practice, we continue to make investments in mitigating risk in older technology, modernizing key platforms and capabilities for greater flexibility and reliability, and securing the benefits and capabilities that cloud-based operations can offer. We continue to make progress in modernizing and improving our systems and critical applications by leveraging proven, state-of-the-art, cloud-based technologies and capabilities. We continue to augment our teams with additional digitization and cloud expertise so they can play a leading role, today and into the future. We are leveraging our 10-year partnership with Google to supplement our in-house expertise and experience as we extend the digitization of our business operations by harnessing the capabilities of Google Cloud Platform, as well as other partners and cloud-based service providers.\n\nWe have adopted a post-acquisition stabilization period for the SmartHome Security and automation line of business in order to thoroughly assess any risks, vulnerabilities and exposures, and consider the mitigation of key risks, before integrating common elements into our core systems and critical applications.\n\nWe conduct ongoing monitoring of our systems and critical applications. Risk-based disaster recovery capabilities are leveraged to help prevent outages and limit impacts on our customers and operations. In addition, enterprise-wide business continuity programs are in place to support monitoring, preparedness, mitigation, response and recovery.",

        "page_content": "## 10/period.ss0111 Our team\n\n## Risk category: Operational\n\nOur success depends on the well-being and engagement of our team members, and their diverse abilities and experiences, as well as our ability to attract, advance and retain the skilled and talented employees upon which our service offerings depend. Each year, we launch a number of unique initiatives that are intended to improve our productivity and competitiveness. These may include acquisitions, operational business integrations, efficiency programs, business process automation and/or outsourcing, offshoring and reorganizations. Since providing support and resources that can help our team members keep themselves physically and mentally healthy is critical for engagement and productivity, our well-being strategy involves an array of programs and initiatives that foster optimal health and well-being for our team.\n\nWe believe that our unique customers first focus and our inclusive and caring culture have contributed to our ability to attract and retain a highly skilled, engaged and motivated workforce, which in turn has driven strong customer and client retention. It may become more difficult for us to maintain a culture that supports our success as we continue to evolve our products and services, enter new geographic areas, open new delivery locations, increase the number of team members and acquire new businesses. If our unique culture is not maintained, our ability to attract and retain highly skilled team members across our core verticals, as well as our customers and clients, may be adversely impacted, and our operational and financial results may be negatively affected.\n\nOur business could also be adversely affected if individuals providing their data annotation services through TIAI's crowdsourcing solutions were classified as employees. The classification of certain individuals who provide their services through third-party digital platforms as independent contractors is currently being challenged by legislators and government agencies in the United States and many other countries in which our TIAI business uses the services of independent contractors. Similarly, some of our healthcare practitioners who are supporting our virtual care business in TELUS Health, as well as some of our engineers who are supporting the development of technology solutions in TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods, may be classified as employees instead of independent contractors by decision-makers in certain jurisdictions. We generally believe that most of those individuals who provide their data annotation services through TIAI's crowdsourcing solutions, those healthcare practitioners who support our virtual care business and those engineers who support the development of technology solutions are independent contractors. Independent contractors can choose whether, when and where to provide services, while data annotation professionals are free to provide services on competitors' platforms, and they use their own equipment. In the case of healthcare practitioners, they are free to provide services in other non-virtual healthcare settings. We may not be successful in defending the independent contractor classification in the jurisdictions in which we operate or such classification is challenged. The costs associated with defending, settling or resolving any future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) that address the independent contractor classification could be material to our business.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nLost work time resulting from team member illness or injury can negatively affect organizational productivity and employee benefit costs. The loss of key team members through short-term and long-term disability (including\n\nabsences resulting from mental health concerns), attrition and retirement, as well as the inability to attract and retain team members with essential or evolving skills, including familiarity with legacy systems, or, in the case of team members leading recent acquisitions in emerging areas of our business, specialized knowledge of such businesses, or any deterioration in overall team member morale and engagement resulting from organizational changes, unresolved collective agreements or ongoing cost reduction initiatives, could have an adverse impact on our growth, business and profitability and our efforts to enhance the customer experience. In addition, changes in technology are shifting the set of skills needed by our team and driving competition for resources among global players.\n\nOur corporate sustainability and social purpose initiatives are also important to our team members, as is our ability to offer resources and services to maintain optimal health and well-being. Our failure to meet or exceed our team members' evolving expectations in these areas could have adverse impacts on our ability to attract and retain team members.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause heightened uncertainty in many of our lives, resulting in higher levels of stress and anxiety and waning resiliency among our team members. Many Canadian workers our team members included - are still working from home, isolated from peers and extended family members and friends, and juggling multiple competing priorities.\n\nGlobal events and ongoing efforts in marginalized communities to achieve equality and social justice have also focused attention on the discrimination and racial injustice that continue to affect many communities.\n\nThe collective agreements related to our three largest bargaining units, covering approximately 7,120 employees, have expired and negotiations to renew these agreements are currently underway. The collective agreement between TELUS and the TWU, USW Local 1944, covering approximately 5,880 employees in customer service, support and technology operations positions, expired on December 31, 2021. Collective bargaining between the parties commenced in October 2021, and continued through to October 2022, when the TWU filed for conciliation and sought the assistance of a federal mediator. While the conciliation process did not result in an agreement, our offer was submitted to employees for a ratification vote in January 2023. The vote, which concluded on January 28, 2023, resulted in the offer being rejected by 65% of TELUS employees who voted. While the union is not in a legal position to initiate a strike as of the date of this MD&A, a work stoppage remains a possibility if an agreement cannot be reached in the future and all other legal pre-conditions are met by the parties.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nOur People and Culture team works to provide an environment for our team members that is safe, empowering and engaging. Our culture is anchored in our TELUS values. Those values have been the cornerstone of our high-performance culture, defining TELUS as both an organization and a team, and guiding our interactions with each other, our customers and communities. In 2021, we reviewed our values to ensure they mirror the evolution of our organization and our transformative journey to build a friendlier future for all. Our evolved values that were launched in 2022 are a direct reflection of feedback from our team members and the spirit of our original values, which have driven our success for over 20 years.",

We achieve this objective by investing in our people throughout their careers, and by offering diverse and inclusive employment prospects and development opportunities.\n\nTo support team members' overall well-being and to achieve a positive effect on absenteeism in the workplace, we take a holistic and proactive approach to health that involves risk prevention, early intervention, team member and family assistance, mental health training, engaging social and educational well-being initiatives, assessment and support services, disability management, and accommodation and return-to-work services. Our well-being strategy aligns with best-in-class frameworks, including the National Standard for Psychological Health and Safety, and encourages our team members to develop optimal personal health across five dimensions of well-being: physical, psychological, financial, social and environmental. To promote safe work practices, we offer training and orientation programs for team members and contractors who have access to our facilities.\n\nHaving teams that are engaged leads to a better team member experience, which in turn drives an improved customer service experience - our customers are more satisfied, resulting in a lower churn rate for our products and services.\n\nThrough our annual Pulsecheck engagement surveys, we continue to assess our team's health and well-being and gather their insights about our work environment, including changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Key highlights included team members confirming their belief that their safety is a priority for their leaders; that their leaders have been providing the support they need during this extraordinary time; and that their work arrangements allow them to collaborate productively to meet the needs of customers. According to Kincentric, our survey provider, TELUS is the most engaged organization globally among organizations of our size and composition.\n\nAt TELUS, we believe that honouring the diversity of our team, customers and communities opens up new perspectives and enables us to connect for good and deliver remarkable outcomes for everyone. In 2022, by focusing on both behavioural and structural changes, as well as confirming our alignment with current best-in-class diversity and inclusion (D&I) practices, we continued to advance our equitable workplace culture and our multi-year D&I evolution strategy.\n\nWe appreciate and celebrate every team member's unique talents, voice and abilities, and we encourage them to always bring their whole selves to work. In 2022, we achieved a score of 85% on our inclusion index, which is an indicator of the strength of our inclusive culture one that values diversity of thought and meaningful input.\n\nWe are working on the implementation of our first five-year Indigenous Reconciliation Action Plan (IRAP), remaining steadfast in our accountability and commitments to Reconciliation. We continue to push for innovation and creativity in responding to the needs of Indigenous communities. Additional information can be found at telus.com/reconciliation .\n\nWe aim to attract and retain key team members through both monetary and non-monetary approaches. Our compensation and benefits program is designed to support our high-performance culture and is both market-driven and performance-based. Where required, we implement\n\ntargeted retention solutions for employees with critical skills or talents that are scarce in the marketplace, and we have a succession planning process in place to identify top talent for senior-level positions.\n\nWe focus on and manage organizational change through a formal business transformation function that leverages the expertise, key learnings and successful practices developed in recent years during the implementation of mergers, business integrations and efficiencyrelated reorganizations.\n\nWe have a post-acquisition integration team that works with our business units and the operations they acquire, applying an integration model based on learnings from previous integrations, while also focusing on the unique attributes and workplace cultures of the acquired companies, which advances the standardization of our business processes and is intended to preserve the unique qualities of each acquired operation.\n\nWith respect to collective bargaining, a governance model is in place to ensure the financial and operational impacts of any collective agreement settlements are assessed, and the outcomes are costeffective, affordable and aligned with our strategic direction. In addition, while a possible work stoppage may lead to reduced productivity and increased costs, extensive business continuity planning has been undertaken over a period of months, resulting in comprehensive emergency operations plans and a high level of readiness for this possibility.\n\nAdditionally, we continuously strive to raise the level of our team members' engagement. We believe that our strong team member engagement continues to be driven by our focus on the customer and team member experience, our success in the marketplace and our social purpose. We plan to continue our focus on other non-monetary factors that are supportive of team member engagement, including performance development, career opportunities, learning and development, recognition, diversity and inclusion, well-being resources and programs, our leading-edge Work Styles program (enabling team members to work where and how they will be most effective and equipping them with robust digital collaboration tools to stay connected), and our community volunteerism, including TELUS Days of Giving.

Our suppliers and vendors may experience business difficulties or privacy and/or security incidents, and may face external challenges, such as epidemics or pandemics, global supply chain shortages or global shipping and port disruptions, as well as government or regulatory pressures. They may restructure their operations, be consolidated with other suppliers, discontinue or cease to provide support or updates for certain products, or sell their operations or products to other vendors. In addition, various suppliers may sell products or services directly to our customers, rather than selling those products and services through us.\n\nIn certain cases, the number of suppliers of a product, service or technology that we use is limited.

        "page_content": "relationship with certain vendors and our future use of their products and services.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nOur agility in the delivery of products and services is directly linked to our ability to engage or replace a supplier or vendor on a timely basis and without incurring additional cost. Reliance on certain manufacturers may strengthen their market power and adversely affect our ability to purchase certain products at an affordable cost. Consequently, the success of upgrades and the evolution of technology that we offer our customers may be impacted, as well as the cost of acquisition or the time required to deploy certain technologies and systems.\n\nThere is no guarantee that our vendor strategies and agreements will not be impacted by operational difficulties or government/regulatory pressures experienced by vendors, or that we will not incur additional costs or delays in continuing to provide services or in deploying our technologies and systems.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nThe continued reduction in air cargo capacity related to the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a rising demand for ocean freight. This has put pressure on the availability of both shipping vessels and ports, as well as domestic road and rail transportation capacities. The widely reported global supply chain shortages have had a notable impact on technology products, beginning with a shortage of silicon wafers and extending to the chipsets and circuit boards that are embedded in almost all of the products that we purchase. These shortages have resulted in both longer lead times and higher costs. While the combined logistical and supply chain challenges have mostly stabilized, the extent to which they will continue to adversely impact our operations and financial performance is uncertain.\n\nAs part of our 5G network upgrade, we have also chosen to replace many of the Huawei products in other layers of our network with enhanced equipment from the suppliers of our 5G network (either Ericsson, Nokia or Samsung). During the transition phase, components removed from the network will be used as replacements, as required on the remaining network, thus ensuring a supply of necessary materials.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nWe value our relationships with our suppliers because they help us achieve our business objectives and contribute to our success. We work closely with key strategic suppliers to ensure appropriate timing in the manufacturing, delivery and warehousing of their products so that our needs will be met regardless of changing conditions. We strive to direct our business to suppliers that have demonstrated a strong commitment to sustainable development by adopting ethical, labour, health and safety, and environmental principles and compliance practices that align with our expectations and support the well-being of their employees, contractors and communities.\n\nIn response to the impact of the pandemic and global supply chain challenges, our supply operations, in collaboration with our product development and marketing teams, have extended future forecasts and increased purchase order quantities to help maintain our fulfilment capabilities in the context of longer lead times. In addition, we continue to seek alternative devices or sources of supply, and where possible, we refurbish equipment in the form of certified pre-owned devices, including smartphones from our Bring-it-Back program and our professional device repair businesses, such as Mobile Klinik and uBreakiFix, to support sustainability.\n\nAs a leading network aggregator, we partner with several network equipment suppliers and work with numerous international and domestic vendors to deliver the best possible experience for our customers across our businesses. We consider possible vendor strategies and/ or restructuring outcomes when planning for our future growth, as well as the maintenance and support of existing equipment and services. We have reasonable contingency plans for different scenarios, including working with multiple vendors, maintaining ongoing strong vendor relationships with periodic reviews of vendor performance, and working closely with other product and service users to influence vendors' product or service development plans. With continued international focus on telecom suppliers, business continuity plans have been formalized to ensure availability of supply in compliance with U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) Entity List restrictions. For our 5G network build, we entered into partnerships with Ericsson, Nokia and Samsung, consistent with our multi-vendor strategy of limiting the risk that single-vendor dependence may lead to a single point of failure, which could be triggered by adverse economic conditions, geopolitical tensions, natural disasters or other difficult circumstances.\n\nIn addition, we regularly monitor the risk profiles of our key vendors and review the applicable terms and conditions of our agreements to determine whether additional contractual safeguards are required. We also promote our supplier code of conduct, which is based on generally accepted standards of ethical business conduct.\n\nIn respect of the risks associated with a dominant supplier's market power, we offer and promote alternative devices to provide greater choice for consumers and to help limit our reliance on a few key suppliers.

Some buildings are constructed on leasehold land, and the majority of wireless radio antennae are either located on towers situated on lands, or are located on buildings that are held under leases or licences with varying terms. We are currently participating in two real estate joint ventures.\n\nInvestments in real estate property development, including return on investment and benefits realization, may be impacted by local economies, changes in construction costs and timelines, financing costs and partnership agreements. Our current and future investments in real estate may also continue to experience the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we are monitoring the evolving return-to-office models.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nRisks associated with our real estate investments include financing risks and uncertain future demand, occupancy and rental rates, especially during the pandemic. There can be no assurance that future real estate developments will be completed on budget or on time or will obtain lease commitments as planned. Accordingly, we are exposed to the risk of loss in relation to our loans and investments should the business plan of a real estate development project not be successfully realized.",

TELUS Ocean in Victoria, B.C. received the required municipal approvals and construction and pre-leasing are proceeding as planned.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nFor our construction projects (residential and commercial) in progress, our exposure to the risk of budget overruns is limited by fixed-price supply contracts and expert project management oversight. Costs for the real estate projects are monitored through our capital gating and approval processes, and we plan to mitigate any risks related to leasing vacant space by arranging pre-lease agreements with prospective tenants prior to completion of construction.\n\nOn new deals, joint venture partners and developers are compensated partially on a performance basis that encourages projects to meet timing and budget objectives, and we engage independent third-party consultants to verify key assumptions such as market rental rates, construction costs and management costs. We also rely on our internal and external legal teams to ensure that the terms of any contracts, partnerships and procurement arrangements with third parties represent our interests.\n\nWe plan our lease strategy in advance for those properties that are not directly owned, including quarterly reviews of current market demand and requirements, as well as any related exposure to lease expiry risk, rental rate risk, landlord risk and physical risk (such as poor building condition or flooding).\n\n## 10/period.ss0114 F/i.ss01nanc/i.ss01ng/comma.ss01 debt and d/i.ss01v/i.ss01dends\n\n## Risk category: Financial\n\nRisk factors, such as fluctuations in capital markets, the economic environment or regulatory requirements pertaining to bank capitalization, lending activity or changes in the number of Canadian chartered banks, may impact the availability of capital and the cost of capital for investment-grade corporate issuers, including us.\n\nThe market price of our Common Shares may be affected by various factors, such as TELUS Corporation's continued access to bank credit facilities, trade receivables securitization and public debt markets, as well as the continuation of the dividend growth plan outlined in our multi-year objectives.\n\nThe market price may also be affected by TI factors, including, but not limited to:\n\n- /bullet.ss01 The market price of TI subordinate voting shares\n- /bullet.ss01 Actions taken or statements made by TELUS, TI or others concerning our relationship with TI\n- /bullet.ss01 TI's access to banks and public markets\n- /bullet.ss01 Factors affecting the performance of TI, that may impact TI's financial performance and subsequently our financial performance.\n\nOur financial instruments, and the nature of the credit risks, liquidity risks and market risks to which they may be subject, are described in Section 7.9 Financial instruments, commitments and contingent liabilities .\n\n## Potential impact\n\nOur business plans and growth could be negatively affected if current financing is not sufficient to cover funding requirements. External capital market conditions could potentially affect our ability to make strategic investments or meet ongoing capital funding requirements, and may prohibit the roll-over of commercial paper at low rates.\n\nThere can be no assurance that we will maintain or improve our current credit ratings. Given the cash demands of the 3500 MHz spectrum auction held in 2021 and the upcoming spectrum auctions, we may be unable to lower our net debt to EBITDA ratio to our objective range in the medium term, which could eventually have a further negative impact on our credit ratings. Our cost of capital could increase and our access to capital could be affected by a reduction in the credit ratings of TELUS and/or TELUS Communications Inc. (TCI). A reduction in our ratings from the current investment grade could result in an increase in our cost of capital.\n\nWhile future free cash flows and sources of capital are expected to be sufficient to meet current requirements, our intention to return capital to shareholders could constrain our ability to invest in our operations for future growth.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nAt December 31, 2022, our senior unsecured debt was approximately $21.6 billion (see the Senior unsecured debt principal maturities chart in Section 4.3 ). We operate a commercial paper program (maximum of US$1.5 billion) that currently provides access to low-cost funding. As at December 31, 2022, we had $1.5 billion of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was denominated in U.S. dollars (US$1.1 billion). When we issue commercial paper, it must be refinanced on an ongoing basis in order to realize the cost savings relative to borrowing on the $2.75 billion credit facility.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nWe may finance future capital and funding requirements with internally generated cash flows, including the possible monetization of non-core assets and cash-generating working capital initiatives, borrowings under the unutilized portion of our bank credit facilities, use of securitized trade receivables, use of commercial paper and/or the issuance of debt or equity securities. We have a shelf prospectus in effect until September 2024, under which we can offer an unlimited amount of securities qualified thereunder in Canada and up to $3.5 billion of securities qualified thereunder in the U.S. as of the date of this MD&A. We believe that our investment-grade credit ratings, coupled with our efforts to maintain constructive relationships with banks, investors and credit rating agencies, continue to provide reasonable access to capital markets.",

At December 31, 2022, we had an unsecured non-revolving $1.1 billion bank credit facility, maturing July 9, 2024, with a syndicate of financial institutions, which is to be used for general corporate purposes. In addition, our TCI subsidiary has an agreement with an arm's-length securitization trust, ending December 31, 2024, under which it is able to sell an interest in certain of its trade receivables up to a maximum of $600 million, of which $500 million was available at December 31, 2022 (see Section 7.7 Sale of trade receivables ).\n\nWe successfully completed a number of debt transactions in 2021 and 2022 (see Section 7.4 ). As a result, the average term to maturity of our long-term debt (excluding commercial paper, TELUS bank credit facilities, the revolving components of the TELUS International credit facility, lease liabilities and other long-term debt) was 12.1 years at December 31, 2022 (compared to 12.5 years at December 31, 2021), and the average cost of our long-term debt was 4.03% (excluding commercial paper, TELUS bank credit facilities, the revolving components of the TELUS International credit facility, lease liabilities and other long-term debt). Foreign currency forward contracts are used to manage currency risk arising from the issuance of commercial paper and substantially all long-term, fixed-term debt denominated in U.S. dollars. Our commercial paper program is fully backstopped by our $2.75 billion credit facility.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, TI had a credit facility consisting of US$800 million of revolving components and US$1.2 billion of amortizing term loan components. For further details on the TI credit facility, see Section 7.6 Credit facilities .\n\nWe manage our financial capital structure and adjust it in light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of our business. We have financial policies in place that are reviewed annually and are intended to help maintain our existing investment-grade credit ratings. Four credit rating agencies currently have ratings that are in line with this target. Access to our $2.75 billion credit facility would be maintained, even if our ratings were reduced to below investment grade.\n\nFunding for future spectrum licence purchases, defined benefit pension plan obligations and any increases in corporate income tax rates will reduce the after-tax cash flow otherwise available to return to our shareholders. Should actual results differ from our expectations, there can be no assurance that we will not change our financing plans, including our intention to pay dividends according to our payout policy guidelines and to maintain our multi-year dividend growth program. No shares were purchased in 2022 under the normal course issuer bid (NCIB) program. In June 2022, we received approval for an NCIB to purchase and cancel up to 10 million Common Shares (to a maximum of $250 million) from June 6, 2022, to June 5, 2023, which would allow us to purchase our Common Shares if and when we consider it advantageous, based on our financial position and outlook, and the market price of our Common Shares. For further details on our multiyear dividend growth program and NCIB program, see Section 4.3 Liquidity and capital resources .\n\nOur Board reviews and approves the declaration of a dividend each quarter, and the amount of the dividend, based on a number of factors, including our financial position and outlook. This assessment is subject to various assumptions and the impact of various risks and uncertainties, including those described here in Section 10 .\n\n## 10/period.ss0115 Tax matters\n\n## Risk category: Financial\n\nWe collect and pay significant amounts of indirect taxes, such as goods and services taxes, harmonized sales taxes, provincial sales taxes, sales and use taxes and value-added taxes, to various tax authorities. As our operations are complex and the related tax interpretations, regulations, legislation and jurisprudence that pertain to our activities are subject to continual change and evolving interpretation, the final determination of the taxation of many transactions is uncertain. Moreover, the implementation of measures that are compliant with new legislation in itself has its own complexities, including those of execution where multiple systems are involved and the interpretation of new rules as they apply to specific transactions, products and services.\n\nTELUS, along with TI, TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods, operates in a number of foreign jurisdictions, including Armenia, Australia, Austria, Bahamas, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Costa Rica, Czechia, Denmark, El Salvador, Finland, France, Germany, Guatemala, India, Ireland, Japan, Latvia, Mexico, Netherlands, the Philippines, Poland, Romania, Singapore, Slovakia, Spain, Switzerland, the Republic of Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States, which increases our exposure to multiple forms of taxation. Generally, each jurisdiction has certain peculiarities in the forms of taxation imposed (e.g. value-added tax, gross receipts tax, stamp and transfer tax, and income tax), and differences in the applicable tax base and tax rates, legislation and tax treaties, as well as currency and language differences. In addition, the telecommunications industry faces unique issues that lead to uncertainty in the application of tax laws and the division of tax between domestic and foreign jurisdictions.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nWe are subject to the risk that income and indirect tax amounts, including tax expense, may be materially different than anticipated, and that a general tendency by domestic and foreign tax collection authorities to adopt more stringent interpretations and aggressive auditing practices could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\n\nWe have significant current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, income tax expenses and cash tax payments. Income tax amounts are based on our estimates, applying accounting principles that recognize the benefit of income tax positions only when it is more likely than not that the ultimate determination of the tax treatment of a position will result in the related benefit being realized. The assessment of the likelihood and amount of income tax benefits, as well as the timing of realization of such amounts, can materially affect the determination of net income or cash flows. We expect the income taxes calculated at applicable statutory rates to range between 24.7 to 25.3% in 2023 (compared to 25.6% in 2022). These expectations can change as a result of changes in interpretations, regulations, legislation or jurisprudence.\n\nThe timing of the monetization of deferred income tax amounts is\n\nuncertain, as it is dependent upon our future earnings and other events. The amounts of deferred income tax liabilities are also uncertain, as the amounts are based on substantively enacted future income tax rates that were in effect at the time of deferral, which can be changed by tax authorities. As well, the amounts of cash tax payments and current and deferred income tax liabilities are also based on our anticipated mix of revenues among the jurisdictions in which we operate, which is also subject to change.",

        "page_content": "The audit and review activities of tax authorities affect the ultimate determination of the actual amounts of indirect taxes payable or receivable, income taxes payable or receivable, deferred income tax liabilities, taxes on certain items included within capital and income tax expense. Therefore, there can be no assurance that taxes will be payable as anticipated and/or that the amount and timing of receipt or use of the tax-related assets will be as currently expected.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nGlobal and local tax policies are subject to continual change, which increases the complexity of taxation.\n\nCanada, together with approximately 140 other countries comprising the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS), approved in principle in 2021 model Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules. These proposals introduced a form of 15% global minimum tax which is intended to be effective in 2024. Similar proposals were introduced by the European Commission in December 2021. In August 2022, the President of the United States signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act , a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax starting in 2023. If applicable, these items, together with related changes to domestic laws and tax treaties, may result in an increase to our effective tax rate in certain jurisdictions.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nWe follow a comprehensive tax strategy that has been adopted by our Board. This strategy outlines the principles underlying and guiding the roles of team members, their responsibilities and personal conduct, the method of conducting business in relation to tax law and the approaches to working relationships with external tax authorities and external advisors. This strategy recognizes the requirement to comply with all relevant tax laws. The components necessary to manage tax risk are outlined in the strategy.\n\nIn giving effect to this strategy, we maintain an internal Taxation department composed of professionals who stay current on domestic and foreign tax obligations, supplemented where appropriate with external advisors. This team reviews systems and process changes for compliance with applicable domestic and international taxation laws and regulations. Its members are also responsible for the specialized accounting required for income taxes.\n\nMaterial transactions are reviewed by our Taxation department so that transactions of an unusual or non-recurring nature are assessed from multiple risk-based perspectives. As a matter of regular practice, large transactions are reviewed by external tax advisors, while other third-party advisors may also be engaged to express their views as to the potential for tax liability. We continue to review and monitor our activities, so that we can take action to comply with any related regulatory, legal and tax obligations. In some cases, we also engage external advisors to review our systems and processes for tax-related compliance. The advice provided and tax returns prepared by such advisors and counsel are reviewed for reasonableness by our Taxation department.\n\n## 10/period.ss0116 The economy\n\n## Risk category: Financial\n\nOur business operations are impacted by broad economic conditions. Unfavourable economic conditions, such as a recession, an economic slowdown, or rising rates of inflation in the markets in which we operate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\n\nIt is difficult to predict the impact that these factors may have on our business operations in the future. Inflation-related impacts were evident in 2022, but the future duration and impacts of current inflationary pressures are unknown.\n\nRisks to the Canadian economy include: fluctuations in oil prices, potential rises in interest rates and levels of consumer and mortgage debt, an acceleration in inflation, volatility in the housing market, the timing and rate of economic recovery from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and uncertainty related to trade issues, including the ongoing imposition of tariffs and supply chain disruption, and the effects of climate change. In addition, as we expand our international operations through acquisitions, such as those within our TI subsidiary and our TELUS Health and TELUS Agriculture & Consumer Goods businesses, we become more exposed to global market conditions. Meanwhile, trade disputes between countries, as well as other economic and political uncertainties and developments outside of Canada, may have global implications, as supply chains have become increasingly integrated.\n\nOur ability to successfully implement cost reduction initiatives and realize planned savings, net of restructuring and other costs, may affect business operations and customer services. Those initiatives include, but are not limited to, our operating efficiency and effectiveness program to drive improvements in financial results, business integrations, business product simplification, business process automation and outsourcing, offshoring and reorganizations, as well as procurement initiatives.\n\n## Potential impact\n\nEconomic uncertainty may cause consumers and business customers to reduce or delay discretionary spending, impacting new service purchases or volumes of use, and consider substitution by lower-priced alternatives.\n\nGlobally, some countries may require financial support, sovereign credit ratings may continue to decline, and there may be a default on the sovereign debt obligations of certain countries. Any of these economic outcomes may increase the cost of borrowing and cause our access to credit to become more limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, financial performance and cash flows. Economic and political uncertainty could undermine business confidence. Unfavourable economic conditions could cause our business clients to reduce, defer or eliminate spending on our services in order to reduce their operating costs.\n\nFluctuations in the Canadian economy could adversely impact growth in our customer base revenue, profitability and free cash flow, and could potentially require us to record impairments in the carrying values of our assets, including, but not limited to, our intangible assets with indefinite lives (spectrum licences and goodwill). Impairments in the carrying values of our assets would result in a charge to earnings and a reduction in owners' equity, but would not affect cash flow. Continued inflationary pressures could lead to increases in input costs such as labour, which may not be offset by revenue growth and may impact margins. In addition, ongoing international supply chain disruptions may make it difficult to source key components (such as handsets) in sufficient quantities and at reasonable prices.\n\nFluctuations in the global economy could affect different industry verticals in different ways. Counter-cyclical industries such as agriculture and logistics should remain largely unaffected, as food producers, distributors and retailers would continue to operate. Healthcare, particularly products and services related to logistics or vaccines, should do well, and hospitals and healthcare providers in certain countries could also perform well.",

        "page_content": "Because certain acquisitions, operating costs and revenues, including TI's revenues, are denominated in U.S. dollars or other non-Canadian dollar currencies, fluctuations in the Canadian dollar exchange rate may impact our financial and operating results.\n\nEconomic and capital market fluctuations could also adversely affect the investment performance, funding and expense associated with our defined benefit pension plans, as obligations are based on certain actuarial assumptions related to expected plan asset returns, salary escalation, life expectancy, the performance of financial markets and future interest rates.\n\n## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nIn 2022, both the Canadian economy and the global economy proved resilient despite challenges from rising inflation, higher interest rates, the war in Ukraine and lingering restrictions in China related to COVID-19. Central banks have aggressively increased interest rates in an attempt to slow inflation but the economic impacts are not yet measurable because of the time lag between interest rate increases and the effects they have on interest rate-sensitive sectors in the economy. Higher interest rates may impact the housing market and the economy more broadly as households cut back on spending in order to manage higher debt service costs. As inflationary pressures persist, the input costs of goods and labour are increasing, which may impact margins and overall profitability.\n\nInterest rates are expected to continue rising in 2023, with several central banks around the world making specific mention of this monetary tool to combat rising inflation. If central banks raise interest rates more quickly and further than the economy can absorb, there is a risk that both the Canadian economy and the global economy could slide into a recession in 2023.\n\nThe Canadian dollar exchange rate with the U.S. dollar was volatile, with the Canadian dollar generally weakening over the year, from $1.27 at the end of 2021 to $1.35 at the end of 2022.\n\nThe solvency position of our defined benefit pension plans, in aggregate, as determined under the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 , was estimated to be a surplus of $1.6 billion at the end of 2022 (compared to a surplus of $1.2 billion at the end of 2021).\n\n## Mitigation\n\nWhile economic risks cannot be completely mitigated, our top priority of putting customers first and pursuing global leadership in the likelihood of our customers recommending our products, services and people also supports our efforts to acquire and retain customers through the economic fluctuations that affect them and us. Our telecommunications services are resilient during recessionary periods, which allows us to navigate through changing market dynamics. We also continue to pursue cost reduction and efficiency initiatives across our business operations, such as labour arbitrage through our TI business. See Section 4.3 Liquidity and capital resources for our capital structure financial policies and plans.\n\nForeign currency forward contracts and currency options are leveraged to fix the exchange rates on U.S. dollar-denominated transactions, commitments, commercial paper and U.S. Dollar Notes in order to help mitigate risks related to exchange rate fluctuations, and we seek to mitigate pension risk through the application of policies and procedures for managing exposure to investment risk and through ongoing monitoring of our funding position. Our best estimate of cash contributions to our registered defined benefit pension plans in 2023 is $19 million ($32 million in 2022). Virtual power purchase agreements with renewable energy projects that develop solar and wind power facilities are being leveraged to manage our exposure to electrical power purchase price risk.\n\n## 10/period.ss0117 L/i.ss01t/i.ss01gat/i.ss01on and /l.ss08ega/l.ss08 matters\n\n## Risk category: Compliance\n\nGiven the size of our organization, investigations, claims and lawsuits seeking damages and other relief are regularly threatened or pending against us. The continued expansion of our product and service offerings in managed services, security, healthcare, and agriculture and supply chain technology, as well as the initial public offering of subordinate voting shares by TI in February 2021, have added to our compliance requirements and increased our exposure to the risk of litigation and the possibility of damages, sanctions and fines. We may also be the target of class actions due to our millions of customer relationships. In addition, like other public companies, we may be subject to civil liability for misrepresentations in written disclosure and oral statements, and liability for fraud and market manipulation.\n\nThe intellectual property and proprietary rights of owners and developers of hardware, software, business processes and other technologies may be protected under statute, such as patent, copyright and industrial design legislation, or under common law, such as trade secrets. Significant damages may be awarded in intellectual property infringement claims and defendants may incur significant costs to defend or settle such claims.\n\nPotentially material certified and uncertified class actions, intellectual property litigation and other claims against us are detailed in Note 29(a) of the Consolidated financial statements.\n\nWith business operations in a number of jurisdictions, we are required to comply not only with Canadian laws and regulations, but also with local laws and regulations in other jurisdictions. These laws and regulations may differ substantially from Canadian laws and add to our regulatory, legal and tax exposures. We continue to extend our business operations into additional jurisdictions and expand our product and service offerings in such jurisdictions, and this may increase our exposure to regulatory, legal and tax risks, including potential significant fines and penalties (e.g. 4% of global revenues under EU data protection laws). In certain cases, laws with extraterritorial application may also impose obligations on us. See Section 10.3 Regulatory matters .\n\n## Potential impact\n\nIt is not currently possible to predict the outcome of such legal matters due to various factors, including: the preliminary nature of some claims; uncertain damage theories and demands; incomplete factual records; the uncertain nature of legal theories and procedures and their resolution by the courts, at both the trial and appellate levels; and the unpredictable nature of opposing parties and their demands.\n\nWe are typically required to process, and sometimes collect and/or store sensitive data, including, but not limited to, personal data regulated by data protection and privacy legislation, where applicable, including the General Data Protection Regulation (EU and U.K.), the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act and proposed Bill C-27 (Canada), and the California Consumer Privacy Act , California Invasion of Privacy Act , Personal Data Protection Bill of 2018 and Data Privacy Act of 2012 (U.S.). The adoption and enforcement by governments of increasingly stringent privacy legislation may increase our exposure to risks related to compliance and liability. A successful class action lawsuit or intellectual property infringement claim, by its nature, could result in a sizeable damages award that could negatively affect a defendant's financial or operating results.\n\nThere can be no assurance that our financial or operating results will not be negatively impacted by any of these factors.",

        "page_content": "## Changes over the past 12 months\n\nAs our TELUS Health team and medical clinics offer services (such as virtual care and electronic prescriptions) directly to consumers and also through third-party partnerships, new risks arise from our reliance on third-party suppliers. Our medical clinics also offer both insured and uninsured medical services, creating risks in relation to regulatory and legal compliance and/or compliance with medical professional standards.\n\nAs we extend our offerings in agriculture and supply chain technology (such as animal health and management) and add to the jurisdictions in which we offer them, we also increase our exposure to the risks associated with regulatory compliance and data security and privacy.\n\nWith the growth and development of technology-based industries, the value of intellectual property and proprietary rights has increased. Trends in awards for damages, costs to defend and the likelihood of settlements, may encourage property rights holders to aggressively pursue infringement claims. Given the vast array of technologies and systems that we use to deliver products and services, and the rapid change and complexity characteristic of such technologies, the number of disputes over intellectual property and proprietary rights can reasonably be expected to increase.\n\nIn Canada, the proposed Bill C-27 Digital Charter Implementation Act , contains a private right of action which, if it becomes law, could increase the risk of litigation and class actions. The Province of Quebec has made amendments to the Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the Private Sector , as noted in Section 10.3 . Over three years, the amendments will phase in major changes and new regulatory requirements.\n\nIn April 2021, the EU Commission announced the adoption of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), which is aligned with the commitment made under the European Green Deal. We may be subject to the EU sustainability reporting requirements in 2024.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nWe believe that we have in place reasonable policies, controls, processes and contractual arrangements, as well as insurance coverage, intended to enable compliance and reduce our exposure to any related risks. We have a designated Chief Data and Trust Officer, responsible for ensuring that we have in place appropriate processes and controls across the enterprise in order to facilitate legal compliance, and for reporting on compliance to the Audit Committee.\n\nOur team of internal and external legal professionals advise on and manage risks related to claims and possible claims, vigorously defend class actions and other claims, pursue settlements in appropriate cases, regularly assess our business practices, and monitor legal developments that may impact risk. They seek and obtain contractual protections con sistent with standard industry practices to help mitigate the risks of intellectual property infringements and work to protect our intellectual property rights through litigation and other means.\n\nOur corporate disclosure policy restricts disclosure by team members, defines the role of Company spokesperson, provides a protocol for communicating with investment analysts, investors and others, and outlines our communications approach.\n\nWe rely on our team members, officers, Board of Directors, key suppliers and other business partners to demonstrate behaviour consistent with applicable legal and ethical standards in all jurisdictions within which we operate. We have an anti-bribery and corruption policy, a comprehensive code of ethics and conduct for our team members and Board of Directors, and mandatory annual integrity training for all team members and identified contractors.\n\nSubject to the foregoing limitations, management is of the opinion, based upon legal assessments and the information presently available, that it is unlikely that any liability related to existing investigations, claims and lawsuits, to the extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise, would have a material effect on our financial position and the results of our operations, excepting the items disclosed herein and in Note 29(a) of the Consolidated financial statements.",

As non-GAAP measures generally do not have a standardized meaning, they may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. For certain financial metrics, there are definitional differences between TELUS and TELUS International reporting. These differences largely arise from TELUS International adopting definitions consistent with practice in its industry. Securities regulations require such measures to be clearly defined, qualified and reconciled with their nearest GAAP measure. Certain of the metrics do not have generally accepted industry definitions.\n\n## Adjusted Net income and adjusted basic earnings per share (EPS):\n\nThese are non-GAAP measures that do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS-IASB and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Adjusted Net income excludes the effects of restructuring and other costs, income tax-related adjustments, other equity (income) losses related to real estate joint ventures, long-term debt prepayment premium and other adjustments (identified in the following tables). Adjusted basic EPS is calculated as adjusted net income divided by the basic weighted-average number of Common Shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate performance at a consolidated level and exclude items that, in management's view, may obscure underlying trends in business performance or items of an unusual nature that do not reflect our ongoing operations. They should not be considered alternatives to Net income and basic EPS in measuring TELUS' performance.\n\n## Reconciliation of adjusted Net income\n\n|                                                                                      | Fourth quarters ended December 31   | Fourth quarters ended December 31   | Years ended December 31   | Years ended December 31   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| ($ millions)                                                                         | 2022                                | 2021                                | 2022                      | 2021                      |\n| Net income attributable to Common Shares                                             | 248                                 | 644                                 | 1,615                     | 1,655                     |\n| Add (deduct) amounts net of amount attributable to non-controlling interests:        |                                     |                                     |                           |                           |\n| Restructuring and other costs                                                        | 82                                  | 43                                  | 219                       | 170                       |\n| Tax effect of restructuring and other costs                                          | (21)                                | (11)                                | (55)                      | (41)                      |\n| Income tax-related adjustments                                                       | (1)                                 | 3                                   | 6                         | (16)                      |\n| Other equity (income) losses related to real estate joint ventures                   | (3)                                 | 1                                   | (3)                       | 3                         |\n| Virtual power purchase agreements unrealized change in forward element               | 38                                  | -

EBITDA is commonly reported and widely used by investors and lending institutions as an indicator of a company's operating performance and ability to incur and service debt, and as a valuation metric. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to Net income in measuring TELUS' performance, nor should it be used as a measure of cash flow. EBITDA as calculated by TELUS is equivalent to Operating revenues and other income less the total of Goods and services purchased expense and Employee benefits expense.\n\nWe calculate EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs, as it is a component of the EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs interest coverage ratio and the Net debt to EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs ratio.\n\nWe also calculate Adjusted EBITDA to exclude items of an unusual nature that do not reflect our ongoing operations and should not, in our opinion, be considered in a long-term valuation metric or should not be included in an assessment of our ability to service or incur debt.\n\nEBIT (earnings before interest and income taxes) is calculated for our reportable segments because we believe it is a meaningful indicator of our operating performance, as it represents our earnings from operations before costs of capital structure and income taxes.\n\n## EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA reconciliations\n\n|                                                                    | TTech   | TTech   | DLCX   | DLCX   | Total   | Total   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|--------|---------|---------|\n| Fourth quarters ended December 31 ($ millions)                     | 2022    | 2021    | 2022   | 2021   | 2022    | 2021    |\n| Net income                                                         |         |         |        |        | 265     | 663     |\n| Financing costs                                                    |         |         |        |        | 322     | 192     |\n| Income taxes                                                       |         |         |        |        | 82      | 197     |\n| EBIT                                                               | 586     | 973     | 83     | 79     | 669     | 1,052   |\n| Depreciation                                                       | 541     | 508     | 48     | 37     | 589     | 545     |\n| Amortization of intangible assets                                  | 296     | 240     | 44     | 45     | 340     | 285     |\n| EBITDA                                                             | 1,423   | 1,721   | 175    | 161    | 1,598   | 1,882   |\n| Add restructuring and other costs included in EBITDA               | 59      | 36      | 35     | 8      | 94      | 44      |\n| EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs                   | 1,482   | 1,757   | 210    | 169    | 1,692   | 1,926   |\n| Other equity (income) losses related to real estate joint ventures | (3)     | 1       | -      | -      | (3)     | 1       |\n| Gain on disposition of financial solutions business                | -       | (410)   | -      | -      | -       | (410)   |\n| Adjusted EBITDA                                                    | 1,479   | 1,348   | 210    | 169    | 1,689   | 1,517   |\n\n## EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA reconciliations\n\n|                                                                    | TTech   | TTech   | DLCX   | DLCX   | Total   | Total   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|--------|--------|---------|---------|\n| Years ended December 31 ($ millions)                               | 2022    | 2021    | 2022   | 2021   | 2022    | 2021    |\n| Net income                                                         |         |         |        |        | 1,718   | 1,698   |\n| Financing costs                                                    |         |         |        |        | 632     | 796     |\n| Income taxes                                                       |         |         |        |        | 604     | 580     |\n| EBIT                                                               | 2,582   | 2,841   | 372    | 233    | 2,954   | 3,074   |\n| Depreciation                                                       | 2,064   | 1,982   | 162    | 144    | 2,226   | 2,126   |\n| Amortization of intangible assets                                  | 1,051   | 912     | 175    | 178    | 1,226   | 1,090   |\n| EBITDA                                                             | 5,697   | 5,735   | 709    | 555    | 6,406   | 6,290   |\n| Add restructuring and other costs included in EBITDA               | 180     | 148     | 60     | 38     | 240     | 186     |\n| EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs                   | 5,877   | 5,883   | 769    | 593    | 6,646   | 6,476   |\n| Other equity (income) losses related to real estate joint ventures | (3)     | 3       | -      | -      | (3)     | 3       |\n| Gain on disposition of financial solutions business                | -       | (410)   | -      | -      | -       | (410)   |\n| Adjusted EBITDA                                                    | 5,874   | 5,476   | 769    | 593    | 6,643   | 6,069   |",

It should not be considered as an alternative to the measures in the Consolidated statements of cash flows. Free cash flow excludes certain working capital changes (such as trade receivables and trade payables), proceeds from divested assets and other sources and uses of cash, as found in the Consolidated statements of cash flows. It provides an indication of how much cash generated by operations is available after capital expenditures (excluding purchases of spectrum licences) that may be used to, among other things, pay dividends, repay debt, purchase shares or make other investments. We exclude impacts of accounting standards that do not impact cash, such as IFRS 15 and IFRS 16. Free cash flow may be supplemented from time to time by proceeds from divested assets or financing activities.",

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice-president and Chief Financial Officer and effected by the Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nDue to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Based on the assessment referenced in the preceding paragraph, management has determined that the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2022. In connection with this assessment, no material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting were identified by management as of December 31, 2022.\n\nThe Company acquired LifeWorks Inc. on September 1, 2022, as set out in Note 18(b) of the consolidated financial statements, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, LifeWorks Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting associated with 5%, 11%, 7% and 6% of the Company's consolidated current assets, consolidated current liabilities, consolidated non-current assets and consolidated non-current liabilities, respectively, and total revenue of $350 million and net loss of $5 million included in the Consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nDeloitte LLP, an Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, audited the Company's Consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, and as stated in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, they have expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExecutive Vice-president and Chief Financial Officer February 9, 2023 Doug French\n\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer February 9, 2023 Darren Entwistle\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and its financial performance and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 9, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.\n\nThe communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\nValuation of Intangible Assets Acquired in Business Acquisitions Refer to Note 1(b) and 18(b) to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company acquired 100% of the equity of LifeWorks Inc. and recognized the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at fair value including intangible assets for customer relationships (customer relationships). In determining the fair value of the customer relationships, management was required to make estimates and assumptions in forecasting future cash flows and determining customer attrition rates.\n\nWhile there are many estimates and assumptions that management makes to determine the fair value of customer relationships, the estimates and assumptions with the highest degree of subjectivity are forecasts of future revenue and customer attrition rates. Performing audit procedures to evaluate these estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of audit effort, including the involvement of fair value specialists.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to forecasts of future revenue and customer attrition rates used to determine the fair value of customer relationships included the following, among others:\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Evaluated the effectiveness of controls over the valuation of customer relationships at the acquisition date, including management's controls over forecasts of future revenue and customer attrition rates.\n- /bullet.ss01 Evaluated the reasonableness of management's forecasts of future revenue by comparing the forecasts to historical results, third-party industry forecasts, internal communications to management, as well as performing inquiries with certain members of management.\n- /bullet.ss01 With the assistance of fair value specialists:\n- /bullet.ss01 Tested the source information underlying the determination of the customer attrition rates and developed a range of independent estimates for the customer attrition rates and compared those to the rates selected by management.\n- /bullet.ss01 Assessed the valuation determined by management for customer relationships by considering publicly available market data for comparable transactions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChartered Professional Accountants Vancouver, Canada February 9, 2023\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.",

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended December 31, 2022, of the Company and our report dated February 9, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n\nAs described in the report of management on internal control over financial reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at LifeWorks Inc., which was acquired on September 1, 2022, and whose financial statements constitute 5%, 11%, 7% and 6% of the Company's consolidated current assets, consolidated current liabilities, consolidated non-current assets and consolidated non-current liabilities, respectively, and total revenue of $350 million and net loss of $5 million included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at LifeWorks Inc.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying report of management on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the\n\nPCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChartered Professional Accountants Vancouver, Canada February 9, 2023",

Data services include: internet protocol; television; hosting, managed information technology and cloud-based services; and home and business security.\n\nTELUS Corporation was incorporated under the Company Act (British Columbia) on October 26, 1998, under the name BCT.TELUS Communications Inc. (BCT). On January 31, 1999, pursuant to a court-approved plan of arrangement under the Canada Business Corporations Act among BCT, BC TELECOM Inc. and the former Alberta-based TELUS Corporation (TC), BCT acquired all of the shares of BC TELECOM Inc. and TC in exchange for Common Shares and Non-Voting Shares of BCT, and BC TELECOM Inc. was dissolved. On May 3, 2000, BCT changed its name to TELUS Corporation and in February 2005, TELUS Corporation transitioned under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia), successor to the Company Act (British Columbia). TELUS Corporation maintains its registered office at Floor 7, 510 West Georgia Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6B 0M3.\n\nThe terms 'TELUS', 'we', 'us', 'our' or 'ourselves' refer to TELUS Corporation and, where the context of the narrative permits or requires, its subsidiaries. Our principal subsidiaries are: TELUS Communications Inc., in which, as at December 31, 2022, we have a 100% equity interest; and TELUS International (Cda) Inc., in which, as at December 31, 2022, we have a 56.6% equity interest, as discussed further in Note 28(c) , and which completed its initial public offering in February 2021. Although they have not had any effect on our current determination of which are our principal subsidiaries, we made material business acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2022, as set out in Note 18(b) .\n\n| General application                                | General application                                         |     |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----|\n| 1.

The generally accepted accounting principles that we apply are International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IFRS-IASB), and Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nGenerally accepted accounting principles require that we disclose the accounting policies we have selected in those instances in which we have been obligated to choose from among various accounting policies that comply with generally accepted accounting principles. In certain other instances, including those in which no selection among policies is allowed, we are also required to disclose how we have applied certain accounting policies. In the selection and application of accounting policies, we consider, among other factors, the fundamental qualitative characteristics of useful financial information, namely relevance and faithful representation. In our assessment, the accounting policy disclosures we are required to make are not all equally significant for us, as set out in the accompanying table; their relative significance for us will evolve over time, as we do.\n\nThese consolidated financial statements for each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, were authorized by our Board of Directors for issue on February 9, 2023.\n\n## (a) Conso/l.ss08/i.ss01dat/i.ss01on\n\nOur consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of all of our subsidiaries, of which the principal ones are: TELUS Communications Inc. and TELUS International (Cda) Inc. TELUS Communications Inc. includes substantially all of our mobile and fixed operations, excluding the customer experience and digital enablement transformation provided through the customer care and business services business of TELUS International (Cda) Inc.\n\nOur financing arrangements and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries do not impose restrictions on inter-corporate dividends.\n\nOn a continuing basis, we review our corporate organization and effect changes as appropriate so as to enhance the value of TELUS Corporation. This process can, and does, affect which of our subsidiaries are considered principal subsidiaries at any particular point in time.\n\n| Accounting policy                                          | Accounting policy   requiring a more significant  choice among policies  and/or a more significant  application of judgment  Yes   | No   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|\n| General application                                        |                                                                                                                                    |      |\n| (a)  Consolidation                                         |                                                                                                                                    | X    |\n| (b)  Use of estimates and judgments                        | X                                                                                                                                  |      |\n| (c)  Financial instruments -   recognition and measurement |                                                                                                                                    | X    |\n| (d)  Hedge accounting                                      |                                                                                                                                    | X    |\n| Results of operations focused                              |                                                                                                                                    |      |\n| (e)  Revenue recognition                                   | X                                                                                                                                  |      |\n| (f)  Depreciation, amortization and impairment             | X                                                                                                                                  |      |\n| (g)  Translation of foreign currencies                     |                                                                                                                                    | X    |\n| (h)  Income and other taxes                                | X                                                                                                                                  |      |\n| (i)  Share-based compensation                              |                                                                                                                                    | X    |\n| (j)  Employee future benefit plans                         | X                                                                                                                                  |      |\n| Financial position focused                                 |                                                                                                                                    |      |\n| (k)  Cash and temporary investments, net                   |                                                                                                                                    | X    |\n| (l)  Inventories                                           |                                                                                                                                    | X    |\n| (m) Property, plant and equipment;   intangible assets     | X                                                                                                                                  |      |\n| (n)  Investments                                           |                                                                                                                                    | X    |\n\n## (b) Use of est/i.ss01mates and /j.ss01udgments\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect: the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements; and the reported amounts and classification of revenue and expense during the reporting period.

In the normal course, we make changes to our assessments regarding materiality for presentation so that they reflect current economic conditions. Due consideration is given to the view that it is reasonable to expect differing opinions of what is, and is not, material.\n- /bullet.ss01 In respect of revenue-generating transactions, we must make judgments that affect the timing of the recognition of revenue, as set out following:\n- /bullet.ss01 We have millions of multi-year contracts with our customers and we must make judgments about when we have satisfied our performance obligations to our customers, either over a period of time or at a point in time. Service revenues are recognized based on customers' access to, or usage of, our telecommunications infrastructure; we believe that this method faithfully depicts the transfer of the services, and thus the revenues are recognized as the services are made available and/or rendered. We consider our performance obligations arising from the sale of equipment to have been satisfied when the equipment has been delivered to, and accepted by, the end-user customers (see (e) following).\n- /bullet.ss01 Principally in the context of revenue-generating transactions involving mobile handsets, we must make judgments as to whether third-party re-sellers that deliver equipment to our customers are acting in the transactions as principals or as our agents. Upon due consideration of the relevant indicators, we believe that the decision to consider the re-sellers to be acting, solely for accounting\n\npurposes, as our agents is more representative of the economic substance of the transactions, as we are the primary obligor to the end-user customers. The effect of this judgment is that no equipment revenue is recognized upon the transfer of inventory to third-party re-sellers.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 We compensate third-party re-sellers and our employees for generating revenues, and we must make judgments as to whether such sales-based compensation amounts are costs incurred to obtain contracts with customers that should be capitalized (see Note 20 ). We believe that compensation amounts tangentially attributable to obtaining a contract with a customer, because the amount of such compensation could be affected in ways other than by simply obtaining that contract, should be expensed as incurred; compensation amounts directly attributable to obtaining a contract with a customer should be capitalized and subsequently amortized on a systematic basis, consistent with the satisfaction of our associated performance obligations.\n\nJudgment must also be exercised in the capitalization of costs incurred to fulfill revenue-generating contracts with customers. Such fulfilment costs are those incurred to set up, activate or otherwise implement services involving access to, or usage of, our telecommunications infrastructure that would not otherwise be capitalized as property, plant, equipment and/or intangible assets (see Note 20 ).\n\n- /bullet.ss01 The decision to depreciate and amortize any property, plant, equipment (including right-of-use lease assets) and intangible assets that are subject to amortization on a straight-line basis, as we believe that this method reflects the consumption of resources related to the economic lifespan of those assets better than an accelerated method and is more representative of the economic substance of the underlying use of those assets.",

It is often difficult and impractical to objectively and clearly distinguish between the operations and cash flows of our business units, and the assets from which those cash flows arise.

As our business continues to evolve, new cash-generating units may also develop.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 The view that our spectrum licences granted by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (including spectrum licences that have been subordinated to us) will likely be renewed; that we intend to renew them; that we believe we have the financial and operational ability to renew them; and thus, that they have indefinite lives, as discussed further in Note 18(e) . /bullet.ss01 The view that our spectrum licences granted by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (including spectrum licences that have been subordinated to us) will likely be renewed; that we intend to renew them; that we believe we have the financial and operational ability to renew them; and thus, that they have indefinite lives, as discussed further in Note 18(e) .\n- /bullet.ss01 In connection with the annual impairment testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill, there may be instances in which we must exercise judgment in allocating our net assets (including shared corporate and administrative assets) to our cash-generating units when determining their carrying amounts. /bullet.ss01 In connection with the annual impairment testing of intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill, there may be instances in which we must exercise judgment in allocating our net assets (including shared corporate and administrative assets) to our cash-generating units when determining their carrying amounts.\n- /bullet.ss01 In respect of claims and lawsuits, as discussed further in Note 29(a) , the determination of whether an item is a contingent liability or whether an outflow of resources is probable and thus is to be accounted for as a provision. /bullet.ss01 In respect of claims and lawsuits, as discussed further in Note 29(a) , the determination of whether an item is a contingent liability or whether an outflow of resources is probable and thus is to be accounted for as a provision.\n\n## (c) F/i.ss01nanc/i.ss01a/l.ss08 /i.ss01nstruments - recogn/i.ss01t/i.ss01on and measurement\n\nIn respect of the recognition and measurement of financial instruments, we have adopted the following policies:\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Regular-way purchases or sales of financial assets or financial liabilities (purchases or sales that require actual delivery of financial assets or financial liabilities) are recognized on the settlement date. We have selected this method, as the benefits of using the trade date method were not expected to exceed the costs of selecting and implementing that method.\n- /bullet.ss01 Transaction costs, other than in respect of items held for trading, are added to the initial fair value of the acquired financial asset or financial liability. We have selected this method, as we believe that it results in a better matching of the transaction costs with the periods in which we benefit from those costs.\n- /bullet.ss01 A contract to receive renewable energy credits and the associated virtual power purchase agreement are distinct units of account. We have selected this method as we believe the receipt of the renewable energy credits is an executory contract and the virtual power purchase agreement meets the definition of a derivative.\n\n## (d) Hedge account/i.ss01ng\n\n## General\n\nWe apply hedge accounting to the financial instruments used to establish designated currency hedging relationships for certain U.S. dollar-denominated future purchase commitments and debt repayments, as set out in Note 4(a) and (d) .\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nThe purpose of hedge accounting, in respect of our designated hedging relationships, is to ensure that counterbalancing gains and losses are recognized in the same periods. We have chosen to apply hedge accounting, as we believe that it is more representative of the economic substance of the underlying transactions.\n\nIn order to apply hedge accounting, a high correlation (which indicates effectiveness) is required in the offsetting changes in the risk-associated values of the financial instruments (the hedging items) used to establish the designated hedging relationships and all, or a part, of the asset, liability or transaction having an identified risk exposure that we have taken steps to modify (the hedged items). We assess the anticipated effectiveness of designated hedging relationships at inception and their actual effectiveness for each reporting period thereafter. We consider a designated hedging relationship to be effective if the following critical terms match between the hedging item and the hedged item: the notional amount of the hedging item and the principal amount of the hedged item; maturity dates; payment dates; and interest rate index (if, and as, applicable). As set out in Note 4(i) , any ineffectiveness, such as would result from a difference between the notional amount of the hedging item and the principal amount of the hedged item, or from a previously effective designated hedging relationship becoming ineffective, is reflected in the Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income as Financing costs if in respect of long-term debt and as Goods and services purchased if in respect of U.S. dollar-denominated future purchase commitments.\n\n## Hedging assets and liabilities\n\nIn the application of hedge accounting, an amount (the hedge value) is recorded in the Consolidated statements of financial position in respect of the fair value of the hedging items. The net difference, if any, between the amounts recognized in the determination of net income and the amounts necessary to reflect the fair value of the designated cash flow hedging items recorded in the Consolidated statements of financial position is recognized as a component of Other comprehensive income, as set out in Note 11 .",

Service revenues from our digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International segment arise from the provision of digital customer experience solutions, including artificial intelligence and content management solutions.\n\nWe offer complete and integrated solutions to meet our customers' needs. These solutions may involve deliveries of multiple services and products (our performance obligations) that occur at different points in time and/or over different periods of time; as referred to in (b) , this is a significant judgment for us. As required, the performance obligations of these multiple-element arrangements are identified and the transaction price for the entire multiple-element arrangement is determined and allocated among the performance obligations based upon our relative stand-alone selling prices for each of them; our relevant revenue recognition policies are then applied, so that revenue is recognized when, or as, we satisfy the performance obligations. To the extent that variable consideration is included in determining the minimum transaction price, it is constrained to the 'minimum spend' amount required in a contract with a customer. Service revenues arising from contracts with customers typically have variable consideration, because customers have the ongoing ability to both add and remove features and services, and because customer usage of our telecommunications infrastructure may exceed the base amounts provided for in their contracts.\n\nFor the purposes of IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , our contracts with customers are not considered to have a significant financing component. With the exception of both equipment-related upfront payments that may be required under the terms of contracts with customers and in-store 'cash and carry' sales of equipment and accessories, payments are typically due 30 days from the billing date. Billings are typically rendered on a monthly basis.\n\nMultiple contracts with a single customer are normally accounted for as separate arrangements. In instances where multiple contracts are entered into with a customer in a short period of time, the contracts are reviewed as a group to ensure that, as with multiple-element arrangements, their relative transaction prices are appropriate.\n\nLease accounting is applied to an accounting unit if it conveys to a customer the right to use a specific asset but does not convey the risks and/or benefits of ownership.\n\nOur revenues are recorded net of any value-added and/or sales taxes\n\nbilled to the customer concurrent with a revenue-generating transaction. We use the following revenue accounting practical expedients\n\nprovided for in IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers :\n\n- /bullet.ss01 No adjustment of the contracted amount of consideration for the effects of financing components when, at the inception of a contract, we expect that the effect of the financing component is not significant at the individual contract level.\n- /bullet.ss01 No deferral of contract acquisition costs when the amortization period for such costs would be one year or less.\n- /bullet.ss01 When estimating minimum transaction prices allocated to any remaining unfulfilled, or partially unfulfilled, performance obligations, exclusion of amounts arising from contracts originally expected to have a duration of one year or less, as well as amounts arising from contracts under which we may recognize and bill revenue in an amount that corresponds directly with our completed performance obligations.\n\n## Contract assets\n\nMany of our multiple-element arrangements arise from bundling the sale of equipment (e.g. a mobile handset) with a contracted service period. Although the customer receives the equipment at contract inception and the revenue from the associated completed performance obligation is recognized at that time, the customer's payment for the equipment will effectively be received rateably over the contracted service period to the extent it is not received as a lump-sum amount at contract inception. The difference between the equipment revenue recognized and the associated amount cumulatively billed to the customer is recognized on the Consolidated statements of financial position as a contract asset and/or an unbilled customer finance receivable, depending upon the form of the contract.\n\nContract assets may also arise in instances where we give consideration to a customer. When we receive no identifiable, separable benefit for consideration given to a customer, the amount of the consideration is recognized as a reduction of revenue rather than as an expense. Such amounts are included in the determination of transaction prices for allocation purposes in multiple-element arrangements.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Some forms of consideration given to a customer, effectively at contract inception, such as rebates (including prepaid non-bank cards) and/or equipment, are considered to be performance obligations in a multiple-element arrangement. Although the performance obligation is satisfied at contract inception, the customer's payment associated with the performance obligation will effectively be received rateably over the associated contracted service period. The difference between the revenue arising from the satisfied performance obligation and the associated amount cumulatively billed to the customer is recognized on the Consolidated statements of financial position as a contract asset.\n- /bullet.ss01 Other forms of consideration given to a customer, either at contract inception or over a period of time, such as discounts (including prepaid bank cards), may result in us receiving no identifiable, separable benefit and thus are not considered performance obligations.",

The difference between the consideration provided and the associated amount recognized as a reduction of revenue is recognized on the Consolidated statements of financial position as a contract asset.\n\n## Contract liabilities\n\nAdvance billings are recorded when billing occurs prior to provision of the associated services; such advance billings are recognized as revenue in the period in which the services and/or equipment are provided (see Note 24 ). Similarly, and as appropriate, upfront customer activation and connection fees are deferred and recognized over the average expected term of the customer relationship.\n\n## Costs of contract acquisition and contract fulfilment\n\nCosts of contract acquisition (typically commissions) and costs of contract fulfilment are capitalized and recognized as an expense, generally over the life of the contract on a systematic and rational basis consistent with the pattern of the transfer of goods or services to which the asset relates. The amortization of such costs is included in the Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income as a component of Goods and services purchased, with the exception of amounts paid to our employees, which are included as Employee benefits expense.\n\nThe total cost of mobile equipment sold to customers and advertising and promotion costs related to initial customer acquisition are expensed as incurred; the cost of equipment we own that is situated at customers' premises and associated installation costs are capitalized as incurred. Costs of advertising production, advertising airtime and advertising space are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Voice and data\n\nWe recognize revenues on an accrual basis and include an estimate of revenues earned but unbilled. Mobile and fixed service revenues are recognized based upon access to, and usage of, our telecommunications infrastructure and upon contract fees.\n\nAdvance billings are recorded when billing occurs prior to provision of the associated services; such advance billings are recognized as revenue in the period in which the services are provided. Similarly, and as appropriate, upfront customer activation and connection fees are deferred and recognized over the average expected term of the customer relationship.\n\nWe use the liability method of accounting for the amounts of our quality of service rate rebates that arise from the jurisdiction of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).\n\nThe CRTC has established a mechanism to subsidize local exchange carriers, such as ourselves, that provide residential basic telephone service to high cost serving areas. The CRTC has determined the per network access line/per band subsidy rate for all local exchange carriers. We recognize the subsidy on an accrual basis by applying the subsidy rate to the number of residential network access lines we provide in high cost serving areas, as discussed further in Note 7. Differences, if any, between interim and final subsidy rates set by the CRTC are accounted for as a change in estimate in the period in which the CRTC finalizes the subsidy rate.\n\n## Other and mobile equipment\n\nWe recognize product revenues, including amounts related to mobile handsets sold to re-sellers and customer premises equipment, when the products are both delivered to, and accepted by, the end-user customers, irrespective of which supply channel delivers the product. With respect to mobile handsets sold to re-sellers, we consider ourselves to be the principal and primary obligor to the end-user customers. Revenues from operating leases of equipment are recognized on a systematic and rational basis (normally a straight-line basis) over the term of the lease. We recognize revenues that arise from employee and family assistance programs and from software solutions (including benefits administration) in the accounting period in which they are provided.\n\nWe recognize revenues that arise from the provision of digital customer experience solutions, including artificial intelligence and content management solutions, in the accounting period in which they are provided, typically on a per-productive hour or per-transaction basis.\n\n## (f) Deprec/i.ss01at/i.ss01on/comma.ss01 amort/i.ss01zat/i.ss01on and /i.ss01mpa/i.ss01rment\n\n## Depreciation and amortization\n\nProperty, plant and equipment (including right-of-use lease assets) are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (lease terms for right-of-use lease assets) as determined by a continuing program of asset life studies. Depreciation includes amortization of leasehold improvements, which are normally amortized over the lesser of their expected average service lives or the terms of the associated leases. Intangible assets with finite lives (intangible assets subject to amortization) are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which are reviewed at least annually and adjusted as appropriate. As referred to in (b) , the use of a straight-line basis of depreciation and amortization is a significant judgment for us.\n\nEstimated useful lives for the majority of our property, plant and equipment (including right-of-use lease assets) and intangible assets subject to depreciation and amortization are as follows:\n\n|                                                                                               | Estimated useful lives   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Property, plant and equipment (including right-  of-use lease assets) subject to depreciation |                          |\n| Network assets                                                                                |                          |\n| Outside plant                                                                                 | 17 to 40 years           |\n| Inside plant                                                                                  | 4 to 25 years            |\n| Mobile site equipment                                                                         | 5 to 7 years             |\n| Real estate right-of-use lease assets                                                         | 5 to 20 years            |\n| Balance of depreciable property, plant and   equipment and right-of-use lease assets          | 3 to 40 years            |\n| Intangible assets subject to amortization                                                     |                          |\n| Customer contracts and related customer relationships                                         | 4 to 15 years            |\n| Fixed subscriber base                                                                         | 25 years                 |\n| Software                                                                                      | 3 to 10 years            |\n| Access to rights-of-way, crowdsource assets and other                                         | 5 to 30 years            |",

        "page_content": "## Impairment - general\n\nImpairment testing compares the carrying values of the assets or cash-generating units being tested with their recoverable amounts (the recoverable amount being the greater of an asset's or a cashgenerating unit's value in use or its fair value less costs of disposal); as referred to in (b) , this is a significant estimate for us. Impairment losses are immediately recognized to the extent that the carrying value of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Should the recoverable amounts for impaired assets or cash-generating units subsequently increase, the impairment losses previously recognized (other than in respect of goodwill) may be reversed to the extent that the reversal is not a result of 'unwinding of the discount' and that the resulting carrying values do not exceed the carrying values which would have been the result if no impairment losses had been recognized previously.\n\n## Impairment - property, plant and equipment; intangible assets subject to amortization\n\nThe continuing program of asset life studies considers such items as the timing of technological obsolescence, competitive pressures and future infrastructure utilization plans; these considerations could also indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, in which case an impairment loss would be recognized.\n\n## Impairment - intangible assets with indefinite lives; goodwill\n\nThe carrying values of intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill are periodically tested for impairment. The frequency of impairment testing is generally the reciprocal of the stability of any relevant events and circumstances, but intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill must, at a minimum, be tested annually; we have selected December as the time of our annual test.\n\nWe assess our intangible assets with indefinite lives by comparing the recoverable amounts of our cash-generating units to their carrying values (including the intangible assets with indefinite lives allocated to a cash-generating unit, but excluding any goodwill allocated to a cashgenerating unit). To the extent that the carrying value of a cash-generating unit (including the intangible assets with indefinite lives allocated to the cash-generating unit, but excluding any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit) exceeds its recoverable amount, the excess amount would be recorded as a reduction of the carrying value of intangible assets with indefinite lives.\n\nSubsequent to assessing intangible assets with indefinite lives, we assess goodwill by comparing the recoverable amounts of our cashgenerating units (or group of cash-generating units) to their carrying values (including the intangible assets with indefinite lives and any goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units). To the extent that the carrying value of a cash-generating unit (including the intangible assets with indefinite lives and the goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit) exceeds its recoverable amount, the excess amount would first be recorded as a reduction of the carrying value of goodwill and any remainder would be recorded as a reduction of the carrying values of the assets of the cash-generating unit on a pro-rated basis.\n\n## (g) Trans/l.ss08at/i.ss01on of fore/i.ss01gn currenc/i.ss01es\n\nTrade transactions completed in foreign currencies are translated into Canadian dollars at the rates of exchange prevailing at the time of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Canadian dollars at the rate of exchange in effect at the statement of financial position date, with any resulting gain or loss recorded in the Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income as a component of Financing costs, as set out in Note 9 . Hedge accounting is applied in specific instances, as discussed further in (d) preceding.\n\nCertain of our foreign subsidiaries do not have the Canadian dollar as their functional currency. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the translation of these foreign subsidiaries' accounts into Canadian dollars are reported as a component of other comprehensive income, as set out in Note 11 .\n\n## (h) Income and other taxes\n\nWe follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes; as referred to in (b) , this is a significant estimate for us. Under this method, current income taxes are recognized for the estimated income taxes payable for the current year. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the tax and accounting bases of assets and liabilities, and also for any benefits of losses and Investment Tax Credits available to be carried forward to future years for tax purposes that are more likely than not to be realized. The amounts recognized in respect of deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based upon the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences or the usage of tax losses and the application of the substantively enacted tax rates at the time of reversal or usage.\n\nWe account for any changes in substantively enacted income tax rates affecting deferred income tax assets and liabilities in full in the period in which the changes are substantively enacted. We account for changes in the estimates of tax balances for prior years as estimate revisions in the period in which changes in the estimates arise; we have selected this approach, as its emphasis on the statement of financial position is more consistent with the liability method of accounting for income taxes.\n\nOur operations are complex and the related domestic and foreign tax interpretations, regulations, legislation and jurisprudence are continually changing. As a result, there are usually some tax matters in question that result in uncertain tax positions. We recognize the income tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only when it is more likely than not that the ultimate determination of the tax treatment of the position will result in that benefit being realized; however, this does not mean that tax authorities cannot challenge these positions. We accrue an amount for interest charges on current tax liabilities that have not been funded, which would include interest and penalties arising from uncertain tax positions. We include such charges in the Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income as a component of Financing costs.\n\nOur research and development activities may be eligible to earn Investment Tax Credits, for which the determination of eligibility is a complex matter. We recognize Investment Tax Credits only when there is reasonable assurance that the ultimate determination of the eligibility of our research and development activities will result in the Investment Tax Credits being received, at which time they are accounted for using the cost reduction method, whereby such credits are deducted from the expenditures or assets to which they relate, as set out in Note 10(c) .",

When share-based compensation vests in tranches (graded-vesting), we recognize the expense using the accelerated expense attribution method. An estimate of forfeitures during the vesting period is made at the date of grant of such share-based compensation; this estimate is adjusted to reflect actual experience.\n\n## Restricted share units\n\nIn respect of restricted share units with neither an equity settlement feature nor market performance conditions, as set out in Note 14(b) , we accrue a liability equal to the product of the number of vesting restricted share units multiplied by the fair market value of the corresponding Common Shares at the end of the reporting period. Similarly, we accrue a liability for the notional subset of our restricted share units without an equity settlement feature and with market performance conditions, using a fair value determined from a Monte Carlo simulation. Restricted share units that have an equity settlement feature are accounted for as equity instruments. The expense for restricted share units that do not ultimately vest is reversed against the expense that was previously recorded in their respect.\n\n## Share option awards\n\nA fair value for share option awards is determined at the date of grant and is recognized in the financial statements. Proceeds arising from the exercise of share option awards are credited to share capital, as are the recognized grant-date fair values of the exercised share option awards.\n\nShare option awards that have a net-equity settlement feature, as set out in Note 14(d) , are accounted for as equity instruments.

The cost of pensions and other retirement benefits earned by employees is actuarially determined using the accrued benefit method pro-rated on service and management's best estimates of both salary escalation and the retirement ages of employees. In the determination of net income, net interest for each plan, which is the product of the plan's surplus (deficit) multiplied by the discount rate, is included as a component of Financing costs, as set out in Note 9 .\n\nAn amount reflecting the effect of differences between the discount rate and the actual rate of return on plan assets is included as a component of employee defined benefit plan re-measurements within Other comprehensive income, as set out in Note 11 and Note 15 . We determine the maximum economic benefit available from the plans' assets on the basis of reductions in future contributions to the plans.\n\nOn an annual basis, at a minimum, the defined benefit plan key assumptions are assessed and revised as appropriate; as referred to in (b) , these are significant estimates for us.\n\n## Defined contribution plans Defined contribution plans\n\nWe use defined contribution accounting for the Telecommunication Workers Pension Plan and the British Columbia Public Service Pension Plan, which cover certain of our employees and provide defined benefits to their members. In the absence of any regulations governing the calculation of the share of the underlying financial position and plan performance attributable to each employer-participant, and in the absence of contractual agreements between the plans and the employer-participants related to the financing of any shortfall (or distribution of any surplus), we account for these plans as defined contribution plans, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 19, Employee Benefits . We use defined contribution accounting for the Telecommunication Workers Pension Plan and the British Columbia Public Service Pension Plan, which cover certain of our employees and provide defined benefits to their members. In the absence of any regulations governing the calculation of the share of the underlying financial position and plan performance attributable to each employer-participant, and in the absence of contractual agreements between the plans and the employer-participants related to the financing of any shortfall (or distribution of any surplus), we account for these plans as defined contribution plans, in accordance with International Accounting Standard 19, Employee Benefits .\n\n## (k) Cash and temporary /i.ss01nvestments/comma.ss01 net\n\nCash and temporary investments, which may include investments in money market instruments that are purchased three months or less from maturity, are presented net of outstanding items, including cheques written but not cleared by the related banks as at the statement of financial position date. Cash and temporary investments, net, are classified as a liability in the statement of financial position when the total amount of all cheques written but not cleared by the related banks exceeds the amount of cash and temporary investments. When cash and temporary investments, net, are classified as a liability, they may also include overdraft amounts drawn on our bilateral bank facilities, which revolve daily and are discussed further in Note 22 .\n\n## (/l.ss08) Inventor/i.ss01es\n\nOur inventories primarily consist of mobile handsets, parts and accessories totalling $414 million as at December 31, 2022 (2021 - $381 million), and communications equipment held for resale. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value, with cost being determined on an average cost basis.

Where property, plant and equipment construction projects are of sufficient size and duration, an amount is capitalized for the cost of funds used to finance construction, as set out in Note 9 . The rate for calculating the capitalized financing cost is based on the weighted average cost of borrowing that we experience during the reporting period.\n\nWhen we sell property, plant and/or equipment, the net book value is netted against the sale proceeds and the difference, as set out in Note 7 ,  is included in the Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income as a component of Other income.",

The obligations are measured initially at fair value, which is determined using present value methodology, and the resulting costs are capitalized as a part of the carrying value of the related asset. In subsequent periods, the provisions for these liabilities are adjusted for the accretion of discount, for any changes in the market-based discount rate and for any changes in the amount or timing of the underlying future cash flows. The capitalized asset retirement cost is depreciated on the same basis as the related asset and the discount accretion, as set out in Note 9 , is included in the Consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive income as a component of Financing costs.

The excess of the cost of an equity investment over its underlying book value at the date of acquisition, except for goodwill, is amortized over the estimated useful lives of the underlying assets to which the excess cost is attributed.\n\nSimilarly, we account for our interests in the real estate joint ventures, as discussed further in Note 21 , using the equity method of accounting. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from transactions with (including contributions to) the real estate joint ventures are deferred in proportion to our remaining interest in the real estate joint ventures.\n\nWe account for our other long-term investments at their fair values unless they are investment securities that do not have either quoted market prices in an active market or other clear and objective evidence of fair value. When we do not account for our other long-term investments at their fair values, we use the cost basis of accounting, whereby the investments are initially recorded at cost, and earnings from those investments are recognized only to the extent received or receivable. When there is a significant or prolonged decline in the value of an investment that is classified as one of our other long-term investments, its carrying value is adjusted to its estimated fair value.\n\n- the impacts of the amended standards, but do not expect that our financial disclosure will be materially affected by the application of the amendments.\n- /bullet.ss01 In May 2021, the International Accounting Standards Board issued targeted amendments to IAS 12, Income Taxes . The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, although earlier application was permitted.

In order to maintain or adjust our financial capital structure, we may adjust the amount of dividends paid to holders of Common Shares, purchase Common Shares for cancellation pursuant to normal course issuer bids, issue new shares (including Common Shares and TELUS International (Cda) Inc. subordinate voting shares), issue new debt, issue new debt to replace existing debt with different characteristics, and/or increase or decrease the amount of trade receivables sold to an arm's-length securitization trust.\n\nDuring 2022, our financial objectives, which are reviewed annually, were unchanged from 2021. We believe that our financial objectives are supportive of our long-term strategy.\n\nWe monitor financial capital utilizing a number of measures, including: net debt to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA*) - excluding restructuring and other costs ratio; coverage ratios; and dividend payout ratios.\n\n## Debt and coverage rat/i.ss01os\n\nNet debt to EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs is calculated as net debt at the end of the period, divided by 12-month trailing EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs. This measure, historically, is substantially similar to the leverage ratio covenant in our credit facilities, except that the covenant includes in EBITDA the unrealized effects of non-currency risk-related derivative financial instruments that are held for trading (see Note 4(h) ). Net debt and EBITDA - excluding restructuring and other costs are measures that do not have any standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS-IASB and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. The calculation of these measures is set out in the following table.

We believe that our use of derivative financial instruments for hedging or arbitrage assists us in managing our financing costs and/or reducing the uncertainty associated with our financing or other business activities. Uncertainty associated with currency risk and other price risk is reduced through our use of foreign exchange derivatives that effectively swap floating currency exchange rates for fixed rates. When entering into derivative financial instrument contracts, we seek to align the cash flow timing of the hedging items with that of the hedged items. The effects of this risk management strategy and its application are set out in (i) following.\n\n## (b) Cred/i.ss01t r/i.ss01sk\n\nExcluding credit risk, if any, arising from currency swaps settled on a gross basis, the best representation of our maximum exposure (excluding income tax effects) to credit risk, which is a worst-case scenario and does not reflect results we expect, is set out in the following table.\n\n| As at December 31 (millions)        | 2022     | 2021     |\n|-------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Cash and temporary investments, net | $  974   | $  723   |\n| Accounts receivable                 | 3,868    | 3,216    |\n| Contract assets                     | 761      | 749      |\n| Derivative assets                   | 333      | 89       |\n|                                     | $  5,936 | $  4,777 |\n\n## Cash and temporary investments, net\n\nCredit risk associated with cash and temporary investments is managed by ensuring that these financial assets are placed with: governments; major financial institutions that have been accorded strong investment grade ratings by a primary rating agency; and/or other creditworthy counterparties.

Accounts are considered to be past due (in default) when customers have failed to make the contractually required payments when due, which is generally within 30 days of the billing date. Any late payment charges are levied at an industry-based market rate or a negotiated rate on outstanding non-current customer account balances.\n\n|                                                                        | As at December 31 (millions)   | As at December 31 (millions)   | As at December 31 (millions)   | 2022         | As at December 31 (millions)   | As at December 31 (millions)   | 2021         |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------|\n|                                                                        | Note                           | Gross                          | Allowance                      | Net/one.numr | Gross                          | Allowance                      | Net/one.numr |\n| Customer accounts receivable,   net of allowance for doubtful accounts |                                |                                |                                |              |                                |                                |              |\n| Less than 30 days past billing date                                    |                                | $  936                         | $ (11)                         | $  925       | $  900                         | $      (8)                     | $  892       |\n| 30-60 days past billing date                                           |                                | 400                            | (11)                           | 389          | 338                            | (7)                            | 331          |\n| 61-90 days past billing date                                           |                                | 185                            | (15)                           | 170          | 93                             | (9)                            | 84           |\n| More than 90 days past billing date                                    |                                | 192                            | (33)                           | 159          | 114                            | (21)                           | 93           |\n| Unbilled customer finance receivables                                  |                                | 1,509                          | (39)                           | 1,470        | 1,323                          | (65)                           | 1,258        |\n|                                                                        |                                | $  3,222                       | $  ( 1 09)                     | $  3,113     | $  2,768                       | $  (110)                       | $  2,658     |\n| Current                                                                | 6(b)                           | $  2,636                       | $ (94)                         | $  2,542     | $  2,194                       | $ (81)                         | $  2,113     |\n| Non-current                                                            | 20                             | 586                            | (15)                           | 571          | 574                            | (29)                           | 545          |\n|                                                                        |                                | $  3,222                       | $  ( 1 09)                     | $  3,113     | $  2,768                       | $  (110)                       | $  2,658     |\n\nWe maintain allowances for lifetime expected credit losses related to doubtful accounts. Current economic conditions (including forwardlooking macroeconomic data), historical information (including credit agency reports, if available), reasons for the accounts being past due and the line of business from which the customer accounts receivable arose are all considered when determining whether to make allowances for past-due accounts. The same factors are considered when determining whether to write off amounts charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts against the customer accounts receivable. The doubtful accounts expense is calculated on a specific-identification basis for customer accounts receivable balances above a specific threshold and on a statistically derived allowance basis for the remainder.\n\nNo customer accounts receivable are written off directly to the doubtful accounts expense.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of the activity related to our allowance for doubtful accounts.\n\n| Years ended December 31 (millions)                 | 2022        | 2021     |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------|----------|\n| Balance, beginning of period                       | $      110  | $   1 40 |\n| Additions (doubtful accounts expense)              | 82          | 42       |\n| Accounts written off/one.numr less than recoveries | (89)        | (77)     |\n| Other                                              | 6           | 5        |\n| Balance, end of period                             | $      1 09 | $   110  |\n\n## Contract assets\n\nCredit risk associated with contract assets is inherently managed by the size and diversity of our large customer base, which includes substantially all consumer and business sectors in Canada.

Current economic conditions, historical information (including credit agency reports, if available), and the line of business from which the contract asset arose are all considered when determining impairment allowances. The same factors are considered when determining whether to write off amounts charged to the impairment allowance for contract assets against contract assets.\n\n## Derivative assets (and derivative liabilities)\n\nCounterparties to our material foreign exchange derivatives are major financial institutions that have been accorded investment grade ratings by a primary credit rating agency. The total dollar amount of credit exposure under contracts with any one financial institution is limited and counterparties' credit ratings are monitored. We do not give or receive collateral on swap agreements and hedging items due to our credit rating and those of our counterparties. While we are exposed to the risk of potential credit losses due to the possible non-performance of our counterparties, we consider this risk remote. Our derivative liabilities do not have credit risk-related contingent features.\n\n## (c) L/i.ss01qu/i.ss01d/i.ss01ty r/i.ss01sk\n\nAs a component of our capital structure financial policies, discussed further in Note 3 , we manage liquidity risk by:\n\n- /bullet.ss01 maintaining a daily cash pooling process that enables us to manage our available liquidity and our liquidity requirements according to our actual needs;\n- /bullet.ss01 maintaining an agreement to sell trade receivables to an arm's-length securitization trust and bilateral bank facilities (Note 22) , a commercial paper program (Note 26(c)) and syndicated credit facilities (Note 26(d) , (e) );\n- /bullet.ss01 maintaining in-effect shelf prospectuses;\n- /bullet.ss01 managing maturity profiles of financial assets and financial liabilities.\n- /bullet.ss01 continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows; and\n\nOur debt maturities in future years are disclosed in Note 26(i) . As at December 31, 2022, TELUS Corporation could offer an unlimited amount of securities in Canada, and US$3.5 billion of securities in the U.S., qualified pursuant to a Canadian shelf prospectus that is in effect until September 2024 (2021 - $2.75 billion of debt or equity securities pursuant to a shelf prospectus that was in effect until June 2023). We believe that our investment grade credit ratings contribute to reasonable access to capital markets. TELUS International (Cda) Inc. has a Canadian shelf prospectus that is in effect until May 2024 under which an unlimited amount of debt or equity securities could be offered.\n\nWe closely match the contractual maturities of our derivative financial liabilities with those of the risk exposures they are being used to manage.\n\nThe expected maturities of our undiscounted financial liabilities do not differ significantly from the contractual maturities, other than as noted below. The contractual maturities of our undiscounted financial liabilities, including interest thereon (where applicable), are set out in the following tables.\n\n|                             | Non-derivative                   | Non-derivative      | Non-derivative                               | Non-derivative           | Derivative                                                   | Derivative                                                   | Derivative                                          | Derivative                                          |           |\n|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n|                             |                                  |                     | Composite long-term debt                     | Composite long-term debt | Composite long-term debt                                     | Composite long-term debt                                     |                                                     |                                                     |           |\n| As at   December 31,   2022 | Non-interest  bearing  financial | Short-term          | Long- term debt,  excluding  leases/one.numr | Leases                   | Currency swap   agreement amounts   to be exchanged/two.numr | Currency swap   agreement amounts   to be exchanged/two.numr | Currency swap   agreement amounts   to be exchanged | Currency swap   agreement amounts   to be exchanged |           |\n| (millions)                  | liabilities                      | borrowings/one.numr | (Note 26)                                    | (Note 26)                | (Receive)                                                    | Pay                                                          | (Receive)                                           | Pay                                                 | Total     |\n| 2023                        | $  3,613                         | $   9               | $ 2,907                                      | $  596                   | $  ( 1 ,679)                                                 | $ 1,674                                                      | $  (669)                                            | $  648                                              | $ 7,099   |\n| 2024                        | 254                              | 105                 | 3,126                                        | 537                      | (201)                                                        | 193                                                          | -

The U.S. dollar is the only foreign currency to which we have a significant exposure as at the balance sheet date.\n\nOur currency risk management includes the use of foreign currency forward contracts and currency options to fix the exchange rates on a varying percentage, typically in the range of 50% to 75%, of our domestic short-term U.S. dollar-denominated transactions and commitments and all U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper. Other than in respect of U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper, we designate only the spot element of these instruments as the hedging item, as the forward element is wholly immaterial; in respect of U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper, we designate the forward rate.\n\nAs discussed further in Note 26(b) and Note 26(f) , we are also exposed to currency risk in that the fair value or future cash flows of our U.S. Dollar Notes and our TELUS International (Cda) Inc. credit facility U.S. dollar borrowings could fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates. Currency hedging relationships have been established for the related semi-annual interest payments and the principal payment at maturity in respect of the U.S. Dollar Notes; we designate only the spot element of these instruments as the hedging item, as the forward element is wholly immaterial. As the functional currency of our TELUS International (Cda) Inc. subsidiary is the U.S. dollar, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates affecting its borrowings are reflected as a foreign currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive income.\n\n## (e) Interest rate r/i.ss01sk\n\nChanges in market interest rates will cause fluctuations in the fair values or future cash flows of temporary investments, construction credit facility advances made to the real estate joint venture, short-term obligations, long-term debt and interest rate swap derivatives.\n\nWhen we have temporary investments, they have short maturities and fixed interest rates and, as a result, their fair values will fluctuate with changes in market interest rates; absent monetization prior to maturity, the related future cash flows will not change due to changes in market interest rates.\n\nIf the balance of short-term investments includes dividend-paying equity instruments, we could be exposed to interest rate risk.\n\nDue to the short-term nature of the applicable rates of interest charged, the fair value of the construction credit facility advances made to the real estate joint venture is not materially affected by changes in market interest rates; the associated cash flows representing interest payments will be affected until such advances are repaid.\n\nAs short-term obligations arising from bilateral bank facilities, which typically have variable interest rates, are rarely outstanding for periods that exceed one calendar week, interest rate risk associated with this item is not material.\n\nShort-term borrowings arising from the sales of trade receivables to an arm's-length securitization trust are fixed-rate debts. Due to the short maturities of these borrowings, interest rate risk associated with this item is not material.\n\nAll of our currently outstanding long-term debt, other than commercial paper and amounts drawn on our credit facilities ( Note 26(c) , (e) ), is fixed-rate debt. The fair value of fixed-rate debt fluctuates with changes in market interest rates; absent early redemption, the related future cash flows will not change. Due to the short maturities of commercial paper, its fair value is not materially affected by changes in market interest rates, but the associated cash flows representing interest payments may be affected if the commercial paper is rolled over.\n\nAmounts drawn on our short-term and long-term credit facilities will be affected by changes in market interest rates in a manner similar to commercial paper.",

The fair value of the virtual power purchase agreement forward element and the associated future cash flows will vary depending upon actual and estimated changes in the electricity spot price, and the electrical power to be produced in the future under each agreement, referenced in the underlying cashsettled contracts for differences.\n\n## Long-term investments\n\nWe are exposed to equity price risk arising from investments classified as fair value through other comprehensive income. Such investments are held for strategic rather than trading purposes.\n\n## (g) Market r/i.ss01sks\n\nNet income and other comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, could have varied if the Canadian dollar: U.S. dollar exchange rate, the U.S. dollar: European euro exchange rate, market interest rates and virtual power purchase agreement forward\n\nelement valuation varied by reasonably possible amounts from their actual statement of financial position date amounts.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis of our exposure to currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based upon a hypothetical change taking place at the relevant statement of financial position date. The U.S. dollar-denominated and European euro-denominated balances and the notional amounts of our derivative financial instruments as at the relevant statement of financial position dates have been used in the calculations.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis of our exposure to interest rate risk at the reporting date has been determined based upon a hypothetical change taking place at the beginning of the relevant fiscal year and being held constant through to the statement of financial position date. The principal and notional amounts as at the relevant statement of financial position date have been used in the calculations.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis of our exposure to wind discount risk and solar premium risk at the reporting date has been determined based upon a hypothetical change taking place at the relevant statement of financial position date. The notional amounts of the virtual power purchase agreements as at the relevant statement of financial position dates have been used in the calculations.\n\nIncome tax expense, which is reflected net in the sensitivity analysis, reflects the applicable statutory income tax rates for the reporting periods.\n\n(7)\n\n| Twelve-month periods ended December 31               | Net income        | Net income         | Other comprehensive income   | Other comprehensive income   | Comprehensive income   | Comprehensive income   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| (increase (decrease) in millions)                    | 2022              | 2021               | 2022                         | 2021                         | 2022                   | 2021                   |\n| Reasonably possible changes in market risks/one.numr |                   |                    |                              |                              |                        |                        |\n| 10% change in C$: US$ exchange rate                  |                   |                    |                              |                              |                        |                        |\n| Canadian dollar appreciates                          | $ (6)             | $ 1                | $   /thinspace19             | $  (33)                      | $   /thinspace13       | $  (32)                |\n| Canadian dollar depreciates                          | $   /thinspace  6 | $ (1)              | $  (19)                      | $  33                        | $  (13)                | $   32                 |\n| 10% change in US$: \u20ac exchange rate                   |                   |                    |                              |                              |                        |                        |\n| U.S. dollar appreciates                              | $   /thinspace16  | $    1 1           | $  (60)                      | $  (67)                      | $  (44)                | $  (56)                |\n| U.S. dollar depreciates                              | $  (16)           | $  (11)            | $   /thinspace60             | $   67                       | $   /thinspace44       | $   56                 |\n| 25 basis point change in interest rates              |                   |                    |                              |                              |                        |                        |\n| Interest rates increase                              |                   |                    |                              |                              |                        |                        |\n| Canadian interest rate                               | $ (8)             | $ (4)              | $   /thinspace76             | $   90                       | $   /thinspace68       | $   86                 |\n| U.S. interest rate                                   | $   -

transactions with the other component(s)), the operations of which can be clearly distinguished and for which the operating results are regularly reviewed by a chief operating decision-maker to make resource allocation decisions and to assess performance. Effective September 1, 2022, we embarked upon the modification of our internal and external reporting processes, systems and internal controls concurrent with the acquisition and integration of LifeWorks Inc., as referenced in Note 18(b) , and correspondingly are assessing our segmented reporting structure.\n\nThe TELUS technology solutions segment includes: network revenues and equipment sales arising from mobile technologies; data revenues (which include internet protocol; television; hosting,\n\nmanaged information technology and cloud-based services; and home and business security); healthcare software and technology solutions (including employee and family assistance programs and benefits administration); agriculture and consumer goods services (software, data management and data analytics-driven smart-food chain and consumer goods technologies); voice and other telecommunications services revenues; and equipment sales.\n\nThe digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International (DLCX) segment, which has the U.S. dollar as its primary functional currency, is comprised of digital customer experience and digital-enablement transformation solutions, including artificial intelligence and content management, provided by our TELUS International (Cda) Inc. subsidiary.\n\nIntersegment sales are recorded at the exchange value, which is the amount agreed to by the parties.",

To ameliorate the situation, the CRTC directs the collection of contribution payments, in a central fund, from all registered Canadian telecommunications\n\nservice providers (including voice, data and mobile service providers) that are then disbursed to incumbent local exchange carriers as subsidy payments to partially offset the costs of providing residential basic telephone services in non-forborne high cost serving areas.

In our specific instance, this is relevant to our investments in Canadian subsidiaries and Canadian partnerships. We are not required to recognize such deferred income tax liabilities, as we are in a position to control the timing and manner of the reversal of the temporary differences, which would not be expected to be exigible to income tax, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. We are in a position\n\nto control the timing and manner of the reversal of the temporary differences in respect of our non-Canadian subsidiaries, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\n## (c) Other\n\nWe conduct research and development activities, which may be eligible to earn Investment Tax Credits. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded Investment Tax Credits of $11 million (2021 - $21 million). Of this amount, $9 million (2021 - $14 million) was recorded as a reduction of property, plant and equipment and/or intangible assets and the balance was recorded as a reduction of goods and services purchased.",

Each restricted share unit is nominally equal in value to one equity share and is nominally entitled to the dividends that would arise thereon if it were an issued and outstanding equity share. The notional dividends are recorded as additional issuances of restricted share units during the life of the restricted share unit. Due to the notional dividend mechanism, the grant-date fair value of restricted share units equals the fair market value of the corresponding equity shares at the grant date, other than for the notional subset of our restricted share units affected by the relative total shareholder return performance condition (for which a grant-date fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation). The restricted share units generally become payable when vesting is complete; TELUS Corporation restricted share units typically vest over a period of 33 months (the requisite service period) and TELUS International (Cda) Inc. restricted share units typically vest over a period of 48 months (the requisite service period). The vesting method of restricted share units, which is determined on or before the date of grant, may be either cliff or graded; the majority of TELUS Corporation restricted share units outstanding are cliff-vesting and the majority of TELUS International (Cda) Inc. restricted share units are graded-vesting. Accounting for restricted share units, as either equity instruments or liability instruments, is based upon\n\nthe expected manner of their settlement when they are granted. Grants of TELUS Corporation restricted share units prior to fiscal 2019, and grants of TELUS International (Cda) Inc. restricted share units prior to fiscal 2021, were accounted for as liability instruments, as the associated obligations were normally expected to be cash-settled when granted.\n\n## TELUS Corporation restricted share units\n\nWe also award restricted share units that largely have the same features as our general restricted share units, but have a variable payout (0% - 200%) that depends upon the achievement of our total customer connections performance condition (with a weighting of 25%) and the total shareholder return on TELUS Corporation Common Shares relative to an international peer group of telecommunications companies (with a weighting of 75%). The grant-date fair value of the notional subset of our restricted share units affected by the total customer connections performance condition equals the fair market value of the corresponding TELUS Corporation Common Shares at the grant date, and thus the notional subset has been included in the presentation of our restricted share units with only service conditions. Reflecting a variable payout, our estimate of the fair value of the notional subset of our restricted share units affected by the relative total shareholder return performance condition is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation. Grants of restricted share units in 2022 and 2021 are accounted for as equity-settled, as that was the expected manner of their settlement when granted.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of outstanding TELUS Corporation non-vested restricted share units.\n\n| Number of non-vested restricted share units as at December 31                       | 2022      | 2021      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Restricted share units without market performance conditions                        |           |           |\n| Restricted share units with only service conditions                                 | 5,224,220 | 5,481,486 |\n| Notional subset affected by total customer connections performance condition        | 357,263   | 366,983   |\n|                                                                                     | 5,581,483 | 5,848,469 |\n| Restricted share units with market performance conditions                           |           |           |\n| Notional subset affected by relative total shareholder return performance condition | 1,071,789 | 1,100,949 |\n|                                                                                     | 6,653,272 | 6,949,418 |\n\nThe following table presents a summary of the activity related to TELUS Corporation restricted share units without market performance conditions.\n\n| Years ended December 31          | 2022 2021                                   | 2022 2021                                   | 2022 2021                | 2022 2021                                   | 2022 2021                                   | 2022 2021                |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                  | Number of   restricted share units/one.numr | Number of   restricted share units/one.numr | Weighted  average grant- | Number of   restricted share units/one.numr | Number of   restricted share units/one.numr | Weighted  average grant- |\n|                                  | Non-vested                                  | Vested                                      | date fair value          | Non-vested                                  | Vested                                      | date fair value          |\n| Outstanding, beginning of period |                                             |                                             |                          |                                             |                                             |                          |\n| Non-vested                       | 5,848,469                                   | -

In respect of TELUS Corporation Common Shares held within the employee share purchase plan, TELUS Corporation Common Share dividends declared during the year ended December 31, 2022, of $47 million (2021 - $42 million) were to be reinvested in TELUS Corporation Common Shares acquired by the trustee from Treasury, with a discount applicable, as set out in Note 13(b) .\n\n## (d) Share opt/i.ss01on awards\n\n## General\n\nWe use share option awards as a form of retention and incentive compensation. We apply the fair value method of accounting for share-based compensation awards granted to officers and other employees. Share option awards typically have a three-year vesting period (the requisite service period). The vesting method of share option awards, which is determined on or before the date of grant, may be either cliff or graded; all TELUS Corporation share option awards granted subsequent to 2004 have been cliff-vesting.\n\nThe weighted average fair value of share option awards granted is calculated by using the Black-Scholes model (a closed-form option pricing model). The risk-free interest rate used in determining the fair\n\nvalue of the share option awards is based on a Government of Canada yield curve that is current at the time of grant. The expected lives of the share option awards are based on our historical share option award exercise data. Similarly, expected volatility considers the historical volatility in the price of our Common Shares in respect of TELUS Corporation share options and the average historical volatility in the prices of a peer group's shares, and in the price of TELUS International (Cda) Inc.'s shares in respect of TELUS International (Cda) Inc. share options. The dividend yield is the annualized dividend current at the time of grant divided by the share option award exercise price. Dividends are not paid on unexercised share option awards and are not subject to vesting.\n\n## TELUS Corporation share options\n\nEmployees may be granted share option awards to purchase TELUS Corporation Common Shares at an exercise price equal to the fair market value at the time of grant. Share option awards granted under the plan may be exercised over specific periods not to exceed seven years from the date of grant. Share option awards granted in fiscal 2021 were for front-line employees.\n\nThese share option awards have a net-equity settlement feature. The optionee does not have the choice of exercising the net-equity settlement feature; it is at our option whether the exercise of a share option award is settled as a share option or settled using the net-equity settlement feature.\n\nThe following table presents a summary of the activity related to the TELUS Corporation share option plan.\n\n| Years ended December 31          | 2022                      | 2022                                            | 2021                      | 2021                                    |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n|                                  | Number of   share options | Weighted   average share  option price/one.numr | Number of   share options | Weighted   average share   option price |\n| Outstanding, beginning of period | 3,050,300                 | $  22.04                                        | 3,014,700                 | $  21.59                                |\n| Granted                          | -                         | $         -                                     | 324,900                   | $  25.96                                |\n| Forfeited                        | (295,000)                 | $  21.93                                        | (289,300)                 | $  21.75                                |\n| Outstanding, end of period       | 2,755,300                 | $  22.05                                        | 3,050,300                 | $  22.04                                |",

The actual PBSR solvency positions are determined in conjunction with mid-year annual funding reports prepared by actuaries (see (e) ); as a result, the PBSR solvency positions in this table as at December 31, 2022 and 2021, are interim estimates and updated estimates, respectively. The interim estimate as at December 31, 2021, was a net surplus of $1,366.\n\nThe solvency valuation effectively uses the fair value (excluding any asset ceiling limit effects) of the funded defined benefit pension plan assets (adjusted for theoretical wind-up expenses) to measure the solvency valuation assets. Although the defined benefit obligations accrued and the solvency valuation liabilities are calculated similarly, the assumptions used for each differ, primarily in respect of retirement ages and discount rates, and the solvency valuation liabilities, due to the required assumption that each plan is terminated on the valuation date, do not reflect assumptions about future compensation levels. Relative to the experience-based estimates of retirement ages used for purposes of determining the defined benefit obligations accrued, the minimum no-consent retirement age used for solvency valuation purposes may result in either a greater or lesser pension liability, depending upon the provisions of each plan. The solvency positions in this table reflect composite weighted average discount rates of 4.8% (2021 - 2.9%). A hypothetical decrease of 25 basis points in the composite weighted average discount rate would result in a $182 decrease in the PBSR solvency position as at December 31, 2022 (2021 - $297); these sensitivities are hypothetical, should be used with caution, are calculated without changing any other assumption and generally cannot be extrapolated because changes in amounts may not be linear.\n\n## (b) Pens/i.ss01on p/l.ss08ans and other def/i.ss01ned benef/i.ss01t p/l.ss08ans - overv/i.ss01ew\n\nWe have a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans that provide pension and other retirement and post-employment benefits to most of our employees. As at December 31, 2022 and 2021, all registered defined benefit pension plans were closed to substantially all new participants and substantially all benefits had vested. The benefit plans in which our employees are participants reflect developments in our corporate history.\n\n## TELUS Corporation Pension Plan\n\nManagement and professional employees in Alberta who joined us prior to January 1, 2001, and certain unionized employees who joined us prior to June 9, 2011, are covered by this contributory defined benefit pension plan, which comprises slightly more than one-half of our total defined benefit obligation accrued. The plan contains a supplemental benefit account that may provide indexation of up to 70% of the annual increase in a specified cost-of-living index. Pensionable remuneration is determined by the average of the best five years of remuneration in the last ten consecutive years preceding retirement.\n\n## Pension Plan for Management and Professional Employees of TELUS Corporation\n\nThis defined benefit pension plan, which with certain limited exceptions ceased accepting new participants on January 1, 2006, and which comprises approximately one-quarter of our total defined benefit obligation accrued, provides a non-contributory base level of pension benefits. Additionally, on a contributory basis, employees annually can choose increased and/or enhanced levels of pension benefits above the base level. At an enhanced level of pension benefits, the plan has indexation of 100% of the annual increase in a specified cost-of-living index, to an annual maximum of 2%. Pensionable remuneration is determined by the annualized average of the best 60 consecutive months of remuneration.\n\n## TELUS Qu\u00e9bec Defined Benefit Pension Plan\n\nThis contributory defined benefit pension plan, which ceased accepting new participants on April 14, 2009, covers any employee not governed by a collective agreement in Quebec who joined us prior to April 1, 2006, any non-supervisory employee governed by a collective agreement who joined us prior to September 6, 2006, and certain other unionized employees. The plan comprises approximately one-tenth of our total defined benefit obligation accrued. The plan has no indexation and pensionable remuneration is determined by the average of the best four years of remuneration.\n\n## TELUS Edmonton Pension Plan\n\nThis contributory defined benefit pension plan ceased accepting new participants on January 1, 1998. Indexation is 60% of the annual increase in a specified cost-of-living index and pensionable remuneration is determined by the annualized average of the best 60 consecutive months of\n\nremuneration. The plan comprises less than one-tenth of our total defined benefit obligation accrued.\n\n## Other defined benefit pension plans\n\nIn addition to the foregoing plans, we have non-registered, noncontributory supplementary defined benefit pension plans, which have the effect of maintaining the pension benefit earned once the allowable maximums in the registered plans are attained. As is common with non-registered plans of this nature, these plans are typically funded only as benefits are paid. These plans comprise less than 5% of our total defined benefit obligation accrued.\n\n## Telecommunication Workers Pension Plan\n\nCertain employees in British Columbia are covered by a negotiated-cost, target-benefit union pension plan. Our contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of negotiated labour contracts (the current contract expired on December 31, 2021 - see Note 29(c) ), and are generally based on employee gross earnings. We are not required to guarantee the benefits or assure the solvency of the plan, and we are not liable to the plan for other participating employers' obligations. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our contributions comprised a significant proportion of the employer contributions to the union pension plan; similarly, a significant proportion of the plan participants were our active and retired employees.\n\n## British Columbia Public Service Pension Plan\n\nCertain employees in British Columbia are covered by a public service pension plan. Contributions are determined in accordance with provisions of labour contracts negotiated by the Province of British Columbia and are generally based on employee gross earnings.\n\n## Defined contribution pension plans\n\nWe primarily offer three defined contribution pension plans, which are contributory, and these are the primary pension plans we sponsor that are available to our non-unionized and certain of our unionized employees. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, employees could generally choose to contribute to the plans at a rate of between 3% and 10% of their pensionable earnings; generally, we match 100% of contributions of employees up to 5% of their pensionable earnings and 80% of contributions of employees between 5% and 6% of their pensionable earnings. Membership in a defined contribution pension plan is generally voluntary until an employee's third-year service anniversary. In the event that annual contributions exceed allowable maximums, excess amounts are in certain cases contributed to a non-registered supplementary defined contribution savings plan.\n\n## Other defined benefit plans\n\nOther defined benefit plans, all of which are non-contributory and, as at December 31, 2022 and 2021, non-funded, included a healthcare plan",

A secondary goal is to maximize the long-term rate of return on the defined benefit plans' assets within a level of risk acceptable to us.\n\n## Risk management\n\nWe consider absolute risk (the risk of contribution increases, inadequate plan surplus and unfunded obligations) to be more important than relative return risk. Accordingly, the defined benefit plans' designs, the nature and maturity of defined benefit obligations and the characteristics of the plans' memberships significantly influence investment strategies and policies. We manage risk by specifying allowable and prohibited investment types, setting diversification strategies and determining target asset allocations.\n\n## Allowable and prohibited investment types\n\nAllowable and prohibited investment types, along with associated guidelines and limits, are set out in each plan's required Statement of Investment Policies and Procedures (SIP&P), which is reviewed and approved annually by the designated governing body. The SIP&P guidelines and limits are further governed by the permitted investments and lending limits set out in the Pension Benefits Standards Regulations, 1985 . As well as conventional investments, each fund's SIP&P may provide for the use of derivative products to facilitate investment operations and to manage risk, provided that no short position is taken and no guidelines and limits established in the SIP&P are violated. Internally and externally managed funds are not permitted to invest directly in our securities, or those of our subsidiaries, and are prohibited from increasing\n\ngrandfathered investments in our securities; any such grandfathered investments were made prior to the merger of BC TELECOM Inc. and TELUS Corporation, our predecessors.\n\n## Diversification\n\nOur strategy for investments in equity securities is to be broadly diversified across individual securities, industry sectors and geographical regions. A meaningful portion (20% - 30% of total plan assets) of the plans' investments in equity securities is allocated to foreign equity securities, with the intent of further diversifying plan assets. Investments in debt securities may include a meaningful allocation to mortgages, with the objective of enhancing cash flow and providing greater scope for the management of the bond component of the plan assets. Debt securities may also include real return bonds to provide inflation protection, consistent with the indexed nature of some defined benefit obligations. Real estate investments are used to provide diversification of plan assets, hedging of potential long-term inflation and comparatively stable investment income.\n\n## Relationship between plan assets and benefit obligations\n\nWith the objective of lowering the long-term costs of our defined benefit pension plans, we purposely mismatch plan assets and benefit obligations. This mismatching is effected by including equity investments in the long-term asset mix, as well as fixed income securities and mortgages with durations that differ from those of the benefit obligations.\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, the present value-weighted average timing of estimated cash flows for the obligations (duration) of the defined benefit pension plans was 11.4 years (2021 - 14.0 years). Compensation for liquidity issues that may otherwise have arisen from the mismatching of plan assets and benefit obligations is provided by broadly diversified investment holdings (including cash and short-term investments) and cash flows from dividends, interest and rents from those diversified investment holdings.\n\n## Fair value measurements\n\nInformation about the fair value measurements of our defined benefit pension plan assets, in aggregate, is as follows:\n\n6\n\n|                                                                                  |          |           | Fair value measurements at reporting date using       | Fair value measurements at reporting date using       | Fair value measurements at reporting date using   | Fair value measurements at reporting date using   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                                  | Total    | Total     | Quoted prices in active   markets for identical items | Quoted prices in active   markets for identical items | Other                                             | Other                                             |\n| As at December 31 (millions)                                                     | 2022     | 2021      | 2022                                                  | 2021                                                  | 2022                                              | 2021                                              |\n| Asset class                                                                      |          |           |                                                       |                                                       |                                                   |                                                   |\n| Equity securities                                                                |          |           |                                                       |                                                       |                                                   |                                                   |\n| Canadian                                                                         | $  841   | $ 1,104   | $  708                                                | $  945                                                | $   1 33                                          | $   1 59                                          |\n| Foreign                                                                          | 2,707    | 2,861     | 500                                                   | 826                                                   | 2,207                                             | 2,035                                             |\n| Debt securities                                                                  |          |           |                                                       |                                                       |                                                   |                                                   |\n| Issued by national, provincial or local governments                              | 2,210    | 1,290     | 2,056                                                 | 1,120                                                 | 154                                               | 170                                               |\n| Corporate debt securities                                                        | 1,081    | 2,436     | -

These significant estimates are of a long-term nature, consistent with the nature of employee future benefits.\n\n## Demographic assumptions\n\nIn determining the defined benefit pension expense recognized in net income for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we utilized the Canadian Institute of Actuaries CPM 2014 mortality tables.\n\n## Financial assumptions\n\nThe discount rate, which is used to determine a plan's defined benefit obligations accrued, is based upon the yield on long-term, highquality, fixed-term investments, and is set annually. The rate of future increases in compensation is based upon current benefits policies and economic forecasts.\n\nThe significant weighted average actuarial assumptions arising from these estimates and used in measuring our defined benefit obligations accrued are as follows:\n\n|                                                                                                                                                                   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Mortality assumptions used to determine defined   benefit obligations accrued as at December 31  Life expectancy at 65 for a member currently   at age 65 (years) | 24.2   | 24.2   |\n| Discount rate/one.numr used to determine:                                                                                                                         |        |        |\n| Net benefit costs for the year ended December 31                                                                                                                  | 2.95 % | 2.50 % |\n| Defined benefit obligations accrued as at December 31                                                                                                             | 5.05 % | 2.95 % |\n| Current service cost in subsequent fiscal year                                                                                                                    | 5.05 % | 3.10 % |\n| Rate of future increases in compensation used to determine:                                                                                                       |        |        |\n| Net benefit costs for the year ended December 31                                                                                                                  | 3.00 % | 2.90 % |\n| Defined benefit obligations accrued as at December 31                                                                                                             | 3.00 % | 3.00 % |\n\n## Sensitivity of key assumptions\n\nThe sensitivity of our key assumptions for our defined benefit pension plans was as follows:\n\n(3)\n\n| Years ended, or as at, December 31                                                                  | 2022                   | 2022                | 2021                   | 2021                 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|----------------------|\n| Increase (decrease) (millions)                                                                      | Change in  obligations | Change in  expenses | Change in  obligations | Change in   expenses |\n| Sensitivity of key demographic assumptions to an increase of one year/one.numr in life expectancy   | $  213                 | $  1 1              | $  323                 | $  1 1               |\n| Sensitivity of key financial assumptions to a hypothetical decrease of 25 basis points/one.numr in: |                        |                     |                        |                      |\n| Discount rate                                                                                       | $  238                 | $  16               | $  366                 | $  13                |\n| Rate of future increases in compensation                                                            | $    (20)              | $    (3)            | $    (34)              | $                    |\n\n## (e)  Emp/l.ss08oyer contr/i.ss01but/i.ss01ons\n\nThe determination of the minimum funding amounts necessary for substantially all of our registered defined benefit pension plans is governed by the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 , which requires that current service costs be funded, and that both going-concern and solvency valuations be performed on a specified periodic basis.\n\n- /bullet.ss01 Any excess of plan assets over plan liabilities determined in the going-concern valuation reduces our minimum funding requirement for current service costs, but may not reduce the requirement to an amount less than the employees' contributions. The going-concern valuation generally determines the excess (if any) of a plan's assets over its liabilities on a projected benefit basis.\n- /bullet.ss01 As of the date of these consolidated financial statements, the solvency valuation generally requires that a plan's average solvency valuation liabilities, determined on the basis that the plan is terminated on the valuation date, in excess of its assets (if any) be funded, at a minimum, in equal annual amounts over a period not exceeding five years. So as to manage the risk of overfunding the plans, which results from the solvency valuation for funding purposes utilizing average solvency ratios, our funding may include the provision of letters of credit. As at December 31, 2022, undrawn letters of credit in the amount of $49 million (2021 - $115 million) secured certain obligations of the defined benefit pension plans, including non-registered unfunded plans.",

Incremental costs were incurred due to proactive steps we elected to take in order to keep our customers and employees safe, including adjustments to the frequency of real estate cleaning and maintenance, among other items. As well, costs that have been incurred in the normal course but which are unable to contribute normally to the earning of revenues have been deemed atypical.",

The acquisition was made with a view to growing our end-to-end capabilities to support small and medium-sized business customers.\n\nThe primary factor that contributed to the recognition of goodwill was the earnings capacity of the acquired business in excess of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired (such excess arising from the acquired workforce and the benefits of acquiring an established business).

As at December 31, 2021, purchase price allocations had not been finalized. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the preliminary acquisition-date fair values for goodwill and deferred income tax liabilities were decreased by $11 million; as required by IFRS-IASB, comparative amounts have been adjusted so as to reflect those decreases effective the dates of acquisition.\n\n## (d) Bus/i.ss01ness acqu/i.ss01s/i.ss01t/i.ss01on - subsequent to report/i.ss01ng per/i.ss01od\n\n## WillowTree\n\nOn October 27, 2022, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire WillowTree, a full-service digital product provider focused on end-user experiences, such as native mobile applications and unified web interfaces. On January 3, 2023, subsequent to the satisfaction of the closing conditions, WillowTree was acquired through our TELUS International (Cda) Inc. subsidiary and it will be consolidated in our digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International segment.\n\nUnder the agreement, WillowTree was acquired for purchase consideration of approximately US$1.1 billion (approximately $1.5 billion at foreign exchange rates at the financial position date), net of assumed debt; purchase consideration is comprised of cash, US$125 million of TELUS International (Cda) Inc. subordinate voting shares and provisions for written put options.\n\nThe acquisition brings key talent and diversity to our segment's\n\nportfolio of next-generation solutions, and further augments its digital consulting and client-centric software development capabilities. The primary factor that gave rise to the recognition of goodwill was the earnings capacity of the acquired business in excess of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired (such excess arising from the low level of tangible assets relative to the earnings capacity of the business). A portion of the amounts assigned to goodwill may be deductible for income tax purposes.\n\nIn respect of the acquired business, we concurrently provided written put options to the remaining selling shareholders for their economic interest, which will be settled subject to certain performance-based criteria and will become exercisable in tranches over a three-year period starting in 2026. The acquisition-date fair value of the puttable shares held by the non-controlling shareholders will be recorded as a provision in the three-month period ended March 31, 2023. The pro vision may be settled in cash or, at our option, in a combination of cash and up to 70% in TELUS International (Cda) Inc. subordinate voting shares. Concurrent with this acquisition, the non-controlling shareholders provided us with purchased call options, which substantially mirror the written put options.\n\nAs is customary in a business acquisition transaction, until the time of acquisition of control, we did not have full access to the books and records of WillowTree. Upon having sufficient time to review the books and records of WillowTree, as well as obtaining new and additional information about the related facts and circumstances as of the acquisition date, we will adjust provisional amounts for identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and thus finalize our purchase price allocation.\n\n## (e) Intang/i.ss01b/l.ss08e assets w/i.ss01th /i.ss01ndef/i.ss01n/i.ss01te /l.ss08/i.ss01ves spectrum /l.ss08/i.ss01cences\n\nOur intangible assets with indefinite lives include spectrum licences granted by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, which are used for the provision of both mobile and fixed wireless services. The spectrum licence policy terms indicate that the spectrum licences will likely be renewed. We expect our spectrum licences to be renewed every 20 years following a review of our compliance with licence terms. In addition to current usage, our licensed spectrum can be used for planned and new technologies. As a result of our assessment of the combination of these significant factors, we currently consider our spectrum licences to have indefinite lives and, as referred to in Note 1(b) , this represents a significant judgment for us.",

There is a material degree of uncertainty with respect to the estimates of the recoverable amounts of the cash-generating units' assets, given the necessity of making key economic assumptions about the future. Recoverable amounts based on fair value less costs of disposal calculations are categorized as Level 3 fair value measures.\n\nWe validate the results of our recoverable amounts calculations through a market-comparable approach and an analytical review of industry facts and facts that are specific to us. The market-comparable approach uses current (at time of test) market consensus estimates and equity trading prices for U.S. and Canadian firms in the same industry. In addition, we ensure that the combination of the valuations of the cashgenerating units is reasonable based on our current (at time of test) market value.\n\n## Key assumptions\n\nThe fair value less costs of disposal calculation uses discounted cash flow projections that employ the following key assumptions: future cash flows and growth projections (including judgments about the allocation of future capital expenditures to support both mobile and fixed operations); associated economic risk assumptions and estimates of the likelihood of achieving key operating metrics and drivers; estimates of future generational infrastructure capital expenditures; and the future weighted average cost of capital. We consider a range of reasonably possible amounts to use for key assumptions and decide upon amounts that represent management's best estimates of market amounts. In the normal course, we make changes to key assumptions so that they reflect\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n19\n\n## Leases\n\nWe have the right of use of land, buildings and equipment under leases. Most of our leases for real estate that we use for office, retail or network (including mobile site) purposes typically have options to extend the lease terms, which we use to protect our investment in leasehold improvements (including mobile site equipment) and to mitigate relocation risk, and/or which reflect the importance of the underlying real estate right-of-use lease assets to our operations. Judgments about lease terms are determinative of the measurement of right-of-use lease assets and the associated lease liabilities. Our judgment in respect of lease terms for\n\ncurrent (at time of test) economic conditions, updates of historical information used to develop the key assumptions and changes (if any) in our debt ratings.\n\nThe key assumptions for cash flow projections are based upon our approved financial forecasts, which span a period of three years and are discounted, for December 2022 annual impairment test purposes, at a consolidated post-tax notional rate of 6.6% (2021 - 6.6%) and 9.5% (2021 - 9.0%) for the TELUS technology solutions and the digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International cash-generating units, respectively. For impairment testing valuations, cash flows subsequent to the three-year projection period are extrapolated, for December 2022 annual impairment test purposes, generally using perpetual growth rates of 1.95% (2021 - 1.95%) and 3.0% (2021 - 3.0%) for the TELUS technology solutions cash-generating unit and the digitally-led customer experiences - TELUS International cash-generating unit, respectively; these growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rates observed in the markets in which we operate.\n\nWe believe that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the calculation of the recoverable amounts of our cash-generating units is based would not cause the cash-generating units' carrying values (including the intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill allocated to each cash-generating unit) to exceed their recoverable amounts. If the future were to adversely differ from management's best estimates for the key assumptions and associated cash flows were to be materially adversely affected, we could potentially experience future material impairment charges in respect of our intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill.\n\nleased real estate utilized in connection with our telecommunications infrastructure, more so than for any other right-of-use lease assets, routinely includes periods covered by options to extend the lease terms, as we are reasonably certain that we will choose to extend such leases.\n\nIn the normal course of operations, there are future non-executory cash outflows in respect of leases to which we are potentially exposed and which are not included in our lease liabilities as at the reporting date. A significant portion (approximately one-third) of our mobile site lease payments have consumer price index-based price adjustments and such adjustments",

As well, we routinely and necessarily commit to leases that have not yet commenced.\n\nAs mandated by Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, telecommunications companies are obligated to allow, on their real estate assets owned, on their real estate right-of-use lease assets and/or on their owned-equipment situated on real estate right-of-use lease assets, competitors to co-locate telecommunications infrastructure\n\nequipment. Of our real estate right-of-use lease assets used for purposes of situating telecommunications infrastructure equipment, less than one-fifth have co-location subleases that we, as lessor, account for as operating leases.\n\nMaturity analyses of lease liabilities are set out in Note 4(c) and Note 26(i) ; the period interest expense in respect thereof is set out in Note 9 . The additions to, the depreciation charges for, and the carrying amounts of, right-of-use lease assets are set out in Note 17 . We have not currently elected to exclude low-value and short-term leases from lease accounting.\n\n| Years ended December 31 (millions)                                | Note   | 2022   | 2021     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Income from subleasing right-of-use lease assets                  |        |        |          |\n| Co-location sublet revenue included in operating service revenues |        | $ 18   | $ 22     |\n| Other sublet revenue included in other income                     | 7      | $   5  | $      4 |\n| Lease payments                                                    |        | $  571 | $  568   |\n\n## 20 Other /l.ss08ong-term assets\n\n| As at December 31 (millions)                                 | Note   | 2022     | 2021     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------|----------|\n| Pension assets                                               | 15     | $  307   | $  453   |\n| Unbilled customer finance receivables                        | 4(b)   | 571      | 545      |\n| Derivative assets                                            | 4(h)   | 250      | 76       |\n| Deferred income taxes                                        |        | 19       | 35       |\n| Costs incurred to obtain or fulfill contracts with customers |        | 154      | 109      |\n| Real estate joint venture advances                           | 21(b)  | 114      | 114      |\n| Investment in real estate joint venture                      | 21(b)  | 1        | 1        |\n| Investment in associates                                     | 21     | 120      | 100      |\n| Portfolio investments/one.numr                               |        |          |          |\n| At fair value through net income                             |        | 21       | 26       |\n| At fair value through other comprehensive income             |        | 467      | 370      |\n| Prepaid maintenance                                          |        | 61       | 62       |\n| Refundable security deposits and other                       |        | 118      | 80       |\n|                                                              |        | $  2,203 | $  1,971 |\n\nThe costs incurred to obtain and fulfill contracts with customers are set out in the following table:\n\n| Years ended December 31 (millions)   | 2022 2021              | 2022 2021                | 2022 2021   | 2022 2021                          | 2022 2021                | 2022 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|\n|                                      | Costs incurred to      | Costs incurred to        |             | Costs incurred to                  | Costs incurred to        |             |\n|                                      | Obtain  contracts with | Fulfill   contracts with | Total       | Obtain   contracts with  customers | Fulfill   contracts with |             |\n|                                      | customers              | customers                |             |                                    | customers                | Total       |\n| Balance, beginning of period         | $  336                 | $ 6                      | $  342      | $  323                             | $  1 1                   | $  334      |\n| Additions                            | 344                    | 13                       | 357         | 282                                | 2                        | 284         |\n| Amortization                         | (276)                  | (4)                      | (280)       | (269)                              | (7)                      | (276)       |\n| Balance, end of period               | $  404                 | $  15                    | $  419      | $  336                             | $ 6                      | $  342      |\n| Current/one.numr                     | $  260                 | $ 5                      | $  265      | $  230                             | $ 3                      | $  233      |\n| Non-current                          | 144                    | 10                       | 154         | 106                                | 3                        | 109         |\n|                                      | $  404                 | $  15                    | $  419      | $  336                             | $ 6                      | $  342      |",

The construction credit facilities contain customary real estate construction financing representations, warranties and covenants and are secured by demand debentures constituting first fixed and floating charge mortgages over the underlying real estate assets. The construction credit facilities are available by way of bankers' acceptance or prime loan and bear interest at rates in line with similar construction financing facilities.",

        "page_content": "## 22 Short-term borrow/i.ss01ngs\n\nOn July 26, 2002, one of our subsidiaries, TELUS Communications Inc., entered into an agreement with an arm's-length securitization trust associated with a major Schedule I bank under which it is currently able to sell an interest in certain trade receivables up to a maximum of $600 million (unchanged from December 31, 2021). The term of this revolving-period securitization agreement ends December 31, 2024 (unchanged from December 31, 2021), and it requires minimum cash proceeds of $100 million from monthly sales of interests in certain trade receivables. TELUS Communications Inc. is required to maintain a credit rating of at least BB (2021 - BB) from DBRS Limited or the securitization trust may require that the sale program be wound down prior to the end of the term.\n\nSales of trade receivables in securitization transactions are recognized as collateralized short-term borrowings and thus do not result in our de-recognition of the trade receivables sold. When we sell our trade receivables, we retain reserve accounts, which are retained interests in the securitized trade receivables, and servicing rights. As at December 31, 2022, we had sold to the trust (but continued to recognize) trade receivables of $118 million (2021 - $118 million). Short-term borrowings of $100 million (2021 - $100 million) are comprised of amounts advanced to us by the arm's-length securitization trust pursuant to the sale of trade receivables.\n\nThe balance of short-term borrowings (if any) is comprised of amounts drawn on bilateral bank facilities and/or other.\n\n## 23 Accounts payab/l.ss08e and accrued /l.ss08/i.ss01ab/i.ss01/l.ss08/i.ss01t/i.ss01es\n\n| As at December 31 (millions)                   | 2022      | 2021      |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Accrued liabilities                            | $   1,593 | $   1,539 |\n| Payroll and other employee-related liabilities | 656       | 633       |\n| Restricted share units liability               | 1         | 28        |\n|                                                | 2,250     | 2,200     |\n| Trade accounts payable                         | 1,382     | 1,213     |\n| Interest payable                               | 206       | 173       |\n| Indirect taxes payable and other               | 109       | 119       |\n|                                                | $  3,947  | $   3,705 |\n\n## 24 Advance b/i.ss01/l.ss08/l.ss08/i.ss01ngs and customer depos/i.ss01ts\n\n6\n\n| As at December 31 (millions)                     | 2022   | 2021    |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|\n| Advance billings                                 | $  662 | $   636 |\n| Deferred customer activation and connection fees | 5      |         |\n| Customer deposits                                | 12     | 10      |\n| Contract liabilities                             | 679    | 652     |\n| Other                                            | 212    | 202     |\n|                                                  | $  891 | $   854 |",

We expect that the associated cash outflows in respect of the balance accrued as at the financial statement date will occur proximate to the dates these assets are retired.\n\n## Emp/l.ss08oyee-re/l.ss08ated\n\nThe employee-related provisions are largely in respect of restructuring activities (as discussed further in Note 16(b) ). The timing of the associated cash outflows in respect of the balance accrued as at the financial statement date is substantially short-term in nature.\n\n## Wr/i.ss01tten put opt/i.ss01ons and cont/i.ss01ngent cons/i.ss01derat/i.ss01on\n\nIn connection with certain business acquisitions, we have established provisions for written put options in respect of non-controlling interests. Provisions for some written put options are determined based on the net present value of estimated future earnings, and such provisions require us to make key economic assumptions about the future. Similarly, we have established provisions for contingent consideration.\n\n## 26 Long-term debt\n\n## (a) Deta/i.ss01/l.ss08s of /l.ss08ong-term debt\n\n-\n\n| As at December 31 (millions)                   | Note   | 2022      | 2021      |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|-----------|\n| Senior unsecured                               |        |           |           |\n| TELUS Corporation senior notes                 | (b)    | $  18,660 | $  15,258 |\n| TELUS Corporation commercial paper             | (c)    | 1,458     | 1,900     |\n| TELUS Corporation credit facilities            | (d)    | 1,145     |           |\n| TELUS Communications Inc. debentures           | (e)    | 199       | 448       |\n| Secured                                        |        |           |           |\n| TELUS International (Cda) Inc. credit facility | (f)    | 914       | 1,062     |\n| Other                                          | (g)    | 321       | 308       |\n|                                                |        | 22,697    | 18,976    |\n| Lease liabilities                              | (h)    | 2,340     | 1,876     |\n| Long-term debt                                 |        | $  25,037 | $  20,852 |\n| Current                                        |        | $ 2,541   | $ 2,927   |\n| Non-current                                    |        | 22,496    | 17,925    |\n| Long-term debt                                 |        | $  25,037 | $  20,852 |\n\nNo cash outflows in respect of the written put options are expected prior to their initial exercisability, and no cash outflows in respect of contingent consideration are expected prior to completion of the periods during which the contingent consideration can be earned.\n\n## Other\n\nThe provisions for other include: legal claims; non-employee-related restructuring activities; contract termination costs and onerous contracts related to business acquisitions; and costs incurred in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Other than as set out following, we expect that the associated cash outflows in respect of the balance accrued as at the financial statement date will occur over an indeterminate multiyear period.\n\nAs discussed further in Note 29 , we are involved in a number of legal claims and we are aware of certain other possible legal claims. In respect of legal claims, we establish provisions, when warranted, after taking into account legal assessments, information presently available, and the expected availability of recourse. The timing of cash outflows associated with legal claims cannot be reasonably determined.\n\nIn connection with business acquisitions, we have established provisions for contract termination costs and onerous contracts acquired.\n\n## (b) TELUS Corporat/i.ss01on sen/i.ss01or notes\n\nThe notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured unsubordinated obligations, are senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness, and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future obligations of, or guaranteed by, our subsidiaries. The indentures governing the notes contain covenants that, among other things, place limitations on our ability, and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, to: grant security in respect of indebtedness; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; and incur new indebtedness.\n\nInterest is payable semi-annually. The notes require us to make an offer to repurchase them at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase upon the occurrence of a change in control triggering event, as defined in the supplemental trust indenture.\n\nAt any time prior to the respective maturity dates set out in the table below, the notes are redeemable at our option, in whole at any time, or in part from time to time, on not fewer than 30 days' and not more than 60 days' prior notice. On or after the respective redemption present value spread cessation dates set out in the table below, the notes are redeemable at our option, in whole but not in part, on not fewer than 30 days' and not more than 60 days' prior notice, at redemption prices equal to 100% of the principal amounts thereof. In addition, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be paid to the date fixed for redemption.",

This program enables us to issue commercial paper, subject to conditions related to debt ratings, up to a maximum aggregate equivalent amount at any one time of $2.0 billion (US$1.5 billion maximum). Foreign currency forward contracts are used to manage currency risk arising from issuing commercial paper denominated in U.S. dollars. Commercial paper debt is due within one year and is classified as a current portion of long-term debt, as the amounts are fully supported, and we expect that they will continue to be supported, by the revolving credit facility, which has no repayment requirements within the next year. As at December 31, 2022, we had $1.5 billion (2021 - $1.9 billion) of commercial paper outstanding, all of which was denominated in U.S. dollars (US$1.1 billion; 2021 US$1.5 billion), with an effective average interest rate of 4.7%, maturing through June 2023.\n\n## (d) TELUS Corporat/i.ss01on cred/i.ss01t fac/i.ss01/l.ss08/i.ss01t/i.ss01es\n\nAs at December 31, 2022, TELUS Corporation had an unsecured revolving $2.75 billion bank credit facility, expiring on April 6, 2026 (unchanged from December 31, 2021), with a syndicate of financial institutions, which is to be used for general corporate purposes, including the backstopping of commercial paper. As at December 31, 2022, TELUS Corporation had an unsecured non-revolving $1.1 billion bank\n\ncredit facility, maturing July 9, 2024, with a syndicate of financial institutions, which is to be used for general corporate purposes. As at December 31, 2022, we had drawn $1.1 billion on the non-revolving bank credit facility, with an effective average interest rate of 5.3% through January 2023.\n\nThe TELUS Corporation credit facilities bear interest at prime rate, U.S. Dollar Base Rate, a bankers' acceptance rate or London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) (as such terms are used or defined in the credit facilities), plus applicable margins. The credit facilities contain customary representations, warranties and covenants, including two financial quarter-end ratio tests. These tests are that our leverage ratio must not exceed 4.25:1.00 and our operating cash flow to interest expense ratio must not be less than 2.00:1.00, all as defined in the credit facilities.\n\nContinued access to the TELUS Corporation credit facilities is not contingent upon TELUS Corporation maintaining a specific credit rating.\n\n| As at December 31 (millions)                                   | 2022     | 2021     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Net available                                                  | $  1,292 | $  850   |\n| Backstop of commercial paper                                   | 1,458    | 1,900    |\n| Gross available revolving   $2.75 billion bank credit facility | $  2,750 | $  2,750 |\n\nWe had $119 million of letters of credit outstanding as at December 31, 2022 (2021 - $193 million), issued under various uncommitted facilities; such letter of credit facilities are in addition to the ability to provide letters of credit pursuant to our committed revolving bank credit facility.\n\n## (e) TELUS Commun/i.ss01cat/i.ss01ons Inc/period.ss01 debentures\n\nThe Series 5 Debentures were issued by a predecessor corporation of TELUS Communications Inc., BC TEL, under a Trust Indenture dated May 31, 1990.

As well, we have received notice of, or are aware of, certain possible claims (including intellectual property infringement claims) against us and, in some cases, other mobile carriers and telecommunications service providers.\n\nIt is not currently possible for us to predict the outcome of such claims, possible claims and lawsuits due to various factors, including: the preliminary nature of some claims; uncertain damage theories and demands; an incomplete factual record; uncertainty concerning legal theories and procedures and their resolution by the courts, at both the trial and the appeal levels; and the unpredictable nature of opposing parties and their demands.\n\nHowever, subject to the foregoing limitations, management is of the opinion, based upon legal assessments and information presently available, that it is unlikely that any liability, to the extent not provided for through insurance or otherwise, would have a material effect on our financial position and the results of our operations, including cash flows, with the exception of the items enumerated following.\n\n## Certified class actions\n\nCertified class actions against us include the following:\n\n## Per minute billing class action\n\nIn 2008, a class action was brought in Ontario against us alleging breach of contract, breach of the Ontario Consumer Protection Act , breach of the Competition Act and unjust enrichment, in connection with our practice of 'rounding up' mobile airtime to the nearest minute and charging for the full minute. The action sought certification of a national class. In November 2014, an Ontario class only was certified by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in relation to the breach of contract, breach of Consumer Protection Act , and unjust enrichment claims; all appeals of the certification decision have now been exhausted. At the same time, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice declined to stay the claims of our business customers, notwithstanding an arbitration clause in our customer service agreements with those customers. This latter decision was appealed and on May 31, 2017, the Ontario Court of Appeal dismissed our appeal. The Supreme Court of Canada granted us leave to appeal this decision and on April 4, 2019, granted our appeal and stayed the claims of business customers.\n\n## Call set-up time class actions\n\nIn 2005, a class action was brought against us in British Columbia alleging that we have engaged in deceptive trade practices in charging for incoming calls from the moment the caller connects to the network, and not from the moment the incoming call is connected to the recipient. In 2011, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld a stay of all of the causes of action advanced by the plaintiff in this class action, with one exception, based on the arbitration clause that was included in our customer service agreements. The sole exception was the cause of action based\n\non deceptive or unconscionable practices under the British Columbia Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act , which the Supreme Court of Canada declined to stay. In January 2016, the British Columbia Supreme Court certified this class action in relation to the claim under the Business Practices and Consumer Protection Act . The class is limited to residents of British Columbia who contracted mobile services with us in the period from January 21, 1999, to April 2010. We have appealed the certification decision. A companion class action was brought against us in Alberta at the same time as the British Columbia class action. The Alberta class action duplicates the allegations in the British Columbia action, but has not proceeded to date and is not certified. Subject to a number of conditions, including court approval, we have now settled\n\nboth the British Columbia and the Alberta class actions.\n\n## Uncertified class actions\n\nUncertified class actions against us include:\n\n## 9-1-1 class actions\n\nIn 2008, a class action was brought in Saskatchewan against us and other Canadian telecommunications carriers alleging that, among other matters, we failed to provide proper notice of 9-1-1 charges to the public, have been deceitfully passing them off as government charges, and have charged 9-1-1 fees to customers who reside in areas where 9-1-1 service is not available. The plaintiffs advance causes of action in breach of contract, misrepresentation and false advertising and seek certification of a national class. A virtually identical class action was filed in Alberta at the same time, but the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench declared that class action expired against us as of 2009. No steps have been taken in this proceeding since 2016.\n\n## Public Mobile class actions\n\nIn 2014, class actions were brought against us in Quebec and Ontario on behalf of Public Mobile's customers, alleging that changes to the technology, services and rate plans made by us contravene our statutory and common law obligations. In particular, the Quebec action alleges that our actions constitute a breach of the Quebec Consumer Protection Act , the Quebec Civil Code , and the Ontario Consumer Protection Act . On June 28, 2021, the Quebec Superior Court approved the discontinuance of this claim against TELUS. The Ontario class action alleges negligence, breach of express and implied warranty, breach of the Competition Act , unjust enrichment, and waiver of tort. No steps have been taken in this proceeding since it was filed and served.\n\n## Summary\n\nWe believe that we have good defences to the above matters. Should the ultimate resolution of these matters differ from management's assessments and assumptions, a material adjustment to our financial position and the results of our operations, including cash flows, could result. Management's assessments and assumptions include that reliable estimates of any such exposure cannot be made considering the continued uncertainty about: the nature of the damages that may be sought by the plaintiffs; the causes of action that are being, or may ultimately be, pursued; and, in the case of the uncertified class actions, the causes of action that may ultimately be certified.",

The terms of these indemnification obligations range in duration. These indemnifications would require us to compensate the indemnified parties for costs incurred as a result of failure to comply with contractual obligations, or litigation claims or statutory sanctions, or damages that may be suffered by an indemnified party. In some cases, there is no maximum limit on these indemnification obligations. The overall maximum amount of an indemnification obligation will depend on future events and conditions and therefore cannot be reasonably estimated. Where appropriate, an indemnification obligation is recorded as a liability. Other than obligations recorded as liabilities at the time of the related transactions, historically we have not made significant payments under these indemnifications. As at December 31, 2022, we had no liability recorded in respect of our indemnification obligations.\n\nSee Note 21(b) for details regarding our guarantees to the real estate joint ventures.\n\n## Other 30 /R.ss04e/l.ss08ated party transact/i.ss01ons\n\n## (a) Transact/i.ss01ons w/i.ss01th key management personne/l.ss08\n\nOur key management personnel have authority and responsibility for overseeing, planning, directing and controlling our activities and consist of our Board of Directors and our Executive Team.\n\nTotal compensation expense for key management personnel, and the composition thereof, is as follows:\n\n| Years ended December 31 (millions)                  | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Short-term benefits                                 | $  17  | $ 16   |\n| Post-employment pension/one.numr and other benefits | 10     | 18     |\n| Share-based compensation/two.numr                   | 65     | 70     |\n|                                                     | $  92  | $  104 |\n\nAs disclosed in Note 14 , we made initial awards of share-based compensation in 2022 and 2021, including, as set out in the following table, to our key management personnel. As most of these awards are cliff-vesting or graded-vesting and have multi-year requisite service periods, the related expense is being recognized rateably over a period of years and thus only a portion of the 2022 and 2021 initial awards are included in the amounts in the table above.\n\n| Twelve-month periods ended December 31   | 2022              | 2022                      | 2022                             | 2021              | 2021                      | 2021                             |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| ($ in millions)                          | Number   of units | Notional   value/one.numr | Grant-date   fair value/one.numr | Number   of units | Notional   value/one.numr | Grant-date   fair value/one.numr |\n| TELUS Corporation                        |                   |                           |                                  |                   |                           |                                  |\n| Restricted share units                   | 1,007,431         | $  32                     | $  39                            | 1,273,308         | $  33                     | $  36                            |\n| TELUS International (Cda) Inc.           |                   |                           |                                  |                   |                           |                                  |\n| Restricted share units                   | 265,617           | 9                         | 9                                | 437,857           | 15                        | 15                               |\n| Share options                            | -                 | -                         | -                                | 167,693           | 1                         | 1                                |\n|                                          |                   | 9                         | 9                                |                   | 16                        | 16                               |\n|                                          |                   | $  41                     | $  48                            |                   | $  49                     | $  52                            |\n\n## (c) Concentrat/i.ss01on of /l.ss08abour\n\nIn 2021, we commenced collective bargaining with the Telecommunications Workers Union, United Steelworkers Local 1944 (TWU), to renew a collective agreement that expired on December 31, 2021; the contract covered approximately 17% of our Canadian workforce as at December 31, 2022. The expired contract remains in effect until a new agreement is reached or a work stoppage occurs.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2022, the parties participated in conciliation with an appointed federal conciliator following the TWU's application to the Federal Minister of Labour for assistance in negotiations. The TWU subsequently held a ratification vote on TELUS' offer, which resulted in 65% of union members voting against accepting the proposed contract. Should a new collective agreement not be reached, there is the risk of a labour disruption after all legal pre-conditions have been met. As a labour disruption could occur in multiple forms, the operational and financial impacts of a labour disruption on us are not practicably determinable currently.",

Deferred share units entitle directors to a specified number of TELUS Corporation Common Shares. Deferred share units accounted for as liabilities have been paid out when a director ceased to be a director, for any reason, at a time elected by the director in accordance with the Directors' Deferred Share Unit Plan ; during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, no amounts were paid out.

In the event of a change in control, Executive Team members are not entitled to treatment any different than that given to our other employees with respect to non-vested sharebased compensation.\n\n## (b) Transact/i.ss01ons w/i.ss01th def/i.ss01ned benef/i.ss01t pens/i.ss01on p/l.ss08ans\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we provided our defined benefit pension plans with management and administrative services on a cost recovery basis and actuarial services on an arm's-length basis; the charges for these services amounted to $7 million (2021 - $7 million).\n\n## (c) Transact/i.ss01ons w/i.ss01th rea/l.ss08 estate /j.ss01o/i.ss01nt venture\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had transactions with the TELUS Sky real estate joint venture, which is a related party, as set out in Note 21 .

Optical fibre networks are used to transmit large amounts of data between locations at high upload and download speeds.\n\nFibre to the x (FTTx): A collective term for any broadband network architecture using optical fibre to replace all or part of the existing copper local loops. FTTH denotes fibre to the home, FTTP denotes fibre to the premises and FTTN denotes fibre to the node or neighbourhood.\n\nHSPA+ (high-speed packet access plus): A 4G technology capable of delivering manufacturer-rated wireless data download speeds of up to 21 Mbps (typical speeds of 4 to 6 Mbps). HSPA+ dual-cell technology can double those download speeds.\n\nIncumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC): An established telecommunications company providing local telephone service. Non-ILEC refers to the telecommunications operations of TELUS outside its traditional ILEC operating territories, where TELUS competes with the incumbent telephone company (e.g. Ontario and most of Quebec).\n\nInternet of Things (IoT): A system of uniquely identifiable end points (or things) that interact without human intervention, most commonly over a wireless network. These systems collect, analyze and act on information in real time and can be deployed to enable the creation of smart connected businesses, homes, vehicles and cities.\n\nInternet protocol (IP): A packet-based protocol for sending and receiving data across networks.\n\n- IP-based network: A network designed using IP and QoS (quality of service) technology to reliably and efficiently support all types of customer traffic, including voice, data and video. An IP-based network allows a variety of IP devices and advanced applications to communicate over a single common network.\n- IP TV (internet protocol television): A television service (offered as Optik TV and Pik TV at TELUS) that uses a two-way digital broadcast signal sent through a network by way of a streamed broadband connection to a dedicated set-top box (or through an app for Pik TV).\n\nLTE (long-term evolution): The leading global 4G wireless technology standard. LTE advanced (LTE-A) and LTE advanced pro offer higher speeds and greater capacity, moving networks closer to 5G. LTE is capable of delivering manufacturer-rated wireless data download speeds of up to 150 Mbps (typical speeds of 12 to 45 Mbps), and LTE-A can offer speeds nearly 10 times higher (in select regions).\n\nMachine-to-machine (M2M): Technologies and networked devices that are able to exchange information and perform actions without human intervention.\n\nMobile virtual network operator (MVNO): A mobile service operator that leases access to a wireless network from other carriers to resell services to end customers.\n\nNormal course issuer bid (NCIB): A program that enables a company to purchase its own shares, typically for cancellation, through exchanges or private purchases over a set period of time.\n\nOver-the-top (OTT): Content, services and applications in a video format, for which delivery occurs through a medium other than the established video delivery infrastructure.\n\nPassive optical network (PON): A fibre-based transmission technology used for delivering broadband network access. GPON (gigabit-capable passive optical network) delivers data download speeds of up to 2.4 Gbps and upload speeds of up to 1.2 Gbps; XGS-PON (10-gigabit-capable symmetrical passive optical network) delivers data download and upload speeds of up to 2.5 Gbps.\n\nSmall cell: Low-powered radio access nodes that can operate in licensed and unlicensed spectrum within a limited range to provide densification and capacity to a macro wireless network.\n\nSpectrum: The range of electromagnetic radio frequencies used in the transmission of voice, data and video. The capacity of a wireless network is in part a function of the amount of spectrum licensed and utilized by the carrier.\n\nSustainability-linked bond (SLB): A debt financing instrument with terms aligned to the borrower's performance against predetermined sustain ability performance targets and principles.\n\nVirtual power purchase agreement (VPPA): A long-term renewable energy contract that does not involve the physical delivery of energy from the generator to the customer. The customer receives renewable energy certificates that can be used to offset greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nVirtual private network (VPN): The extension of an encrypted, private network across a public network that allows users to securely send and receive data, as if users were directly connected to a private network.\n\nVoice over internet protocol (VoIP): The transmission of voice signals over the internet or IP network.\n\nFor f/i.ss01nanc/i.ss01a/l.ss08 def/i.ss01n/i.ss01t/i.ss01ons/comma.ss01 see Sect/i.ss01on 11 of Management/quoteright.ss01s d/i.ss01scuss/i.ss01on and ana/l.ss08ys/i.ss01s/period.ss01",

In May 2022, we announced our intention to target ongoing semi-annual dividend increases, with the increase to be 7 to 10% annually, through to the end of 2025. This further extends our multi-year dividend growth program originally announced\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nin May 2011 and extended for three-year periods in May 2013, May 2016 and May 2019, and provides investors with ongoing clarity with respect to our intentions regarding our dividend growth program. Since 2011, we have raised our dividend 23 times, bringing the total number of our dividend increases to 30 since 2004.\n\nNotwithstanding this, dividend decisions will continue to be dependent on earnings and free cash flow and subject to the Board's assessment and determination of TELUS' financial situation, capital requirements and economic outlook on a quarterly basis. There can be no assurance that the Company will maintain its dividend growth program through 2025.\n\nTELUS advises that, unless noted otherwise, all quarterly dividends paid since January 2006 are eligible dividends under the Income Tax Act . Under this legislation, Canadian residents may be entitled to enhanced dividend tax credits that reduce the income tax otherwise payable.

Under this plan, eligible shareholders can have their dividends reinvested automatically into additional shares. TELUS may elect to purchase common shares in the open market or by issuance from treasury (less a discount, if any, of up to 5%). TELUS will provide advance notification to participants if and when an election is made to change the method of purchasing common shares, and if by treasury issuance, any discount offered or any change in the rate of discount. Effective October 1, 2019, until TELUS elects otherwise, TELUS offers shares from treasury at a 2% discount from the average market price.\n\nWe also offer a share purchase feature, under which eligible shareholders can, on a monthly basis, buy TELUS shares (maximum $20,000 per calendar year and minimum $100 per transaction) without brokerage commissions or service charges.\n\nThis plan is managed by Computershare Trust Company of Canada.\n\nV/i.ss01s/i.ss01t te/l.ss08us/period.ss01com/ dr/i.ss01sp or contact Computershare for /i.ss01nformat/i.ss01on and enro/l.ss08ment forms/period.ss01",
