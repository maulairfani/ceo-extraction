In an industry seeing a steeper cost curve, this can enable improved margin generation going forward.\n\nA competitive shareholder return is important to ensure that Hydro remains attractive to investors. We are pleased to convey that the Board of Directors proposes to allot 62 percent of adjusted net income in 2022, as a combination of dividends and share buybacks.\n\n## Megatrends present new challenges and opportunities\n\nGoing forward, we see two megatrends which will have a great impact on our business environment, posing new risks, but also opportunities.\n\nFirst, we see a new geopolitical reality with increased rivalry between powers, weaker global institutions, a decline in trust and increased polarization within societies. This may have a significant impact on the global economy affecting trade, economic cooperation, supply chains and global development.\n\nThe vulnerability in global supply chains was revealed by the pandemic and is further amplified by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In our view, proven long-term security of supply, affordability and access to energy, minerals and strategic materials will become an increasingly important strategic advantage.\n\nSecondly, amid all the uncertainty going forward, one thing seems certain, we see higher climate ambitions and greater attention to sustainability. These are being turned into stronger regulations and business commitments, and higher expectations to the industry among politicians and regulators.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Letter to stakeholders\n\nUnique position in a new reality\n\nHydro entered 2022 on the back of the strongest aluminium markets in decades following the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the year would soon be dominated by a devastating war in Europe, an energy crisis, spiking inflation and a global economic slowdown, including a significant fall in aluminium demand. We are pleased to present Hydro's best financial result ever during what turned into a challenging year.\n\nThe past year has once again shown us how fast things can change in our business environment, how important it is to be robust and resilient, and not to lose sight of the long-term opportunities.\n\n## Our people are the foundation on which we are built\n\nHydro's most precious asset is our workforce of 32,000 highly skilled and engaged employees around the world. We see a direct link between the health, safety and wellbeing of our people, our performance culture, and the progress of our strategic agenda.\n\nComing out of the pandemic, we have seen an encouraging safety performance. The 2022 total recordable injury rate (TRI) was 2.4, which is a strong improvement from 3.3 in 2021, and the lowest level ever reported in Hydro. The highrisk incidents rate (HRI) improved to 0.8 in 2022, compared with 1.4 the previous year. We cannot rest though. Ensuring a safe work environment is a continuous job, which needs focus and attention by everyone, every day, at every shift.\n\n## A record year and a solid basis to meet uncertainty and pursue opportunities\n\nIn a turbulent year, we benefitted from our strong cost position and our improvement efforts as well as from the high prices for aluminium and energy. We delivered record results in 2022, with an adjusted EBITDA of NOK 39.7 billion and a corresponding return on capital (RoaCE) of 22.2 percent, well above our target of 10 percent over the cycle.\n\nMuch of this is attributed to our organization's solid improvement drive. In 2019, we launched an ambitious improvement program, delivering improvements of NOK 7.3 billion annually by 2023. Last year we reached our target well",

The fuel switch projects, changing energy sources from fuel oil and coal to natural gas and electricity at our alumina refinery Alunorte, are progressing well. It is especially encouraging that the significant reductions of greenhouse gas emissions go hand in hand with reduced operating costs. In parallel, we are developing and maturing the technologies needed to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in 2050 or earlier.\n\nFor existing primary aluminium plants, we aim to eliminate emissions through carbon capture and storage (CCS), and are currently running test projects to verify the efficiency at selected plants.\n\nFor new primary aluminium capacity, Hydro's technologists have worked for the past six years to develop a breakthrough zero-emission technology, the proprietary HalZero. We aim to construct a test facility to further mature the technology concept, with a bold aspiration to deliver our first batch of HalZero aluminium by 2026. Once CCS and HalZero are in place, it is finally realistic to speak of zero-emission primary aluminium.\n\nIn addition, recycling will play a vital role in the transition towards a low-carbon economy. For us, recycling represents an opportunity for new profitable growth. Furthermore, recycling of post-consumer scrap is reducing the carbon content in the products we bring to the market. We are excited that Hydro produced its first prime quality, near-zero aluminium based on recycling of 100 percent post-consumer scrap in 2022.\n\nWe are encouraged by higher demand for recycled aluminium, strong margins and attractive returns, and have a comprehensive project pipeline. Last year, we made the decisions to establish new recycling capacity at Cassopolis, Cressona and Henderson in the US, Rackwitz in Germany,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis is most noteworthy though among customers, investors and financiers, and current and potential new employees.\n\nThe current energy crisis has demonstrated how crucial access to affordable renewable energy is for society and industry to succeed with the green transition. Markets are increasingly concerned about how products are made, and we expect sustainability frontrunners to be appreciated and preferred.\n\nWe are not only committed to contributing to change, but we are also committed to drive change. More importantly, we increasingly see sustainability as our path to profitability. We continue to pursue our strategy to strengthen our position in low-carbon aluminium, as well as growing in new energy solutions.\n\n## Shaping and serving the markets for greener products\n\nThe transition towards net-zero emissions is expected to be a key driver for aluminium demand towards 2030. Even in a challenging market, we expect 2.8 percent annual growth towards 2030, of which a large part is coming from the automotive segments. Demand for recycled aluminium is expected to grow at double the rate with an annual growth at 5.4 percent.\n\nIt is encouraging that demand for low-carbon primary aluminium is accelerating and set to outpace the rest of the market at a 20 percent annual growth rate from 2022 to 2030. In fact, we expect greener and recycled aluminium to make up a majority of the EU and North American market by 2030.\n\nIn order to successfully deliver on our decarbonization strategies and achieve our ambitions on shaping the market for low and near-zero carbon aluminium, we have teamed up with frontrunners in the value chain to develop creative, innovative and sustainable solutions. The strategic partnerships with Mercedes-Benz and Polestar, and window solutions provider VELUX, enable smarter solutions with a lower-carbon footprint.\n\nIn Extrusions, we grow together with our customers, particularly in the automotive market segment, and have positioned Hydro CIRCAL to be the standard bearer in building and construction.

We are committed to invest in education, support just transition by contributing to economic and social development in societies where we operate, and ensure transparency and responsible business practices in our supply chains.\n\nIn 2022, we were especially proud to open the new technical school in Barcarena, also benefiting Hydro by expanding and qualifying the local workforce. We also continue to support the long-term collaborative platform Sustainable Barcarena Initiative. Programs for local entrepreneurship, education, health and environmental initiatives.\n\nWe have also seen that by educating our suppliers in Par\u00e1, we are not only ensuring that our own supply is sourced responsibly, we also enable our suppliers to grow and become preferred suppliers to other businesses in Brazil. This is truly a win-win situation for both Hydro and society.\n\nWorking to improve industry standards for human rights, transparency and responsible production, we are engaging with a range of international organizations. We are also a signatory member of the UN Global Compact and a committed member of the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI).\n\nOn the environmental side, we are committed to reducing the footprint of our mining operations, rehabilitate forests and protect biodiversity, and to eliminate landfilling of recoverable waste by 2040.\n\n## Well positioned for future value creation\n\nFacing a more unpredictable global economy and an urgent need to drive the green transition, Hydro is well positioned to navigate through turbulence in the short-term without losing sight of our strategic positioning for the long-term opportunities.\n\nWe have a highly skilled and motivated workforce, low and robust cost positions with ambitions to improve, a pathway to net-zero aluminium products through targeted technology\n\ndevelopment, strong market positions and a portfolio of profitable growth projects. We also have ambitious and concrete sustainability targets integrated in our business strategy and operations.\n\nThis is all supported by a solid financial framework, ensuring financial strength and flexibility, while also enabling competitive shareholder distribution.\n\nOn this basis, we believe Hydro has a unique position to create value in a new reality, developing industries that matter.\n\n| Dag Mejdell   | Hilde Merete Aasheim   |\n|---------------|------------------------|\n| Chair         | President and CEO      |\n\nand Szekesfehervar in Hungary, together with our bid to acquire the Polish recycling company Alumetal. These are important steps for implementing our profitable growth ambitions.\n\nIn addition to addressing own emissions, Hydro has launched a new target to reduce upstream Scope 3 emissions per tonne aluminium delivered to the market by 30 percent by 2030. These are emissions produced by our suppliers, and the target will be reached mainly through greener sourcing of raw materials and metals.\n\n## Growing in new energy\n\nAvailability of renewable power is more critical than ever to meet global climate targets. For Hydro, the contribution of Hydro Rein to bring forward more power production is crucial. Hydro Rein has made significant progress during the last year and is now executing four projects with contracted revenues amounting to USD 2.7 billion. We continue our active process for raising external capital for Hydro Rein.\n\nHydro Rein and Hydro Havrand are working together with the respective business areas to contribute to strengthening their position in low-carbon aluminium through renewable sourcing and decarbonization. Through Hydro Havrand, we aim to produce green hydrogen that may replace the use of natural gas in our own production and help external customers decarbonize their hard to abate emissions.\n\nWe continue to pursue our ambition to take an active part in batteries and energy storage solutions. Through our 30 percent stake in the graphite producer Vianode, we are taking a role in the production of more sustainable raw materials for electric vehicle batteries. The synthetic graphite materials from Vianode will be produced with up to 90 percent lower CO 2 emissions than today's standard materials.\n\nEurope's largest electric vehicle battery recycling plant, HydroVolt, a 50/50 joint venture between Hydro and Swedish EV battery producer NorthVolt, has now been in commercial operation for almost a year.\n\n## Driving sustainability: Future-proofing our company\n\nIt is fundamental for every business to know its impact on nature and people, and to protect and uphold human rights in local operations as well as in global supply chains. This contributes to the health and livelihoods of people and communities in times of transition.",

Hydro's ambition is to strengthen its position in terms of profitability and sustainability, thereby increasing long-term value for our stakeholders and improving lives and livelihoods where we operate. Our main priority remains providing a healthy and safe work environment for our people.\n\nThe strategic direction toward 2025 focuses on two key areas: strengthening the company's position in low-carbon aluminium and growing in new energy. The strategy leverages our competitive advantage to seize opportunities within the current megatrends and the market's growing demand for low-carbon aluminium.\n\nThe initiatives within both areas of Hydro's 2025 strategy support the achievement of our main profitability target of 10 percent RoaCE over the cycle. Hydro's track record of industrial development, close customer collaboration, combined with an integrated commercial and sustainability strategy, provide a solid foundation for the future. Hydro's ambition is to be an industry leader in low-carbon aluminium.\n\n## Increasing demand for greener aluminium\n\nGlobal megatrends such as sustainability, electrification, and urbanization support the growing demand for aluminium and renewable energy. Aluminium with a lower-carbon footprint is seen as an important enabler for the green transition. Hydro's customers across industry sectors such as transportation, construction, packaging and electrical are setting ambitious decarbonization targets. Low-carbon aluminium is a key lever to reduce Scope 3 emissions for these industries.\n\nIn addition, the political and regulatory landscape supports aluminium demand. The European Green Deal has a goal of reducing CO 2 emissions by 57 percent by 2030. It is a catalyst for a restructuring of the energy market toward renewable sources.\n\nThe demand for aluminium in our main markets is expected to grow at around 3 percent annually until 2030. Low-carbon aluminium demand is expected to outpace the rest of the market, with a current estimate of 20 percent compound\n\nannual growth rate (CAGR) from 2022 to 2030. External consultants expect low-carbon and recycled aluminium will make up a majority of the EU and American markets in 2030.\n\nAround 70 percent of Hydro's primary aluminium production capacity is based on renewable electricity, producing aluminium with a carbon intensity around 25 percent of the world average, placing our primary aluminium production among the most carbon efficient in the world. Hydro is constantly working to develop aluminium alloys with a lowcarbon footprint. Currently, Hydro offers two types of lowcarbon aluminium through our Hydro CIRCAL and Hydro REDUXA material brands.\n\nHydro CIRCAL is a range of products made with a minimum of 75 percent recycled, post-consumer scrap aluminium. Using recycled aluminium, Hydro drastically reduces energy use and our CO 2 footprint in the production phase, while still offering high quality aluminium.\n\nHydro REDUXA is our low-carbon aluminium. Using renewable energy sources like hydro and wind power during production, Hydro has reduced the carbon footprint per kg of aluminium to just 4.0 kg (less than a quarter of the global average).\n\nHydro's strong extrusions market positions and close customer relationships, support our margins and growth ambitions in key segments. Hydro's innovative solutions are also increasing the substitution potential of aluminium and creating new markets.\n\nHydro's decarbonization path and climate initiatives Hydro has the ambition of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and 2) by 2050 or earlier.\n\nHydro is pursuing three decarbonization pathways to further reduce the carbon footprint of aluminium. To secure the value of existing smelters, Hydro is developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) solutions that can be retrofitted into existing aluminium plants. Hydro is collaborating with the technology provider Verdox. The first technology test was successfully completed in 2022, and a second test is planned to start in early 2023.",

The fuel switch will reduce the refinery's annual CO 2 emissions by 700,000 tonnes when completed. The project started in the first quarter of 2022, and is expected to be in operation during the second half of 2023. In addition, Hydro is installing three electrical boilers at Alunorte powered by renewable energy to replace the current coal fired boilers. The first boiler is already operational, and the second and third boilers are expected to be operational in 2024. These initiatives will result in a reduction of around 1.1 million tonnes CO 2 emissions from the Alunorte alumina refinery.\n\nAnother pathway more suited for greenfield smelters is Hydro's proprietary HalZero technology. This is technology based on converting alumina to aluminium chloride prior to electrolysis in a process where chlorine and carbon are kept in closed loops, resulting in a fully decarbonized process. Hydro aims to deliver the first zero-carbon primary aluminium from the HalZero industrial pilot plant by 2026.\n\nRecycling post-consumer aluminium, is a third and faster pathway to zero-carbon aluminium. Using 100 percent postconsumer scrap, Hydro will be able to produce near-zero carbon products at a competitive abatement cost. In 2022, Hydro produced its first near-zero aluminium based on 100 percent recycled post-consumer scrap.\n\n## We provide products produced with low emissions\n\nKilos of CO2e emmissions per kilo aluminium\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHydro continues to strengthen its climate ambitions in 2022, launching targets to reduce upstream Scope 3 emissions per tonne aluminium delivered to the market by 30 percent compared to our 2018 baseline emissions. The Scope 3 target will mainly be achieved by purchasing metal with a low-carbon footprint, and reflects our growth ambitions in recycling and extrusions.\n\n## Key steps to strengthen low-carbon aluminium position\n\nOver the past year, Hydro has seen an increased demand for our low-carbon brand products Hydro CIRCAL and Hydro REDUXA. Sales of our two low-carbon brands have grown by 65 percent since 2021. Hydro has the capacity to triple Hydro CIRCAL sales volumes and double volumes of Hydro REDUXA in the mid-term.\n\nHydro continues to work in strategic customer partnerships to shape the market for low and near-zero carbon aluminium. The objective is to contribute to reducing the climate impact of our customers by utilizing the full potential of aluminium as a low-carbon solution. In 2022, Hydro formed a new strategic partnership with Mercedes-Benz, and will deliver REDUXA 3.0 (defined as below 3.0 kg CO 2 / kg Al from mine to metal) to a range of Mercedes-Benz models in 2023, ultimately reducing the carbon footprint of the vehicle.\n\nIncreasing demand for greener products, improved product mix, higher margins and market share growth, have supported Hydro's 2025 commercial ambition of NOK 2.5 billion in EBITDA improvements. Towards 2027, Hydro aims to further increase the commercial ambition by NOK 0.5 billion to NOK 3 billion.\n\nExtrusions, defined as a strategic growth area in Hydro, has successfully improved their business over the last years and is on track to realize their 2025 target EBITDA of NOK 8 billion, despite current market volatility. Extrusions continues to position itself for future growth through key investments. In 2022, Extrusions invested in around 55,000 tonnes of new press capacity through investments across the portfolio, in addition to the EUR 63 million acquisition of Hueck building systems and extrusion business. The acquisition will strengthen Hydro's presence in Germany and other European markets, and create a solid platform for further growth of the combined businesses.\n\nRecycling is an important enabler to strengthen Hydro's position in low-carbon aluminium.

Hydro has an ambition to achieve no net loss of priority biodiversity in all new projects and has set a target to eliminate landfilling of recoverable waste by 2040 across our operations.\n\nHydro's mining operations have a target of 1:1 rehabilitation of areas mined and released for rehabilitation, which is\n\non track. In 2023, Hydro will rehabilitate an additional 100 hectares in its legal reserve, which comprises degraded land not impacted by Hydro operations. For bauxite residue, Hydro has a target to eliminate the need to build new permanent storage facilities by 2050 and a target to utilize 10 percent of bauxite residue generation from 2030. This is supported by a project with the technology company Wave Aluminium, to potentially build a pilot plant at Hydro Alunorte to process 50kt of bauxite residue per year, extracting metals from bauxite residue.\n\nHydro's social ambition is to improve the lives and livelihoods wherever the company has operations. To date, Hydro has provided education to around 157,000 people and has an ambition to provide quality education to 500,000 people by 2030. In addition, Hydro has invested in building social centers in Par\u00e1 and a technical school in Barcarena.\n\nHydro has an ambition of zero fatal accidents and life changing injuries, and to provide safe and healthy workplaces. In 2022, there were zero fatalities and one life changing incident, while our overall recordable injury rate was at the lowest level ever reported in Hydro.\n\n20000\n\n15000\n\n10000\n\n5000\n\n0",

These areas include hydropower, solar and wind power, green hydrogen, batteries and energy solutions.\n\n## Hydro Rein\n\nHydro Rein was established as a company in 2021, building on Hydro's strong position in the energy markets and renewable energy operations, including a strong track record in structuring power purchase agreements tailored for industrial offtake. Hydro Rein supports Hydro and other industrial companies to decarbonize, offering certified renewable power and industrial scale solutions to improve energy efficiency, reduce emissions and cut costs, such as onsite generation, energy efficiency, energy storage and flexibility management. The company is a full scale developer in the wind and solar space, focusing on minority positions in projects in the Nordics and Brazil.\n\nHydro Rein has made significant progress during 2022. The company is currently executing four projects with a total installed capacity of 1.7 GW, in Mendubim, Feij\u00e3o and Boa Sorte in Brazil, and Stor-Sk\u00e4lsj\u00f6n in Sweden. The projects in Brazil are some of the largest renewable energy sites under construction in Brazil, and are important enablers to decarbonize Alunorte and reach Hydro's target of a 30 percent CO 2 reduction by 2030. Contracted revenues for the four projects (PPAs) amount to approximately USD 2.7 billion total nominal value.\n\nIn the near term, Hydro Rein will strengthen its focus on early phase projects for industry purposes in the Nordics. The company is maturing solar power projects in Denmark, onshore wind projects in Sweden and onshore and offshore wind projects in Norway. These projects are being developed in strategic partnerships with other industrial players. Hydro Rein also has a large portfolio of complementary projects at Hydro sites around the world.\n\n## Hydro Havrand\n\nHydro Havrand was established as a company in 2021. Leveraging Hydro's 3 GW potential offtake, industrial competence and energy expertise, Hydro Havrand will offer competitive green hydrogen to third party industries and evolving hydrogen markets such as heavy duty trucking and maritime.\n\nGreen hydrogen will be vital in order to decarbonize Hydro's industrial activities. Previously communicated projects include a 5 MW green hydrogen pilot project at Hydro's H\u00f8yanger smelter in Norway. Hydro Havrand and Aluminium Metal are maturing the project, which is pending funding support from Enova. If the pilot is successful, it will enable aluminium production with close to zero CO 2 emission. Hydro Havrand is currently maturing projects in Norway and internationally.\n\n## Batteries\n\nOver the past year, Hydro has developed a more focused battery strategy concentrating on growing within sustainable battery materials mainly in Europe.\n\nThe Hydrovolt battery recycling operations in Norway has started production and received large interest from both the EU and OEMs in Europe. The company is exploring an expansion of recycling capacity within Europe, with a longterm ambition to recycle 50,000 tonnes of battery packs by 2025 and 200,000 tonnes of battery packs by 2030, equivalent to approximately 150,000 EV batteries in 2025, and 400,000 in 2030.\n\nIn addition, Hydro Batteries has acquired a 30 percent share in Vianode, a company jointly owned with Elkem and Altor, offering sustainably produced, battery grade synthetic graphite with more than 90 percent lower embedded CO 2 emissions compared to conventional production. Commercial production is expected to start in 2024.\n\n## Value creation across the energy space going forward\n\n- 1.  Expanded footprint in the Nordics in terms of power and market operations, projects, and sourcing\n- 2.  Sourcing and management of power and fuels for Hydro operating assets across geographies\n- 3.  Hydro Rein successfully established as separate company with external capital and partners\n- 4.

Short-term RoaCE targets includes an additional stretch on top of the 10 percent RoaCE target in strong markets.\n\nCost of capital and RoaCE targets are differentiated for each business area as risk and volatility of earnings, and cash flows in the underlying business activities differ.\n\nHydro's main efforts to realize targeted capital returns are summarized in the full value creation framework. The framework includes three levers all underpinned by Hydro's sustainability agenda: the improvement program, commercial ambitions and strategic growth initiatives.\n\n## Improvement program\n\nIn 2022, Hydro further increased its improvement program target by NOK 1.5 billion to NOK 10.0 billion by 2025, which includes a positive rebasing effect of NOK 0.7 billion. Hydro also extended its improvement program to 2027 with additional improvements of NOK 1.0 billion.\n\nImprovement programs across the business areas are focused on operational excellence, procurement savings and\n\nfixed cost reductions. Operational excellence is key when it comes to maximizing value creation from current assets, and relies on the culture of continuous improvement and good control over the influenceable parameters. Fixed cost reductions are targeted through efficiency improvements from robotization and automation as well as energy efficiency improvements. The ambitions within procurement savings have been further stretched following systematic efforts over time. Improvements in all business areas include savings related to increased efficiency within staff and support functions, with Global Business Services (GBS) contributing the most.\n\n## Commercial ambitions\n\nThe commercial ambitions focus on market and customerdriven growth opportunities within the current portfolio. Hydro has a commercial ambition to deliver NOK 2.5 billion by 2025, and in 2022, Hydro extended its commercial ambition to 2027, with an additional ambition of NOK 0.5 billion. Execution and success rely on market support and customer demand, and are therefore less certain. The commercial initiatives include new product development in Aluminium Metal, market share gain and gross margin improvement in Extrusions through optimized product mix, increased sales of green products and higher production capacity, as well as commercial activities in Bauxite &\n\n## Full value creation potential\n\n## Financial ambitions\n\n## Lifting cash flow, delivering higher returns\n\nHydro's financial ambition is to lift cash flows and generate capital and shareholder returns through a combination of longer-term financial priorities supported by near-term financial targets. At the same time, Hydro aims to differentiate through its strong sustainability position and to develop businesses where megatrends match Hydro's capabilities.\n\nSupported by increasing interest from regulators, customers and financial markets, Hydro firmly believes that leading in sustainability is a strong foundation for our long-term license to operate and a key driver for long-term profitability. By emphasizing climate, environment, integrity and social responsibility, as well as by developing greener business and product offerings, Hydro will reduce risks and create new profitable opportunities.\n\nHydro has developed a framework that establishes clear priorities to lift cash flow and returns.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nImprovement program\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMaximizing value creation from current assets/operations\n\nCommercial initiatives\n\nPursuing market and customerdriven growth opportunities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGrowth and strategic initiatives\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMajor changes in business portfolio and/or stategic direction",

In 2022, Hydro introduced a supplementary guidance on targeted Adjusted net debt of around NOK 25 billion over-the-cycle. Given historical industry cyclicality, this means that the Adjusted net debt will be below the target in the stronger parts of the cycle, to be able to absorb the impact from industry cycle downturns and maintain financial flexibility in periods of adverse market conditions.\n\nA strong liquidity position is considered critical to support operations and investments through the industry cycle. In addition to a robust cash position, our liquidity is supported by revolving credit facilities, overdraft facilities and short-term liquidity lines.\n\nHydro's strategic hedge program is aimed at further strengthening the company's financial flexibility and robustness. Using financial derivatives, the program seeks to lock in strong upstream margins and secure cash flows. For further details, see note 7.1 Capital management.\n\n## Clear principles for capital allocation\n\nHydro has clear priorities and guidelines for capital allocation. Investments are evaluated using different scenarios for macro and market development to support robustness in investment decisions. Hydro also uses differentiated return requirements to reflect the underlying risk and exposures in each project.\n\nHydro divides capital expenditures into three categories: sustaining, return-seeking, and growth. The strategy is to allocate more growth and return-seeking capital to the areas with higher value generation potential, both from a profitability and sustainability perspective. In addition, all the business areas have been grouped into different strategic modes, which impacts the capital allocation.\n\nInvestments are generally funded by Hydro cash generation or debt, with each subsidiary being capitalized to serve its own activity. The plan is to finance the Hydro Rein and Hydro Havrand initiatives partly with external equity, either through public listing or through private placement, reducing the capital contribution from Hydro.\n\nHydro continues to optimize net operating capital levels both in absolute terms and in days of revenue, with due consideration given to the balance between capital release and supply chain robustness. The company targets a net operating capital release of NOK ~4 billion by the end of 2023.\n\n## Robust shareholder distribution\n\nHydro aims to provide its shareholders with a predictable dividend and a competitive return compared with alternative investments in similar companies. Hydro's ambition is to distribute a minimum of 50 percent of adjusted net income attributable to Hydro shareholders as ordinary dividend over\n\nAlumina to achieve higher premiums on alumina and hydrate.\n\n## Growth and strategic initiatives\n\nGrowth initiatives represent larger changes in the business portfolio. Hydro's strategy is to diversify and grow within the areas of recycling, and the new energy areas. These areas are supported by the current megatrends as well as by Hydro's core industrial expertise.\n\n## Financial strength and flexibility\n\nHydro's main strategy for mitigating risk related to volatility in cash flow is to maintain a strong balance sheet, investment grade credit rating and strong liquidity. At the same time reducing the average cost position of production assets and allocating capital in line with our strategic ambitions remain a key priority. Hydro considers this crucial to navigate the industry cycles, to be able to invest during cyclical downturns, and to be able to access the capital markets at attractive terms. In certain circumstances, derivatives may be used to mitigate financial risk in the business area or group levels.\n\nCurrently, Hydro has a BBB rating with S&P Global and a Baa3 rating with Moody's, both with a stable outlook.\n\nHydro uses the ratio Adjusted net (cash) debt to adjusted EBITDA as the key indicator of balance sheet strength and the ability to absorb volatility in the markets.

To benefit from the lower cost of capital enabled by sustainability performance, Hydro published its green and sustainabilitylinked financing framework in 2022. The framework is directly linked to our medium to long-term sustainability strategy and will provide an advantage in access to and cost of capital.\n\nThe EU taxonomy is a welcomed approach to providing comparable financial data on green activities in the sector. Hydro's activities are partly covered by this, such as the manufacturing of primary aluminium, secondary aluminium, recycling, and renewable power generation.

Hydro mines bauxite from Paragominas using stripmining technology. It is sorted and crushed for transportation as a slurry through a 244 kilometer long pipeline, then refined into alumina at Alunorte. Bauxite from MRN is transported to Alunorte by ship. In addition to our equity interests in the MRN bauxite mine, Hydro has volume offtake agreements for Vale's 40 percent interest in MRN, which amounted to 5.0 million mt in 2022. When operating at full production capacity, Hydro has a long position in bauxite of 3 million tonnes (assuming MRN produces 12.5 mt per annum) and 2-3 million tonnes of alumina.\n\n## Cost and revenue drivers\n\nThe main cost drivers for bauxite are labor, maintenance and consumables, electricity and fuel for mining equipment. These account for around 75 percent of the cash cost of mining activities. Labor, the largest cost factor, accounting for about 30 percent, is influenced by Brazilian wage levels and productivity developments. Maintenance and consumables are influenced by inflation and operational efficiency.\n\nThe main cost drivers for alumina refining are bauxite, energy and caustic soda. These represent around 85 percent of cash costs. Energy costs are a mix of fuel, coal and electricity, and account for about 40 percent of the total costs. Caustic soda represents around 15 percent of cash costs. Bauxite purchases from Paragominas, and those made under offtake agreements from MRN, are based on prices partly linked to the London Metal Exchange's (LME) prices and to alumina market prices.\n\n## Strengthen low-carbon aluminium position\n\nHydro Bauxite & Alumina is working to improve its position on the alumina industry cost and carbon curves, with Alunorte targeting to move from the first quartile of alumina refineries in terms of carbon intensity, to the first decile by 2025. To reach the targets for greenhouse gas emissions reductions,",

The business area consists of wholly owned aluminium metal plants in Norway, and partly owned plants in Slovakia, Qatar, Australia, Canada and Brazil. The plants produce standard ingot and value added products, such as extrusion ingot, primary foundry alloys, sheet ingot and wire rod.\n\n## Cost and revenue drivers\n\nThe main cost drivers for the production of primary aluminium include alumina, power and carbon, which together comprised about 80-85 percent of the cash costs of electrolysis metal in 2022. Hydro use approximately two tonnes of alumina to produce one tonne of aluminium, representing 35-40 percent of the cash cost of primary aluminium. Energy represents on average 25-30 percent of cash costs, and carbon anodes consumed in the smelting process account for 20-25 percent. Realized aluminium prices and casthouse product premiums are the most important revenue drivers. Aluminium Metal has a history of continuous improvements, covering all relevant earnings drivers.\n\nInternal supply contracts between our hydropower production operations and our aluminium metal business covered about half of the energy consumption of our wholly owned Norwegian metal plants in 2022. The remainder is mainly covered by external supply contracts. The external supply contracts comprise a mixture of hydropower and wind power.\n\nElectricity for the Qatalum aluminium plant in Qatar is provided by an integrated natural gas fired plant supplied with gas by Hydro's joint venture partner, Qatar Energy. The rest of the global joint ventures are covered by medium to longterm contracts, expiring between the end of 2024 and the end of 2030.",

This includes the Hydro EcoDesign process that helps our customers create products with increased functionality and a lower-carbon footprint.\n\nExtrusions applies additional levers to improve its carbon footprint, including sourcing aluminium with a carbon footprint that is lower than the average, increasing the use of recycled post-consumer scrap and reducing the emissions from our operations. See the section on Climate change for more details on how the recycling sourcing strategy can reduce upstream greenhouse gas emissions and the carbon footprint of products.\n\nIn addition, Hydro Havrand is exploring the possibility of replacing fossil fuels with green hydrogen at several of Extrusions' recycling operations. Several of Extrusions' plants have installed or are considering installation of on-site renewable power generation, while others have signed power purchase agreements with renewable power producers.\n\n## Extrusions EBITDA forecast 2025\n\nNOK billions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Hydro Extrusions\n\n## Operations\n\nHydro Extrusions is the world leader in extrusion based aluminium solutions.

Rising intermittent generation from solar and wind power is increasing price variation across power markets. The energy supply crisis in Europe in 2022, led to extraordinarily high and volatile prices for electricity, with large differences in Norwegian power price areas, supporting Hydro Energy's profitability significantly in 2022.\n\n## Diversify and grow in renewable energy\n\nHydro Energy's captive renewable energy production, competitive sourcing of renewable power and energy system solutions enable Hydro and other industrial companies to succeed in the transition to a net-zero society. The carbon footprint of aluminium is highly dependent on the source of energy, and Hydro Energy enables the production of lowcarbon aluminium.\n\nHydro Energy is focused on growing its portfolio of new energy solutions, while also addressing and managing the social and environmental impacts that comes with land use. Read more about Hydro's energy production and how our new energy solutions contribute to a net-zero society in the section on Climate Change.\n\n## Power sourcing for Hydro smelters in Norway\n\nTWh\n\nn Wind power n Hydropower n Current captive\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n400\n\nEmployees\n\nTWh\n\n11.6\n\nExternal power\n\nsourcing\n\nTWh\n\n7.7\n\nHydropower\n\nproduction\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Hydro Energy\n\n## Operations\n\nHydro Energy has more than 100 years of experience in production of renewable energy. Today, the business area is one of the three largest operators of hydropower production in Norway, and a large power market player in the Nordic region and Brazil. Hydro Energy is responsible for developing new business opportunities for Hydro within renewable energy, green hydrogen and batteries, and provides support to the rest of Hydro's business areas with contracts, security of supply and energy framework conditions.\n\nIn Norway, Energy operates 36 hydropower plants, with combined installed capacity of 2.8 GW at the end of 2022. In a normal year, our captive production is 9.4 TWh and Energy is an operator of 13.7 TWh renewable power production. This includes Tonstad Windfarm (208 MW/0.7 TWh) in Norway, from which Energy purchases all volumes. In addition, Energy purchases more than 9 TWh of renewable power annually in the Nordic market, mainly under long-term contracts, resulting in our total market portfolio for power to be around 18 TWh per year in the Nordics in a normal year.\n\nWithin the new energy growth areas, Hydro Rein currently has 1.7 GW gross installed capacity in construction or operation and targets another 1.3 GW by 2026. Hydro Havrand is currently embarking on a pilot project using green hydrogen to decarbonize the H\u00f8yanger recycling plant. The project is pending funding support from Enova.\n\nHydro Batteries is growing within sustainable battery materials, through their investment in the synthetic graphite company, Vianode, and the EV battery recycling company, Hydrovolt. In addition, Hydro Batteries has portfolio holdings in the marine battery systems segment leader, Corvus, and the European emerging cell manufacturing leader, Northvolt.\n\n## Cost and revenue drivers\n\nProduction volumes are strongly influenced by hydrological conditions. Seasonal factors affect both supply and demand. Energy's cost base is relatively stable, although volatile spot volumes and prices may cause significant variations in quarterly revenues. Energy optimizes its power portfolio in the market every day.",

The license grants an exclusive right to explore an area, subject to various requirements including compensation to the landowner and payment of an annual exploration fee to the National Mining Agency.\n\nIf the exploration identifies viable resources, a mining concession is granted, including an obligation to pay royalties to the government and landowners.\n\n## Aluminium regulations\n\n## Environment\n\nHydro's aluminium operations are subject to a broad range of environmental laws and regulations, both inside and outside the EU. These laws and regulations impose stringent environmental protection standards related to air emissions, water management, hazardous materials and waste management.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions\n\nThe aluminium industry is included in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). The aluminium industry is affected by the scheme directly and indirectly by the pass through of CO 2 allowance costs by power producers into the power prices ('indirect effects').\n\nAluminium production is qualified as an industrial sector exposed to a significant risk of 'carbon leakage' (i.e. risk of European operations losing market share to less carbonefficient installations outside the EU). Aluminium producers therefore receive a higher percentage of free emission allowances compared to sectors not exposed to carbon leakage. Aluminium producers are also eligible to apply for indirect carbon cost compensation for the indirect effects of ETS in the power prices under the state aid guidelines adopted according to the ETS Directive.\n\nIn December 2022, the EU Commission, the European Council and the European Parliament finalized negotiations on a revision of the ETS Directive, accompanied by a new carbon leakage mechanism called the Carbon Border\n\nAdjustment Mechanism (CBAM) Regulation. Ambitions were raised to a total emission cut of 55 percent by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, up from 40 percent under present regulation. For the sectors covered by CBAM, the ETS Directive stipulates a phase out of free allowances from 2026 to 2034. The final text of both instruments is expected in first quarter 2023. Reporting obligation under CBAM will start in October 2023.\n\n## Trade and Tariffs\n\nThe international trade framework has a significant impact on Hydro's business through political developments (EU-USChina relations), the strategic agenda of key trading blocs (regional and bilateral free trade agreements, developments at the WTO, etc.), and technical instruments such as tariffs, anti-dumping duties and other trade measures.\n\nThe EU tariff rates on imports of alumina, primary and semifinished aluminium products vary from 3 to 7.5 percent, excluding aluminium metal produced in the EEA and other countries the EU has a free trade agreement with. Since 2020, the EU has in place anti-dumping duties on aluminium extrusions from China, currently in the range of 21.2-32.1 percent. The EU also has specific anti-dumping duties on certain aluminium products such as foil, wheels and radiators imported from China. In December 2022, the UK decided anti-dumping duties to be applied on imports of certain aluminium extrusion from China to UK in the range between 0 percent and 35 percent.\n\nThe US currently has a tariff of 10 percent on aluminium imports, excluding imports from Australia, Argentina, Canada and Mexico. In October 2021, the EU and the US reached a temporary agreement regarding US Section 232 tariffs on aluminium by replacing duties with a tariff-rate quota from January 1, 2022. This agreement covers imports from the EU to the US while exports from Norway and Qatar will still be exposed to the tariffs.\n\n## Energy regulations\n\nHydro's main production assets are hydropower based and situated in Norway. The ownership and utilization of large Norwegian waterfalls for hydropower production is subject to various laws and regulatory requirements, including a requirement for concession from the Ministry of Petroleum\n\n## Regulations\n\nHydro is subject to a broad range of laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which it operates. These laws and regulations impose stringent standards and requirements, and potential liabilities relating to the construction and operation of our plants and facilities, air and water pollutant emissions, the storage, treatment and discharge of waste waters, the use and handling of hazardous or toxic materials, waste disposal practices, and the remediation of environmental contamination, among other things. Some of the laws and regulations deemed most material to Hydro's type of operations are elaborated below. Tax regulations are covered in the Country by Country report. 1\n\n## Bauxite & Alumina regulations\n\nEnvironmental Regulation\n\nHydro's operations in Brazil are subject to strict license and environmental regulations requirements.\n\nUnder Brazilian law, an environmental license is required for any activity that has the potential to pollute, which is often made subject to conditions to ensure regulatory compliance or to mitigate effects on the environment or local communities. Hydro's Brazilian operations hold several environmental licenses.\n\nParticular regulations apply to our operations in the Minerac\u00e3o Paragominas S.A. (Paragominas) mine, due to its location in the Amaz\u00f4nia region. The Brazilian Forest Code requires that 80 percent of a rural property with native forest in the Amaz\u00f4nia region must be preserved as an Environmental Legal Reserve, implying that a mine cannot be developed without a sustainable forest management plan. However, within states that have an Economic-Ecological Zoning, for the purpose of environmental restoration, the legal reserve requirement is set to 50 percent, applicable for our operations in Paragominas.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions\n\nIn 2020, Brazil reaffirmed the commitment to a 37 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 and 43 percent by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, as first submitted as targets at the 2015 Climate Change Conference in Paris.",

EU regulations of power markets as well as the EU Water Framework Directive are by and large implemented in Norwegian law.\n\nApproximately one-third (3 TWh) of Hydro's normal annual production is subject to concession terms requiring Hydro to transfer ('revert') the production assets to the Norwegian state when the concession expires. The majority of concessions will expire around 2050. Reversion can be avoided if the power plants, or two-thirds or more of the shares of the entity that owns the power plants, are sold to a public entity prior to reversion.\n\nHydro is currently developing a portfolio of production assets within wind and solar power (Hydro Rein) and renewable hydrogen (Hydro Havrand), which are expected to build, own and operate assets in multiple jurisdictions.\n\nWind, solar and hydrogen projects are all subject to various regulatory matters, such as license requirements, grid access requirements, land and zoning regulations, and HSE. The offshore wind and hydrogen industries are fairly new, and regulations are currently under development in several jurisdictions.\n\n'Hydro is currently developing a portfolio\n\nof production assets within wind and\n\nsolar power (Hydro Rein) and renewable\n\nhydrogen (Hydro Havrand), which are\n\nexpected to build, own and operate assets\n\nin multiple jurisdictions.'",

Key markets have experienced their highest inflation levels for the past 20 years, and in response many central banks increased interest rates during the year, weakening demand. Continued global supply chain disruptions and China's zero-Covid policy further reduced growth.\n\n## Bauxite & Alumina\n\nThe World excluding China alumina market was oversupplied in 2022, with China absorbing the excess production as imports to balance the global market. The World excluding China production decreased 3 percent from 2021, driven by refinery curtailments in Europe exceeding alumina production increases in Indonesia and India. In Ukraine, the Mykolaiv refinery was fully shut down in the second quarter following the onset of the war in Ukraine.\n\nChinese alumina production increased 6 percent from 2021, driven by the ramp-up of several new greenfield refineries, mostly using imported bauxite.\n\nThe Platts alumina price index started the year at USD 345 per mt, ranging from USD 310 to 533 per mt during 2022. The price increased strongly at the beginning of the year following the onset of the war in Ukraine reflecting heightened supply risk, reaching an annual high of USD 533 per mt in the middle of March. Prices trended down during the second quarter stabilizing around USD 330 per mt of the remainder of the year, reflecting price levels of domestic alumina in China.\n\nThe Platts alumina price index averaged USD 362 per mt for the year, a 10 percent increase compared to 2021. Prices as a percentage of LME varied, averaging 13.4 percent for the year compared with 13.2 percent in 2021. The price index at the end of 2022 represented 13.8 percent of the three month aluminium price quoted on LME.\n\nChina imported 1.9 million mt (1.0 million mt net of exports) of alumina in 2022, compared to net imports of 3.1 million mt in 2021. Australia accounted for 56 percent of imports followed by Indonesia and Vietnam with 23 percent and 10 percent, respectively. China exported 0.8 million mt of alumina to Russia in 2022.\n\nChina imported 126.3 million mt of bauxite in 2022, 18 percent higher than the previous year. Imports from Guinea increased 28 percent from 2021 to 70.2 million mt, with smaller increases of 11 percent and 1 percent of imports from Indonesia, to 19.7 million mt, and Australia to 34.2 million mt, respectively. These three countries accounted for 98 percent of China's bauxite imports in 2022, compared to 99 percent in 2021.\n\nThe price of bauxite imported into China in 2022 increased to an annual average of USD 58 per mt CIF China compared to USD 48 per mt CIF China in 2021, mainly driven by higher oil prices and ocean freight rates.\n\n## Primary Aluminium\n\nThree month LME prices started the year at USD 2,808 per mt and ended the year at USD 2,378 per mt. Prices increased in the first quarter reaching an all time high in March of USD 3,849 per mt as the war in Ukraine increased the fear of sanctions on Russian producers and significant disruptions to metal flows. Prices decreased significantly in the second quarter before trading around USD 2,200 - 2,400 per mt for the remainder of the year driven by a weaker macroeconomic environment.\n\nThe US and European standard ingot premiums started the year at USD 665 per mt and at USD 425 per mt respectively. European standard ingot premiums increased in the first half of the year peaking in May at a new all time high of USD 615 per mt, prices then decreased steadily before stabilizing around USD 250 per mt at the end of the year as a weaker macroeconomic environment effected demand. The US Midwest standard ingot premium peaked at an all time high of USD 882 per mt in April, then declined steadily to around USD 490 per mt at the end of the year as a weaker macroeconomic environment effected demand.\n\nGlobal primary aluminium consumption increased by 0.4 percent to 69.2 million mt in 2022. Global supply increased by 2.3 percent to 68.9 million mt resulting in global deficit of around 0.3 million mt. For 2023, global primary aluminium demand is expected to increase by around 1 percent and aluminium production is expected to increase by around 2 percent, resulting in a global surplus in 2023.",

Overall, the demand and supply for primary aluminium was balanced outside China in 2022. Demand for primary aluminium outside China is expected to increase by around 1 percent in 2023. Corresponding production is expected to be up about 1-2 percent. Demand and supply for the world outside China is expected to be balanced in 2023.\n\nDemand for primary metal in China increased around 0.3 percent to 40.2 million mt in 2022. Chinese production increased by 4.0 percent in 2022. The Chinese market was mainly balanced in 2022. Energy supply issues encountered in 2021 were resolved in 2022, facilitating significant restarts of previously curtailed capacity supporting production growth. Chinese primary production is expected to increase by 2-3 percent in 2023. Primary metal demand is estimated to increase by around 1-2 percent, resulting in a slight surplus in 2023.\n\nLME stocks decreased significantly in 2022, from 0.93 million mt at the end of 2021, to 0.45 million mt at the end of 2022. Stocks dropped to a 20 year low of 0.27 million tons in August 2022, followed by a slight increase. Total global inventories, including unreported inventories, are estimated to have decreased by 0.4 million mt in 2022. The total stock level is estimated to be around 9.0 million mt at the end of 2022.\n\nThe European demand for sheet ingot, primary foundry alloys and wire rod increased in 2022. The consumption of extrusion ingot was negatively affected by weakness in the building and construction sector leading to a reduced demand in 2022 compared to 2021.\n\nIn Asia, the demand for extrusion ingot weakened in the second half of 2022 and high inventory levels were reported in the market at the end of the year. Primary foundry alloys demand remained stable due to pent up demand caused by semiconductor and logistics supply disruption in 2021.\n\nThe US demand for extrusion ingot in the US grew throughout the first half of 2022, but moderated toward the end of the year as higher interest rates slowed industrial activity. Meanwhile, primary foundry alloy demand steadily picked up throughout the year as automobile and light truck production rebounded with improvements in deliveries of semiconductors.\n\n## Extruded Products\n\nExtrusion demand growth moderated throughout 2022 after rebounding strongly in both Europe and North America in 2021, following the severe slowdown in 2020. Demand remained fairly strong in the first half of the year, but started to weaken in the second half as the macro environment weakened, particularly in Europe due to the war in Ukraine and high inflation. European extrusion demand increased 2 percent in the first half of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, while demand fell 10 percent in the second half compared to second half 2021. North American demand also moderated in the second half of 2022, with growth slowing from around 6 percent in the first half of 2022 to flat growth in the second half compared to same periods last year.\n\nBuilding and construction, and industrial segments experienced the weakest development in 2022 after strongly rebounding in 2021. Higher interest rates and reduced consumer spending negatively impacted the underlying demand for these segments, with further weakness expected in the first half of 2023. The automotive segment is improving as automotive producers are increasing production amid easing of supply chain issues.\n\nOverall, European demand is estimated to have decreased by 4 percent in 2022, compared to 2021. CRU estimates that European extrusion demand will further decrease by 7 percent in 2023, compared to 2022, with growth picking up in the second half of the year. North American demand is estimated to have increased 3 percent in 2022, compared to 2021. CRU estimates that North American extrusion demand will decrease by 1 percent in 2023, compared to 2022.\n\n## Energy market developments\n\nBoth Nordic and continental power prices reached record levels in 2022. The war in Ukraine has generated a sharp increase in energy prices and significant volatility in energy markets. Fuel prices were already at a high level early in the year, but both price level and volatility increased to unprecedented levels as Russian coal and gas supply gradually eroded. In addition to the gas shortage, weak hydrology in the Nordic area, drought at the continent and sustained problems with French nuclear power capacity contributed to the high price levels. The significant price area differences in the Nordic region have remained during the year due to limitations in transmission capacity between the Northern and Southern part of the NordPool area.",

Energy and Extrusions also achieved returns significantly above the target level during 2022. Bauxite & Alumina RoaCE was lower in 2022 compared to 2021, mainly driven by higher raw material and energy prices.\n\n## Cash effective change in net operating capital 1)\n\nCash effective change in net operating capital from continuing operations amounted to NOK (8.8) billion during 2022, compared to NOK (8.6) billion during 2021. While seasonality and a weakening market towards year end contributed to a net release of trade receivables, the market slowdown also contributed to an inventory increase driven by excess production, price increases, and security of supply measures. The settlement of the Slovalco power hedge position also contributed to increase in net operating capital.\n\n## Capex 1)\n\nTotal capex in 2022 ended up at NOK 11.5 billion, up from NOK 6.9 billion in 2021. Projects prioritized in 2022, include critical maintenance activities needed to safeguard Hydro's production assets in every business area.

Growth and return-seeking capex was mainly related to the expansion of remelt capacity in Extrusions and Aluminium Metal, new extrusion presses and customer-driven investments in Extrusions, and investments in Hydro Rein and Batteries in Energy.\n\n## Free cash flow 1)\n\nFree cash flow from continuing operations ended at NOK 14.0 billion in 2022, up from NOK 10.5 billion in 2021. Cash generation was supported by strong EBITDA results, partly offset by increased capex and build in net operating capital.\n\n## Dividend\n\nHydro's ambition is to pay attractive dividends to shareholders. In light of the strong financial performance in 2022, and reflecting our robust balance sheet, the Board of Directors has proposed to distribute NOK 13.5 billion, which represents 61.6 percent of 2022 adjusted net income, as a combination of NOK 5.65 per share of cash dividends and NOK 2 billion of share buybacks. The final shareholder distribution for 2022 is subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting on May 10, 2023.\n\n## Financial performance\n\n## Financial performance\n\n## Adjusted EBITDA\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2022, increased compared to the same period last year. Higher realized all-in metal and alumina prices, record high annual results in both Extrusions and Energy, and positive currency effects were offset by higher fixed and raw material costs upstream.\n\n## Net income\n\nNet income from continuing operations amounted to NOK 24,381 million in 2022, compared to NOK 13,930 million in 2021. In addition to the factors described above, net income from continuing operations included a net foreign exchange gain of NOK 2,192 million, a NOK 3,352 million unrealized loss on power and raw material contracts, and a NOK 3,003 million unrealized gain on LME related contracts.\n\n## Return on average capital employed (RoaCE)\n\nIn 2022, Hydro achieved an adjusted return on average capital employed of 22.2 percent, higher than the 18.6 percent achieved in 2021, and above the ambition to deliver 10 percent over the cycle. The main driver behind the strong returns was record high results in Aluminium Metal following high all-in metal prices and positive currency effects.\n\n## Adjusted EBITDA\n\nNOK billion\n\n<!-- image -->",

The net cash reduction was driven by a positive free cash flow, which was offset by shareholder distributions as well as currency and lease effects.\n\n## Adjusted net cash (debt) 1)\n\nHydro's adjusted net cash (debt) was NOK (6.0) billion at the end of 2022, compared to NOK (7.0) billion at the end of 2021. The adjusted net debt reduction was mainly driven by a reduction in cash collateral and pension obligations, partly offset by a reduction in net cash.\n\n## Adjusted net (cash) debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio 2)\n\nHydro's adjusted net (cash) debt to adjusted EBITDA was 0.2, well below the targeted maximum ratio of 2.0 over the cycle.\n\n## Liquidity\n\nHydro held NOK 29.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents and NOK 0.8 billion in time deposits at the end of the year. Short-term bank deposits are normally available at short notice. Norsk Hydro ASA has a USD 1.6 billion revolving multi-currency credit facility with a syndicate of international banks, maturing in December 2026. The facility was undrawn per year-end 2022. Overdraft facilities and liquidity lines also provide access to additional short-term liquidity.\n\n## Improvement program\n\nBy the end of 2022, Hydro realized NOK 7.8 billion in improvements, exceeding the original target of NOK 7.0 billion for the year. During the year, Hydro increased the improvement program target by NOK 1.5 billion to NOK 10.0 billion by 2025, including a positive rebasing effect of approximately NOK 0.7 billion. Hydro also extended the program to 2027, with additional targeted improvements of NOK 1.0 billion. Extrusions is the main driver of the strong 2022 performance through procurement savings and the Extrusions Business System (EBS) initiative. Key improvements in Bauxite & Alumina and Aluminium Metal included improvements to operational parameters and raw material consumption. Hydro's target for 2023 is to achieve NOK 8.4 billion in accumulated improvements.\n\n## Commercial ambition\n\nHydro realized NOK 1.8 billion in commercial initiatives by the end of 2022, out of the total NOK 2.5 billion ambition by 2025. Hydro has also extended the program to 2027, with additional improvements of NOK 0.5 billion. The 2022 commercial impact in Extrusions is mainly driven by margin improvements. Bauxite & Alumina achieved higher premiums on their alumina sales compared to their performance benchmark. Finally, Aluminium Metal increased greener product sales as well increased impact from new products, such as HyForge. In total, 470 kt of CIRCAL and REDUXA were sold in 2022, which is around 185 kt more than in 2021.",

To mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, long-term debt is mainly maintained in currencies reflecting underlying exposures and cash generation.\n\nThe table shows sensitivities regarding aluminium prices and foreign currency fluctuations for 2023. The table illustrates the sensitivity of adjusted earnings, before tax, interest and depreciation to changes in these factors and is provided to supplement the sensitivity analysis required by IFRS, included in note 8.2 Financial instruments to the financial statements. These sensitivities are on an adjusted basis, and do not consider revaluation effects of derivative instruments, which may influence earnings. The sensitivities include the impact from financial risk management contracts per December 31, 2022.\n\n## Sensitivities with 100% production\n\n## Commodity price sensitivity +10%\n\nNOK million\n\nAluminium (Adj.

By reducing our footprint, improving relations with stakeholders and neighbors, managing impacts, increasing resource efficiency and developing new markets, Hydro will reduce risk and create new opportunities. Hydro has quantified ambitions towards 2030 and 2050 that will improve our performance on climate, environment, and social responsibility.\n\n## Climate performance\n\nHydro's ambition is to be a net-zero company by 2050 or earlier, delivering net-zero products and enabling a netzero society. In 2022, Hydro's total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were 6.5 percent lower than the 2018 climate strategy baseline, and is still on track in to deliver on our target of total emission reductions of 10 percent by 2025. Hdyro recycled 321,000 tonnes of post-consumer aluminium scrap, enabling the production of 100 tonnes of Hydro CIRCAL with 100 percent post-consumer scrap, and 50,000 tonnes of Hydro CIRCAL with a minimum of 75 percent recycled post-consumer scrap. In 2022, Hydro has also set reduction targets for Scope 3 emissions towards 2030 - a 15 percent reduction in total emissions and a 30 percent reduction in Scope 3 emissions per ton aluminium delivered to market, both from a 2018 baseline.\n\n## Environmental performance\n\nThe goal of Hydro's environment strategy is to minimize impact across our operations by addressing environmental challenges. Hydro is progressing according to plan towards 2030. In 2022, our rehabilitation target was met for our mining site in Paragominas, Brazil and a Global Procedure on biodiversity and ecosystem services management was established. Hydro has a target to eliminate all recoverable waste generated by our operations, by 2040. In 2022, the company recycled 71 percent of our waste and has started to develop specific roadmaps to eliminate the landfilling of the remaining recoverable waste. For bauxite tailings and residue, specifically, the Tailings Dry Backfill (TDB) methodology, implemented in 2021, has eliminated the need to build new tailings storage facilities in Paragominas, Hydro continues our R&D activities into bauxite residue reuse. In 2022, 66 percent of the tailings generated at our mine were\n\ndiverted to temporary storage for drying under the TDB method.\n\n## Social performance\n\nHydro is working towards a transition to a low-carbon economy that also provides a just transition, where job creation and decent work is ensured, and aims to contribute to the development of local communities where it operate. In 2022, Hydro developed a framework for supporting a just transition and established a forum for Human Rights in the company. Solutions for increased traceability and transparency of sustainability data in the value chain have been piloted with some key customers during 2022. A roadmap for implementation across all business areas by 2025 is developed. Hydro educated almost 25,000 people as part of our ambition to provide quality education and capacity building to 500,000 people by 2030, achieving 31 percent of the target on aggregate. Moreover, Hydro contributed NOK 69 million in community investments, charitable donations and sponsorships around the world.\n\nThe total recordable injury rate was 2.4 per million hours worked in 2022, an improvement from 3.3 in 2021. This is our best result to date. The majority of injuries were classified as minor, with one life changing injury and zero fatalities recorded during the year.\n\nThe diversity, inclusion and belonging strategy was further developed in 2022, and implementation is continuing in all business areas. Our gender balance improved by 2 percentage points, with 22 percent of the Hydro workforce comprising women by the end of 2022.\n\n## Sustainability reporting\n\nThe Sustainability chapter presents Hydro's management of and performance on material climate, environmental and social issues. The Sustainability statements includes detailed performance indicators and our principles for sustainability reporting. Our materiality assessment is presented in the section on Sustainability reporting the Hydro way, in the Governance chapter. Hydro reports on its sustainability performance in accordance with the GRI standards. Please see our GRI index at Hydro.com/gri.",

Risk information is reviewed and monitored on an ongoing basis, considering the pace of internal and external change\n\n## Risk review\n\nEnterprise Risk Management in Hydro\n\nRisk management is an integral part of all our business activities and decisions.\n\nThe Board of Directors (BoD) sets expectations, oversees Hydro's system of risk management and reviews key risks through biannual updates which serve as an important foundation for the strategy and business planning processes. In addition, specific topics will be subject to more frequent updates. Progress on risk mitigation is reflected in the remuneration schemes of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Corporate Management Board (CMB). The Board Audit Committee supports the BoD's supervisory role. The CMB is responsible for Hydro's risk management framework at group level and assists the CEO in its execution. The framework is inspired by international standards, and Hydro more specifically apply the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission's 'COSO Internal Control - Integrated Framework' (2013) with respect to Financial Reporting.\n\nRisk management is an integral part of all our business activities and decisions.\n\nThe further attribution of risk management roles in Hydro is supported by the development of a three lines of defense (3LoD) governance model.\n\nThe first line of defense resides with managers at all levels in business areas and corporate functions. They have the responsibility for and ownership of incident and HSE risks. Business areas and corporate functions ensure that risks within their respective areas of accountability are identified, assessed, adequately mitigated, documented, reported and updated. The frequency of updates is dependent on the nature of each risk as well as the pace of internal or external change.\n\nThe second line comprises governance owners and subject matter experts in different risk areas. They develop policies\n\nand procedures for managing risk and coordinate an annual risk assessment with a biannual status update. More broadly, they support, challenge and monitor the first line of defense.\n\nThe third line comprises Group Internal Audit & Investigation. This department independently evaluates whether Hydro's risk management, control and governance processes, as designed and implemented by management, are adequate and contribute to the achievement of the organization's objective.\n\nThrough the 3LoD model, major risks are managed according to Hydro's risk appetite and consolidated at group level through the annual strategy process, with a status update provided in the business planning process, while mitigating plans progress on an ongoing basis.\n\nAn overview of Hydro's key risks, including developments during the last 12 months and related mitigating actions, is included below. Overall, Hydro has seen an evolution of the company's risk profile rather than a material change, with emphasis on the challenges of protectionism, regionalization and the company's new strategic direction. Despite Hydro's best efforts, our risk-mitigating initiatives may fail or prove to be inadequate to mitigate all risks. As our risks increase, decrease and change, and as new risks emerge over time, the information contained in this section should be carefully considered by investors.",

They could have a significant upside and are characterized by their large scale and potential long-term impact on sustainability and profitability. They are generally influenced by structural shifts in the external business environment.\n\n## Incident risks\n\nIncident risks are mainly operational or influenced by operational processes. They will often, but not always, materialize suddenly and with immediate impact. Short-term mitigation is typically within Hydro's control. Hydro's main incident risks could impact several parts of the value chain with a broad range of consequences.\n\n## HSE risks\n\nHSE risks relate to health, safety, security and/or environmental events. They are often operational or influenced by operational processes. Hydro's main HSE risks could influence multiple parts of the business. In addition to their HSE-related consequences, these risks may also result in major legal, social, reputational and financial impacts.\n\n| Strategic risks                                                                             | Influenceability   | Likelihood   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------|\n| 1.

Sustainability trends\n\n## Description\n\nStakeholders' expectations on Hydro's sustainability performance continue to evolve. While our CO 2 footprint is among the lowest of aluminium producers, the production process remains energy and carbon intensive. In addition, key stakeholders are increasingly looking beyond carbon and focusing on the overall sustainability footprint, including environmental and social factors.\n\n## Consequences\n\nA failure to deliver on expectations could negatively impact our license to operate, damage our reputation and increase the risk of substitution away from aluminium.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Developments\n\nGlobal awareness and attention toward sustainability continues to trend upwards. To a large degree, this is positive for Hydro compared to peers mainly due to Hydro's renewable power and recycling portfolio. In addition to current climate change targets, the attention towards biodiversity and social aspects is expected to increase as decarbonization roadmaps become more mature. Customers' expectations increasingly reflect this across all aspects of sustainability and along the entire value chain.\n\nRegulations are tightening, especially in Europe. Investments in research and development toward greener solutions are growing, which increases the drive to deliver sustainable materials. In general, all geographies, industries and companies are expected to come under increased scrutiny.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nIn 2020, Hydro established a new strategic direction to strengthen our position in low-carbon aluminum and grow within renewable energy. Hydro is committed to reduce its GHG emissions by 30 percent by 2030. This includes projects to reduce CO 2 emissions in the value chain such as a fuel switch to LNG and the electrification of boilers at Alunorte, while research on the use of hydrogen or other zero emissions processes in the cast-houses is being developed.\n\nWithin primary aluminium production, Hydro is working on various methods to reduce direct emissions, while also targeting an increased use of post-consumer scrap, thereby reducing total energy usage and metal waste. These contribute towards our longer-term technology roadmap to decarbonize main processes such as primary smelting and recycling, supporting our overall ambition to become carbon neutral by 2050.\n\nIn 2022, Hydro made good progress on our ambitions through installing the first electrical boiler at our alumina refinery, producing the first batch of aluminium products based on 100 percent post-consumer scrap, and progressing on the development our carbon free aluminium production technology in line with our targets. This enables our growing portfolio of lowcarbon aluminum products, sold at a premium pricing.\n\nAlongside decarbonization, progress is made on other environmental areas such as biodiversity, waste and water as well as stronger community relationships, particularly in Brazil. Initiatives to improve our social and environmental impact are monitored, communicated, and reported on a regular basis. This is in line with our Just Transition framework, focusing on three key societal outcomes: protecting human rights and providing access to equal opportunities, contributing to resilient local communities, and supporting people to gain the necessary skills and jobs for the future low-carbon economy.",

Value chain concentration\n\n## Description\n\nHydro receives almost all our alumina from Hydro-owned operations in Brazil, whereby the bauxite mine at Paragominas supplies the majority of raw materials to the Alunorte alumina refinery through a 244 kilometers long pipeline.\n\nOn several occasions during the past few years, Hydro experienced challenges with respect to its operations in Brazil due to a combination of factors involving physical climate incidents, asset integrity (ability to run assets effectively and reliably) and a complex political and social environment. In response, Hydro has made significant efforts to enhance the robustness of our operations in the region.\n\n## Consequences\n\nHydro's integrated aluminium production chain poses risks related to value chain concentration, where disruptions in the bauxite and alumina production located in one region in Brazil could negatively impact metal production in other parts of the company.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Developments\n\nThe Bauxite & Alumina assets operated at expected capacity throughout 2022, despite continued complexities relating to the Covid-19 pandemic. The political and regulatory environment in Brazil has been relatively stable over the course of the year, although the polarized election campaign may indicate some uncertainty going forward.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nIn Brazil, actions have been taken to improve asset integrity, strengthen community relationships and reduce our long-term environmental impact. Systematic social responsibility efforts are ongoing, including the Sustainable Barcarena initiative and commitments stemming from the agreement with the Government of Par\u00e1 and Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico. Hydro is engaged in a systematic dialogue with political, governmental, non-governmental and local communities regarding the social and regulatory challenges facing our operations and the communities in which Hydro operates.\n\nThe physical adaption of assets and supply chain robustness are important mitigating factors against the risk posed by climate change related incidents, such as flooding, landslides, droughts, and the implications these may have on the local environment, as well as our ability to continue safe operations and access to raw materials and markets.\n\nCommercial activities within alumina and other raw materials provide access to key markets and other sources as a tool in managing supply disruption risk.",

Macro-economic developments, geopolitical tensions, protectionism and trade disruptions\n\n## Description\n\nThe aluminium industry is pro-cyclical with demand for products closely linked to overall economic conditions. Protectionism is the process by which countries impose barriers to free trade with the intention of protecting national interests. Geopolitical tensions are often the underlying cause of such actions. Trade and supply chain disruptions can impact the access to and cost of raw materials.\n\n## Consequences\n\nProtectionism may directly affect Hydro's ability to access certain markets and trade competitively. It also leads to lower economic growth, which could indirectly affect the demand for our products.\n\nHigher import duties and trade barriers increase costs, impacting the quantity, quality and price of internationally traded goods which Hydro requires to run our operations.\n\nPeriods of macroeconomic uncertainty or recession can increase the price volatility for aluminium products, affecting Hydro's ability to deliver stable returns. Macro-economic developments also drive changes in currency rates, which may have a significant adverse effect on Hydro's cost and competitive position. At the industry level, changing dynamics in major aluminium producing countries, such as China, may see large volumes of aluminium enter the market, reducing global price levels.\n\nIn the long-term, renewable energy scarcity and high supply costs in countries where Hydro operates could affect our competitiveness.\n\n## Developments\n\nHigh inflation, increasing interest rates, higher energy costs and additional factors such as those stemming from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine have impacted economic growth, affecting demand for Hydro's products. Hydro operates in several countries which could face energy scarcity resulting in the rationing of energy, either caused by sudden events such as the curtailment of gas supply from Russia or gradually increasing supply challenges, particularly during winter months. Energy rationing could materially disrupt Hydro's operations in those countries.\n\nSupply chain disruptions, both logistical and geopolitical, are adversely impacting the supply and cost of certain raw materials to our operations as well as our customers' ability to receive goods on which they depend to run their operations. This has been further exacerbated by continued shipping constraints.\n\nIn March 2021, the European Union (EU) imposed anti-dumping duties on certain aluminium extrusions from China for a period of five years. This was followed in the UK by a similar decision in December 2022. A temporary agreement between the US and EU regarding US Section 232 tariffs on aluminium replaces duties with quotas while exports from Norway and Qatar are still exposed to 10 percent tariffs.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nRobust and stable operations, a strong balance sheet, high focus on operational and commercial improvements, competitive power contracts and strategic hedging support Hydro's robust positioning during potential downturns. Due to the Energy crisis, severe market volatility has adversely affected liquidity in the industry. Hydro proactively monitors and manages credit risk in our contract portfolio, and maintains constructive dialogues with relevant contract parties. However, actions may still be needed in response to market conditions, for example due to a significant reduction in market demand for aluminium billets in Europe and high energy prices, Hydro decided to close its majority owned primary aluminum Hydro Slovalco plant in Slovakia and partially reduce production at two plants in Norway until market conditions improve.\n\nIn general, Hydro is well positioned to handle challenges arising from protectionism and regionalization. The majority of our network of aluminium metal plants is located within large well-established markets, and our downstream operations have strong local presence in both Europe and North America. Hydro also actively participates in organizations aiming to promote and foster fair trade, such as European Aluminium and the U.S. Aluminum Association.\n\nThe supply chain risk is managed through a combination of physical inventory build-ups for key raw materials, selective hedging, long-term agreements with approved suppliers and commercial activities in the marketplace.\n\nFor further information on our mitigating financial measures, please refer to the Performance review section Hydro's key financial exposures and note 8.1 Financial and commercial risk management.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Regulatory & policy framework uncertainty\n\n## Description\n\nThe aluminium industry is subject to multiple local and global regulatory frameworks, including mining regulations, tariffs, labor laws and power industry regulations. Additionally, climate related regulations in the European Union (EU) such as the implementation of national and regional CO 2 taxes and increased attention on similar regulations in the United States of America (US) are at the forefront of the current uncertainty. The growing pressure to meet climate goals is driving the pace of new regulations and their increased scope regarding all aspects of sustainability.\n\n## Consequences\n\nThe sustainability driven developments in regulatory frameworks largely represent an opportunity for Hydro. There might however be unintended consequences arising from complexity, the uneven impact of and increased emphasis on legislation, potentially impacting aluminum's competitiveness versus other materials, the economic viability of our operations and/or ability to conduct business in certain markets.\n\nA failure to comply with such laws across multiple local and global regulatory frameworks could expose Hydro to investigations, criminal and civil sanctions such as fines, penalties or loss of licenses, materially impacting the financial results. In addition, there could be adverse consequences such as reputational damage.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Developments\n\nThe growing pressure to meet climate goals is driving the pace of new regulations and their increased scope regarding all aspects of sustainability. This is increasingly aligned with a push towards strengthening regional sustainable supply chains, reducing dependence on global markets for key raw materials and energy sources.\n\nIn Europe, the EU has reacted to the energy security challenges arising from the Russian invasion of Ukraine by increasing its drive towards renewable power, launching its sweeping 'REPowerEU' legislative package in May, aiming to reduce consumption, increase renewable production and diversify energy supplies. The US passed 'The Inflation Reduction Act', a landmark federal law which includes investments in clean energy production, reducing emissions and improving energy security.\n\nThe 'Fit for 55' climate legislative package proposed in 2021, includes among other things, a review of the emissions trading system (ETS). The EU reached an agreement on the revision of the ETS and introduction of a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in December 2022. The new ETS and CBAM means that free allocation of emission allowances for aluminium production will be phased out from 2026 to 2034. By 2025, the Commission will also consider whether to replace the indirect CO 2 cost compensation scheme with a CBAM on Scope 2 emissions. The US has been considering similar mechanisms, but so far focused on investment support through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).\n\nThe Commission has proposed amendments to the EU's electricity market design in addition to various national and EU initiatives already introduced to soften the impact of the energy crisis. In addition, there is uncertainty around potential structural reform to the EU's electricity market design in addition to various national and EU initiatives already introduced to soften the impact of the energy crisis.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nHydro continues to actively engage with regulators and industry associations, where appropriate, to ensure that aluminium's position is taken into consideration. Hydro has been involved in the development of international frameworks on climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, supporting the establishment of a level playing field for the industry.\n\nFor power industry regulations, Hydro engages in various activities to support and promote sustainable energy policies in the regions in which it operates, in addition to securing competitive energy supplies for our own operations.",

Technological breakthroughs\n\n## Description\n\nHydro is exposed to disruptive technological developments by our direct competitors or by other competing materials and industries. Materials produced with technologies giving lower sustainability footprints could have a significant advantage and could challenge aluminium in key application areas.\n\n## Consequences\n\nThe successful industrialization of competing metals with lower sustainability footprints could increase the risk of substitution and potentially lower demand for aluminium.\n\nThe successful commercialization of breakthrough technological developments such as inert anodes would impact Hydro's comparative advantage as an aluminium producer with one of the lowest CO 2 footprints.\n\nOur new business ventures into growth markets such as hydrogen, batteries, and solar energy also expose Hydro to the increased risks associated with immature technologies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Developments\n\nThe increasing focus on sustainability is part of a long-term trend and expected to continue going forward. Hydro sees research and development activities across relevant industries concerning CO2-free production methods and competing material, such as production of steel using hydrogen. Within the aluminium industry, several research initiatives are looking into inert anode technology to reduce direct process emissions.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nHydro views technology as a key enabler in delivering on the dual profitability and sustainability strategy. Hydro conducts research and development in house and participates in joint partnerships and projects with other leading industrial companies, universities and research institutions. We also follow external developments closely.\n\nHydro has identified and are executing a number of technology based roadmaps to producing aluminium with near-zero to zero footprint, including recycling of post-consumer scrap, carbon capture, and CO2-free primary production through a chloride based process called HalZero.\n\nWithin renewable energy, risks related to immature technologies are mitigated through entering selective partnerships with established leaders and by taking limited positions to gain experience while restraining the potential downside.",

Climate change\n\n## Description\n\nClimate change related risks comprises climate related physical events that may impact the integrity of our assets (physical risks), as well as strategic challenges arising from climate related policies, regulations and customers' demand for zero or low-emission solutions (transition risks).\n\nPhysical risks could result from climate related acute and/ or chronic changes in rainfall patterns, flooding, shortages of water or other natural resources, variations in sea levels, storm patterns and intensities as well as temperatures.\n\nTransition risks could result from an increased demand for lowcarbon products and solutions, higher costs for greenhouse gas emissions and production inputs, as well changes to market prices for aluminium based products.\n\n## Consequences\n\nThe consequences of physical risks on Hydro's facilities and operations are highly uncertain and could include the flooding of containment basins, interruptions to production processes, infrastructure failures and the potential for major accidents.\n\nTransition risks could positively affect the demand for and valuation of Hydro's low-carbon products and portfolio while also requiring the implementation of additional low-emission solutions throughout the value chain. Current technologies may not be able to meet the abatement and emissions requirements, necessitating the development of new solutions to reduce our carbon footprint.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Developments\n\nPhysical climate risks are on the rise, evidenced by the increased occurrence of climate events such as floods, drought, and forest fires. Hydro is exposed to such physical climate risks through its global footprint, although there was no significant impact to our operations over the course of 2022.\n\nTransition risks are reflected in the increased demand for low-carbon aluminium in our markets. The sales of Hydro Reduxa and Hydro Circal have increased accordingly. Hydro's climate strategy puts Hydro in a leading position to supply low-carbon aluminium to the market. Hydro also sees a growing interest among our customers and end users regarding our decarbonization roadmap and ability to deliver near-zero products well before 2030.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nHydro has conducted comprehensive climate risk assessments to better understand and mitigate the potential consequences of climate related physical events on our operations. Hydro modelled future weather patterns and their potential impact on our sites based on climate models and scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). For 2023, our ambition is to update the physical climate risk assessments and further integrate the findings and management of such risks at an operational level, where the physical adaptation of assets and supply chain robustness are the subject of ongoing attention.\n\nIn order to manage transition risks, Hydro's climate strategy, advocacy work on future climate related legislation, technology and market strategies aim to be consistent with a 1.5 degree scenario. Our long-term positioning, operational and financial planning reflect our assessment of related transition risks. Hydro's capabilities and positioning within renewable energy, batteries, lowcarbon alumina and aluminium products, sorting and recycling, ambitious decarbonization roadmap and new energy ventures positions the company well to benefit from the transition to a low-carbon economy.",

Insufficient asset integrity\n\n## Description\n\nHydro is exposed to a range of risks and hazards including critical equipment breakdowns, power failures and natural catastrophes that could result in disruptions to operations across our business areas\n\n## Consequences\n\nOperational disruptions might reduce or interrupt production at key plants for significant periods of time, materially affecting our financial results and cash flows.\n\nIn Brazil, Hydro operates an integrated mine, pipeline and refining system meaning that a disruption at Paragominas could adversely affect Alunorte and other downstream operations.\n\nSome operations are located close to sizable communities where operational events could also result in significant and potentially lasting impacts on the health and safety of employees, contractors, nearby communities as well as the environment. In addition, Hydro might be subject to claims, fines and further damage to our profitability or reputation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Developments\n\nThe risk of a major operational disruption in Bauxite & Alumina (B&A) remains a subject of ongoing attention. There was no significant disruption in B&A and energy and extrusion sites over the course of 2022, and the long-term risk is expected to decline with the planned investments to sustain and replace equipment across sites. One of the four production lines at the partowned aluminium plant Albras shut down from February 19 to July 29, 2022, due to an internal power distribution failure. This reduced the plant's overall production capacity by 25 percent during the period.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nIn Brazil, Paragominas joined Alunorte and the port in being certified according to the ISO 55001 Asset Management standard. Extensive repairs and maintenance on the Paragominas bauxite pipeline continue to progress according to plan with 36 kilometers completed in 2022. The back up power line between Paragominas and Tom\u00e9-A\u00e7u is expected to be completed in 2023. A third Mobile Harbor Crane was added at Vila Do Conde port to further support bauxite offloading activities, complemented by updated firefighting measures to protect the conveyor belts.\n\nHydro Aluminium Metal made good progress on projects to replace or update critical equipment such as rectifiers, pot control systems and baking furnaces. In response to the recent disruption at Albras, a comprehensive review of busbars has been conducted and Hydro is testing a new busbar by-pass solution.\n\nHydro performs regular inspections and maintenance activities, conducts comprehensive emergency preparedness training with key personnel and maintains a range of business continuity plans across sites to best prevent and mitigate operational disruptions. Our resilience against power outages is enhanced, where appropriate, by automated substations, power generating facilities and back up facilities.",

All business units are frequently mapping and evaluating such risks and implementing corresponding mitigating measures. Risks arising from regulatory developments within the various compliance areas are mitigated by continuous improvements of Hydro's compliance structures and processes. For instance, the risk of potentially breaching trade sanction laws has been given special attention since the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nOne compliance incident involving a US subsidiary is still in progress. Hydro Extrusion USA, LLC executed a plea agreement under which it admitted to a federal misdemeanor violation of the Clean Air Act at its cast house in The Dalles, Oregon. An initial sentencing hearing is set for January 2023, with a second hearing to be scheduled in the second quarter of 2023. The company is continuing to proactively work with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Suspension and Debarment Division. Hydro Extrusion USA, LLC is also engaged in discussions with the EPA's Suspension and Debarment Division with respect to this matter.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nHydro's Code of Conduct requires adherence to laws and regulations as well as global directives and procedures. It is systematically implemented and maintained through our compliance system, which is based on a clear governance structure defining roles and responsibilities to manage the relevant compliance risks. Business Areas have a clear responsibility to act in a compliant manner, while being supported by Group Compliance and competent staff in other functions to help safeguarding compliance. While the system includes controls and activities to prevent, detect, report and respond to compliance failures, the core focus is on the prevention of non-compliance incidents. In addition to policies, guidelines and procedures, Hydro maintains an extensive training program adapted to the company's risks and profile to continuously build and maintain a strong culture of compliance and integrity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Developments\n\nThe underlying cyber security risk to industrial control systems stabilized after a spike early in the year, triggered by uncertainty with regards to the invasion of Ukraine's potential to escalate into cyberwarfare. This was addressed by Hydro through internal control improvements including but not limited to business continuity, incident and crisis management, network security as well as training & awareness.\n\nThe external threats relating to cyber attacks are developing as malicious actors continue to innovate and change their techniques to increase their success rate, requiring organizations to adapt quickly.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nHydro remains vigilant to the unstable geopolitical situation in Europe and other continents where the company operates with possible spillover effects on governmental organizations and companies around the world.\n\nThis risk continues to receive attention through the continuous improvement and close monitoring of compliance to and effectiveness of existing security capabilities. Security controls will be further refined over 2023 and 2024, with a focus on protecting Hydro against the most relevant threat actors and their specific tactics and techniques. Hydro has adopted a risk based approach where new security measures will be prioritized based on continuous evaluation of the dynamic threat landscape.\n\n## 8. Material legal or compliance incident\n\n## Description\n\nWhile Hydro has a strong commitment to act in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the company could still be negatively affected by criminal or civil proceedings or investigations related, but not limited to, alleged anticompetitive or corrupt practices, product quality, environment, health and safety, data privacy, market regulation or trade sanctions.\n\n## Consequences\n\nHydro's controls and initiatives may, however, be insufficient to mitigate the risk of non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations and if such risk materializes there could be material adverse effects on our business. Potential consequences range from fines or penalties, litigation and reputational risk, withdrawal of licenses and suspension or operational shutdowns thereby causing material adverse impacts on Hydro's operating results, cash flow and financial condition.\n\n## 9. Major cyber-attack\n\n## Description\n\nHydro's Information and Technology (I&T) infrastructure is critical to all our operations, ranging from process control systems at production sites to central personnel databases and systems for external reporting.\n\nCybercrime is increasing globally, exposing Hydro to a range of threats to the integrity, availability and confidentiality of our systems. Threats may include attempts to access information, ransomware attacks, destructive installation of viruses, denial of service and other digital security breaches.\n\n## Consequences\n\nA cyber breach could result in a broad range of impacts including HSE events, operational disruptions and the leakage of private or confidential data.",

Material tax change\n\n## Description\n\nHydro is committed to pay equitable taxes where the economic value is created. Our global reach involves complexity and potential volatility linked to regulatory changes on direct and indirect taxes as well as to OECD/EU initiatives such as the Global Tax Reform. In addition, multiple changes often occur in local tax regulations, constantly shifting the global tax landscape, which is challenging to predict and navigate.\n\n## Consequences\n\nChanges to tax regulations can occur suddenly and materially impact Hydro's financial results as well as influence decisions with regards to future investment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Developments\n\nIn Brazil, the tax system remains complex and volatile, with a broad range of direct and indirect taxes levied at federal, state and municipal levels, including the Imposto Sobre Circula\u00e7\u00e3o de Mercadorias e Servi\u00e7os (ICMS) which is an indirect tax charged on circulation of goods and services. Brazil has a general ICMS exemption on exports. Under a 15 years framework agreed in 2015 with the state of Para, Hydro's local operations are under certain conditions entitled to a deferral of the payment of ICMS. A potential discontinuation of the ICMS deferral would materially adversely affect Hydro's operating results from its Brazilian operations.\n\nOver the last year, local authorities showed increased attention to ICMS, requesting that Hydro demonstrates compliance with commitments under the agreement. A 5 percent reduction on the deferral was resolved for Albras, offset by a new Complementary Law which lowers energy tax levies to the general rate.\n\nHydro is involved in a large number of disputes with tax authorities pertaining to the Group's business in Brazil. In Norway, a proposal was introduced in September to increase the effective resource rent tax rate for hydropower from 37 percent to 45 percent, in addition to the introduction of high-price contributions.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nHydro is engaged in a systematic dialogue with local, state and federal politicians as well as industry associations regarding the fiscal regulatory challenges which could impact Hydro's operations. The main topic of this dialogue concerns our contribution to a sustainable aluminum value chain and underlines the need for competitive and predictable framework conditions for its operations.\n\nHydro continuously monitors and responds to global regulatory changes, including the development and implementation of Mandatory Disclosure Regime (MD) guidelines as a response to the directive issued by the EU.",

All such incidents are treated seriously and investigated to their root causes to prevent recurrence.\n\n## Consequences\n\nWorkplace related loss of life has a traumatic and long lasting psychological effect on relatives, close friends and colleagues.\n\nLife changing injuries affect the quality of life of the injured person and often require significant adjustments at home and work. This could be associated with long lasting psychological impacts on the injured person and family, together with the need for ongoing financial support. Police or health and safety agencies might impose sanctions which include imprisonment and fines. In addition, Hydro might need to shut down its operations and be subjected to legal disputes, sanctions and reputational damage. Civil action could result in compensation claims.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Developments\n\nHigh-risk incidents with the potential for a fatality or life threatening injury continue to decrease in both number and rate. There were no life threatening injuries to employees or contractors in 2022, however one life changing injury to a contractor occurred during the year. Initiatives rolled out during the year include robust self-assessment systems across BAs as well as traffic and asset management improvements.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nHydro's approach to HSE and Security includes leaders who are committed to safety and highly visible on the factory floor with well developed and robust HSE management systems, together with employees and contractors who are actively involved in day to day HSE activities reducing risks such as work permitting, risk assessments and root cause analysis.\n\nControl measures aimed at reducing the likelihood of fatal and life changing incidents occurring have been developed and implemented in all business areas. Hydro's fatality prevention procedures are well established and continuously improved.\n\nHigh-risk actions and completion rates are critically reviewed to ensure robust processes and learning across all sites. Frequent health, safety, security and environment network meetings connect specialists from all business areas, who discuss preventative control measures following high-risk incidents and who share best practices and innovative solutions. Machinery safety and asset integrity incidents are receiving particular attention to further prevent failures and constitute an area for further improvement.",

Security incident\n\n## Description\n\nHydro is exposed to security risks such as public violence, robbery or theft. This risk is particularly relevant in the Barcarena region in Brazil, but also present in other areas such as Mexico (Reynosa and Monterrey).\n\n## Consequences\n\nThe outcome of security incidents could be psychological impact, a serious injury, single or multiple fatalities. The risk of kidnapping and subsequent ransom demands is also present.\n\nSecurity incidents could potentially be associated with environmental incidents through attacks on the Paragominas bauxite pipeline and result in business interruptions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Developments\n\nA number of firearm related incidents and robberies occurred in 2022 in relation to Hydro's operations in Paragominas, Alunorte and Extrusion North America, however the overall incident levels have decrease significantly compared to 2021.\n\nViolence in Barcarena and surrounding areas remains comparable to previous years, at a concerning level. There have also been several armed hijacks of trucks used to transport Hydro Extrusions materials in Sao Paulo. The security situation in Reynosa and Monterrey, while not impacting business operations, remains a concern and is monitored closely.\n\nThe war in Ukraine and associated increase in international political tensions elevates the potential risk of sabotage.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nHydro's Bauxite & Alumina security team closely monitors security risks and maintains close contact with security authorities in operational areas. Security training for security teams based in Brazil is ongoing, and weekly security calls incorporate all Hydro locations in the country. Improvements to perimeter fencing and monitoring at Alunorte have improved deterrent and response with improvement in access controls and CCTV implemented.\n\nHydro monitors closely the performance of our security providers, one of which has achieved international accreditation and recognition.\n\nGroup Security closely monitors the security risks in Brazil and maintains close contact with both plants in Mexico ensuring security mitigation measures are aligned with the developments and threat.\n\nThe review of security and emergency preparedness procedures and contingency plans is ongoing to counteract threats to Hydro businesses related to the Russian war on Ukraine.",

Impact on the environment\n\n## Description\n\nHydro's mining and industrial operations are exposed to potential risks that could have a negative impact on the environment. Such risks are usually long-term and may relate to the effects of known and unknown, historical and current emissions to the air, water and soil around Hydro's operations.\n\nMany operational sites have some form of environmental legacy that will need to be remediated prior to site closure. Examples include areas with contaminated ground and landfills that could potentially impact the environment if there is a route of exposure, such as a spread to the food chain via groundwater.\n\n## Consequences\n\nRelated events could have a significant and potentially lasting negative impact on the aquatic life, flora, fauna and may pose health and safety risks to nearby communities if, for example, ground water becomes contaminated. They could also potentially lead to operational shutdowns, fines or legal disputes, negative reputational impacts as well as a material impact on financial results and cash flow.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Developments\n\nChemical usage and waste production are present at all sites, with an inherent risk of spills and leakages. Aluminum Metal and Bauxite & Alumina are the business areas most exposed to significant negative impacts on the environment due to the volumes of hazardous materials used in operations and locations of large sites. There has been a small reduction in severe incidents reported in 2022, compared to previous year.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nAll Hydro sites are required to have action plans in place for known legacies. These are agreed with relevant regulatory bodies. Legacy remediation plans are suitable for known risks, but potential investigations may uncover unknown risks, while there is also an increased scrutiny of operations in Brazil.\n\nIn order to reduce the risks for our operations, Hydro performs extensive risk assessments. These include the modelling of future weather patterns and their impact on Hydro's facilities based on existing climate models from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and scenarios for policy and legal risk, technology, market and reputational risk. Environmental studies are being conducted in Barcarena. These were originally due for completion in 2022, but have been postponed until next year. A rehabilitation plan is in place for Paragominas.\n\nAll sites are required to follow Group standards on chemical and waste management to mitigate the inherent risk of storing, handling and disposing hazardous materials. Chemical management and controls set to prevent spills are included in business area internal audit programs. Hydro has conducted analysis on fluoride emissions from our smelters in Norway and established plans to mitigate their effect on the local deer population.",

There have not been any incidents involving crane failures or other significant defects in other structures during the year.\n\nThe stability of the Schwandorf bauxite residue deposits in Germany has progressed with a drilling and testing program according to Geotechnical Design Standard. Following this assessment, it was concluded that the bauxite residue facilities exhibit geotechnical stability, and no risk elements require immediate measures.\n\n## Mitigation\n\nHydro is continuously seeking to reduce the likelihood of major incidents with risk mitigating activities through the commitment to comply with the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management within the applicable deadlines. Other initiatives include Tailings Dry Backfill technology that will eliminate the long-term risk of failure at Paragominas.\n\nHydropower dams are highly regulated. At closed tailings facilities, the risk of failure under varying conditions, including extreme weather and seismic events (defined as events with a statistical return period of 1:10000), is under investigation. The Paragominas bauxite pipeline's extensive repairs and maintenance program is ongoing, while security concerns associated with the pipeline's length and remote location are addressed through a robust and well embedded fatal risk management approach.\n\nThe old ship unloaders at the Vila do Conde port in Brazil were replaced by new Mobile Harbor Cranes. Frequent contact with the port administration continues with improvements in maintenance and inspections regimes.\n\n## 15. Structural collapse or other major accident\n\n## Description\n\nHydro is exposed to the risk of major accidents such as the collapse of a hydropower dam, an incident at its tailings storage at Paragominas or bauxite residue storage facilities at Alunorte and Schwandorf, the collapse of the entire port structure at the Alunorte alumina refinery or a rupture of its bauxite slurry pipeline between Paragominas and Alunorte.\n\n## Consequences\n\nAny occurrence of such incidents could have a significant and potentially lasting adverse impact on the environment as well as the health and safety of employees, contractors and nearby communities. In addition, Hydro might need to shut down its operations and may be subjected to fines, legal disputes and reputational damage thereby causing a material adverse impact on operating results, cash flow and financial condition.",

The return ex. dividend for 2022 was NOK 5.1, or 7.4 percent. Hydro paid its 2021 dividend of 5.40 NOK/share in May 2022, and 1.45 NOK/share in September 2022. In addition, a NOK 2 billion share buyback program was approved by the Extraordinary General Meeting in September 2022. As of December 31, 2022, 34 percent of the share buyback program had been completed.\n\nHydro's Board of Directors proposes to pay a dividend of NOK 5.65 per share for 2022, and a share buyback program of NOK 2 billion for approval by the Annual General Meeting on May 10, 2023, reflecting Hydro's strong financial position. The proposed payment demonstrates the company's commitment to provide a predictable and competitive dividend.\n\nThe average five-year payout ratio is 74 percent. There were 2,068,998,276 shares issued at the end of 2022. A total of 1,272,589,837 Hydro shares were traded on the Oslo Stock Exchange (OSE) during 2022 at a value of NOK 88.9 billion, making Hydro the third most traded company on the OSE. The average daily trading volume for Hydro shares on the OSE during 2022 was 5,029,999 shares. Hydro's shares are listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange, while our American Depositary Shares (ADSs) trade on OTCQX International in the US, the premium over-the-counter market tier.\n\n## Dividend policy\n\nLong-term return to shareholders should reflect the financial value created by Hydro over time. Total shareholder return consists of dividends and share price development. Hydro's dividend policy is in the long term to pay out minimum 50 percent of adjusted net income as ordinary dividend over the cycle to our shareholders. The dividend policy has a floor of NOK 1.25 per share.\n\nWhen determining the dividend for a specific year, Hydro will take into consideration expected earnings, future investment opportunities, the outlook for world commodity markets and our financial position. Hydro targets an adjusted net debt of around NOK 25 billion over the cycle.\n\n## Top 15 shareholders\n\n| The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries   | 34.7%   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Folketrygdfondet                                | 6.0%    |\n| The Vanguard Group, Inc.                        | 2.4%    |\n| BlackRock Investment Management (UK) Ltd.       | 2.2%    |\n| BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A.     | 2.1%    |\n| Schroder Investment Management Ltd.

This consideration will be made in the light of alternative investment opportunities and our financial situation. In circumstances when share buybacks are relevant, our Board of Directors proposes buyback authorizations to be considered and approved by the Annual General Meeting. Authorizations are granted for a specific time period and for a specific share price interval during which share buybacks can be made, in accordance with applicable regulation.\n\n## Funding and credit quality\n\nMaintaining a strong financial position and an investment grade credit rating are viewed as important risk mitigating factors, supporting Hydro's possibilities for strategic development. Access to external financial resources is required in order to maximize value creation over time, within an acceptable risk exposure.\n\nTo secure access to debt capital on attractive terms, Hydro aims at maintaining an investment grade credit rating from the leading rating agencies. Contributing towards this ambition, Hydro's targets, over the business cycle, a ratio of average Adjusted net cash (debt) to adjusted EBITDA below 2x, and an adjusted net debt of around NOK 25 billion. For further information, see note 7.1 Capital management in the Financial Statements section of this report.\n\n## American Depository Shares\n\nJPMorgan Chase Bank NA, as depositary of the ADSs through its nominee company, Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, held interests in 19,067,034 ordinary shares, or 0.92 percent of the outstanding ordinary shares as of December 31, 2022. The interests are on behalf of 249 registered holders of ADSs.\n\n## Major shareholders and voting rights\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Hydro had 56,441 registered shareholders as per the Norwegian Central Securities Depository (VPS). The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries of Norway was the largest of these with a shareholding of 34.26 percent of the total number of ordinary\n\nshares authorized and issued, and 34.70 percent of the total shares outstanding. As of the same date, the Government Pension Fund - Norway (Folketrygdfondet) owned 5.92 percent of the total number of ordinary shares issued and 6.0 percent of the total shares outstanding. There are no different voting rights associated with the ordinary shares held by the state.\n\nThe Norwegian Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries represents the Norwegian government in exercising the state's voting rights. The state has never taken an active role in the day to day management of Hydro and has for several decades not disposed of any of the ordinary shares owned by it, except when participating in the share buyback programs. All shares carry one vote. It is a requirement of Norwegian legislation that a shareholder can only vote and have preferential subscription rights for shares registered in their name.\n\nShares registered with a nominee account must be reregistered in the Norwegian Central Securities Depositary, Verdipapirsentralen (VPS), before the Annual General Meeting in order to obtain voting rights. This requirement also applies to our US-traded ADSs. Hydro cannot guarantee that beneficial shareholders will receive the notice for a general meeting in time to instruct their nominees to affect a reregistration of their shares. Hydro is organized under the laws of the Kingdom of Norway. It may be difficult for investors to effect service of process outside Norway upon Hydro or its directors and executive officers, or to enforce against Hydro or its directors and executive officers judgments obtained in other jurisdictions. Norwegian courts are unlikely to apply other than Norwegian law when deciding on civil liability claims under securities laws.\n\n## Information from Hydro\n\nCommunicating with the stock market is given high priority, and Hydro aims to maintain an open dialogue with market participants. Our objective is to provide sufficient information on a timely basis to all market participants to ensure a fair valuation of our shares. Information that is considered price sensitive is communicated by news releases and stock exchange announcements. Hydro hosts regular meetings for investors in Europe and the US. The major brokers in Oslo and London publish equity research reports on Hydro. Previous annual and quarterly reports and Hydro's Investor relations' policy are available on Hydro.com.\n\n## Annual General Meeting\n\nThe Annual General Meeting of the company will be held May 10, 2023, at 10:00 CET. Notice to the Annual General Meeting, including information on participation and relevant appendices will be distributed to the company's shareholders at least three weeks prior to the Annual General Meeting.\n\n## Change of address\n\nShareholders registered in the Norwegian Central Securities Depository should send information on changes of address to their registrar and not directly to Hydro.\n\n## Financial calendar 2023 1)\n\n| April 28   | First quarter results   |\n|------------|-------------------------|\n| May 10     | Annual General Meeting  |\n| July 21    | Second quarter results  |\n| October 24 | Third quarter results   |\n\nSee updated calendar on Hydro.com.",

It is an approach that has existed within Hydro since 1905 and guided our development over the years. The Hydro Way originates from our company's identity, our unique set of characteristics and constitutes a way of doing things that differentiates us from other companies.\n\nThe Hydro Way helps set our priorities and serves as a reference point when questions arise. The Hydro Way explains how our business is run through:\n\n- \u009f Our  purpose\n- \u009f Our  values\n- \u009f Our operating model\n\nOur purpose is supported by our values and defines how Hydro conducts our business:\n\nHydro's purpose is to create a more viable society by developing natural resources into products and solutions in innovative and efficient ways.\n\nAll elements of Hydro's environmental and social performance are integrated in Hydro's overall group strategy. This includes specific support strategies on climate change, environment and people as described in the Sustainability section of this annual report.\n\nHydro's constituting documents and global directives describe the requirements for our operations. Policy commitments for responsible business conduct are embedded in business processes through Hydro's directives, mandates and procedures. See the section on Corporate governance for more information.\n\n## Our reporting approach\n\nHydro has based our sustainability reporting on The Hydro Way since 2004. The sustainability reporting is reviewed by Hydro's Corporate Management Board and approved by the Board of Directors. Hydro complies with the Norwegian legal requirements on country by country reporting.\n\nThe sustainability reporting is based on reporting frameworks from the UN Global Compact, the International Council on Mining and Metals' (ICMM) 10 principles and Position\n\nStatements, and the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative's (ASI) 11 principles and underlying criteria.\n\nHydro reports in accordance with the GRI Standards. Hydro's GRI Content Index 2022 can be found at Hydro.com/gri, and shows Hydro's adherence to UN Global Compact, ICMM, ASI, UN Sustainable Development Goals and UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.\n\nOur sustainability reporting is subject to independent assurance by our external auditors. For more information about our reporting principles and reporting scope, please refer to About the reporting in the appendices containing the notes to our Sustainability section.\n\n## Materiality assessment\n\nIn 2022, Hydro updated our materiality assessment according to the guidance provided in the GRI 3 (2021) Universal Standard. The process to update the materiality assessment was facilitated by the sustainability reporting team, using workshops to involve expert functions in Hydro that have insight into our sustainability commitments and external stakeholders' expectations. See the stakeholder dialogue section of the report for more information.\n\nThe material topics present our best judgment of the most significant impacts that Hydro has on the economy, environment, and people through our activities and business relationships. The materiality assessment is approved by Hydro's Corporate Management Board.\n\nOur 2022 report is organized around nine material topics. Each of the nine topics has corresponding subchapters in the annual report, which sets out why the topic is material and presents our management of and performance related to the material topic and the corresponding subtopics.",

Legacy impact as a topic with a separate section in the report reflects that closure planning and managing our legacy assets comprises managing social and financial risks, as well as environmental risks.\n- \u009f Innovation and technology transition is introduced as a material topic. In our 2021 annual report, the topic was included in Innovation and Renewable energy transition.\n- \u009f Our people and work environment is introduced as a material topic. The topic covers what our 2021 annual report included under the topics: Diversity and inclusion, Emergency preparedness, Health, safety and security, and Organizational capabilities and culture.\n- \u009f Pandemics is removed from material topics. Our reporting on the subtopic Security and emergency preparedness under the material topic Our people and work environment reflects how Hydro works to prepare for and responds to pandemics and other acute events.\n- \u009f Living wage introduced as a subtopic to Human rights and Our people and work environment. This reflects our obligations, as per the Norwegian Transparency Act, to map and manage risks related to human rights and working conditions, which specifies that living wages is a key aspect of decent working conditions.\n- \u009f Some subtopics appear under several material topics:\n- \u00b7 Materials is a subtopic to both Climate change and Responsible supply chain. The subtopic relates to both the carbon footprint of our sourced raw materials and ability to achieve our net-zero ambitions, and to the due diligence Hydro performs on suppliers to manage risks related to our commitments to responsible business conduct.\n- \u00b7 Human rights is both elevated as a material topic with a corresponding subchapter that describes our overall governance and processes to safeguard human rights in our operations and value chain in line with the reporting requirements in the Norwegian Transparency Act, and also included as a subtopic to Supply chain.\n\n## Hydro's materiality analysis 2022\n\n## Ethics and compliance\n\n- \u00b7 Integrity and anti-corruption\n- \u00b7 Partnerships\n- \u00b7 Product quality and liabilities\n- \u00b7 Public affairs and lobbying\n- \u00b7 Transparency\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Responsible supply chain\n\n- \u00b7 Conflict minerals\n- \u00b7 Human and workers' rights\n- \u00b7 Just transition\n- \u00b7 Local workforce and wage\n- \u00b7 Raw materials\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Local community value creation\n\n- \u00b7 Community investments and social programs\n- \u00b7 Education and skills development\n- \u00b7 Just transition\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Human rights\n\n- \u00b7 Human and workers' rights\n- \u00b7 Indigenous peoples and traditional communities\n- \u00b7 Just transition\n- \u00b7 Living wage\n\n## Our people and work environment\n\n- \u00b7 Diversity, inclusion and belonging\n- \u00b7 Living wage\n- \u00b7 Workers' health and safety\n- \u00b7 Security and emergency preparedness\n- \u00b7 Talent and leadership development",

Our corporate governance provides a foundation for value creation and good control mechanisms in the form of corporate directives that describe mandatory requirements for all parts of our organization.\n\n## Our approach\n\nOur governing documents and global directives help ensure that all our employees carry out their activities in an ethical manner and in accordance with current legislation and Hydro standards. Our Code of Conduct addresses compliance with laws and other matters such as handling of conflicts of interest, and a commitment to equal opportunities for all employees. Our defined programs contribute to compliance with anti-corruption and basic human rights, and other relevant governance areas.\n\nHydro follows the most recent Norwegian code of practice for corporate governance dated October 14, 2021. Information regarding our shareholder policy can be found in the Hydro Share section. Hydro's strategic direction is described in the section on Strategic direction.\n\n## Global directives and Code of Conduct\n\nThe Hydro Way represents our framework for leadership, organization and culture and is the foundation of our governance system. See Sustainability reporting - The Hydro Way for further information.\n\nOur governance structure is based on applicable laws and regulations, and Hydro's corporate directives, with delegation of responsibility to our business areas and to corporate functions whose duties include finance, tax and accounting, social responsibility, environment and governance, including legal and compliance. In order to maintain uniformly high standards, Hydro sets common requirements in the form of constituting documents and global directives. Constituting documents are approved by Hydro's Board of Directors, or the general meeting of shareholders, while global directives are approved by the President and CEO. This information is made available to all employees.\n\nHydro's Code of Conduct is a constituting document and applies to all Hydro employees throughout the world, as well as to board members of Hydro and its subsidiaries. See Ethics and compliance for more information about Hydro's Code of Conduct.\n\nMore comprehensive information about our governance practices, policies, Code of Conduct, and requirements can be found at Hydro.com/governance.

The members of the Nomination Committee, including its chairperson, are elected by the general meeting of shareholders for periods of up to two years at a time. The Nomination Committee makes its recommendation to the general meeting of shareholders regarding the election of shareholder elected members on the board of directors and regarding remuneration to the board members. The nomination committee further makes its recommendation to the general meeting of shareholders regarding the election of the members and chairperson of the Nomination Committee and regarding remuneration to the members of the Nomination Committee. The guidelines for the Nomination Committee are adopted by the general meeting of shareholders. The guidelines include Hydro's requirements for independence, shareholder interests, competence, capacity and diversity.\n\nDevelopments and events during the reporting year (14 meetings. 95.7 percent meeting attendance.)

Seven are elected by the general meeting of shareholders, four are elected by and among the company's employees in Norway, for a period of up to two years. The employee representatives on the Board each have a personal deputy. In accordance with Norwegian law, the Board assumes the overall governance of the company, ensures that appropriate\n\nmanagement and control systems are in place and supervises the day to day management as carried out by the President and CEO.\n\nAll shareholder elected members are external. No members elected by employees are part of the company's executive management. Employee directors have no other service contractual agreements with the company outside of their employee contracts, though they are subject to their duties as board members.\n\nThe Board normally conducts an annual self-assessment of its work, competence, and cooperation with management and an assessment of the chairperson. Further, the Board Audit Committee performs an annual self-assessment.\n\nAll shareholder elected members were in 2022, deemed to be independent according to the Norwegian standards. None of the company's non-employee board members had any other service contractual agreements with the company. Thomas Schulz was, as of December 31, 2022, the CEO of the listed company Bilfinger SE. Sales and purchases between Bilfinger SE and fully owned Hydro subsidiaries was in total NOK 380.363.323 in 2022. Schulz was not directly involved in these transactions. Schulz stepped down as Board member of the Company as of May 10, 2022.\n\nDevelopments and events during the reporting year (20 meetings. 96.7 percent meeting attendance) The Board of Directors has an annual plan for its work. It includes recurring topics such as strategy review, business planning, risk and compliance oversight, financial reporting, people strategy, succession planning as well as health and safety and sustainability including social responsibility, climate and environment. The Board is closely following the market and macroeconomic developments relevant for the aluminium industry. High on the Board's agenda in 2022 was health and safety, including social responsibility and the environment, the Covid-19 situation, and the continued work and implementation of the Hydro 2025 strategy 'Lifting profitability, driving sustainability.' The board conducted deep dives throughout the year, including deep dives on Hydro's human rights management, cyber security, hydrogen and operational deep dives on the business areas B&A and Aluminium Metal. A two day strategy meeting to follow up on the work and implementation of the Hydro 2025 strategy was held in June. Extraordinary meetings have been held when needed.\n\n## Governance bodies\n\n## General meeting of shareholders\n\nCompany shareholders exercise ultimate authority through the general meeting. Shareholders registered in VPS, the Norwegian Central Securities Depository, five working days in advance of the general meeting of shareholders can vote in person or by proxy. Invitations are sent to shareholders or to the shareholder's security deposit bank. Following the discontinuation of the Corporate Assembly on the company's annual general meeting May 10, 2022, the articles of association of the company was amended to reflect this amendment to the company's governance model.\n\nThe general meeting of shareholders elects the shareholders representatives of the Board and determines the remuneration of the Board. Further it elects the external auditor and approves the auditor's remuneration. It also approves the statutory report according to Norwegian requirements and financial statements, including the dividend proposed by the Board. Moreover, it elects the nomination committee and determines their remuneration, and, finally, deals with any other matters listed in the notice convening the meeting. Shareholders may, at least four weeks before an ordinary general meeting, request in writing that proposals for resolutions are submitted to the general meeting, or that items are added to the agenda.\n\nDevelopments and events during the reporting year The Annual General meeting was held May 10, 2022.

Information that Hydro must provide in accordance with the Norwegian Accounting Act, Section 3-3b is also included. This overview should be seen in context with the general corporate governance report provided in Hydro's annual report for 2022.\n\nThe Board of Directors of Norsk Hydro ASA (the 'Board') actively supports sound management principles of corporate governance. The Code of Practice covers 15 topics, and this board report covers each of these topics and describes Hydro's adherence to the Code of Practice. More detailed information can be found on the company's website.\n\n## Deviations from the Code of Practice\n\nAdherence to the Code of Practice is based on a comply or explain principle, meaning that any deviation from the Code of Practice shall be justified and explained. This includes to explain what alternative solution the company has selected. To the Boards best assessment, the company has in total four deviations from the Code of Practice. This includes two deviations from Section 6, one from section 8 and one from Section 14. Each deviation is explained below and under the relevant section of this board report.\n\n## Section 6, General Meeting of Shareholders:\n\nHydro has two deviations from this section:\n\n- (1) 'Ensure that the members of the Board of Directors ... are present at the General Meeting:'\n\nThe entire Board has normally not participated in the general meeting. Matters under consideration at the general meeting of shareholders have not previously required this. Chair of the Board is always on hand to present the annual report and answer any questions from shareholders. As of the Annual General Meeting in 2023, all board members will be encouraged to attend the Annual General Meetings of the company, either physically or electronically.\n\n- (2) 'Making arrangements to ensure an independent chair for the general meeting'\n\nHydro's Articles of Association section 9 previously stated that the general meeting was to be chaired by the chair of the corporate assembly, or in his or her absence, by the deputy chair.\n\nFollowing the resolution by the Annual General Meeting to discontinue the company's corporate assembly May 10, 2022, and appurtenant amendments to the Articles of Association, the general meetings of the company will be chaired by an independent chair, in accordance with applicable regulation.\n\n## Section 8 - Board of directors: composition and independence\n\nHydro has one deviation from this section: The general meeting should elect the chairman of the board of directors. However, it is stated in the Public Limited Liability Companies Act (No: 'Allmennaksjeloven') section 6-1(2) that the board of directors shall always elect its chair if it has been agreed that the company shall not have a corporate assembly. The Board of Hydro elects its chair for periods of until two years at a time.\n\n## Section 14, Takeovers:\n\n'The Board of Directors should establish guiding principles for\n\nHydro has one deviation from this section: how it will act in the event of a takeover bid:'\n\nThe Board has chosen not to prepare explicitly formulated general principles for handling takeover bids. The reason for this is that the Norwegian state, represented by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries, owns 34.26 percent of the Hydro shares (as of 31.12.2022) and the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries has by virtue of the Active Ownership Report (Report to the Storting no. 6 (2022-2023)) expressed a long-term ownership perspective in the company for the purpose of retaining a leading technology and industrial company with head office functions in Norway, c.f. the Active Ownership Report (Report to the Storting no. 6 (2022-2023)) p. 44.\n\n## 1. Implementation and reporting on corporate governance\n\nHydro follows the most recent edition of the Norwegian code of practice for corporate governance dated October 14, 2021. Hydro seeks to comply with international best practice standards when preparing its constituting documents and global directives, and the Board monitors the subject of corporate governance actively and continuously. The Board believes that there is a clear link between high-quality governance and the creation of long-term shareholder value.\n\nThe Board has the overriding responsibility for the stewardship of the company and shall conduct supervision of the company's day to day management and the company's activities in general. The Board believes that sound corporate governance is vital to ensure the greatest possible sustainable value creation over time in the best interests of Hydro's employees, shareholders and other key stakeholders, and is committed to maintaining a high standard of corporate governance across the group.\n\nThe Board approved this statement in a Board meeting held on February 13, 2023, through the signing of the Annual Report.\n\n## 2. Hydro's business\n\nHydro is a global aluminium and energy company with production, sales and trading activities throughout the value chain, from bauxite, alumina and energy generation to the production of primary aluminum and extruded products as well as recycling. Based in Norway, the company has approximately 32,000 employees involved in activities in 40 countries on all continents. Rooted in more than a century of experience in renewable energy production, technology development and partnerships, Hydro is committed to strengthening the viability of the customers and communities the company serve and managing the impacts of the company's activities on people, society and the environment, in line with corporate policies for health, safety, security, sustainability and climate, including human rights and ethics.\n\nThe company's objective, as stated in Section 2 of its Articles of Association, is to engage in industry, commerce and",

The board conducted deep dives throughout the year, including deep dives on Hydro's human rights management, cyber security, hydrogen and operational deep dives on the business areas B&A and Aluminium Metal. A two day strategy meeting to follow up on the work and implementation of the Hydro 2025 strategy was held in June. Extraordinary meetings have been held when needed.\n\nThe Board conducts an annual self-assessment of its work, competence and cooperation with management, including an assessment of the chair. Further, the Board Audit Committee performs an annual self-assessment. The main conclusions of the Board self-assessment is normally submitted to the nomination committee, which in turn assesses the Board's composition and competence. The self-assessment is faciliated by the corporate advisory firm Egon Zehnder.\n\nNorsk Hydro ASA has purchased and maintains a Directors and Officers Liability Insurance on behalf of the members of the Board and the CEO. The insurance also covers any employee acting in a managerial capacity and includes controlled subsidiaries. The insurance policy is issued by a reputable insurer with an appropriate rating.\n\nReferences: Hydro's articles of association are available at Hydro. com/governance. Learn more about The Hydro Way and Hydro's corporate directives at Hydro.com/principles.\n\n## 3. Equity and dividend\n\nIn the opinion of the Board, Hydro's equity capital is appropriate to the company's objectives, strategy and risk profile.\n\nHydro's dividend policy was revised in 2021, reflecting Hydro's ambitions to lift performance and cash returns to shareholders over the cycle. The revised dividend policy is to pay out a minimum of 50 percent of adjusted net income over the cycle with a NOK 1.25 per share dividend floor. In the Board's opinion the dividend policy is clear and predictable.\n\nThe dividend per share is proposed by the Board, based on Hydro's dividend policy, and approved by the general meeting of shareholders.

Our approach to reporting is based on transparency and consideration of the requirement for equal treatment of all players in the securities market. This also pertains to contact with shareholders outside of the general meetings of shareholders.\n\nShareholder information is available on Hydro.com. The financial statements and Annual Report are sent free of charge to shareholders on request. Notice of general meeting of shareholders is sent directly to shareholders with known addresses unless they have consented to receive these documents electronically. All information sent to the shareholders is made available on Hydro.com when distributed. Presentation of the quarterly reports as well as the annual general meeting are simultaneously broadcasted through webcasts. All relevant information is sent to the Oslo Stock Exchange electronically for public storage.\n\nHydro has emergency plans in place at the relevant levels in the organization. These plans are exercised regularly. Rules for who can speak on behalf of the company are regulated through Hydro's Code of Conduct.",

By reducing our footprint, improving relations with neighbors and other stakeholders, managing impacts, increasing resource efficiency and developing new markets, Hydro will reduce risk and create new opportunities. Hydro has quantified a set of ambitions towards 2030 and 2050 that will improve our performance on climate, environment, and social responsibility.\n\nThis chapter is part of Hydro's reporting in accordance with the GRI standards and presents Hydro's management of and performance on material environmental and social issues. Our materiality assessment and summary of the topics are presented in the section on Sustainability reporting the Hydro way, in the Governance chapter. This chapter should be read together with the appendix to the annual report that contains Hydro's Principles for sustainability reporting and the notes to our sustainability performance. Hydro's GRI index is available at Hydro.com/gri. See also the notes to our sustainability performance for more information.\n\n## Hydro and the UN Sustainable Development Goals\n\nThe UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) embrace a universal approach and define the global agenda for sustainable development. The goals explicitly call on businesses to use creativity and innovation to address development challenges, and recognize the need for governments to encourage sustainability reporting. Hydro uses the SDGs to understand the context of our impact on sustainable development. Please refer to the Appendices for an overview of Hydro's impact on the 17 development goals.\n\nMateriality analysis\n\nOur 2022 material topics reported on in this chapter can be found in our Materiality analysis.",

Hydro is committed to applying ethical business practices and compliance throughout our organization and supply chain. Hydro's board sanctioned Code of Conduct creates the foundation that supports our efforts to do the right things and to always act with integrity throughout our global organization wherever we operate and conduct business on behalf of Hydro.\n\n## Our approach\n\nIn Hydro, compliance is defined as adherence to applicable laws and regulations as well as Hydro's governance documents. Specific policies and procedures as well as guidelines have been established to assist line management to adhere to Hydro's compliance requirements. Special emphasis is made on reducing the risk of non-compliance within financial reporting, anti-corruption, competition, data privacy, economic sanctions, human rights, security, health, safety and environment.\n\nOur compliance system is based on a clear governance structure defining roles and responsibilities regarding compliance and all compliance-related activities undertaken throughout the company. For legal entities where Hydro holds less than 100 percent of the voting rights, we are working through their boards of directors to promote the principles in Hydro's Code of Conduct and our governance documents. In 2022, Hydro continued to strengthen the compliance program through various updates and improvements.\n\nThe management of compliance risks are integrated in our business planning, enterprise risk management and followup process, including relevant risk-mitigating actions and relevant key performance indicators. The progress of actions as well as any non-compliance matters are addressed in the quarterly internal board meetings that each business area has with the CEO, and an annual compliance report is submitted to the board of directors. The head of group compliance reports to the board of directors through the board audit committee at his own discretion. In addition, he participates in all board audit committee meetings and provides quarterly compliance updates to the audit committee. He also meets with the board of directors periodically.

Procedures are in place to assess the integrity risk of business partners. Regular transactionbased screening of customers and suppliers is also carried out, see note S10.5 Screening of business partners and supplier audits to the social statements.\n\nAn integrity culture index was introduced in Hydro's employee engagement survey in 2020, benchmarking the employee perception of our integrity culture. The overall score of the index was within the first quartile of the defined external benchmark, which was one of the KPIs of the CEO scorecard. The results provided us with a good basis for specific and tailored compliance activities which were undertaken in 2021 and 2022. In 2022 the integrity culture index was measured again and the scores shows a positive trend since 2020.\n\nHydro's global data protection constitutes the company's binding corporate rules for data protection (BCR) and ensures compliance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Designated data privacy coordinators for all business areas and staff functions form part of the data privacy network chaired by the head of data privacy. We are continuously working on the robustness of the data privacy network, which is seen as a key point for a well-functioning data privacy program. With a program established in 2018,\n\nHydro has also worked on several data privacy program improvements in procedures and supporting processes to ensure continuous fit to the business.\n\nWe are committed to building a culture of trust where employees are comfortable to ask questions, seek guidance, raise concerns, and report suspected violations to our Code of Conduct, applicable laws or regulations or Hydro's obligations. Normally, internal concerns and complaints should be raised with local management, but employees may also raise the issue directly with Human Resources, HSE (health, safety and environment), a union representative, Compliance, Legal or Internal Audit. Employees, on-site contractors, and others may also use Hydro's confidential reporting channel, the AlertLine, where concerns can be reported anonymously to Internal Audit. The AlertLine is available in applicable languages and reports can be made online or via toll-free phone numbers listed at Hydro's intranet or on Hydro.com. For further information about the use of our global grievance mechanism and the AlertLine, please see the Human Rights chapter and note S10.1 Reported and confirmed cases of non-compliance .\n\nThe Head of Internal Audit reports to Hydro's Board of Directors through the Board Audit Committee. The Committee and Corporate Management are informed on matters reported through the AlertLine on a quarterly basis. Hydro's Internal Audit has resources in Norway, Brazil and North America. The head of internal audit participates in all board audit committee meetings and provides quarterly updates to the audit committee.\n\nHydro is committed to delivering high quality products and managing product related liabilities. Product quality comprises quality specifications in the use phase of our products as well as criteria for carbon footprint and environmental impact of our products. To meet customer expectations for product quality and responsible value chain, we are working to certify our production sites according to the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI). This year we increased the share to 66%, see note S13 Certificates , and note S10 Compliance for more information. Please refer to the Climate change and Environment chapters of the annual report for more information about our work.\n\nFor more information about Hydro's performance on compliance, see note S10 Compliance to the social statements in this report.\n\n## Transparency\n\nTransparency is key to creating a global level playing field as well as to safeguard the company's reputation. Hydro reports in accordance with the GRI Standards and supports the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Since 2005, we have reported payments to host governments related to exploration and extraction activities for bauxite. We also comply with the Norwegian legal requirements on country-by-country reporting. In accordance with the Norwegian Transparency Act (valid from 2022), UK Modern Slavery Act and Australia Modern Slavery Act, we publish a transparency statement and an account of due diligence assessments, see the Human Rights section. In addition, we follow the Euronext guidelines to issuers for Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) reporting.\n\n## Partnerships\n\nHydro works through industry and aluminium associations to improve the ESG standards within our industry and to establish a level playing field for global aluminium production.\n\nHydro is a member of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), which gives us the opportunity to participate in the development of industry practices on the environment and to share best practices. We are also a founding member of the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI).\n\nThe ongoing loss of biodiversity and degradation of ecosystems represent long-term risks for the industry and\n\n## Alleged and confirmed cases of discrimination and harassment\n\nNumber of cases\n\n<!-- image -->",

To increase our knowledge and secure a science-based approach to rehabilitation, the Biodiversity Research Consortium Brazil-Norway (BRC) was established in 2013. BRC consists of the University of Oslo and its Brazilian partners Museu Paraense Em\u00edlio Goeldi, Federal University of Par\u00e1 and Federal Rural University of the Amazon, in addition to Hydro. The scope of the consortium is to create an environmental research program connected to our mining operations. The aim is to strengthen Hydro's ability to preserve natural biodiversity and to better rehabilitate the areas where we mine bauxite. Twenty-six research projects are progressing, and more projects are in the pipeline.\n\nJoining forces in collective action is critical in the fight against corruption. Hydro has had a partnership with Transparency International for many years. Hydro is also a member of the Maritime Anti-Corruption Network (MACN), which provides valuable insight into the maritime industry - an important part of our supply chain. Through Alunorte, Albras, Minera\u00e7\u00e3o Paragominas and Norsk Hydro Brasil, Hydro has been a signatory of the Business Pact for Integrity and Against Corruption since 2018. The Pact is developed by the Ethos Institute in partnership with global organizations such as the United Nations and the World Economic Forum, seeking to unite companies with the objective of promoting a more ethical market and to eradicate bribery and corruption in Brazil. Hydro companies in Brazil had improvements in their integrity results reported in the Integrity Ethos Indicators.\n\nHydro has had a long-standing partnership with Amnesty International Norway since 2002. The partnership is based on human rights education and dialogue meetings on relevant human rights dilemmas. Hydro is also an active member of the Nordic Business Network for Human Rights coordinated by the Danish Institute for Human Rights. To contribute to the development and strengthening of the human rights management and procedures, Hydro participates in other relevant forums, such as ICMM, ASI and UN Forum on Business and Human Rights.\n\nHydro is a Signature Partner of UNICEF Norway to contribute to quality education for children and adolescents. For information about our community investments and social programs, see the Community investments and social programs section.\n\nIn addition, we cooperate with global and local industry organizations, NGOs and other organizations. See\n\nHydro.com for an overview of important partnerships. For information about how we collaborate with other institutions within research and development, please see the section on Innovation.\n\n## Public affairs and lobbying\n\nHydro recognizes the value of engaging with public authorities and other stakeholders in relation to the development of various policy initiatives that impact our industry. We interact primarily with decision makers in countries where we have significant operations, such as Norway, Brazil and the US, as well as with regional structures like the European Union institutions. These interactions are mainly related to securing competitive, stable and predictable industry framework conditions, taxes and legislation that affect our activities.\n\nWe promote our views on issues of importance either through direct interaction with public authorities and other stakeholders, or through various industry associations. See GRI Standards 2-29 at Hydro.com/gri.\n\nIn addition, we participate in think tanks, especially in Brussels, and engage regularly in discussions with various NGOs.\n\nMost resources are dedicated to advocacy activities within the EU, Brazil, the US and Norway, through business associations, and to direct dialogue with authorities and decision makers. When relevant, we are in dialogue with applicable tax authorities in Norway, the EU and Brazil. We may also discuss fundamental tax developments and issues with other enterprises.\n\nWe support the principles of free and fair trade, and efforts to create a global level playing field. In our advocacy, we also support the climate targets set in the Paris Agreement.\n\nHydro supports market-based solutions for pricing of carbon emissions, like the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). A decisive part of the EU regulation is the ability to compensate for the extra cost occurring within the EU, in order to maintain competitiveness for global industries like aluminium. Pricing of emissions from imported products through a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is scheduled to replace existing carbon leakage measures with a phase-in starting in 2026. For the aluminium industry it's important that CBAM is reviewed and tested before implemented, and that indirect cost compensation remains as an important carbon leakage instrument.",

It is a roadmap on policies to achieve carbon neutrality in the EU by 2050 and includes policies to develop markets for low-carbon and circular products, in combination with stricter targets for emission reduction. We see interesting opportunities in both this roadmap, and in the Commission's initiatives on Circular Economy and Critical Raw Materials, as long as it is combined with competitive framework conditions.\n\nThe EU agenda on energy markets has been particularly full in 2022. Hydro's main view is that interventions in these markets should be temporary and targeted at alleviating costs for vulnerable consumers. In the long term, markets should be allowed to function to provide the right pricing signals for investments in renewable energy production.\n\nIn 2023 the EU and the US will be conducting negotiations on a Global Arrangement on Sustainable Steel and Aluminium (GASSA). Hydro will follow this process closely with a view to securing proper definitions of what should be considered sustainable.\n\nFor information on spending on public affairs and lobbying, see note S12 Public affairs and lobbying to the Environment and social statements in this report.\n\nAccording to our Code of Conduct, Hydro may not make financial contributions to political parties.\n\n## Stakeholder dialogue\n\nEngaging with our stakeholders helps us understand what is expected of us, what is important to them, how we impact them and how we can solve common challenges. As a global company, Hydro participates in a wide range of activities, from local community meetings to national and international multi-stakeholder and industry association discussions. We are committed to interacting with all our stakeholders in an ethical and transparent manner. We strive to demonstrate integrity in everything we do.\n\nOur dialogue and engagement covers a large number of stakeholders and individuals, such as unions, works councils, academia, customers, suppliers, business partners,\n\nauthorities, industry associations, non-governmental organizations and local communities, including vulnerable groups. This is shown in the figure on Stakeholder dialogue.\n\nWe consult with interested and affected parties in the identification, assessment and management of all significant social, health, safety, environmental and economic impacts associated with our activities. For more information regarding stakeholder dialogue and human rights, see our section on Rightsholder and stakeholder engagement in the Human rights chapter.\n\nDialogue with affected groups gives input to plans, detailing our environmental and social responsibilities. We strive to act in an open and credible manner, and gather views from interested parties, aiming for a common understanding of the decisions that are made.\n\nWhen planning new projects, we map the environmental and social impact when relevant. Before major developments or large expansions are undertaken, it is a requirement to conduct an impact assessment, in line with internationally accepted standards. In both cases, we follow standards such as the International Finance Corporation Performance Standards, Equator principles and UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. This includes the principle of free, prior and informed consent when indigenous and traditional peoples are involved. The assessments follow the requirements regarding information, consultation and investigation of the project's environmental and social impact, including human rights, and include an action plan with proposed initiatives.\n\nAll business areas have a forum for dialogue between management and union or employee representatives. Hydro's Global Framework Agreement is extended and still valid.",

In parallel, climate related risks can impact the integrity of our assets.\n\n## Our approach\n\nHydro has set a net-zero ambition by 2050 or earlier and believes low-carbon aluminium products can play an important role in reducing global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Hydro's ambition is to reduce the climate impact from our value chain and become a net-zero company in 2050 or earlier, deliver net-zero products and use our industrial and energy competence to enable the transition to a net-zero society. Our net-zero ambitions are based on a successful transition to a 1.5 degree economy, in line with climate science and the Paris agreement.\n\nHydro's climate strategy is an integral part of our overall business strategy, aiming at driving improvements and\n\ndevelopment within the company. Impact on the climate strategy is also a criterion for all significant investment decisions. The strategy includes reducing the climate impact of our operations as well as taking advantage of business oppor tunities by enabling our customers and society to do the same.\n\nAlumina refining and electrolysis of primary aluminium are energy-intensive processes and constitute the majority of Hydro's GHG emissions. The energy source is the main driver for total as well as specific emissions, i.e. emissions per tonne of product produced. On the other hand, aluminium can save significant amounts of energy and GHG emissions in the use phase due to its lightweight properties. In addition, Hydro aims to enable other sectors to decarbonize and transition to a low-carbon economy by utilizing our industrial and energy competence to develop batteries, green hydrogen and more renewable energy.\n\n## Net-Zero Hydro\n\nThe majority of Hydro's direct GHG emissions are associated with alumina production, mainly fossil fuel combustion for the heat-intensive calcination process and steam generation,\n\n## Ambitions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReduction in scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2030\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReduction in scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2025\n\n## Performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n0.62\n\nTonne scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions per tonne alumina refinined\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTonne scope 1 GHG emissions per tonne aluminium from the electrolysis process\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Net zero\n\nScope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2050 or earlier\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n11.03\n\nMillion tonnes scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by ownership equity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nReduction in upstream scope 3 GHG emissions per tonne aluminium by 2030\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMillion tonnes upstream scope 3 GHG emissions by ownershp equity",

We have initiated a significant R&D program to assess options for zero-carbon processes throughout the  aluminium value chain.\n\nWe are exploring three pathways to deliver zero-carbon aluminium products:\n\n- \u009f Carbon capture and storage and direct air capture to decarbonize our existing primary aluminium facilities\n- \u009f Our own proprietary HalZero technology for carbon-free processes for primary aluminium production\n- \u009f Utilizing more post-consumer aluminium scrap. We have successfully produced the first commercially available nearzero carbon aluminium in 2022 at the Clervaux recycling plant, using 100% post-consumer scrap.\n\nRead more about Hydro's technology roadmap in the Innovation and technology transition chapter.\n\nIn addition, Hydro's new energy ventures, Hydro Rein, Hydro Havrand and Hydro Energy's Batteries unit can play an important role in enabling a net-zero society.\n\nHydro recognizes the need to limit global warming to 1.5\n\nand the electrolysis process for primary aluminium, which is harder to abate.\n\nHydro's ambition is to reach net-zero GHG emissions in 2050 or earlier, and we have established a roadmap to reduce our absolute direct and indirect GHG emissions by 10 percent by 2025 and 30 percent by 2030, based on a 2018 baseline. 1 The climate strategy is integrated in the Corporate Management Board's remuneration and followed up as a KPI on the CEO's balanced scorecard.\n\nChanges in our production portfolio might influence these targets, but our aim is still to reduce our specific emissions, i.e. emissions per metric tonnes of aluminium produced. The baseline emissions equal 11.3 million tonnes CO 2 equivalents (CO2e), including direct emissions and indirect emissions from electricity generation (scope 1 and 2 emissions).\n\nInnovation and technology development are key enablers for reaching net-zero GHG emissions from Hydro's operations in\n\n- 1 2017 for Paragominas, Alunorte and Albras due to the production embargo at Alunorte and curtailment at Albras and Paragominas in 2018\n\ndegrees above pre-industrial levels, as set out in the Paris agreement from 2015. To understand the impact of climate change and the implications of the Paris Agreement for the aluminium industry, Hydro has taken part in the International Aluminium Institute's work to develop greenhouse gas pathways toward 2050 consistent with the Paris Agreement. These are in-line with the International Energy Agency's 1.5 degree scenario, combined with IAI's analysis of demand in the aluminuim market and material flows. These pathways are integrated in Hydro's strategy, hence Hydro's climate strategy is aligned with climate science. Hydro is considering to verify our climate strategy against the Science Based Target Initiative when they have developed a sectoral decarbonization approach (SDA) for the aluminium sector.\n\nThe overall carbon footprint of primary aluminium is highly dependent on the source of energy used to produce the metal. Consequently, in recent years, the electricity grid mix has been a key factor in deciding the location of Hydro's investments. More than 70 percent of the electricity used in Hydro's production of primary aluminium is based on renewable power. This is based on the physical grid mix in the countries where we operate.\n\n## Technology roadmap towards net-zero emissions in 2050\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nn\n\nSmelter process emissions\n\nn\n\nElectricity generation\n\nn\n\nAlunorte fossil fuel combustion\n\nn\n\nOther fossil fuel combustion\n\n## Hydro's climate strategy baseline\n\nThe indirect (scope 2) emissions in the baseline for the RCF and Hydro's climate strategy is based on supplier-specific emission factors from power purchasing agreements, as we believe this incentivizes our plants to implement greener energy sourcing.

It can be recycled infinitely without degradation in quality, and recycling requires 95 percent less energy than primary aluminium production.\n\nHydro is a large remelter and recycler of aluminium. We remelt process scrap from our own production and from other companies, as well as post-consumer scrap from the market. The carbon footprint of recycled pre-consumer scrap or process scrap is dependent on its metal origin. Thus, process scrap from aluminium produced by coal power comes with a much higher footprint than process scrap from hydropowerbased aluminium. Post-consumer scrap, however, comes with no historical carbon footprint, as this metal is entering its next lifecycle.\n\n## Sustainable financing in Hydro\n\nHydro's sustainability position enables profitable growth and a cost of capital advantage. To access favorable financing, Hydro published a green and sustainabilitylinked financing framework in 2022. This Framework was established to support the issuance of Green Financing Instruments, as well as Sustainability-Linked Financial products. The financial products use, respectively, the EU Taxonomy and Hydro's climate strategy as basis for the financial products, with KPIs linked to GHG emissions and recycling of post-consumer scrap. CICERO Shades of Green has provided a Second Party Opinion on the Framework and rated it Excellent on Governance and 'medium green' overall.\n\nHydro established a Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) programme on 7 November 2022, approved by Euronext Dublin and the Central Bank of Ireland. The EMTN programme provides a framework for issuance of euro medium term notes up to an aggregate amount of EUR 5 billion. Hydro's first NOK 3 billion sustainability-linked bonds under the new framework and EMNT programme were issued on 30 November 2022, with a potential redemption premium (a financial penalty) applicable if targets for reduced GHG emissions and increased recycling of post-consumer scrap are not met. This makes\n\nRecycling post-consumer scrap comes with challenges. The metal has to be collected and properly sorted, before being recycled back to high quality products. The main challenge with post-consumer scrap is to make sure that the quality of the metal is preserved in the recycling process, and to identify the alloys and properties of the used metal we purchase. Hydro produces extrusion ingot with a high share of postconsumer scrap (e.g. our Circal products) We work together with customers to develop new markets and specifications for products with a high recycled content, whilst developing even more advanced sorting technology.\n\nHydro has an ambition to recycle 620-770 thousand tons of post-consumer scrap by 2027. To reach our ambitions, we are improving our processes to combine process scrap with postconsumer scrap recycling. The technology is being rolled out to Hydro's remelting and recycling plants. These investments\n\nHydro the first investment grade Norwegian company to issue sustainability-linked bonds. The transaction is split between two tranches, a 6 year NOK 1,500 million with a floating rate of 3m Nibor + 2.000% p.a., and a 6 year NOK 1,500 million with a fixed rate of 5.257% p.a.\n\nHydro Alunorte signed a USD 200m sustainability-linked loan in 2022. The seven-year loan facility is structured as a sustainability linked loan, swapped to fixed rate. The sustainability link was incorporated in the facility and interest rate swap, linking pricing to performance on the GHG emission reduction target to be achieved through the Alunorte fuel switch project.\n\nIn 2019, Hydro signed a USD 1.6 billion revolving multicurrency credit facility with the margin linked to Hydro's GHG emissions target. The margin under the facility will be adjusted based on Hydro's progress to meet its annual targets to reduce GHG emissions by 10 percent by the end of 2025.\n\nIn 2022, Hydro's GHG emissions were 6.5% lower than the 2018 climate strategy baseline. Hydro is on track to reach the target of 10 percent emissions reductions by 2025.\n\nEnergy efficiency is an important part of Hydro's ongoing efforts to reduce costs and air emissions. Our alumina refinery Alunorte in Brazil is among the most energyefficient refineries in the world. Switching part of our fuel oil consumption used for calcination at Alunorte to natural gas with lower GHG emissions is an important enabler to reach our emission reduction targets. The project is on track to reduce emissions by 700,000 tonnes of CO 2 by 2025. In addition, we have installed one electrical boiler for steam generation, replacing fossil fuel combustion, and plan to install two more with a total potential to reduce emissions by an additional 400,000 tonnes of CO 2 by 2025. By 2030, the aim is to fully decarbonize all processes at Alunorte, except the calcination process. This will be done mainly by electrification of remaining boilers and will lead to total emission reduction of 70 percent at Alunorte by 2030. For more information on Hydro's emission data see note E1 to our Sustainability statements.\n\nIn order to ensure continued supply of renewable power to Hydro's operations in Norway, we operate 39 hydropower plants with a combined installed capacity of 2.7 GW. Adjusted for ownership shares, our captive hydropower production is 9.4 TWh in a normal year. In addition, we operate a wind farm and purchase more than 9 TWh of renewable power annually in the Nordic market under long-term contracts.\n\nAverage electricity consumption at our consolidated production sites was 13.9 kWh per kilogram primary aluminium produced in 2022. The global average was 14.1 kWh in 2021. 1 We are now in the process of transferring Hydro's next generation of smelter technology, the Karm\u00f8y Technology Pilot, to our other primary aluminium metal plants, see the Innovation chapter for more information.\n\nIn Hydro Extrusions, our sites are working on different initiatives to lower their GHG emissions associated with energy and electricity consumption. As an alternative to purchasing the standard electricity mix from the grid, some plants have entered into power purchasing agreements (PPAs) with renewable power producers. Many plants are also working with partners and governments to evaluate the possibilities of installing their own on-site renewable power generation. The sites are also working to improve energy efficiency through benchmarking, process improvements and when investing in new equipment.",

Our Hydro CIRCAL product line offering aluminium with 75 percent post-consumer scrap has among the lowest carbon footprints in the aluminium industry.\n\nTo enable the sorting process of aluminium scrap by the different alloys to preserve the quality of the aluminium, we have developed a laser sorting technology, Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS). We have installed an industrial pilot line at Hydro's scrap sorting facility, St. Peter in Germany. We have improved the pilot sorter with regards to throughput and quality. Also, we have developed and commissioned the HySortTM LIBS sorter that is flexible on the input of post-consumer scrap with a much higher throughput and more consistent quality of the sorted product. The ambition of the technology is to sort postconsumer scrap back into its original alloys for remelting in Hydro's casthouses. The machine has been handed over to production mid-year 2022 and is currently used to sort shredded post-consumer scrap in the St. Peter plant back into alloys.\n\nOne of the challenges when recycling post-consumer scrap is metal loss when the pieces are too small or thin, leading to dross. To address this issue, we have developed a 'screw extruder' to handle thin-gauge scrap such as chips, swarf or shredded material. The screw will compact the scrap and the larger metal pieces will reduce dross generation in the recycler.\n\n## Net-Zero Products\n\nAluminium has significant carbon footprint benefits in its use phase, especially due to its lightweight properties. We work closely with customers to develop products that save energy and reduce emissions, and enable them to reach their sustainability targets.\n\nExamples include lighter transportation. Replacing 1 kg of steel with aluminium in a car using fossil fuel or electricity from fossil sources reduces GHG emissions by about 20 kg of CO2e due to aluminium's lightweight properties. Aluminium in packaging reduces cooling needs and food spoilage, and building facades in aluminium lead to lower operating costs\n\nand enable buildings to generate as much energy as they use during operation.\n\nDemand for low-carbon aluminium products is increasing and it is expected to continue growing. With 70 percent of Hydro's primary aluminium production using renewable electricity, and the low-carbon aluminium brands Hydro REDUXA and Hydro CIRCAL, we differentiate our product portfolio from our peers, while supporting both margin and volume growth. Hydro earns additional premiums or volume commitments on its low-carbon products, and many customers choose Hydro's aluminium due to its low carbon footprint.\n\nReaching our 2030 climate ambition will result in an even lower carbon footprint from our products. The production capacity for near-zero carbon aluminium will be developed in line with market demand. This is reflected in the ambition to deliver Hydro REDUXA 2.0 with a carbon footprint of less than 2 tonnes of CO 2 per mt of aluminium by 2030.\n\n## Post-consumer scrap\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAluminium production\n\nPre-consumer scrap\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNew consumer productsPost-consumer scrap\n\n<!-- image -->",

As Hydro regards the carbon footprint of process scrap as equal to its metal origin, Hydro's upstream scope 3 emissions are significant when including externally sourced metal. Hydro is also producing more alumina than what is being processed internally. A lot of alumina is thus being processed outside of Hydro's smelters, resulting in high downstream emissions from processing of sold products. Hydro's total scope 3 emissions in 2022 was 27.9 million tonnes of CO 2 , split between upstream emissions of 14.4 millions tonnes CO 2 and downstream emissions of 13.5 millon tonnes CO 2 . Upstream emisions are dominated by metal purchase and downstream emissions are dominated by external processing of alumina.\n\nIn 2022, Hydro set emissions reduction targets for upstream scope 3 emissions. The targets are to reduce total upstream scope 3 emissions by 15 percent by 2030, and to reduce upstream scope 3 emissions per ton aluminium delivered\n\nGHG emission intensity -\n\nTonnes CO2e per mt alumina\n\n## GHG emission intensity - alumina refining alumina re/fining\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nto the market by 30 percent by 2030. Both targets refer to a 2018 baseline. 1 Downstream scope 3 emissions were not included in the targets as these emissions are outside of Hydro's influence and control.\n\nThe 2022 results shows that Hydro has reduced its total upstream scope 3 emissions by 29 percent in 2022, compared to the baseline. Per tonne aluminium delivered to market, Hydro has already reduced its emissions by 26 percent. The reductions are mainly due to more conscious sourcing of aluminium metal, but also due to less sourcing of metal in general. Going forward, upstream scope 3 emissions may increase, both in total and per tonne, due to higher activity and thus more external metal input.\n\n## Net-zero Society\n\nHydro's competence and capabilities also makes us an enabler for net-zero society. To move to a net-zero society the world needs more renewable electricity generation, and mechanisms to store that energy. In addition, not all processes can be directly electrified, and need other alternatives to fossil fuel. To address these challenges and help both Hydro and the broader society and economy at large, Hydro has during the last years set up a battery unit, established Hydro Rein as a company that is responsible\n\nGHG emission intensity -\n\nelectrolysis\n\n## GHG emission intensity - electrolysis\n\nTonnes CO2e per mt aluminium\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, we produced 100 tonnes of CIRCAL100 from 100% post-consumer scrap with a carbon footprint below 0.5 tonne CO 2 per tonne aluminium. This is a significant improvement, compared with the current 2.3 kg CO 2 /kg aluminium in Hydro CIRCAL extrusion ingot based on 75 percent post-consumer aluminium scrap, and the world average of 16.6 kg CO 2 / kg aluminium. Hydro will make key capacity investments over the medium term to ensure our recycling portfolio can facilitate the increasing demand for Hydro CIRCAL.\n\nRead more about our pathways to delivering near-zero aluminium in the Innovation chapter.\n\n## Greener sourcing and scope 3 emissions\n\nHydro is a large purchaser of raw materials and energy. Hydro aims to source less carbon-intensive energy and aluminium metal with a lower carbon footprint. We also aim to increase the use of post-consumer scrap in our metal production.\n\nScope 3 emissions refer to indirect emissions from purchased raw materials and services. It is divided between upstream scope 3 emissions and downstream scope 3 emissions. Whilst upstream scope 3 emissions are under the influence of the company, downstream scope 3 emissions are generally outside of a company's influence.

Hydro's experts collaborate with Polestar on defining joint R&D programs and explore specific aluminium alloys needed for the vehicle.\n\nAddressing climate related risks and opportunities Our operations and facilities are subject to risks arising from physical climate change that may impact our operations. Effects of climate change could include changes in rainfall patterns, flooding, shortages of water or other natural resources, changing sea levels, changing storm patterns and intensities, and changing temperature levels. The changes may be acute and/or chronic. These changes can lead to operational and environmental incidents within our operations, for example by flooding of containment basins, interruption of production processes or causing failures or maintenance needs to our infrastructure. Changing temperatures can also lead to increased emissions from our industrial processes.\n\nIn order to understand and mitigate the risks for our operations and potential consequences related to climate change, we have performed comprehensive climate risk assessments, evaluating both physical and transition risks. In 2018, Hydro modelled future weather patterns and their impact on our facilities based on climate models and scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). In 2023, our ambition is to update the physical climate risk assessment and integrate the findings and management of such risk into our system of risk management.\n\nClimate change adaptation and the transition to a 1.5 degree economy poses both opportunities and risks to Hydro. We have assessed scenarios for policy and legal risks, technology, market and reputation risks consistent with a 1.5 degree scenario. The outcome of this is integrated into Hydro's climate strategy, our advocacy work on future climate-related legislation, and our technology and market strategies. As a result, Hydro's long term positioning, operational and financial planning reflect our assessment of transition risks in a 1.5 degree scenario.\n\nHydro's ambitions are based on a successful transition to a 1.5 degree economy. The transition may lead to stricter regulations and more ambitious climate targets that may drive costs within parts of our asset base. The overall portfolio will likely benefit from such trends, as it will affect demand for and valuation of Hydro's low-carbon products and portfolio. Hydro is a signatory to TCFD.\n\n## IAI emission projection pathways toward 2050 2050 target\n\nTonnes CO2e/t primary aluminium\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -Historic emissions of the aluminium industry\n- Below 2 degrees scenario\n- 1.5 degrees scenario\n- Range of CO2 emission intensities in the aluminium industry\n\nSource: International Aluminium Institute (IAI), Hydro analysis\n\nfor new renewable growth projects, as well as the green hydrogen company, Hydro Havrand.\n\nHydro Rein is a leading provider of renewable energy solutions to industrials, fully owned by Hydro. Hydro Rein has a diversified portfolio of 16 projects under development in core markets in the Nordics and Brazil. The company has an ambition of 3GW in construction or operation (gross) by 2026. In addition to certified renewable power, Hydro Rein supports customers with onsite generation, energy efficiency, energy storage and flexibility management.\n\nThe Batteries business unit aims to develop leading sustainable battery businesses in Europe by active investments in the battery value chain. Batteries targets growth within sustainable battery materials by leveraging Hydro's capabilities. Core growth pillars are Circular Solutions and Anode Materials. Currently Batteries have invested in the synthetic graphite producer Vianode, the EV battery recycler Hydrovolt, as well as in Corvus and Northvolt.\n\nHydro Havrand, our green hydrogen company, will use Hydro's green hydrogen offtake, potentially as much as 4 GW and more than 80 locations, as a springboard to global opportunities. Increased renewable energy production, energy efficiency and electrification can address the majority of global emissions. Green hydrogen produced with renewable power can contribute towards the remaining emissions from 'hard to abate' sectors such as heavy industries and the maritime sector.\n\nStrategic partnerships and the circular economy Aluminium's inherent properties of durability, light-weight and recyclability makes the metal well positioned for the circular economy. Hydro's industrial experience can also be a benefit to other sectors trying to decarbonize their products and value chains, and make them more circular. The Circular Economy concept and associated business models represent opportunities for Hydro. To capitalize on these, we have to enter into strategic partnerships and move away from traditional supplier/customer relationships to design sustainable products.\n\nOne example is the Swedish electric car maker Polestar which has an ambition to create a climate-neutral car by 2030. Hydro joins Polestar as a materials partner to explore how aluminium can contribute to realizing the project. The Polestar 0 project will require zero-carbon footprint",

If not correctly managed, land-use change, resource utilization, emissions of pollutants, and disposal of hazardous waste all have the potential to cause long-term, irreversible impacts to nature and human health. To minimize such detrimental effects, Hydro must ensure management practices are used to identify and address the environmental risks associated with its operations.\n\n## Our approach\n\nThe goal of Hydro's environment strategy is to minimize our impact across our operations by addressing industry's key environmental challenges. We aim to do so by driving rehabilitation at our bauxite mine, developing and implementing viable management solutions for tailings and bauxite residue streams, while reducing waste to landfill from our downstream operations and significantly reducing our non-GHG emissions to air. We have set longer-term\n\nambitions to eliminate the need for permanent bauxite residue storage from 2050 and eliminating landfilling of all other recoverable waste by 2040. Targets for land rehabilitation and reduced waste to landfill will be included in the CEO's KPI scorecard for 2023. We also have the ambition to achieve no net loss of priority biodiversity in all new projects.\n\nAll of Hydro's operations shall follow our own internal policies and procedures, related to environmental management, supported by comprehensive health, safety and environment (HSE) management systems, audit programs, training and awareness initiatives.

This mean that new projects, including major changes to the environmental footprint of existing assets, that pose a threat to priority biodiversity (i.e. natural habitat and critical habitat) must design a Biodiversity Action Plan that can credibly achieve a No Net Loss outcome for those biodiversity features impacted by the project. These actions must follow the Biodiversity Mitigation Hierarchy, where actions are taken to first avoid and minimise the impact of the project, and then seek to rehabilitate impacts that do occur. Finally, the project will consider implementing biodiversity offsets to compensate for any residual impacts to the priority biodiversity features that remain after taking avoidance, minimisation and rehabilitation measures. This ambition applies to any project that is fully owned by Hydro.\n\n## Paragominas land use and rehabilitation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- n Legal reserves (ARL and PPA)\n- n Area under ongoing rehabilitation\n- n Current mining operations\n- n Tailings storage facilities\n- n Long-term infrastructure\n\n## Biodiversity\n\nBiodiversity, and the ecosystem services that it supports, is vital for human existence and the sustainable growth of industry and society. Biodiversity is under immediate threat from the direct and indirect effects of human activity, with an unprecedented number of species at risk of extinction. Industry can be the cause of, and is affected by, the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Hydro, as an industrial company with presence in the extractive and energy sectors, has a responsibility to manage the impact of its activities on biodiversity and ecosystem services.\n\nIn 2022, Hydro published a Global Procedure for the management of risks and impacts related to biodiversity and ecosystem services. This procedure applies to all wholly owned and operated activities within Hydro and defines a risk management approach anchored in the Biodiversity Mitigation\n\nHierarchy. We have also set an ambition to achieve no net loss of priority biodiversity in all new projects. Risk mapping of biodiversity and related Biodiversity Action Plans are consistently in place where applicable, and confirmed through ASI certification.\n\n## Mining\n\nHydro's only operated mine, Minera\u00e7\u00e3o Paragominas S.A. (MPSA, referred to as Paragominas) is located within the municipality of Paragominas, in the state of Par\u00e1, northern Brazil. To access the bauxite deposits, which are located 8 to 12 metres underground, the overlying vegetation, topsoil and overburden must first be removed (see note E6.1). The municipality of Paragominas is located in an area defined as the deforestation belt around the central Amazon region. Within the municipality, there has been a reduction in forest area of more than 30 percent over a period of almost\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\n\"\n\n\u00b0\n\n\"\n\n\u00b0\n\n\"\n\n\u00b0\n\n\"\n\n\u00b0\n\n3\n\n47\u00b0 48'0\" W\n\n47\u00b0 45'0\" W\n\n47\u00b0 42'0\" W",

The Paragominas property, itself, is characterised by areas of primary rainforest and land previously used for agriculture\n\nDue to the nature of strip mining, it is possible to progressively rehabilitate areas impacted by the bauxite mining activity. Hydro has a specific rehabilitation target for Paragominas which promotes this progressive rehabilitation approach. The target requires that mined areas undergo rehabilitation within two hydrological seasons after release from the mining operations. This is what we refer to as our 1:1 rehabilitation target. This rolling target was again met in 2022, when we rehabilitated 100 percent of the mined areas released in 2020. See note E6.2 for quantitative information on land use and rehabilitation. As required by Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), Hydro discloses its mining concessions and exploration permits at hydro.com.\n\nWe use three different methods for the rehabilitation of mined areas, based on different needs:\n\n- \u009f Traditional rehabilitation (planting of local species)\n- \u009f Natural regeneration of vegetation (utilising the seed bank within the topsoil)\n- \u009f Nucleation (uneven distribution of topsoil and addition of branches to promote water retention and create more complex habitat)\n\nTo increase our knowledge and secure a science-based approach to rehabilitation, the Biodiversity Research Consortium Brazil-Norway (BRC) was established in 2013. For more information, see our section on partnerships.\n\n## Hydropower operations\n\nAll of Hydro's hydropower reservoirs are located within or\n\nin close proximity to national parks and other protected areas in mountainous regions in southern Norway, including Hardangervidda and Jotunheimen. In addition to potential impacts on biodiversity, including changes in aquatic and terrestrial habitats along the waterways, our hydropower activities may also have impacts on recreation and tourism.\n\nTo mitigate the effects of hydropower-related impacts on fish populations, we release fish spawn in almost 40 lakes and rivers according to concession requirements. In relation to renewal of concessions, rehabilitation projects are carried out in rivers and lakes to improve fish habitats and aesthetic qualities. We also monitor the impact of our operations on aquatic life in rivers connected to catchment areas. During 2022 we initiated biodiversity risk screening of our current hydropower operations. This work has been started for the Fortun power station, and the risk screening will be carried out for the other power station locations over the next couple of years. The study will identify potential risks to biodiversity due to operation, which will further lead to Biodiversity Action Plans. We intend to address high risks and seeks mitigating activities where necessary.\n\n## Water\n\nHydro's primary interactions with water relate to freshwater withdrawals (including significant rainfall) and discharges in our bauxite mining and alumina refining operations in northern Brazil, seawater and surface water withdrawals in our Norwegian primary aluminium smelters and the water catchment influence of our hydropower operations in Norway. Of all the water withdrawals across Hydro's operations, very little is consumed. The primary consumption type is evaporative losses in processes related to alumina refining and aluminium recycling and extrusion. The majority Hydro's withdrawn water is discharged to seawater and rivers. Freshwater discharged to surface water bodies, e.g. rivers and lakes, is considered of high quality according to the ICMM definition.\n\nWater-related risks are very specific to the type of operation and its geographic location. We have a Global Procedure for Water Stewardship that requires operations to evaluate water related risks and opportunities at a catchment scale and to develop management plans and context relevant targets to address material risks identified. For the majority of Hydro's operations, priority is given to managing the quality of discharges to the external environment and ensuring that we operate within the relevant permit limits and regulatory",

This was partly reversed in 2019 and 2020 due to the lifting of the embargo and ramp-up of production. Production in 2021 returned to normal levels\n\nframeworks. Due to seasonal heavy rainfall in Northern Brazil, managing flood risk is important for both the mining operation and the alumina refinery. Other initiatives include reducing dependency on surface water withdrawals at our mining operation in Brazil, by increasing rainwater capture and storage and reuse of process water, and water-use efficiency programmes in our Extrusion business to reduce overall water withdrawal intensity.\n\nHydro uses the WRI Aqueduct water tool to perform an annual review of freshwater withdrawal from water-stressed areas, defined as locations with high or extremely high baseline water stress. The mapping of Hydro's sites in 2022 showed that less than 1 percent of our overall freshwater input came from water-stress areas.\n\nHydro has ongoing concession process for the hydropower system in Fortun. As part of the concession process, we are assessing the environmental impacts on the regulated water resources, taking into consideration inputs from local stakeholders, relevant authorities and municipalities. A similar process has been initiated in R\u00f8ldal-Suldal by the authorities, where Hydro is minority owner and operator, but LyseKraft DA, as majority owner, is in lead of the process. We are also carrying out environmental impact assessments and studies of mitigating actions for our hydropower operations in \u00c5rdal, based on a decision of the Norwegian Environment Agency (Milj\u00f8direktoratet) for the period 2019-2024.\n\nOur Norwegian hydropower operations are also covered by and categorized in the regional Water Management Plans (WMP). The water regulation in Norway is based on the EU Water Framework Directive, which aims for 'good ecological status or potential' for all water resources within 2027. New WMPs (2022-2027) were approved by the Norwegian Government in October 2022. The WMPs will be an important basis for authorities' follow-up of the concessionaires in the future. The WMPs are based on proposals and input from different stakeholders.\n\nSee note E4.2 for quantitative information on water withdrawal.\n\n## Waste and efficient resource use\n\nOur goal is to first minimize the amount of waste produced in our operations, and then reuse or recycle it. When this is not possible, we shall deposit it in a secure way to minimize\n\nadverse effects to people and the environment.\n\n## Tailings and bauxite residue\n\nTailings from bauxite extraction consist of mineral rejects from the extraction process mixed with water and flocculants. The tailings at Paragominas are stored in dedicated tailings storage facilities (TSFs), where the particles settle and excess water is captured in separate clarification ponds for reuse or discharge to the external environment. These clarification ponds also prevent overflow to the river during heavy precipitation.\n\nThe bauxite tailings facilities and bauxite residue deposits are regularly inspected by Hydro and the Brazilian authorities. In addition, independent third-party audits are performed twice a year, to comply with Brazilian regulations and maintain the stability certifications for each TSF. For more details on Tailings and bauxite residue, see note E5.1 and our full tailings disclosure forms available at our website.\n\nHydro's Tailings Dry Backfill technology at the Paragominas mine allows tailings to dry in shallow areas before being excavated and returned to the mined strip from where they originated. The mined strip is then reshaped and rehabilitated with the ambition of returning it to original conditions. By continuously backfilling the dry tailings, the methodology eliminates the need for new permanent TSFs, including the need to raise existing facilities further. The operating license for this technology was received in December 2020, and it has now been fully adopted into operations at the mine.\n\nBauxite residue is a waste product of the alumina refining process. Its disposal is challenging due to large volumes and its alkaline nature. The residue is washed with water to lower the alkalinity and to recover caustic soda for reuse. Hydro uses an enhanced dry stacking technology for disposing of bauxite residue which allows for storage at steeper slopes, thus reducing the relative environmental footprint. The residue moisture content has been reduced to 22 percent.\n\nIn order to address the long-term legacy of bauxite residue generation and storage, Hydro has set a 2050 ambition to eliminate the need for new bauxite residue storage areas and a target to utilize 10 percent of bauxite residue generation from 2030. For more information, please refer to the section on Tailings management in the Closure planning and legacy impact chapter.

Furthermore, opening new production lines and closing down production lines will give fluctuations in the aluminium production, production, and due to the cyclical nature of SPL, a 4.7-year time lag in the SPL volumes. Hence SPL is normalilzed with aluminium production with a 5-year rolling average as the best estimate of a trend line. Increased production of SPL in recent years relates to higher relining frequency and restart of line B at the Husnes aluminium plant.\n\nbauxite residue as a resource, described in the section on collaboration with other parties in the Innovation chapter.\n\n## Other waste and by-products\n\nHydro has set a target to eliminate landfilling of all recoverable waste by 2040, and to landfill less than 35 percent of generated spent pot lining (SPL) by 2030. SPL, or cathode waste, is generated from the electrolysis cells used in primary aluminium production. Qatalum has a temporary solution for handling SPL in cooperation with local cement plants and they are working to find a permanent solution. The Albras aluminium plant in Brazil have had a significant stock of SPL. This is being continually reduced according to an annual plan and target, and is delivered to the cement industry in Brazil. Hydro has also initiated a research project in collaboration with Alcoa with the aim to recycle first-cut SPL.\n\nA large portion of the anode waste from our smelting activities in Norway is being used by Norcem cement plant in Brevik, Norway. The carbon material from Hydro is being used as an alternative fuel in the production process, which ensures safe treatment of any hazardous components. Hydro also has an agreement with a refractory supplier to recycle part of the bricks coming from relining the anode baking furnace.\n\nDross is a mixture of metallic aluminium, alloy components and metal oxides that is formed on the surface of liquid aluminium. Hydro's casthouses have treatment facilities to recover as much aluminium as possible from hot dross and residual dross can also be sent to third parties for further treatment. 100 percent of dross produced in Hydro is recycled, either through onsite or offsite recovery treatment processes.\n\nHydro is also involved in a Norwegian research project, that is evaluating the recovery of valuable surplus bath components from aluminium electrolysis.\n\nSee note E5 Waste for quantitative information on waste treatment.\n\n## Non-GHG Emissions to air\n\nEmissions to air are inherent in the aluminium production process and are generated at all stages of the value chain. Key air emissions from our operations include sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, fluorides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,\n\nand particulates, see note E2.1 Other emissions for details. Where needed, emissions to the external environment are reduced through treatment of the flue gases prior to their release into the environment.\n\nIn addition to reducing our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, Hydro's ambition is to halve non-GHG emissions from fossil fuels (i.e. sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulates) by 2030.\n\nFollowing a mass balance of mercury at Alunorte in Brazil, Hydro has initiated a project to install four mercury condensers on the digestor lines. The first condenser was installed in 2018, as a pilot, and its technical performance is being monitored prior to the installation of the remaining units. The initial timeline to install the remaining units has been rescheduled to allow for further performance optimization of the technology. Installation of the remaining three condensers is planned to start in 2023.",

Our 117 years of industrial activity has resulted in environmental and social legacies, which require management many years after the industrial activity that created them ceased.\n\nIn the early days of our company's history, rivers and fjords near our industrial sites became contaminated due to the release of waste products into the near waters. Some of these fjords remain impacted and require our attention today. Even though environmental practices have been significantly improved throughout the years, today's operations, while conducted in compliance with regulatory requirements and in line with best industry practices and available technologies, have the potential to create additional legacies that power social, environmental, and financial risks to Hydro and our external stakeholders.\n\n## Our approach\n\nThrough our closure and legacy management program, we aim to avoid and/or minimize the creation of additional legacies as well as to minimize impacts of legacies from the past. Our approach is to manage risks and opportunities throughout all phases of an asset's life cycle, including investment (design/construction or acquisition), operation, and closure.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to implement our legacy management project for operational sites to improve the way we work with proactive closure planning and legacy risk management.\n\n## Legacy sites management\n\nThe Kurri Kurri aluminium metal plant in Australia was formally closed in 2014 and during the subsequent years, buildings and infrastructure were demolished. The proposal to remediate the site was approved in 2020 after a rigorous assessment by the New South Wales' Department of Planning, Industry and Environment (DPIE). The project is primarily for construction of an onsite, engineered containment cell, to deposit the contents of an existing approved stockpile of mixed waste generated during the 1970s and 1980s, the first decades that the plants was in use. Several pockets of contaminated soil, along with other waste that cannot be reused or recycled, will also be placed\n\nin the cell. Although unfavourable weather conditions have delayed the containment cell construction by approximately 6 months, the expected completion is estimated to be early 2024. The reuse of historic spent potlining (SPL) as feedstock for cement production is also progressing according to the plan. Hydro has agreed to sell the site to a joint venture of local property and residential land developers Stevens Group and McCloy Group. Under the sale agreement with McCloy/ Stevens Groups, the land sales will be divided into precincts and progressively be realized over several years. The first group of these sales have been completed during 2022. Further information is disclosed at Regrowth Kurri Kurri's webpage\n\nThe Norwegian Environment Agency (NEA) has required Hydro to remediate historical contamination in the Gunneklev fjord through capping of the contaminated sediments with clean geologic materials. In January 11 2023, NEA accepted our application to extend the deadline from December 2023 to December 2024. The reason for the postponement is the need for alignment between the remediation project and with the E18 road and tunnel construction project in the local area. Surplus geological materials from the road project may be used in the remediation project.\n\nHydro continues to execute a structured remediation and reclamation plan in collaboration with authorities at the former fluorspar mines dated back to the 1920s in Germany. The goals are to physically secure underground mining structures for all generations to come and enable desired land uses including reforestation.\n\nAt the Ashtabula legacy site in the US, several activities were carried out throughout 2022, including demolition and closure of settlement ponds. Site-wide environmental investigation has been completed and the results assessed. The need for environmental remediation activities is being assessed and alternatives evaluated.\n\nThe Aluchemie anode producer, which is a joint venture company owned by Hydro (47 percent) and Rio Tinto (53 percent), located near Rotterdam in the Netherlands, closed its operation at the end of 2021. In 2022, the demolition of buildings and infrastructure was initiated and is on-going on schedule. Site remediation strategy is being defined and discussed with the relevant authorities. The property is owned by the Rotterdam Port Authority and Aluchemie is required to return the site to the same condition existing in 1962,\n\n<!-- image -->",

Remediation activities, according to the current schedule, will be completed in 2025.\n\nThe activities at the legacy tailings facilities in Schwandorf and Stulln, Germany are outlined in the Tailings Management section.\n\n## Tailings management\n\nOur definition of tailings facility , as applicable to Hydro's assets, is an asset that is designed and managed to contain the tailings produced by the mining process or the bauxite residue produced by the alumina refining process.\n\nTailings facilities refer to facilities that contain tailings or bauxite residue in open pit mines or on the surface. Tailings facilities are higher than 2.5 m measured from the elevation of the crest to the elevation of the toe of the structure or have a combined water and solids volume more than 30,000 m3. Hydro's methodology for tailings dry-back fill in Paragominas is not defined as tailings facilities.\n\nA tailings facility can have status as 'in active use', 'inactive' or 'closed'. Hydro has tailings facilities in the first and the latter category.\n\nOur objective for tailings management is zero failures that may lead to loss of life or life-changing injuries, material negative socioeconomic impact or material environmental damage throughout the tailings facility lifecycle, from design to post closure.\n\nWe manage four tailings facilities at Paragominas and Alunorte in the state of Par\u00e1 in Brazil and six smaller closed tailings facilities at legacy sites in Schwandorf and Stulln in Germany.\n\nWe commit to best practice tailings management to protect the health and safety of people, host communities and the environment. We plan, design, construct, operate, maintain, close, and relinquish our tailings facilities in accordance with regulatory compliance requirements, internal company standards, the International Council on Mining and Metal (ICMM) framework, and the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI) practices. Furthermore, Hydro is committed to implement the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM), requiring that tailings facilities operated by Hydro with Extreme or Very high potential\n\nconsequences will conform to the standard by August 5, 2023, while other tailings facilities operated by Hydro not in a state of safe closure, will conform to the standard by August 5, 2025 1 .\n\nIn 2022, we made significant progress on the implementation of GISTM in Hydro. This includes:\n\n- \u009f Established a governance structure and appointed roles in accordance with GISTM. This work will continue in 2023.\n- \u009f Established an Independent Tailings Review Board for Paragominas and Alunorte in accordance with the GISTM requirements.\n- \u009f Carried out reviews for all tailings facilities in Paragominas and Alunorte, by ITRB as part of the GISTM implementation.\n- \u009f Carried out reviews for all tailings facilities at the legacy sites in Germany by international tailings management experts.\n\nThe GISTM implementation and the assessment of the GISTM status is still ongoing. Our ambition is to be compliant within the applicable deadlines.\n\nFor all our tailings facilities, we disclose more detailed technical information at Hydro.com.The information is updated on a regular basis.\n\nHydro is a member of ICMM which is one of the three coconveners of GISTM alongside UN Environment Program (UNEP) and PRI, an investor initiative in partnership with UNEP Finance Initiative and UN Global Compact.\n\nHydro is also a 5 percent shareholder in Minera\u00e7\u00e3o Rio do Norte (MRN). MRN is the operator of the mine and is responsible for its tailings management. Hydro works with MRN and the other stakeholders through the board of directors and relevant technical committees to require the safe operation of MRN's tailings facilities in accordance with applicable laws and standards.\n\nThe section on waste and efficient resource use in the Environment chapter describes tailings and bauxite residue in more detail, including how we are pursuing reduction, reuse, and remediation technologies and methodologies to minimize impacts from tailings.",

Innovation allows us to improve our aluminium products and processes, develop cutting edge technology to use less energy, cut GHG emissions, and help our customers meet their commercial and sustainability goals. Our technology roadmap is our pathway to zero emissions and a more fair and circular economy. We aim to produce better and greener aluminium, and work closely with our customers early in the product cycle, to help them meet their goals for their market and the climate.\n\n## Our approach\n\nIn the mature aluminium industry, the development cycles are long, with a need for highly skilled technology competence. This includes smelter technology, new aluminium alloys with special properties, lighter transportation, better packaging to reduce cooling needs and food spoilage, and aluminium facades that lead to lower operating costs and enable\n\nbuildings to generate as much energy as they use during operation. At the same time, our downstream activities are continuously developing new solutions with customers. More and more, this collaboration reflects design thinking, bridging the gap from idea to solution.\n\nTo promote innovation, Hydro has a technology board consisting of members from Hydro's Corporate Management Board. The technology board meets twice per year to set direction and priorities in the technology area. Business areas are responsible for their own technology development and for the execution of their respective technology strategies. A corporate technology office ensures a holistic and longterm approach to Hydro's technology strategy and agenda. The Chief Technology Officer leads an internal R&D network with representatives from the business areas and supports Hydro's technology board in developing overall research and technology priorities and strategies.\n\n## Ambitions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThousand tonnes of recycled post-consumer scrap by 2027\n\n## Performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThousand tonnes of postconsumer scrap\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInnovation and technology transition\n\nMaterial topics covered\n\nin this chapter:\n\nNet zero products and operations\n\nRenewable energy transition\n\nResearch and development\n\nNet zero\n\nEmissions by 2050 or sooner\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n50\n\nThousand tonnes sold of Hydro CIRCAL\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUtilization of bauxite residue generation by 2030\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThousand tonnes of bauxite residue",

To deliver on our commitment and ambition, we need new technologies that enable us to deliver net-zero products and achieve netzero operations. Our efforts are concentrated along three main pathways to zero:\n\n## 1. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) - decarbonizing existing smelters\n\nThrough capturing off-gases at smelters, we aim to reduce electrolysis emissions for existing smelters. We have evaluated more than 50 CCS technologies and developed a roadmap for testing and piloting the most promising up to industrial scale. The most likely outcome will be a combination of off-gas capture and direct air capture to eliminate 100 percent of the emissions. Upstream emissions at the Alunorte alumina refinery in Brazil will be reduced via fuel switch and electrification, and we will pilot hydrogen for calcination of alumina.\n\n## 2. HalZero chloride process - decarbonizing new smelter capacity\n\nThrough utilizing our proprietary HalZero chloride process, we can convert alumina to aluminium chloride prior to electrolysis in a process where chlorine and carbon are kept in closed loops, resulting in a fully decarbonized process. We have been working on lab-scale for more than five years on this\n\n## Emissions reduction pathway by HalZero Chloride process\n\nTonnes CO2e per tonne aluminium\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntechnology and have developed a roadmap for translating this to industrial scale before 2030. This way we can fully decarbonize the smelting process by eliminating emissions for both electrolysis and anode baking. Hydro's HalZero technology will be relevant for new capacity post-2030.\n\n## 3. Zero aluminium through scaling up volumes of postconsumer scrap (PCS)\n\nWe plan to improve our recycling capacity to sort and utilize more difficult PCS aluminium. We already produce Hydro CIRCAL, a certified recycled and low-carbon product of more than 75 percent post-consumer scrap. We have demonstrated our ability to produce this also with 100 percent post-consumer scrap, but to do this in a profitable way at scale requires utilizing greater amounts of difficult, unsorted and contaminated scrap. In order to achieve this we will utilize advanced laser-based sorting (LIBS). In order to have a fully decarbonized scrap based product we also need to use direct electricity or hydrogen in our remelting furnaces at the recyclers. You can read more about our recycling in the Climate change chapter.\n\nTo contribute to decarbonizing society, we must also strengthen our ambitions regarding a just and fair transition towards carbon neutrality. Our chapter on Human rights describes our approach to a just transition.\n\nFrom an innovation perspective, Hydro benefits from our\n\n## Emissions reduction pathway by Post-Consumer Scrap\n\nTonnes CO2e per tonne aluminium\n\n## Research and development (R&D) efforts\n\nOur R&D efforts are centered around the following:\n\n- \u009f Reducing energy consumption, waste, emissions and carbon footprint in line with Hydro's sustainability agenda\n- \u009f Making products and solutions that promote the use of aluminium and sustainable development\n- \u009f Using R&D and technology to ensure optimal operations in existing assets, including cost and HSE\n- \u009f Improving environmental impact in Hydro Bauxite & Alumina, such as biodiversity, rehabilitation and utilization of bauxite residue\n- \u009f Developing recycling technology and low-carbon products based on post-consumer scrap, e.g. Hydro CIRCAL.\n- \u009f Increasing the share of value added products and tailored solutions in collaboration with the customer\n- \u009f Utilizing the opportunities of digitalization to improve process stability, productivity, cost and safety.\n- \u009f Building competence in batteries and hydrogen\n\nThe greater part of our R&D expenses goes to our in-house research and application development organization, while the remainder supports work carried out at external institutions. Our main R&D centers are in \u00c5rdal (smelter technology) and Sunndal (alloys and casting) in Norway, Barcarena in Brazil (bauxite and alumina), and Finsp\u00e5ng in Sweden and Troy, Michigan, in the US (both Extrusions).\n\n## Emissions reduction pathway by Carbon Capture and Storage\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n* (Hydro CIRCAL)  2.3 kg CO2/kg aluminium",

We are looking into projects to replace fossil carbon in our anodes with bio carbon, and while it appears challenging, we are part of two R&D programs supported by the Norwegian Research Council looking into this. In addition, we are on track with our HalZero technology development project where we explore a new process for production of primary aluminium with zero CO 2 emissions. A feasibility project has been supported by Gassnova and we have also submitted an application to ENOVA for the first pilot step of HalZero.\n\nTailings management and bauxite residue is a challenge in our industry. One example of our progress relates to the tailings dry backfill project which is described in the section on Tailings and bauxite residue in the Environment chapter. Bauxite residue is a challenge in our industry due to its alkalinity and large volumes. Alunorte uses an enhanced dry-stacking residue disposal technology, which includes an improved residue filtration step and the in-situ mechanical compaction of the disposed residue. Alunorte is now using press filtration technology before transporting the residue to the disposal area. This technology produces a filtered cake with lower moisture content, which allows for the cake's further mechanical compaction and storage on steeper slopes, thus reducing disposal area requirements and environmental footprint.\n\nR&D\n\n## Current technology\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbroad knowledge and oversight of the entire value chain from bauxite mining, alumina refining, electrolysis of primary aluminium and alloy technology to finished products and recycling.\n\nInnovation and development initiatives are carried out in close collaboration between our production units, R&D organization and customers. We emphasize three main areas: the quality of our products, the efficiency of our production system and the development of new alloys. Our casthouse production process is based on our advanced proprietary casting technology, developed by the fully owned equipment producer Hycast and our R&D organization.\n\nQuality improvements are closely linked to our customer technical service, which addresses customer needs while improving our own casthouse process. We develop new alloys with distinct properties to support the development of new or enhanced applications within industries such as automotive, building and construction, and electronics. This work begins with developing an understanding of metallurgical processes that forms the basis for sample compositions and production methodologies carried out in laboratory or test production facilities. Full-scale testing is often completed with customers and/or end-users.\n\n## HalZero\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur 75,000-tonne-per-year technology pilot at Karm\u00f8y in Norway shows stable and excellent performance and produces the world's most climate- and energyefficient primary aluminium. We are now in the process of implementing technology elements from the Karm\u00f8y Technology Pilot in our existing primary aluminium smelters, improving performance and financial robustness. This includes the Husnes line B in Norway, which started production in 2020, and as a part of the regular maintenance and relining of our electrolysis cells in all smelters, presently at Sunndal.\n\nIn the area of digital innovation we have developed digital twins; a digital simulation model of physical processes. In Hydro's digital twins we combine our physics based models with sensor data from production and advanced analytics algorithms. Digital twins have successfully been implemented in the control systems of our smelters, providing more stable production at a higher performance, and we pursue this approach across other Hydro business areas. Exploring and piloting data science and robotization is done in Hydro Energy and Extrusions as well.\n\nToward 2050, we are exploring different paths for zero carbon technology in aluminium production. We are partnering with several start ups and academic environments to\n\n## Research and development expenses\n\nNOK million\n\n<!-- image -->",

These include The Research Council of Norway, Enova, Innovation Norway and Prosessindustriens Milj\u00f8fond. The majority of the support from The Research Council of Norway is paid directly to projects administered or partnered by Hydro at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), SINTEF or Institute for Energy Technology (IFE). We are a partner in four centers for research-based innovation, supported by The Research Council of Norway: SFI Metal Production, SFI Center for Advanced Structural Analysis, SFI Manufacturing and SFI Physical Metallurgy. These are cross-disciplinary R&D programs with a frame of up to eight years. We are also a partner in similar centers for environment-friendly energy (FME). For more information, see note S8 Financial assistance from governments to the Environment and Social statements about public funding.\n\nWe also participate in other national and EU-funded R&D projects on post-consumer scrap recycling technology, following market demand for products with a low carbon footprint. Our R&D program includes joint projects with external research institutes such as SINTEF, NTNU, IFE and the University of Oslo in Norway and the University of Auckland in New Zealand.\n\nSince 2016, Hydro has been a partner in NAPIC, the NTNU Aluminium Product Innovation Center. Its purpose is to develop new aluminium applications. A consortium that comprises several downstream industries has been established and five different faculties at NTNU are participating. To support and speed up the activity, Hydro has been sponsoring an NTNU professor in this area.\n\nHydro participates in international collaboration projects investigating the possibilities of using bauxite residue as a resource. An important example is with NTNU, SINTEF, Norcem/Heidelberg and Veidekke to develop a new type of concrete using bauxite residue as a resource to improve\n\nquality. We are also working with other aluminium companies through the International Aluminium Institute to solve this industry challenge. In Brazil, Hydro cooperates with the national Brazilian entity SENAI (National Service of Industrial Apprenticeship) mineral research area, UFPA (Federal University of Par\u00e1) and USP (University of S\u00e3o Paulo) on R&D projects connected to bauxite residue management.\n\n## Product stewardship\n\nHydro engages in dialogue with customers and other stakeholders regarding the environmental impact of our processes and products. We perform life-cycle assessments (LCAs) for all major product groups to identify improvement potential. With other aluminium producers, we have developed a pan-European network of national initiatives to promote and recycle aluminium packaging. Many of these national activities emphasize education and have developed projects with primary and secondary schools and universities to stimulate the next generation to make their contribution to a better environment.\n\nHydro is an active member of the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative. As of publication of this report, 61 of our consolidated production sites have been certified, covering Hydro's value chain from bauxite to finished products.\n\n## Investments in new energy solutions\n\nAs part of Hydro's new strategic direction, Hydro is investing in growth initiatives and energy solutions that enable a net-zero society. This includes more renewable electricity generation and mechanisms to store that energy. Read more about Hydro's investments in batteries unit, renewable energy and green hydrogen in the section on Net-zero society in the Climate change chapter.\n\n## Aluminium in automotive\n\nThe growing use of aluminium in the automotive industry is being driven by emissions regulations, electrification and passenger safety requirements. Aluminium is well suited for automotive due to low weight, good strength and formability, corrosion resistance, recyclability and its energy absorption properties that can increase safety. Lightweighting is particularly important for electric vehicles with heavy battery packages.\n\nThis is creating new opportunities for Hydro as an established supplier to the automotive industry in Europe, North America and Asia. Product applications include extruded aluminium frames and sub-frames, body-in-white (BIW) components and battery casings.\n\nIn the Extrusion Europe and Extrusion North America business units, innovation, R&D and application development is predominantly targeted toward the growth in automotive and especially the e-mobility BIW structural markets. The commercial transportation market is another key area. For our Precision Tubing unit, innovation targets new aluminium applications, such as fuel and brake lines, with aluminium replacing copper and steel, resulting in lighter products with comparable performance. Moreover, Hydro develops aluminium-based material concepts for battery components and integrated solutions for thermal management and battery modules.\n\n## High level of expertise\n\nAn important part of Hydro's technology strategy is to utilize our researchers, operators and other experts in optimizing the operations at our plants. The competence base in Hydro's technology environments is on a high level in general and world-class in several core areas. As a result, we emphasize using this competence in operational improvements. Examples include reduced energy consumption in casting furnaces, new cathode solutions for relining of electrolysis cells, improved blending tools for utilization of recycled materials, reduced emissions, and improvement projects related to quality and productivity.\n\nUpstream, we prioritize our R&D and innovation efforts toward decarbonization technology development and operational efficiency, while downstream, we concentrate on applications and product development. Part of our work downstream is conducted together with customers, reflecting design thinking from idea to solution. From 2021, we have prioritized more",

The figure below summarizes how we manage human rights, and Hydro's prioritized human rights areas, through four steps.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 1. Policy commitment and governance\n\nHydro's Human Rights Policy was last updated in 2020 and outlines the company's commitment to respect, support and promote human rights. The commitment is integrated in key procedures, including supply chain management, new projects, portfolio management, and risk management. The policy is approved by the Corporate Management Board and is available at Hydro.com. The policy and salient risks were reviewed in 2022 and updates will be published in 2023. Information pertaining to Hydro's human rights policies and compliance is regularly discussed with the Board of Directors, the Corporate Management Board, business area management teams, and relevant parties such as union representatives.\n\nIn 2022, the Hydro's Human Rights Forum (HuRF) was established to align and regularly share knowledge on human rights topics across the company. HuRF is comprised of representatives from each business area and representatives from Compliance, Legal, Sustainability, Procurement, HR, and ESG-reporting.\n\nFor more information on policy and governance across our business and with our suppliers, see Hydro's human rights policy.\n\n## 2. Rightsholder and stakeholder engagement\n\nWhen relevant, we consult parties that might be significantly impacted by our activities.\n\nWe engage and collaborate with stakeholders internally and externally to understand and evaluate the effectiveness of our human rights management. This includes NGOs, unions, local associations, authorities, and other relevant stakeholders. For more information, see the section on our partnerships.\n\nWe are committed to the principles of non-discrimination and to respecting the rights of vulnerable individuals and groups. In terms of impact and remediation, we aim to engage in dialogue with, and pay particular attention to, vulnerable individuals and groups.\n\nEmployee representatives are involved in dialogue at an early stage in all major processes affecting employees. We have a tradition for open and successful collaboration between management and unions. For more information, see Collaborating with unions and employee representatives in the section on Our people and work environment.\n\nWhere relevant, and in line with our risk-based approach, we have regular dialogue with communities, and more frequent and structured dialogue in communities with higher risk of facing adverse human rights impacts. We develop and plan community dialogues in collaboration with affected communities, based on their needs and expectations. Community members close to our sites in Brazil and at several other major sites are invited to visit plants on a regular basis.

Due diligence: Identifying, assessing, acting,\n\nmonitoring and communicating risks and impacts Hydro's human rights due diligence is integrated in relevant business processes including the enterprise risk management process. Mitigating action plans are developed and included in business plans in the business areas where relevant. Business plans are monitored, followed up and evaluated through the year in regular internal board meetings. Human rights and other sustainability-related issues are discussed when relevant.\n\nIn line with our risk-based approach, we aim to conduct more thorough human rights impact assessments with mitigating action plans where there is a higher risk for adverse impacts.\n\nBefore new projects, major developments or large expansions are undertaken, we aim to conduct risk-based environmental and social impact assessments when relevant, which include evaluating risks for adverse human rights impacts. We are\n\n## 3. Grievance mechanisms and remediation\n\nGrievance, or complaint, mechanisms are important tools to inform us of our impact on individuals and groups. Grievances may be of any kind, including social and environmental issues. In situations where we identify adverse human rights impact that we have caused or contributed to, we work to cooperate in, promote access to and/or provide remediation. See Managing human rights risks for more information concerning remediation cases.\n\nTo help facilitate informed and effective participation with people who are potentially affected by our operations, we establish or facilitate access to grievance mechanisms. We encourage, and will not retaliate against, individuals who in good faith ask a question, raise a concern, report a suspected violation, or participate in an internal company investigation. Hydro is committed to not interfere, retaliate, or hinder access to external or internal, judicial, or non-judicial grievance mechanisms.\n\nWe have several grievance mechanisms depending on stakeholder groups. The whistle-blower channel AlertLine can be publicly accessed through Hydro.com to report concerns involving illegal, unethical, or unwanted behavior. See Ethics and compliance for more information. Grievance mechanisms for community members have different approaches\n\n## Risk-based approach\n\nIn line with UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and with OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct, we prioritize due diligence according to the following framework:\n\n| Factors for prioritization         | For own operations and joint  ventures this translates to                                        | For suppliers and contractors  translates to 1)                                                 |\n|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Size of business                   | Number of employees and/or  cornerstone employer                                                 | Expenditure                                                                                     |\n| Nature of operations               | Footprint on environment, including  water resources, emissions, etc.                            | Suppliers industry.

The Code of Conduct includes our opposition to all forms of modern slavery. In addition, more specific training on relevant human rights topics is provided to relevant functions and locations. E-learning on Hydro's Social responsibility, including human rights, is available to all employees. In 2022, over 500 employees participated in live trainings in human rights due diligence and more than 8.400 employees completed the e-learning on sustainability. For more information, see note S10.4 Compliance training, and, also, Local community value creation and Responsible supply chain regarding capacity building for external stakeholders.\n\n## Managing human rights risks\n\nWe monitor Hydro's prioritized human rights areas and recognize that there are potential risks of adverse impacts concerning our operations. According to our human rights risk-based approach looking at the size, nature, context,\n\n## Country human rights risk levels\n\nWe use country human rights risk levels in the countries where Hydro is present to help guide our human rights management. The risk levels are based on a range of independent human rights sources, such as Global Slavery Index, Heidelberg Conflict Barometer and Human Development Index. The following countries where Hydro has operations or joint ventures were in 2022 considered high risk: Brazil, China, Bahrain, India, Mexico, Qatar and Turkey. We use a more extensive list of country human rights risk levels for our suppliers and for other relevant procedures, including investment decisions.

See Responsible supply chain for more information about Hydro's supply chain.\n\nThe most significant adverse impacts that we are aware of through our due diligence processes, including grievance mechanisms, are described below. We have also described how we are working to mitigate or remediate these potential or actual adverse impacts. Hydro did not detect severe human rights impacts in our own operations in 2022.\n\n## Brazil\n\nIn 2022, Hydro continued the human rights due diligence process in our operations in the state of Par\u00e1, Brazil. The process covers the sites Alunorte, Albras and Paragominas, including the bauxite slurry pipeline from Paragominas to Alunorte.\n\nAfter a first analysis, a Human Rights Action Plan was set in motion with initiatives that included:\n\n- \u009f Conducting human rights training for management, other employees and suppliers, including our grievance mechanism partner\n- \u009f Developing policies on anti-discrimination and harassment, and on traditional communities\n- \u009f Detailed mapping of traditional communities along the 244-km-long bauxite pipeline as well as advancements on the Quilombola study\n- \u009f Implementation of social initiatives and strengthening social dialogue with traditional communities\n- \u009f Better incorporate the Voluntary Principles for Security and Human Rights in security providers' contracts\n- \u009f Strengthening effectiveness criteria for grievance mechanisms\n\nIn the beginning of 2022 Hydro engaged KPMG to conduct an independent assessment of the Human Rights Action Plan across its operation in Brazil. KPMG assessed the implementation of the priority targets, considering the level of completion and appropriateness, to ensure the targets were properly achieved. 92 percent of the initiatives in the Human Rights Action Plan have been executed as planned.\n\nHydro conducted a structured dialogue process engaging\n\n178 community leaders in Barcarena to understand their perspective on key issues associated with our operations and to provide information about our actions.\n\nIn an area surrounding Hydro's operations in Barcarena and which is regulated for industrial purposes, illegal logging and irregular settlements have accelerated since 2016. Hydro is constantly engaged with competent authorities to find a solution that respects the Human Rights guidelines.\n\nHydro is conducting a thorough consultation with Quilombolas communities, following ILO 169 guidelines, which will increase our understanding of local cultures, provide means to identify potential impacts and ensure their right to participate in the process. Hydro is engaged with competent authorities, i.e. Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Cultural Palmares, State of Par\u00e1 and INCRA 1 . We especially follow closely the communities impacted by the construction and operation of the 244kmlong pipeline that crosses areas inhabited by traditional Quilombola groups, including the Jambua\u00e7u Territory, in Para. As part of an integrated plan to remediate past impacts along the pipeline, in 2022 an agreement was signed with families directly impacted by the work, but not contemplated by the legal agreement with the former owner.\n\nHydro is also seeking to establish and contribute to a fund for social investments for the Jambua\u00e7u Territory. The program supports local associations along the pipeline to strengthen their legal, administrative and governance structure. We also have social programs and other income generation initiatives, including traditional farming.\n\nRegarding the lawsuit made in the Netherlands by Cainquiama and nine individuals linked to Alunorte and Albras, please see note S10.2 Legal claims to the Social performance statement.\n\nIn the municipality of Oriximin\u00e1 in Par\u00e1, where the MRN 2 bauxite mine is located, there are Traditional Quilombola communities that are requesting formal title to their land. Hydro is constantly engaged with MRN through the board of directors and committees to ensure the project complies with national and international standards.

In 2022, MRN was certified by the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative Performance Standard.\n\nHydro Rein made three important project investments in Brazil in 2022, Ventos dos Zacarias (formerly referred to as Feijao), a wind and solar project in the northeast of Brazil, Mendubim, a solar project in the northeast of Brazil, and Boa Sorte, a solar project in the southeast of Brazil.\n\nIn Ventos dos Zacarias, Rein has Green Investment Group as partner. A joint environmental and social team is responsible for following up identified environmental and social impacts throughout the project development and construction, including the impact on and potential resettlement of members of the two self-identified Quilombola communities in the vicinity of Ventos dos Zacarias.\n\nIn Mendubim, Rein has Scatec and Equinor as partners. Out of two households resettlements in the project, one family was moved in September and the other family was resettled in November. Scatec is responsible for executing the action plan that is in place for the second resettlement.\n\nIn Boa Sorte, Rein has Atlas Renewables as partner. They are responsible for the execution of environmental and social programs. Boa Sorte does not involve resettlements neither traditional communities.\n\nWe work with our business partners to ensure the implementation of IFC Performance Standards on relocation of people as well as other relevant standards that Hydro follows. These are described in our approach earlier in this chapter.\n\n## Qatar\n\nAt the primary aluminium producer Qatalum, a joint venture where Hydro holds 50 percent, close to 75 percent of the roughly 1250 workers are employed directly by Qatalum. The remaining 25 percent are temporary workers that, for the most part, have a Qatalum employed manager. Qatalum strives to secure good working conditions for all employees, and work continuously to assess, safeguard and improve the conditions of contracted workers. Qatalum became a member of the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI) in 2021 and was audited by DNV against both the Performance and Chain of Custody standards. In April 2022, Qatalum received\n\nits certificate for both standards, a recognition that it is aligned with globally accepted standards on ESG. We aim to continue to work with Qatalum in addressing relevant findings and observations in the audit. In 2022 we continued our discussions with local stakeholders and companies present in Qatar to address and discuss common challenges related to the recruitment of migrant workers, as well as sharing knowledge and good practice related to working conditions in Qatar.\n\n## Sweden\n\nThe wind farm project Stor-Skj\u00e4lsj\u00f6n is located near Sundsvall in the north of Sweden, of which Hydro Rein has 25 percent ownership of the project. A review of environmental and social risks has been conducted. No known noncompliances with regulatory requirements or Hydro's policies have been identified. An adjacent Sami community will be impacted by the wind farm, as the areas are in some periods used for reindeer herding. Legal agreements on cooperation between the Sami community and the wind farm during construction and operation have been signed and regular consultations held. Eolus, Rein's experienced Swedish partner, is responsible for the development and stakeholder management. The impacts of the wind farm will be minimized through mitigative actions proposed by the community.\n\n## Other countries\n\nWe also have more limited operations in other countries where there is an increased human rights risk, including China, Hungary, and Mexico. We track the human rights developments in these countries and seek ways to mitigate our impact when and where relevant.",

Clear expectations\n\nWith more than 25,000 suppliers, we have a significant indi -rect impact on society and the environment through our supply chain, and our suppliers are all important contributors to the success of our business. We engage, influence and work with our suppliers for continuous improvement and to mitigate potential negative impacts to people and the environment in our supply chain.\n\n## Our approach\n\nA responsible supply chain is part of our sustainability ambitions. We will ensure transparency and traceability of key sustainability data for our products by 2025 or earlier. In 2022 we initiated a group wide project to identify common KPIs, building a data model to support the transfer of data along the value chain and establishing a 2025 roadmap with identified milestones. Our approach to responsible sourcing is based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct, and can be summarized in three steps:\n\n## 1. Mapping of risks\n\nAll suppliers are subject to a qualification process, including mapping of risks related to business practice, human rights, working conditions and environment. If we identify any concerns related to such issues, we conduct a more comprehensive review or audit of the potential supplier to clarify if the supplier meets our requirements before any agreements are signed. The mandatory due diligence process for all suppliers is described in the company-wide procedure, Sustainability in the supply chain, and is based on three levels of inherent sustainability risk levels. See illustration on our supplier due diligence process.\n\n## Ambitions\n\n## Performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTransparency and traceability of key sustainability data for our products by 2025 or earlier\n\nHydro's Supplier Code of Conduct sets out the minimum sustainability requirements for all our suppliers. The code is based on internationally recognized standards such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, UN Global Compact and the ILO Core Conventions.\n\n## 3. Support and development\n\nWe build our relationship with our suppliers on mutual trust and development. We actively discuss and promote ethical business practice, safe working conditions, human rights and environmental issues.\n\nHydro's social ambition for 2050 is to improve lives and livelihoods in the communities where we operate. For more information, see the Human rights chapter.\n\n## Hydro's supply chain\n\nMost of Hydro's suppliers are located in the same countries as our production facilities.\n\nThe Hydro Supplier Code of Conduct was last updated in 2020 to be more specific on several requirements, especially on human rights, conflict minerals, working conditions, environmental and climate impact. The changes are based on international standards to which Hydro is committed, including the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) and Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI).\n\nThe principles set out in Hydro's Supplier Code of Conduct are made binding through contractual clauses to ensure suppliers and business partners reflect the values and principles that Hydro promotes. Standard contracts also include clauses on auditing rights and the supplier's\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1,500 due diligence processes carried out\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n40% of existing counterparties screened",

Failure to comply with the principles may result in a termination of the contract.\n\nThrough 2022, the business areas implemented our global procedure on sustainability in the supply chain to ensure a common approach across Hydro, with special emphasis on risk categorization of suppliers. The documents explaining our approach and requirements are available on Hydro.com/ principles.\n\nSuppliers, customers and other business partners registered in our main accounting systems are screened weekly against recognized international sanction lists. Furthermore, we have developed a spend cube to visualize external spend, measure procurement initiatives and manage supply chain risk.\n\nFurthermore, supplier audits and site visits are performed by Hydro personnel and external auditors based on risk analyses. See note S10.5 Screening of business partners and supplier audits for more information.\n\nThrough regular reviews, audits and other tools, we contribute to continuous development among our suppliers. We have a risk based approach to supplier audits. In 2022, we conducted 200 supplier audits, all of which included topics related to HSE, human rights and working conditions. We are an active member of the ASI and promote ASI's certification program to our aluminium suppliers for the sustainable development of their operations. We also cooperate with other external stakeholders, such as unions and industry associations, to develop and implement supplier development programs.\n\nWe engage and collaborate with stakeholders internally and externally when relevant, to help inform and evaluate the effectiveness of our approach to responsible sourcing. See our section on Partnerships for more information.\n\n## Just Transition in our Supply Chain\n\nWith more than 25,000 suppliers, Hydro is exposed to several human rights risks in its supply chain which could hinder the achievement of a Just Transition. Through our supply chain management, we can contribute towards one of the",

Hydro has a complex and diverse supply chain. By utilizing the intelligence and performance improvement tools provided by EcoVadis, we believe we will be in a good position to streamline sustainability risk management, and to help us promote and monitor positive development of our supply chain.\n\nthree outcomes that characterize a Just Transition: to ensure 'people have human rights protected and have access to equal opportunities'.\n\nTo track progress on this in our supply chain, our target is to ensure responsible and inclusive business practices by undertaking human rights due diligence in all relevant projects and in the supply chain. In 2022, we undertook 1,500 supplier due diligences and did not uncover any adverse human rights breaches in our supply chain. We met the target of undertaking human rights due diligence in all relevant projects and in the supply chain.\n\n## Managing risks\n\nThe prioritized human rights areas monitored in the supply chain are related to safe and decent working conditions, health, discrimination, freedom of association and collective bargaining. The risk of incidents of child labor abuse, compulsory or forced labor is also monitored. There have been very few findings of these severe risks in our supply chain in recent years. We do, however, recognize a risk of forced or compulsory labor among suppliers in the Middle East, South America and Asia. This is addressed in our supplier screenings, supplier audits and regular dialogue with the suppliers.\n\n## China\n\nIn early 2021, several countries introduced sanctions on officials in China over alleged human right violations against the mostly Muslim Uighur minority group, mainly in the Xinjiang region. 2022 saw the US ban on imports from China's Xinjiang region take effect, emphasizing the need to remain duly diligent. Hydro does not source material and alloys from the Xinjiang region, but given the complexity of internal Chinese supply chains we continue to monitor the situation.\n\n## Guinea\n\nHydro does not source bauxite directly from Guinea, but some of the alumina Hydro sources in Europe and a part of the primary metal sourced externally have their bauxite origin in Guinea. We followed closely the complaints process related to the expansion of the CBG mine raised to the Compliance Officer in CAO (the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman for the International Finance Corporation). We have requested more information from both parties in the complaints case, the mine operator and the NGOs representing the impacted villagers.\n\n## Norway\n\nIn Norway, Hydro has an offtake agreement with Statkraft on power from the new Fosen wind power installation. The projects on the Fosen peninsula are located within Sami reindeer grazing land. Agreements on mitigating measures and compensation for extra costs during the construction phase were previously entered into with the two affected reindeer herding groups. In August 2021, the Norwegian supreme court determined that the construction of the wind park had not sufficiently taken into account the rights of the Sami population. The consequences of the verdict are being assessed by the responsible ministry. Hydro is monitoring the situation and following up with Statkraft.\n\n## Supplier development\n\nWe work to strengthen and improve our suppliers' sustainability performance through efforts such as dialogue, knowledge-sharing, innovation processes, incentives and supplier development programs. As a part of our work to strengthen our procurement processes, we have incorporated living wage considerations. In particular, we encourage our suppliers to pay wages to cover basic needs and provide some discretionary income.\n\nIn Brazil, suppliers can apply to participate in a comprehensive, year long supplier development program. In 2022, twenty one supplier companies were invited to participate in the third edition of the Supplier Development Program. At the end, twelve suppliers successfully completed all the requirements and were duly certified in December 2022. The total number of participants, considering all three editions is 148 companies, including ninety local companies.",

We can only succeed as a company if the communities around us also succeed, and investing in positive development is an important part of mitigating risk and negative impact. Through offering jobs, buying services, paying taxes and fees, and by trying to be good neighbors, we contribute to the society to which we belong. We constantly strive to make a positive difference in these communities. This is integrated into our purpose, values and business strategy.\n\n## Our approach\n\nA key element in Hydro's approach to local community value creation and just transition is to strengthen the societies and communities where we operate. The way we do this differs from country to country and from community to community. The main contribution is generated from our operations through production and purchase of goods and services, direct and indirect job creation, and tax payments. We engage in capacity building through targeted programs, to develop the competence of groups as well as individuals, and we have partnerships aiming to further enhance the public's knowledge about Hydro and its operations. Hydro has corporate requirements on management of community investments, charitable donations and sponsorships. Read about Hydro's social ambitions for 2050 in our chapter on Human rights.\n\n## Education and skills development target\n\nOur ambition is to equip 500,000 people with essential skills\n\n## Ambition\n\n## Performance\n\n500,000\n\nPeople equipped with essential skills for the future economy through education and skills development by 2030\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPeople educated or trained in 2022 as part of target\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSpent on community investments, charitable donations and sponsorships\n\nfor the future economy by 2030. We have developed a methodology which defines what constitutes as education and skill development and ensures consistency in how we measure our progress across the company. The methodology can be accessed here. The insight from measuring the people reached and the impact of our initiatives make us better equipped to select and execute future initiatives with a positive impact.\n\nIn 2022, we reached more than 25,000 people, which implies that we have reached to 157,000 people in total since 2018. We are still on track to reach 500,000 by year-end 2030. Continuous improvement of current initiatives and the development of new high-impact initiatives are important going forward.\n\n## Community investments and social programs\n\nWe have a magnitude of social programs based on local needs and customs. Some of our community investments and programs are linked to mining license requirements, while others are voluntary commitments. The programs target education, economic growth, decent work, entrepreneurship, capacity building and strengthening of institutions.\n\nTo support local communities, we organize volunteer programs at many of our production sites. The volunteer activities are based on local customs and needs. Many sites also support local communities through a range of sponsorships and charitable donations.\n\nAnother important contribution is the transfer of competence that takes place through our cooperation with universities and research institutions. This includes the cooperation with three academic institutions in Par\u00e1, Brazil, and the University of\n\n<!-- image -->",

There are high levels of unemployment and general poverty with a lack of access to basic services, with the share of people with access to sanitation at less than 30 percent.\n\nIn Par\u00e1 state, Hydro has several social programs across the seven municipalities where we have operations. The programs contribute to the sustainable development of the territory, supporting a just transition and promoting capacity building, education and income generation, preserving the biodiversity of Amazon, with respect for Human Rights. To achieve this goal, we develop projects in four strategic areas: Education and skills; Value Chain; Quality of life; Biodiversity. In 2022, we developed a strategy to guide our social investments and strengthen our efforts toward a positive impact on the territories.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, we also continued technical training for community members along the bauxite pipeline from Paragominas to Barcarena (see managing human rights risks in Human rights chapter) to strengthen their job opportunities. We also work to establish social programs and income generation initiatives, including traditional farming and livelihoods, along the pipeline.\n\nAs the Hydro Sustainability Fund initiative, we initiated the Sustainable Barcarena Initiative (SBI) in 2018. This is an independent platform for sustainable development in Barcarena in Par\u00e1 state. The overall aim is to bring local stakeholders together to discuss challenges and opportunities, strengthen capabilities and ultimately invest in the social initiatives they plan and develop together. In 2022, about 120 people participated in meetings, dialogues or programs organized by the initiative. The Hydro Sustainability Fund finances SBI and will contribute with BRL 100 million to the initiative over a 10 year period.\n\nThe fund launched its first round of financing in 2019 for projects supporting local associations to increase community businesses' knowledge and to promote cultural events. Due to Covid-19, the implementation of the projects was delayed until 2021, but the projects are now underway. A second round of financing of more than BRL 7.1 million is under development together with USAID. SBI coordinates the financing rounds.\n\nCommunity investments,\n\ncharitable donations and\n\nsponsorships\n\n## Community investments, charitable donations and sponsorships\n\nNOK million\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOslo through the Biodiversity Research Consortium BrazilNorway.

Hydro is also the sponsor of a professorship in Norway and has several adjunct professors among its own employees. See collaborating with other parties for more information.\n\n## Just Transition in our local communities\n\nHydro has a direct and indirect influence on communities with a plethora of unique challenges. In our Just Transition work, we have looked at the communities where we have the largest presence, and the ones which are uniquely exposed to Just Transition challenges to prioritise our work. Some of these at-risk communities, face challenges related to poverty and inequality, physical climate change and challenges related to decarbonisation efforts changing the nature and demand of jobs in communities.\n\nKey towards contributing towards a Just Transition is supporting the local communities in which we operate is therefore supporting them to develop resilience in a changing world, and the necessary skills and jobs for a future low carbon economy. We will contribute toward this by empowering 500,000 people with education and skills for the future economy by 2030, as described above. We also engage in partnerships for a positive local development.\n\n## Breakdown of 2022 results by type of support provided\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n* Education refers to initiatives within the traditional educational system, and Capacity building covers training outside the educational system.",

See our section on Partnerships for more information.\n\nA volunteering program for employees has helped increase internal engagement and address community needs. In 2022, over 500 employees participated in the volunteer programs organized at several of our locations in Brazil. The volunteers organized over 70 different activities, including organizing food baskets, fundraising, seed planting and training for community leaders.\n\n## India\n\nIn Kuppam, India, we finance two local learning labs using tablets and physical games that give children at two schools in the community access to enhanced learning opportunities. Although our extrusion plant in India was sold in 2021, the project was still funded by Hydro in 2022.\n\n## Italy\n\nWe continued supporting UNICEF's 'Upshift' program, a youth social innovation and social entrepreneurship program designed primarily for marginalized or at-risk young people. In 2022, Hydro supported 'Upshift' for migrant and refugee youth in Italy.\n\n## Ukraine emergency support\n\nUNICEF received NOK 10 million from Hydro to support families and children affected by the war in Ukraine. NOK 1 million of the donation was donated by Hydro employees around the world, as part of a two-week fundraising initiated by Hydro's unions EWC (European Works Council) and LO (Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions). Additionally, Hydro made a holiday contribution of NOK 1 million to\n\nUNICEF which was donated to their Ukraine Winter Preparedness program. Hydro in Poland has organized transport to and from the Ukrainian border for any of the 400 Ukrainian Hydro employees who wished to bring their families to Poland. Hydro Extrusions has donated EUR 50,000 to Happy Kids, a Polish NGO providing foster homes and care for children evacuated from the war. The donations will help finance food, clothing, medicines and more.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We have a responsibility to provide a safe work environment and believe that this also promotes efficiency and lower operating costs. We believe that diverse and inclusive teams lead to higher levels of innovation, a learning culture, better customer understanding, and better financial results. Hydro is committed to the principles of non-discrimination and does not tolerate any form of harassment or bullying in the workplace.\n\n## Our approach\n\n## Occupational health and safety\n\nHydro shall be a leading company in our industry in the area of occupational health and safety. This will be achieved through consistent implementation of the management system with committed and visible leadership, and full engagement of all employees and others who work with us. The CEO HSE Committee is the strategic decision-\n\nmaking committee for all main HSE-related matters for the Hydro group. The committee is led by President & CEO Hilde Merete Aasheim and consists of the members of the Corporate Management Board and the head of HSE.\n\nOur ambition is to provide safe and healthy workplaces, promote health and wellbeing, and prevent work-related injuries and ill-health. We drive safety improvements by systematically reducing risks, training personnel and regularly following up by line management and safety delegates. All injuries and high-risk incidents are investigated to find root causes and to share lessons learned between our sites.\n\nWe will work continuously to avoid damage to property and loss of production. Hydro has developed a comprehensive health and safety management system and our manufacturing sites are certified to internationally recognized health and safety standards. We embrace digital tools where possible and have developed an advanced incident management system, self-assessment tools, risk management processes, e-learning training modules, etc., all easily accessible to employees. In addition, we have strengthened our behavioral\n\n## Ambitions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWomen in permanent and temporary positions by 2025\n\n## Performance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n22%\n\nWomen in permanent and temporary positions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur people and work environment\n\nMaterial topics covered in this chapter:\n\nDiversity, inclusion and belonging\n\nLiving wage\n\nWorkers' health and safety\n\nSecurity and emergency preparedness\n\nTalent and leadership development\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n0\n\nFatal accidents and life changing injuries\n\n1\n\nLife changing injury\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nScore on the Inclusion index by 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The majority of injuries were relatively minor, however, there was one life-changing injury reported during the year where a contractor had two fingers amputated using a table saw.\n\nWe recorded zero fatal accidents in 2022. Sadly, we have recorded one fatality in February 2023, when a contractor employee at minority-owned MRN lost his life in an accident involving a vehicle. At the time of publishing our annual report, the accident is under investigation by police and MRN. See note S5 to the Sustainability statements for more information about our health and safety statistics.\n\nThe deployment of fatality-prevention procedures and associated life-saving rules and behaviors continued in 2022, which contributed to a continued reduction in the number and rates of high-risk incidents with the potential to be fatal or life changing. Key initiatives include monthly deep dive incident data analyses to support continuous improvement through root cause identification and defining actions to prevent incidents from recurring, and quarterly health, safety, security and environment network meetings to connect specialists from all business areas to discuss findings and actions\n\ntaken from high-risk incidents, and sharing best practice and innovative solutions.\n\nOur approach to continual improvement of physical and chemical occupational health is based on work environment risk assessments (WERA) and implementation of riskreduction measures followed up through an associated key performance indicator. WERA provides a systematic approach for evaluating the exposure of similar exposure groups, identifying the most exposed work operations and measures can be implemented before ill-health occurs. The Group online HSE tool, IMS provides a WERA module to facilitate the work process and ensure transparency.\n\nThe focus on mental health and wellbeing has continued with numerous initiatives completed during the year to raise awareness, including mental health webinars, quarterly wellbeing topics addressing stress management, sleep hygiene, healthy eating and physical activity. In addition, two e-learning modules on stress awareness and stress management have been developed. To ensure a systematic approach to the psychosocial work environment, we have established a psychosocial risk indicator (PRI) as part of our employee engagement survey, Hydro Monitor. A process for follow-up of the PRI has been developed, including guidelines and tools.\n\n## Our people strategy\n\nHydro needs competence, capabilities and organizational culture to deliver on our strategy. Hydro's people strategy sets strategic priorities for talent acquisition, learning and competence development, leadership and succession, and diversity and inclusion. The priorities are supported by targets and activities based on the business areas' needs.\n\nHydro believes its value proposition, purpose, and growth opportunities are important to attract and retain talent in a challenging labor market. In 2023, Hydro will deploy new assessment tools for personality and ability to ensure the right candidates are employed. Hydro invests in employee skills and development opportunities in line with both business and individual needs to deliver on our business strategy and to be an attractive employer. Our goal is to have a culture of continuous learning to ensure the current and future workforce are prepared to deliver on our growth agenda and improve our business.\n\nLearning and competence development is offered through a combination of on the job training, social initiatives like networking, mentoring and peer to peer learning, and formal learning initiatives. Our learning platform supports learning and competence development by providing content from learning providers and well known universities. All employees have a yearly dialogue with their leader where goals, development needs and activities are discussed and documented.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To have a solid pipeline of leaders with the required breadth of experience, we aim to rotate leaders so that they gain knowledge from different parts of the organization and provide programs that support the development needs of leaders and specialists. Through the succession and talent processes, we work with the leadership and specialist pipelines to identify and develop our future leaders.\n\nHydro believes Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging (DIB) is a key enabler for Hydro. Our DIB processes are centred around three pillars:\n\n- \u009f Diversity: Seeking multiple perspectives and competencies when solving tasks and meeting customer needs. This includes increasing relevant diversity across seniority levels, including improved gender balance\n- \u009f Equity: Promoting equitable opportunities for everyone to thrive, contribute and succeed, adjusting for the fact that different individuals have different starting points\n- \u009f Inclusion: Fostering inclusive leadership and an inclusive culture for all employees to contribute with their full potential\n\nWe aim to increase value creation and foster a culture of belonging in a high-performing and sustainable work environment based on inclusion of our differences.

To be more data driven, we have developed reports, dashboards and analytics for the business areas in 2022 to track progress on key DIB metrics.\n\nHydro Monitor is our global employee engagement survey, sent to all permanent employees every other year, including 2022. It is complimented with shorter pulse surveys on different levels in the organization on a more frequent basis. The purpose of the survey is to measure key drivers of engagement within Hydro by giving employees a method to have their voices heard and provide valuable feedback. This feedback is developed into focused action plans and roadmaps for improvement.\n\nMore information on Hydro's goals and approach to diversity, inclusion and equitable opportunity, can be found in the social and environmental statements.\n\nCollaborating with unions and other employee representatives Through the Global Framework Agreement, Hydro is committed to providing equality of opportunity and treatment as required by ILO Conventions 100 and 111, respectively. This includes equal remuneration for men and women for work of equal value. The diversity and inclusion strategy was approved in 2021 and communicated through the business area communication bodies for dialogue between management and union representatives.\n\n## Living wage\n\nIn light of the Norwegian Transparency Act, we are in the process of conducting living wage gap analyses for our main operations and geographies, which we aim to finalize in 2023. In 2021, living wage was included in our responsible supply chain and procurement processes. Further information can be found in the section on Responsible supply chain.\n\n## Security and emergency preparedness\n\nHydro is committed to the protection of people, environment, physical assets, data and information. We anticipate and prepare for potentially adverse incidents with crisis potential in order to maintain business and operational continuity.\n\nTo prepare for and respond to intentional, unintentional and/\n\nThe green transition will create new employment opportunities and changes to existing ones. Innovations in our production methods and advancement of technologies risks the automation of jobs. Additionally, our focus on decarbonisation must not exacerbate social inequalities or discrimination. In order to facilitate a Just Transition, we develop skills and jobs relevant to the future low carbon economy, and ensure that our employees have their human rights protected and access to equal opportunities. We will contribute towards these outcomes by providing training and reskilling opportunities to Hydro employees. In 2022, we continued to develop and deliver learning and competence development for all our employees. We also work to increase inclusiveness among Hydro employees and track the perception of inclusiveness in our Hydro Inclusion Index. In 2022, 76 percent of employees have a positive perception of inclusion in Hydro.\n\nLeadership is a prioritized organizational lever for Hydro. Our ambition has been to develop a leadership framework of competencies based on valid research, but also reflecting what is unique to Hydro and therefore what we need from our leaders to deliver our business strategy and live our values. The framework serves as a fundament for our leadership processes, development programs and tools. In 2022 the leadership expectations have been deployed. In addition, selection and succession of potential leaders will be supported by our leadership criteria.\n\nEEI\n\n## Hydro Monitor - Employee Engagement Index\n\nPercent engaged\n\n<!-- image -->",

They help to link the process of security and emergency response, crisis management and recovery from the plant through to business area level and above.\n\nSecure information handling is important to ensure Hydro's business continuity and reputation. Cyber-risk assessment is an integrated part of Hydro's enterprise risk management system, in order to facilitate the business areas' awareness of how cyber risks relate to their critical assets and operations. Crucial computer systems are subject to surveillance and regulations, and all personnel with access to sensitive information are bound to secrecy and required to handle information according to corporate guidelines and requirements.\n\nOur enterprise IT platform 1 is a critical element in all parts of our operations, covering areas such as digital collaboration, enterprise resource planning, central personnel databases and systems for external reporting. Cybercrime is increasing globally, and Hydro is exposed to threats to the integrity, availability and confidentiality of our information and systems. Threats may include attempts to access information, computer viruses, denial of service and other digital security breaches.\n\nHydro has launched several initiatives to increase the robustness of the enterprise IT platform against malicious attacks by improving system infrastructure and by educating employees through mandatory e-learning to develop and improve secure work processes and routines, and to understand how these threats can be prevented. Additional segregation and protection is also implemented for the process control systems at Hydro's plants.\n\nCorporate Emergency Team crisis management training has been conducted together with the Cyber Crisis Team (CCT) to train a cyber security scenario with global impact for the company.\n\nCovid-19 continues to circulate globally, however, there are many tools available, and the risk of severe illness, hospitalization and death are reduced compared to earlier\n\n## Diversity characteristics\n\nWe have a broad definition of diversity in Hydro. We believe it encompasses both primary characteristics (what you cannot influence) such as gender assignet at birth, race, color, age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, affectional orientation, personality; and secondary factors (what you can influence) including education, work experience, skills, language, geography, communication style, and beliefs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Work  background   | Marital   status         | Parental   status                | Communication  style   |\n|--------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Talents            | Sexual  orientation      | Age                              | Culture                |\n| Skills             | Ethnicity Gender         | Personality Physical   abilities | Religious   beliefs    |\n| Experiences        | Geographical  background | Education                        | Language               |\n\n- n Secondary characteristics - can be influenced\n- n Primary characteristics - cannot be influenced\n\nor naturally occurring disasters, and to protect people and critical assets, we adapt and initiate security measures depending on the evolving risk picture. Our emergency preparedness plans enable effective response to highrisk incidents and crises, ensuring an effective, cohesive, integrated and timely response to any business disruption, regardless of origin, scale or complexity.\n\nSecurity in Hydro includes a proactive security risk management process, based on analysis, to enable appropriate mitigating actions and accurate and timely decision-making. Security guards are employed on a regular basis to protect our personnel and assets. No armed personnel are used in our operations.\n\nThere were several serious security incidents in 2022, and some involved firearms. No Hydro personnel were injured in these events and resulting security-mitigation measures were employed to further protect personnel and prevent against other incidents.\n\nDuring 2022, Hydro continued the progression to achieve certification for ISO 18788, a management system for private security operations, requirements and guidance. It is founded upon the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights, helping to demonstrate an ethical approach to the delivery of security services, and it will benchmark Hydro's security management system against the international standards. Hydro's security teams have achieved conformity to the requirements in the US and are now preparing for accreditation and certification. Hydro are also continuing to support our third-party security providers to achieve the same level of conformity in Brazil. One of the providers in Brazil achieved certification to ISO 18788 in 2021 and is now working with Hydro to help other Hydro providers through the process.\n\nHydro is responsible for infrastructure and functions on local and regional levels that might be critical to society's operability, and we operate large-scale production sites where a crisis could influence community interests and safety in general. Hence, we are subject to control and follow-up by relevant national authorities. We have emergency plans in place by site, business area and at group level, and we exercise and validate these plans regularly.\n\nTen emergency and crisis management workshops, with risk mapping at their core, were held in 2022.

In addition, emphasis has been given to the mental health state of the Group's staff impacted by long-standing social distancing rules, and the Group continues to encourage vaccination according to the guidelines set by authorities in countries where it operates.\n\nOur strategy to minimize the operational impact of Covid-19 and prepare for future pandemics continues to be based on full compliance with rules complemented by a flexible range of Hydro-specific responses and robust emergency preparedness. Where applicable, guidelines and regulations from national authorities such as those pertaining to travel restrictions, social distancing, home office or complete societal lockdowns have been reflected in our internal policies and procedures. We evaluate our key pandemic-related risks and vulnerabilities through annual security and business resilience assessments, which support the preparation and review of business continuity plans.\n\nAdditional measures that have been used and could be reinstated include stock level increases for raw materials to reduce our exposure to supply chain disruptions, as well as cash-preservation measures to reduce cost, capital expenditures and ensure adequate liquidity to face the financial impact of potential shutdowns.\n\n## Diversity, inclusion & belonging\n\nThe following sections provide information on the status of diversity and inclusion in Hydro, and the activities being undertaken to identify and analyze risk of discrimination and to take action to improve our DIB performance, in accordance with the requirements in the Norwegian Equality and AntiDiscrimination Act. This diversity and inclusion report and its references to the social statement, is approved by the Board of Directors and included in their responsibility statement.\n\n## Our diversity, inclusion and belonging program\n\nWe value diverse perspectives as essential to delivering on our long-term strategic agenda. Diversity allows us to think, approach challenges and solve problems differently.\n\nHydro is committed to providing equitable employment opportunities and treating all employees fairly and with respect regardless of primary or secondary diversity\n\ncharacteristics. Hydro's employees and business areas shall only use merit, qualifications and other professional criteria as a basis for employee-related decisions, such as recruitment, training, performance, compensation and promotion. We strive to develop programs and actions to encourage a diverse organization based on the principle of equitable opportunities. Hydro is committed to the principles of nondiscrimination and does not tolerate any form of harassment or bullying in the workplace.\n\n## Identifying and mitigating DIB-related risks\n\nWe use our employee engagement surveys, Hydro Monitor and pulse surveys, to identify and monitor risks relating to diversity, inclusion and belonging in Hydro. We also use the internal grievance mechanism AlertLine to assess the risk of discrimination and harassment in the organization, and track relevant employee data from our core employee system. Hydro Monitor also allows us to assess employee engagement and psychosocial risk indicators across different demographics, including gender, age, role, minority status, and caretaking needs.\n\nSince 2021, we have measured inclusion through our inclusion index. The index consists of eight questions related to diversity, inclusion and belonging, obtained through the Hydro monitor and pulse survey. The inclusion index score forms one of the CEO KPIs from 2023 measured on an annual basis as an improvement score and is also a KPI in our long-term Just Transition Sustainability roadmap.\n\nWe have developed tools and guidelines to assess risk of discrimination towards underrepresented groups. The business areas are expected to develop targets, act on the findings from the risk assessments, develop roadmaps, ensure responsibility is taken, and report progress to eliminate discrimination. The tools include digital and anonymous focus groups trying to understand root causes and actions, unconscious bias testing and training, and group guidelines for employee resource groups.\n\nAs a mitigating action, Hydro's DIB Policy has been further developed and implemented in 2022. It explains Hydro's commitment to diversity, inclusion and belonging and outlines the principles of DIB.\n\nHydro's corporate management board owns the DIB agenda and is accountable for DIB across Hydro.

The dashboards use HR reporting data and employee surveys for quarterly tracking of metrics on gender balance, diversity in the succession pool, inclusive culture, wellbeing, psychological safety and diversity leadership. The quarterly measurements are used to develop action plans and make continuous improvements and reported on in internal board meetings for each business area.\n\nTo mature our work on diversity, inclusion and belonging, we are continuously implementing actions at all levels in the organization across our strategic pillars.

In 2022, we achieved 22 percent. For more information about temporary employees see note S1.2. Employees by employment type and part-time employees.\n\nThe share of women in Hydro's Board of Directors was 36 percent in 2022. With three women among the seven shareholder-elected members and one woman among the three employee representatives on the Board of Directors, Hydro complies with the Norwegian legal requirements on women representation. The proportion of women on Hydro's Corporate Management Board was 40 percent in 2022. For further information about gender balance, see note S3 Diversity in management and S1 - Employees.\n\nWhile gender balance is a challenge among operators at most of Hydro's operational sites, women constitute 49 percent of the workforce in Hydro's corporate staffs and 45 percent in Global Business Services.

For example, Aluminium Metal, which is Hydro's largest business area in Norway, has implemented procedures to ensure a predictable work schedule for operators, and opportunities for flexible working hours for non-operator employees.\n\n## Opportunities for people with disabilities\n\nHydro seeks to generate opportunities and become an attractive employer for employees with disabilities, across our global operations. To foster an environment and culture where people of all physical, cognitive and mental health abilities can feel supported and be successful, we have developed a global guide for inclusion of people with disabilities. We are continuously adjusting working conditions so that all employees have the same opportunities in their workplace.\n\nIn Brazil, we are required to employ at least 5 percent employees with disabilities. At the end of 2022, 4.7 percent of the employees in Paragominas were disabled, at Alunorte 4.6 percent, and at Albras 4.8 percent. The absolute number for employees with disabilities increased in 2022, compared to 2021, and we are working to increase the share of disabled employees further. The Hydro Extrusions sites in southern Brazil fulfilled their legal requirements.\n\n## Pay equality and compensation\n\nHydro is committed to provide equal employment opportunities for all our employees. Hydro will continuously work to ensure pay equality for the same or similar jobs, regardless of gender. Our global compensation principles state that all employees shall receive total compensation that is competitive and aligned with the local industry standard. The compensation should be holistic, performance-oriented, transparent, fair and objective. Relevant qualifications, such as performance, education, experience and professional criteria, shall be considered when providing training, settling compensation and awarding promotions.\n\nIn 2020, we started the integration of compensation data in our people master data system, and a global job architecture framework was developed enabling us to map all employees in Hydro in a consistent way. Hydro's global job architecture framework is built on Mercer's International position evaluation system (IPE). Hence, Hydro's architecture consists of two main elements: a job family structure and a job level structure.\n\nThe activities and competency requirements determine which family a job belongs to, and it is the job that an individual holds that is mapped, not the individual person. The jobs are mapped in the family structure. We map employee positions in a level structure based on the complexity of each job. The job level structure consists of nine levels from operators, specialists to managers. Levels 1 to 3 typically cover operators in our plants, levels 5 and 6 jobs require higher education, e.g. bachelor or master with typically 1 to 5 years of experience. Levels 6 and 7 are jobs that require extensive experience in their area of expertise and levels 8 and 9 cover our most senior specialist and management positions.\n\nIn 2021, Hydro reported for the first time on compensation related differences between men and women based on the requirements in the Norwegian Equality and AntiDiscrimination Act. In 2022 we expanded our compensation reporting to identify pay gaps, increase transparency and improve fairness. We have prioritized countries where there are legal requirements on compensation reporting.\n\nFurther information on pay equality and compensation, including details on pay gap, temporary and part-time positions and parental leave statistics by gender for persons employed by our Norwegian subsidiaries, is included in note S1 - Employees and note S2 - Remuneration. In 2023, this will be updated with the biannual statistics on gender pay gaps and gender differences in part time work for each employee category, according to the Norwegian Equality and Anti-Discrimination Act.",

Judgment in these areas are partly related to the sources of uncertainty identified above and partly related to other sources of uncertainty discussed in the individual notes.\n\n- \u00b7 Impairment of non-current assets, discussed in note 2.5 Impairment of non-current assets\n- \u00b7 Uncertain assets and liabilities, discussed in section 4 Uncertain assets and liabilities\n- \u00b7 Uncertain tax positions, discussed in note 10.1 Income taxes\n- \u00b7 Business combinations, impacting such items as long-lived assets and uncertain assets and liabilities, discussed in note 1.5 Significant subsidiaries and changes to the consolidated group\n- \u00b7 Financial instruments, discussed in section 8 Financial risk and financial instruments\n\n## Significant accounting policies\n\nThe following description of accounting principles relevant for presentation and consolidation applies to Hydro's 2022 financial reporting, including comparative figures. The accounting policies for items covered by specific note disclosures are described in the relevant notes in this set of financial statements.\n\n## Income statements and statements of comprehensive income\n\nHydro has elected to present a separate income statement and a separate statement of comprehensive income, rather than a combined statement. Further, Hydro presents an analysis of expenses based on their nature as a common analysis of expenses through Hydro's value chain. Hydro has elected to present a sub-total Earnings before financial items and tax (EBIT). This measure is also used as a segment profit measure. The share of the profit (loss) in equity accounted investments is included in this sub-total because the majority of such investments are operationally integrated with Hydro's businesses. Results from such investments are managed as part of Hydro's operating activities with significant transactions between the majority of these investments and Hydro. Return on other equity investments is not as closely related to the business activities in Hydro, and hence classification as finance income better reflects the way such investments are managed.\n\nGains and losses on disposal of non-current assets are presented net, as well as expenditures related to provisions that are reimbursed by a third party. However, insurance compensation and government grants are reported on a gross basis.\n\n## Statements of cash flows\n\nHydro uses the indirect method to present cash flows from operating activities. Interest and dividends received as well as interest paid are included in cash flows from operating activities. Dividends paid are included in cash flows from financing activities.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include Norsk Hydro ASA and subsidiaries, which are entities in which Hydro has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity (control). Control is normally achieved through ownership, directly or indirectly, of more than 50 percent of the voting power. Currently, Hydro has more than 50 percent of the voting power in close to all subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are included from the date control commences until the date control ceases.\n\nIntercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Profit and loss resulting from intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nNon-controlling interests represent equity interests in subsidiaries held by other owners than Hydro. Non-controlling interests are reported as a separate section of the Group's equity in accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements. Results attributed to non-controlling interests are based on ownership interest, or other method of allocation if required by contract.\n\n## Transactions between non-controlling shareholders and the group\n\nSales and purchases of equity interests and equity contributions not resulting in Hydro gaining or losing control of a subsidiary are reported as equity transactions in accordance with IFRS 10. No gain, loss or remeasurement of values of recognized assets, liabilities or goodwill are recognized as a result of such transactions.\n\n## Note 1.1 Reporting entity, basis of presentation and significant accounting policies\n\nThe reporting entity reflected in these financial statements comprises Norsk Hydro ASA and consolidated subsidiaries (Hydro). Hydro is headquartered in Oslo, Norway, and the group employs around 32,000 people in about 40 countries. Hydro is a global supplier of aluminium with operations throughout the industry value chain, and engages in development and production of renewable energy. Operations include power production, bauxite extraction, alumina refining, aluminium smelting, recycling, and extruded solutions. The Board of Directors and the President and CEO authorized these financial statements for issue on February 13, 2023. Hydro is listed on the Oslo stock exchange, Oslo B\u00f8rs.\n\n## Basis of presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Norsk Hydro ASA and its subsidiaries are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as endorsed by the European Union (EU) and Norwegian authorities and effective as of December 31, 2022. Hydro also provides the disclosures as specified under the Norwegian Accounting Act (Regnskapsloven).\n\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for certain assets, liabilities and financial instruments, which are measured at fair value. Preparation of financial statements including note disclosures requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported. Actual results may differ.\n\nThe functional currency of Norsk Hydro ASA is the Norwegian krone (NOK). The Hydro group financial statements are presented in NOK.\n\nAs a result of rounding adjustments, the figures in one or more columns included in the financial statements may not add up to the total of that column.\n\nInterest rates used for calculating net present values are rounded to the nearest 10 basis points for post-employment benefits, to the nearest 25 basis points for other non-financial assets and liabilities.\n\n## Significant estimates and judgment\n\nEstimation risks are associated with different phases of operation and sources of uncertainty. We have identified the following important sources of estimation risks, which impacts accounting estimates in different ways:\n\n- \u00b7 Changing business environment, including changes driven by the green shift and physical climate changes already present or expected in the near future, impacting such estimates as remaining useful life for existing assets and whether assets are impaired due to shorter useful life, higher cost, or regulatory constraints of operations. These aspects of judgments are further discussed in note 2.4 Depreciation and amortization expense and note 2.5 Impairment of non-current assets.\n- \u00b7 New business models for developing projects or businesses in cooperation with others are applied for such business activities as renewable energy projects and technology development. Contracts used in such projects may introduce complexity related to how to assess control and influence for part-owned companies, including whether Hydro has control, joint control or significant influence over such companies as further discussed in note 3.1 Investments in joint arrangements and associates.\n- \u00b7 Renewable energy projects introduce complex accounting judgment related to contract structures including which of these contracts that represent financial instruments to be recognized at fair value and how to measure such contracts with entity specific features as further discussed in note 8.2 Financial instruments.\n- \u00b7 Exiting and remediating sites used for historic activities represent both risks of costs and liabilities, and opportunity for value creation, and involves estimation of extent and cost of remediation effort as well as assessment of the value of land, building and other assets historically used for industrial purposes.",

For derivatives covering a period beyond the liquid period of price curves, the curves are extrapolated using unobservable data.\n\nFair value of commodity derivatives is measured as the present value of future cash flows, calculated using forward curves and exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. Estimates from brokers and extrapolation techniques are applied for non-quoted products and periods to achieve the most relevant forward curve. For electricity contracts linked to specific production facilities, variability in production profile and price patterns are included in the valuation models. In addition, when deemed appropriate, correlation techniques between commodities are applied. Options are revalued using option pricing models, and credit spreads are applied where deemed to be significant. Markets are assessed to determine whether they are active for the relevant instruments. Currency and interest markets are considered liquid for the periods used for price references, and thus applied unadjusted. For aluminium contracts priced to observations at the London Metal Exchange (LME), liquidity is considered good for the first few years, with fewer transactions for longer durations. For electricity contracts priced to the electricity exchange Nasdaq OMX, liquidity is considered good for the first two years. For longer durations there are fewer transactions and higher uncertainty. Similar assessment is made for other markets used for price references. For less liquid periods, adjustments to remove outliers and extrapolation techniques are applied.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nHydro measures embedded forward contracts that are separated from the host contract by comparing the forward curve at contract inception to the forward curve as of the balance sheet date. Changes in the present value of the cash flows related to the embedded derivative are recognized in the balance sheet with changes in the fair value recognized in the income statement. Forward curves are established as described above under Derivatives.\n\n## Note 1.3 Significant events\n\nThe following significant events have impacted Hydro in 2022, or are expected to impact Hydro in 2023:\n\nAt the beginning of 2022 the aluminium markets were one of the strongest in decades in the aftermath of the corona pandemic. However, the Russian invasion in Ukraine, the energy shortage in particular in Europe, spiking inflation and a global economic slow-down, including a significant fall in aluminium demand, resulted in significantly weaker markets in the second half of the year. There is significant uncertainty surrounding the market outlook impacting estimates.\n\nIn March, Hydro announced that no new contracts with Russian counterparts will be entered into in response to the war in Ukraine. Existing contracts were terminated where contract clauses or sanctions allowed, otherwise Hydro complied with such contracts through the minimum term.\n\nIn August 2022, the Board of Directors in the part-owned subsidiary Slovalco in Slovakia decided to stop primary aluminium production in response to high energy prices and adverse framework conditions. Primary production had been curtailed in steps during 2021 and 2022, resulting in power purchase contracts for delivery during 2022 at fixed price being recognized at fair value of about NOK 2.8 billion at the end of 2021. The fair value represented a gain on derivative purchase contracts in 2021, with market adjustments and realization in 2022. The Slovalco smelter assets were written down as impaired at the end of 2021 as a result of the high production costs not supporting profitable production. The casthouse in Slovalco continues its recycling operations.\n\nThe Hydro Rolling business was sold in June 2021. The business is reported as Discontinued operations. The transaction is further described in note 1.5 Significant subsidiaries and changes to the group .\n\n## Foreign currency transactions\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency of the transacting entity by applying the rate of exchange as of the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date. Currency gains or losses are included in Finance expense.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nFor consolidation purposes, the financial statements of subsidiaries with a functional currency other than Norwegian kroner (NOK) are translated into NOK. Assets and liabilities, including investment in associates, joint ventures and goodwill, are translated using the rate of exchange as of the balance sheet date. Income, expenses and cash flows are translated using the average exchange rate for the reported period. Goodwill is recognized in the predominant functional currencies in the acquired businesses. Translation adjustments are recognized in Other comprehensive income and accumulated in Currency translation differences in Other components of equity. On disposal of such subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the cumulative translation adjustment of the disposed entity is recognized in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.\n\n## Note 1.2 Measurement of fair value\n\nHydro measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value for the purpose of recognition or disclosure. Recurring fair value measurement is used primarily for financial instruments, see section 8 Financial risk and financial instruments. Nonrecurring fair value measurement is used for transactions, such as business combinations, divestments with non-cash consideration and certain other non-routine transactions. Fair value is estimated using inputs which are to varying degree objectively observable. Certain items are valued on the basis of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 valuations), others are valued on the basis of inputs that are derived from observable prices (level 2 valuations), while certain positions are valued on the basis of judgmental assumptions that are to a limited degree or not at all based on observable market data (level 3 valuations).\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nThe estimated fair value of Hydro's financial instruments is based on market prices and valuation techniques. Valuations are made with the objective to include relevant factors that market participants would consider in setting a price, and to apply accepted economic and financial methodologies for the pricing of financial instruments. References for less active markets are carefully reviewed to establish relevant and comparable data. Extrapolations and other accepted valuation techniques are employed in periods with few or no transactions, such as for long-term commodity contracts in markets with few observations beyond the short or mid-term period, and for contracts with variability or contingencies which are not present in observable markets.\n\nHydro's estimated credit spread for similar liabilities is used when determining the fair value of financial instruments where Hydro is net liable. Hydro determines the appropriate discount factor and credit spread for financial assets based on both an individual and on a portfolio assessment.\n\n## Equity securities\n\nFair value for unlisted shares is based on commonly accepted valuation techniques utilizing significant unobservable data, primarily cash flow-based models. To the extent there are transactions in such shares, the transaction price is assessed and, to the extent comparable to rights embodied in the investment held by Hydro, used for reference. For investments where share holdings are associated with offtake rights and/or obligations or other specific clauses, those rights and obligations are included in the valuation of the equity securities. Fair value for listed shares or regularly traded shares is based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet date.\n\n## Debt instruments\n\nFair value for unlisted debt instruments is estimated primarily through cash flow models using contractual cash flow where relevant, and discount rates reflecting the perceived credit risk and other relevant risks associated with the instrument. Fair value for listed instruments is based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet date.",

The following exceptions apply for intersegment transactions:\n\n- \u00b7 Internal commodity contracts may meet the definition of a financial instrument in IFRS 9 or contain embedded derivatives that are required to be reported separately and valued at fair value under IFRS 9. However, Hydro considers these contracts as sourcing of raw materials or sale of own production, and accounts for such internal contracts as executory contracts.\n- \u00b7 Certain other internal contracts may contain a lease arrangement. However, the segment reporting reflects the responsibility allocated by Hydro's management for those assets, and no internal lease arrangement is identified.\n\nThe following tables include information about Hydro's operating segments.\n\n|                         | External revenue   | External revenue   | Internal revenue   | Internal revenue   | Share of the profit (loss) in equity  accounted investments   | Share of the profit (loss) in equity  accounted investments   |\n|-------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Amounts in NOK million  | 2022               | 2021               | 2022               | 2021               | 2022                                                          | 2021                                                          |\n| Hydro Bauxite & Alumina | 21,649             | 17,088             | 12,303             | 10,610             | -

Operating segments are components of a business that are evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker for the purpose of assessing performance and allocating resources. Hydro's chief operating decision maker is the President and CEO. Generally, financial information is required to be disclosed on the same basis that is used by the CEO.\n\nHydro's operating segments represent separately managed business areas with products serving different markets, or distinct elements of the business separately followed up and reported to the chief operating decision maker. Hydro's reportable segments are the business areas Hydro Bauxite & Alumina, Hydro Aluminium Metal, Hydro Extrusions, and Hydro Energy, as well as the Hydro Metal Markets activities which are managed combined with Hydro Aluminium Metal.\n\nHydro Bauxite & Alumina activities includes bauxite mining activities, production of alumina and related commercial activities, primarily the sale of alumina. Alumina purchased and produced is both used internally for production of aluminium and sold to external customers.\n\nHydro Aluminium Metal includes primary aluminium production and casting activities. The main products are comprised of extrusion ingots, foundry alloys, sheet ingot and standard ingot.\n\nHydro Metal Markets includes all sales activities relating to products from our primary metal plants in Aluminium Metal and operational responsibility for stand-alone recyclers as well as physical and financial metal trading activities. Aluminium produced by Aluminium Metal and Metal Markets is both used internally for production of extruded products and sold to external customers.\n\nHydro Extrusions delivers products within extrusion profiles, building systems and precision tubing, and is operating several recycling facilities, both integrated with its extrusion plants and separate plants. Hydro Extrusions is present in about 40 countries. The products are delivered to such sectors as construction, automotive and heating, ventilation and air conditioning.\n\nHydro Energy includes operating and commercial responsibility for Hydro's power stations in Norway, a trading and wholesale business in Brazil, and energy sourcing for Hydro's world-wide operations. Energy is also responsible for Hydro's initiatives within other renewable energy production such as wind and solar managed by Hydro REIN, the hydrogen initiatives managed by Hydro Havrand and the battery initiatives.\n\nOther consist of Hydro's captive insurance company Industriforsikring, internal service providers, and certain other activities. Unallocated corporate activities are reported as part of Other.\n\n## Operating segment information\n\nHydro uses two measures of segment results, Earnings before financial items and tax - EBIT and EBITDA. EBIT is consistent with the same measure for the group, considering the principles for measuring certain intersegment transactions and contracts described below. Hydro defines EBITDA as Income (loss) before tax, financial income and expense, depreciation, amortization and write-downs, less investment grants. Hydro's definition of EBITDA may be different from other companies. The two measures represent results with and without the charge for historic investments in production capacity and other fixed assets and are considered complementary.\n\nBecause Hydro manages long-term debt and taxes on a group basis, Income before tax and Net income is presented only for the group as a whole.\n\nIntersegment sales and transfers reflect arm's length prices as if sold or transferred to third parties at the time of inception of the internal contract, which may cover several years. Transfers of businesses or fixed assets within or between Hydro's segments are reported without recognizing gains or losses. Results of activities not considered part of Hydro's main operations as well as unallocated revenues, expenses, liabilities and assets are reported together with Other under the caption Other and eliminations.",

The non-controlling owners hold options to participate in the capital increase, expiring in the first quarter of 2023. The non-controlling owners have limited influence on the operational decisions. The non-controlling interests in Alunorte amounted to NOK 517 million as of December 31, 2022 and NOK 554 million as of December 31, 2021. Funds held by the entity are not available to the group through cash pool arrangements. Dividends need to be approved by the shareholders jointly. The shareholder agreement supports transfer of dividend to the extent possible under statutory regulations. The refinery produces alumina, which is sold to its shareholders in proportion to ownership interest at a price based on prevailing alumina prices.\n\nThe table below summarizes key figures for Albras, the only subsidiary with non-controlling interests considered material, as included in the group financial statements. Fair value adjustments from Hydro's acquisition of the subsidiary are included. Intercompany transactions and balances are included, and any internal profit and loss in inventory and fixed assets purchased from group companies are not eliminated in the numbers below.\n\n|                                                              | Albras   | Albras   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Amounts in NOK million                                       | 2022     | 2021     |\n| Internal revenue                                             | 5,928    | 5,003    |\n| External revenue                                             | 5,305    | 4,503    |\n| Earnings before financial items and tax                      | 856      | 2,544    |\n| Net income                                                   | 804      | 1,592    |\n| Other comprehensive income                                   | 1,229    | (153)    |\n| Total comprehensive income                                   | 2,032    | 1,439    |\n| Net cash flows from operating activities                     | 898      | 1,534    |\n| Net cash flows from investing activities                     | (1,204)  | (986)    |\n| Net cash flows from financing activities                     | 260      | (610)    |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                    | 273      | 319      |\n| Other current assets                                         | 3,614    | 2,449    |\n| Non-current assets                                           | 5,332    | 3,940    |\n| Current liabilities                                          | (2,049)  | (2,033)  |\n| Non-current liabilities                                      | (1,639)  | (732)    |\n| Equity attributable to Hydro                                 | (2,820)  | (2,010)  |\n| Equity attributable to non-controlling interests             | (2,711)  | (1,933)  |\n| Share of net income attributable to non-controlling interest | 996      | 779      |\n| Dividends paid to non-controlling interests                  | 119      | 260      |\n\n## Note 1.5 Significant subsidiaries and changes to the group\n\n## Accounting policies for business combinations\n\n## Business combinations\n\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations. Consideration is the sum of the fair values, as of the date of exchange, of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued in exchange for control of the acquiree. The fair value of Hydro's pre-existing ownership interest in an acquiree is included in the consideration, with any gain or loss recognized in Other income, net.\n\nThe acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognized separately at the acquisition date at their fair value irrespective of any non-controlling interest, and goodwill recognized to the extent the consideration exceeds identified net assets.\n\nThe interest of non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree is initially measured as the non-controlling interests' proportion of the fair value of the net assets recognized (partial goodwill method, see note 2.3 Goodwill), or as the non-controlling interests' proportion of the fair value of the acquiree (full goodwill method, see note 2.3 Goodwill). Non-controlling interests are subsequently adjusted for changes in equity of the subsidiary after the acquisition date.\n\n## Assets held for sale and Income from discontinued operations\n\nAssets held for sale are reported separately in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, provided that the sale is highly probable, which includes the criteria that management is committed to the sale, and that the sale will be completed within one year. Assets held for sale are not depreciated but are measured at the lower of carrying value and the fair value less costs to sell for the asset group. Assets are not reclassified in prior period balance sheets. Immaterial disposal groups are not reclassified.\n\nA discontinued operation is a component of Hydro that is held for sale or has been disposed of. A discontinued operation is a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations. Related cash flows, results of operations and gain or loss from disposal are reported separately as Income (loss) from discontinued operations.\n\nAssets held for sale, liabilities in disposal groups and income and expense from discontinued operations are excluded from specifications presented in the notes unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Significant judgment in accounting for business combinations\n\nIn a business combination, consideration, assets and liabilities are recognized at estimated fair value, and any excess purchase price included in goodwill. Where Hydro had an existing ownership interest in the acquiree, that interest is also reassessed to determine its acquisition date estimated fair value, resulting in an acquisition date gain or loss. In the businesses Hydro operates, fair values of individual assets and liabilities are normally not readily observable in active markets. Estimation of fair values requires the use of valuation models for acquired assets and liabilities as well as ownership interests. Such valuations are subject to numerous assumptions and are thus uncertain. The quality of fair value estimates may impact periodic depreciation and amortization of fixed assets, and assessment of possible impairment of assets and/or goodwill in future periods.\n\n## Subsidiaries with significant non-controlling interests\n\nThe Hydro group consists of about 160 companies in about 40 countries. Most subsidiaries, including the large operating units in Norway, are 100 percent owned, directly or indirectly, by Norsk Hydro ASA. A list of significant subsidiaries is included in note 7 Shares in subsidiaries to the separate accounts of Norsk Hydro ASA later in this report. Restrictions in the ability to transfer dividend based on reported results and/or equity in the relevant subsidiaries exist in most countries where we operate. In some countries, including Brazil, there are also legal restrictions in our ability to integrate cash holdings in subsidiaries in the group's cash pool. There are non-controlling interests in some subsidiaries. The more significant ones are described below.\n\n## Albras\n\nHydro holds 51 percent of the shares in the Brazilian aluminium smelter Alum\u00ednio Brasileiro S.A. (Albras), which is part of Hydro Aluminium Metal. The non-controlling owner has significant influence on certain decisions in the entity, including operational and investment budgets. The non-controlling interests in Albras amounted to NOK 2,711 million as of December 31, 2022 and NOK 1,933 million as of December 31, 2021. Funds held by the entity are not available to the group through cash pool arrangements. Dividends need to be approved by the shareholders jointly. The shareholder agreement supports transfer of dividend to the extent possible under statutory regulations. The smelter produces standard",

The carrying value of PP&E is comprised of the historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. The carrying value also includes the estimated value of the asset retirement obligation upon initial recognition of the liability. Hydro uses the cost model for PP&E and any investment properties.\n\n## Capitalized maintenance\n\nExpenditures for maintenance and repairs applicable to production facilities are capitalized in accordance with IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment when such costs are incurred on a scheduled basis with a time interval of greater than one year. Expenditures that regularly occur at shorter intervals are expensed as incurred. Major replacements and renewals are capitalized and any assets replaced are retired.\n\n## Stripping cost\n\nStripping costs incurred during the mining production phase are allocated between cost of inventory produced and the existing mine asset. Stripping costs are allocated as a component of the mine asset in the event they represent significantly improved access to ore. Stripping costs include such activities as removal of vegetation as well as digging the actual pit for mining the ore.\n\n## Capitalized interest\n\nHydro capitalizes borrowing costs on qualifying assets in accordance with IAS 23 Borrowing Costs. Currency gains or losses related to Hydro's foreign currency denominated borrowings are not capitalized.\n\n## Hydro's property, plant and equipment\n\nThe main components of Hydro's property, plant and equipment is production related machinery and buildings in Hydro's more than 100 operating plants. PP&E includes leased assets, see note 2.6 Leases.\n\n## Discontinued operations and assets held for sale\n\nHydro entered into an agreement to sell Hydro Rolling to KPS Capital Partners on March 5, 2021. The transaction was completed on June 1, 2021. The sold business comprised the Hydro Rolling segment, and related pension liabilities and certain support functions reported as part of Other activities. The transaction was subject to approval in the EU and certain other jurisdictions. The assets and liabilities in the divested business were reported as Assets held for sale and Liabilities in disposal groups as of the beginning of March 2021 until completion of the transaction. The results of operations in the divested businesses are reported separately under the caption Discontinued operations. The gain on sale of the business is also reported in this line item. No interest expense related to loans has been allocated to discontinued operations. Cash flows from discontinued operations are presented separately.\n\nSales from Hydro to the discontinued operations mainly represent aluminium sheet ingot and liquid aluminium as well as alumina and power delivered from Hydro's continued business to the rolling operations, priced with reference to observable market prices. These elements of cost were included in the result from discontinued operations of 2021 as such costs were required to achieve the sales reported for the discontinued operations. Most of the supply arrangements continue under the same or similar terms. Further, Hydro charged the discontinued business for certain shared services and other expenses incurred jointly, which remained charged to the discontinued operations in 2021, while shared administration costs and other corporate charges were not included in the discontinued operations.\n\nThe gain on sale in 2021 was NOK 79 million including recycling of an accumulated currency gain of NOK 554 million. The final consideration is subject to certain potential adjustments, mainly related to transfer taxes for which Hydro has assumed the responsibility. In 2022, a positive adjustment to estimated transaction related costs in the amount of NOK 36 million was recognized, increasing the total gain to NOK 115 million.\n\n## Summary of financial data for discontinued operations\n\n| NOK million                                         | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Revenue                                             | -      | 11,637 |\n| Depreciation, amortization and impairment           | -      | 178    |\n| Other expenses                                      | -      | 10,330 |\n| Earnings before financial items and tax             | -      | 1,149  |\n| Financial income (expense), net                     | -      | 40     |\n| Income (loss) before tax                            | -      | 1,189  |\n| Income tax expense                                  | -      | 407    |\n| Income (loss) from discontinued operations          | -      | 783    |\n| Impairment of discontinued operations               | -      | 850    |\n| Gain on disposal (net of tax)                       | 36     | 79     |\n| Gain (loss) from discontinued operations            | 36     | 12     |\n| Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities | -      | (902)  |\n| Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities | -      | 4,563  |\n| Net cash used in financing activities               | (54)   | (13)   |\n| Foreign currency effects on cash                    | -      | 2      |\n| Net cash provided by discontinued operations        | (54)   | 3,650  |",

Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair value separately from goodwill when they arise from contractual or legal rights or can be separated from the acquired entity and sold or transferred.\n\n## Emission rights\n\nGovernment granted and purchased CO2 emission allowances expected to be used towards Hydro's own emissions are recognized as intangible assets at nominal value (cost). The amounts are not amortized but are tested for impairment. Actual CO2 emissions which exceed the level covered by emission rights are recognized as a liability. Any sale of excess emission rights is recognized at the time of sale at the transaction price. CO2 emission allowances purchased for trading are measured and classified as inventory.\n\n## Research and development\n\nResearch expenditures are expensed as incurred. Development costs are capitalized as intangible assets at cost in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets when the recognition criteria are met, including probable future economic benefit and that the cost can be measured reliably.\n\nTo the extent development costs are directly contributing to the construction of a fixed asset, the development costs are capitalized as part of the asset provided all criteria for capitalizing the cost are met. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage, as well as maintenance costs, are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Exploration cost\n\nExploration cost for mineral resources are expensed as incurred. Costs related to acquired exploration rights are allocated to the relevant areas and capitalized. An area represents a unit that may be utilized based on shared infrastructure and may include several licenses. Exploration rights are transferred to mine development cost when development starts. Amortization of transferred mineral rights starts when extraction of the resources starts. Exploration rights related to undeveloped areas remain on the balance sheet as intangible assets (mineral rights) until a development is decided or a decision not to develop the area is made.\n\n## Significant judgment in accounting for research and development\n\nIn assessing whether activities should be accounted for as research expenditures or capitalized as development costs, significant judgement is applied in evaluating the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset and how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits.\n\n## Hydro's intangible assets\n\nHydro holds intangible assets mainly as complementary resources to its physical assets. Waterfall rights are fundamental for production of hydroelectrical power, however, a significant share of such rights was granted to Hydro rather than purchased. A significant share of acquired waterfall rights have indefinite life and are thus not amortized. Mineral rights are undeveloped rights related to Hydro's mining operations in Brazil. Other intangible assets include customer relations, technology and other intangible assets identified in acquisitions, in addition to proprietary technology developed internally, and certain other types of intangible assets.\n\nSee note 10.2 Research and development for information regarding expensed research expenditures.\n\n| Amounts in NOK million                  | Land and  buildings   | Machinery and  equipment   | Plant under  construction   | Total    |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------|\n| Cost                                    |                       |                            |                             |          |\n| December 31, 2020                       | 34,961                | 100,064                    | 4,402                       | 139,427  |\n| Additions                               | 221                   | 4,099                      | 3,458                       | 7,778    |\n| Disposals                               | (425)                 | (2,469)                    | (5)                         | (2,900)  |\n| Companies sold                          | (54)                  | (233)                      | (1)                         | (288)    |\n| Transfers                               | 658                   | 2,665                      | (3,323)                     | -

Goodwill is initially measured either as the excess of the consideration over Hydro's interest in the fair value of the acquiree's identifiable net assets (partial goodwill), or as the fair value of 100 percent of the acquiree in excess of the acquiree's identifiable net assets (full goodwill). The method is elected on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Hydro has applied the partial goodwill method for all business combinations completed prior to December 31, 2022. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment annually, and more frequently if indicators of possible impairment are observed, in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. Goodwill is allocated to the cash generating units or groups of cash generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination and that are monitored for internal management purposes.\n\n## Hydro's goodwill\n\nGoodwill allocated to Hydro Extrusions was recognized in the acquisition of Sapa AS in 2017. Goodwill allocated to Hydro Bauxite & Alumina was recognized in the acquisition of certain aluminium businesses, mainly in Brazil, in 2011. Goodwill allocated to Hydro Metal Markets was recognized in acquisitions undertaken more than 20 years ago.\n\n| Amounts in NOK million              | Hydro  Extrusions   | Hydro Bauxite  & Alumina   | Hydro Metal  Markets   | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|---------|\n| Cost                                |                     |                            |                        |         |\n| December 31, 2020                   | 3,932               | 1,708                      | 405                    | 6,045   |\n| Foreign currency translation effect | (16)                | (96)                       | 4                      | (108)   |\n| December 31, 2021                   | 3,916               | 1,612                      | 409                    | 5,937   |\n| Foreign currency translation effect | 399                 | 351                        | 44                     | 793     |\n| December 31, 2022                   | 4,315               | 1,963                      | 453                    | 6,730   |\n| Accumulated impairment              |                     |                            |                        |         |\n| December 31, 2020                   | (1,017)             | -

Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite life are required to be tested for impairment annually, in addition to any tests required when impairment indicators are determined to be present. Hydro has elected to do the annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth quarter. Exploration cost for undeveloped mining areas are assessed for impairment under IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources.\n\nWhen a Cash Generating Unit (CGU) or an asset is tested for impairment, the recoverable amount is estimated as the higher of the CGU's fair value less cost of disposal, or its value in use. The carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognized in the amount that the carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount. Losses are reversed in the event of a subsequent increase in the recoverable amount of an impaired asset, however, impairment of goodwill is not reversed.\n\n## Significant judgment in accounting for impairment of non-current assets\n\nIAS 36 requires that Hydro assess conditions that could cause an asset or a CGU to become impaired. The identification of CGUs involves judgment, including assessment of where active markets exist, and the level of interdependency of cash inflows. For Hydro, the CGU is either the individual plant, a group of plants that forms an integrated value chain where no independent prices for the intermediate products exist, a group of plants that are combined and managed to serve a common market, or a group of assets where circumstances otherwise indicate significant interdependencies. Assessing which indicators that may cause a CGU to be impaired includes such conditions as the macroeconomic environment impacting prices, supply and demand, significant changes in Hydro's planned use of the assets or expected changes to technology, regulations, or other frame conditions. All of these changes may impact the combination of product prices, raw material cost and energy cost, resulting in changes to the production margin to cover the carrying value of net assets in the CGU. Expected or reasonably possible climate and environmental changes as well as regulatory changes responding to such changes, impacts the assessment of financial viability and remaining useful life. Such factors are assessed in the same way as uncertain market prices for input factors and products, impacting cash flow estimates used for the tests.\n\nDirectly observable market prices rarely exist for our assets. However, fair value may be estimated based on recent transactions on comparable assets, internal models used by Hydro for transactions involving the same type of assets or other relevant information. Calculation of value in use is a discounted cash flow calculation based on continued use of the assets in their present condition, excluding potential exploitation of improvement or expansion potential, and including certain entity specific synergies or other positions.\n\nDetermination of the recoverable amount involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as commodity prices and their impact on markets and prices for upgraded products, development in demand, inflation, operating expenses and tax and legal systems. We use internal business plans, quoted market prices, external market and industry analysis and our best estimate of long-term development in commodity prices and production margins, currency rates, discount rates and other relevant information. Hydro's long-term assumptions for key prices and rates, such as prices on aluminium, alumina and key energy carriers, macroeconomic development and certain other key factors for our production facilities is important input to the analysis. This set of assumptions reflects megatrends such as the green transition and Hydro's view on relative strength of our products compared to alternative materials, development in prices and cost, growth expectations and other relevant factors. These planning assumptions are consistent with Hydro's strategy and the aim to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius as expressed in the Paris agreement. Our assumptions are one set of possible financial effect of achieving this goal. Other alternative paths may be more or less beneficial to Hydro's businesses.\n\nA detailed forecast of net cash flows is developed for a period of three to five years with projections thereafter, reflecting our view of the business cycle. Certain replacement investments are specifically modelled based on individual assets expected useful life. Hydro does not include a general growth factor to volumes for the purpose of impairment tests, however, cash flows are generally increased by expected inflation and, where market conditions are depressed, we consider whether full or partial market recovery towards previously observed volumes is justified. Estimated cash flows are discounted with a nominal risk adjusted discount rate specific for the business activity and country.\n\nUncertainty related to world economic development and its impact on demand and prices for Hydro's key products and input factors has been significant during the period, driven by the Ukraine war, energy shortages, in particular in Europe, increased inflation and interest rates, as well as the Covid-19 pandemic, and supply chain disruptions.\n\n## Note 2.4 Depreciation and amortization expense\n\n## Accounting policies for depreciation and amortization\n\nDepreciation and amortization expenses are measured on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, commencing when the asset is ready for its intended use. Mine property and development costs in extractive activities are depreciated using the unit-of-production method, using proved and probable reserves. Tangible and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not depreciated. Estimated useful life by category is as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 Machinery and equipment, initial investment 4-30 years, for power plants up to 75 years\n- \u00b7 Machinery and equipment, capitalized maintenance 1-15 years\n- \u00b7 Buildings 20-50 years\n- \u00b7 Intangible assets with finite lives 3-10 years, for rights related to hydroelectric power production up to 50 years\n\nA component of an item of property, plant and equipment with a significantly differing useful life and a cost that is significant in relation to the item is depreciated separately. At each financial year-end Hydro reviews the residual value and useful life of its assets, with any estimate changes accounted for prospectively over the remaining useful life of the asset.\n\n## Significant judgment in accounting for depreciation and amortization expense\n\nSignificant judgement is applied in the assessment of the useful life of the assets in Hydro's operations. Useful life may be shorter than technical remaining life. Expected life is influenced by technology development, including when new technology with lower or zero emissions becomes available and when such technologies may make existing assets obsolete. Our estimate is that phasing in of new technology will not significantly impact producing assets until after 2030, when we expect lower emission technologies to become available at industrial scale.\n\nPhysical climate risk such as changes to weather patterns and severity of rain, wind, flooding, and other events impact our assessment. Hydro has not identified material assets expected to have a significantly shorter life due to climaterelated risks.\n\n## Specification of depreciation and amortization by asset category\n\n| Amounts in NOK million                                         | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Buildings                                                      | 1,402  | 1,362  |\n| Machinery and equipment                                        | 6,762  | 6,221  |\n| Intangible assets                                              | 429    | 439    |\n| Depreciation and amortization from discontinued operations     | -      | (178)  |\n| Depreciation and amortization expense in continuing operations | 8,593  | 7,844  |",

The groups of CGUs are as follows:\n\nExtrusion North America covers production plants, marketing and product development in the US and Canada. The operation consists of 21 production plants, recognized intangible assets and goodwill from Hydro's acquisition.\n\nExtrusion Europe covers production plants, marketing and product development in Europe, mainly within the EU. The operation consists of 32 production plants, recognized intangible assets and goodwill from Hydro's acquisition.\n\nBuilding Systems covers production plants, product warehouses, marketing and product development facilities, mainly in Europe, and sales and marketing offices covering a wider presence. The operation is present at 59 locations in 26 countries. The asset base consists of a limited number of production plants, several warehouses of differing size and complexity, three brands, other intangible assets and goodwill from Hydro's acquisition.\n\nPrecision Tubing covers production plants, marketing and product development on four continents. The operation consists of 10 production plants in South America, Asia, Europe and North America, recognized intangible assets and goodwill from Hydro's acquisition.\n\nThe impairment tests for all of the groups of CGUs described above are cash flow models expressed in nominal terms using forecasts for the first five years based on internal business plans approved by management. Margins, volumes and investments are considered highly correlated, as high margin above the metal value is achieved through production of more complex products, requiring higher cost and/or more expensive equipment. We have thus not considered development in margins, cost and volume separately. Cash flows have been projected as terminal values beyond the fiveyear forecast period with a zero nominal growth assumed. Key assumptions are development in annual net cash flows, comprising volume and cost development in relevant market segments, as well as the discount rate.\n\nThe main assumptions and sensitivities are shown in the tables below. The sensitivities represent a stress test, identifying changes in each parameter which would result in a recoverable amount equal to the carrying amount of the CGU, while keeping all other parameters unchanged. The changed parameter is applied for the entire period, including the terminal value. The decrease in annual cash flows does not represent a reasonably possible scenario developed by Hydro, as changes in the market resulting in significantly reduced cash flows for individual plants or the whole business unit is likely to be mitigated with measures to reduce costs, including sale or closure of production lines or plants similar to what is currently ongoing.\n\n| Amounts in NOK million                         | Extrusion North  America   | Extrusion  Europe   | Building  Systems   | Precision  Tubing   |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Carrying value of goodwill                     | 1,607                      | 824                 | 552                 | 159                 |\n| Carrying value of other assets                 | 7,272                      | 6,757               | 2,749               | 2,446               |\n| Carrying value of CGU                          | 8,879                      | 7,581               | 3,301               | 2,605               |\n| Recoverable amount                             | 14,366                     | 15,244              | 7,786               | 8,474               |\n| Recoverable amount in excess of carrying value | 5,486                      | 7,663               | 4,484               | 5,869               |\n| Key assumptions                                |                            |                     |                     |                     |\n| Terminal value growth                          | 0.0%                       | 0.0%                | 0.0%                | 0.0%                |\n| Discount rate                                  | 10.50%                     | 9.00%               | 9.00%               | 10.25%              |\n| Stress test                                    |                            |                     |                     |                     |\n| Discount rate - % change                       | 61%                        | 91%                 | 149%                | 204%                |\n| Discount rate - % point                        | 16.90%                     | 17.20%              | 22.40%              | 31.10%              |\n| Annual reduction in net cash flow all years    | 38%                        | 50%                 | 58%                 | 69%                 |\n\n## Tests performed in 2022 and 2021\n\nTests for impairment have been performed for all CGUs with mandatory annual tests and the CGUs where impairment indicators have been identified. The recoverable amounts for these units have been determined estimating the Value in Use (VIU) of the asset and/or, if appropriate, its fair value less cost of disposal (FV), and comparing the highest of the two against the carrying value of the CGUs. The calculation of VIU has been based on management's best estimate, reflecting Hydro's business planning process. The discount rates are derived as the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for a similar business in the same business environment, on an over-the business-cycle view, using 10 years government bond rates, a US equity risk premium, credit spreads and country risk premiums. Beta estimates are reviewed from time to time, considering actual Hydro share observations versus different market indices, analysis of selected peers and external views. Credit spreads are based on Hydro's credit spreads, while country risk is based on the premiums published by the Swedish Export Credit Agency EKN. The post-tax rates are converted to pre-tax rates using the nominal tax rates in the relevant countries. For Hydro's businesses the pre-tax nominal discount rate is estimated at between 8 percent and 17 percent (2021: 5.5-15.00 percent). The higher rates are applicable for assets within the Aluminium Metal activities in Brazil, while the lower rates are applicable for assets within Extrusions in Europe.\n\nHydro has incurred the following impairment losses during 2022 and 2021:\n\n| Amounts in NOK million                       | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Classification by asset category             |        |        |\n| Impairment losses                            |        |        |\n| Property, plant and equipment                | 331    | 435    |\n| Other intangible assets                      | 4      | 2      |\n| Total impairment of non-current assets       | 336    | 437    |\n| Impairment loss from discontinued operations |        | 850    |\n| Classification by segment                    |        |        |\n| Impairment losses                            |        |        |\n| Hydro Aluminium Metal                        | 77     | 286    |\n| Hydro Extrusions                             | 258    | 150    |\n| Total impairment of non-current assets       | 336    | 437    |\n\n## Goodwill is allocated to CGUs or groups of CGUs as shown in the following table:\n\n| Amounts in NOK million                     | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Extrusion North America (Hydro Extrusions) | 1,607  | 1,427  |\n| Extrusion Europe (Hydro Extrusions)        | 824    | 779    |\n| Building Systems (Hydro Extrusions)        | 552    | 521    |\n| Precision Tubing (Hydro Extrusions)        | 159    | 147    |\n| Bauxite & Alumina Operations               | 1,963  | 1,612  |\n| Recycling (Hydro Metal Markets)            | 453    | 409    |\n| Total goodwill                             | 5,557  | 4,895  |",

This CGU is tested for impairment using a FV approach based on observed transaction values for power production assets in the Nordic region. The recoverable amount, estimated as a post-tax fair value, exceeds the carrying amount significantly.\n\n## Impairment tests based on indications of loss in value\n\n## Hydro Extrusions\n\nThe CGU Precision Tubing Brazil, consisting of three production facilities, was tested for impairment as of the end of 2022 due to deteriorating financial performance in 2022 and expectations to long-term pressure on profitability in a challenging market situation. The recoverable amount was determined as VIU based on Hydro's internal assumptions for production volumes, financial margins, currency exchange rates and timing of cash flows. The estimated VIU amounted to NOK 193 million using a discount rate of 14.25 percent. The resulting impairment loss amounted to NOK 204 million.\n\nDuring 2022, an impairment loss of NOK 54 million was recognized following an announcement of intended closure and sale of parts of the production facilities at a European plant. The recoverable amount was determined based on estimated selling price.\n\nDuring 2021, some assets related to plants and activities that were sold or closed, mainly in Europe, were written down to estimated selling price, recognizing impairments of NOK 150 million.\n\n## Hydro Aluminium Metal\n\nFor the primary aluminium plant Slovalco, NOK 77 million was recognized as impairment losses in 2022 following the decision to curtail smelter production. The impairment included an adjustment of asset retirement obligations. The carrying values of the assets related to electrolysis are fully impaired as of December 31, 2022. The plant has been regularly tested for impairment over several years, and was last written down by NOK 286 million in 2021.\n\nThe primary aluminium plant Albras was tested for impairment as of the end of 2022 due to high and volatile inflation rates and prices of raw material. In addition, the process of obtaining power contracts to replace current contracts expiring in 2024, exposes the plant to uncertainty regarding future power prices. The recoverable amount exceeded the carrying amount.\n\n## Hydro Bauxite & Alumina\n\nGoodwill in Hydro Bauxite & Alumina is allocated to a CGU consisting of the Alunorte alumina refinery, the main bauxite source Paragominas and certain related activities.\n\nThe recoverable amount has been determined based on a VIU calculation. VIU is estimated at NOK 21.3 billion. The value equals the carrying value of NOK 21.2 billion. The calculation used cash flow forecasts in BRL based on internal plans approved by management covering a five-year period. Production volumes have been assumed at nameplate capacity reflecting the measures taken to mitigate downside risk of production shortfalls, including recent and approved investments in asset integrity. All significant price assumptions are internally derived based on external references, reflecting both price assumption used for planning purposes and updated market observations at year-end. Cash flows have been projected for the following 35 years based on the five-year detailed forecast period using Hydro's long-term assumptions for alumina prices and key raw material prices. Investments to replace equipment with a shorter expected life than the total structure is estimated based on internal plans. The CGU is expected to remain in operation for at least the 40-year period. Improvements expected from certain initiated equipment replacements are included. This includes the ongoing investment facilitating the change in energy supply replacing coal with natural gas at the alumina refinery, Alunorte. Further possible and/or planned improvements are not included in the cash flow forecasts. Cash flows beyond the five-year period are inflated by the expected long-term inflation levels in Brazil and the main western economies.\n\nThe main assumptions to which the test is sensitive are shown in the table below:\n\n|                                                                   | Assumptions   | Assumptions   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                                                   | 2023          | Long-term     |\n| Exchange rate BRL/USD                                             | 5.27          |               |\n| Alumina price, long-term price represent real terms 2022 (USD/mt) | 371           | 355           |\n| Production volume alumina (million mt)                            | 6.25          | 6.35          |\n| Discount rate nominal, pre-tax                                    | 16.25%        | 16.25%        |\n\nSignificant cash flows are denominated in US dollars. These are translated to BRL at a rate of 5.27 for 2023 with a stronger BRL in the period 2024 to 2030, reaching a nominal rate of 5.27 in 2029. For future periods the exchange rate is projected with a rate development reflecting the inflation difference of 1.1 to 1.3 percentage points between international inflation and the higher expected Brazil specific inflation.\n\nThe sensitivities presented below indicates how changes in key parameters impact the recoverable amount. The changed parameter is applied for the entire period, while keeping all other parameters unchanged. The decrease in annual cash flows is reasonably possible, at least for shorter periods. As the key parameters are interdependent, a change in the indicated range would not be expected to continue for the entire period of operation without impacting other parameters. The VIU equals the carrying amount, which indicates that any combination of negative changes to one or more parameter compared to the assumptions in the test without offsetting positive changes would result in a need for impairment writedown of the CGU.\n\n|                                        | Change in assumption   | Value 2023   | VIU in excess of carrying  amount (NOK million)   |\n|----------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| Exchange rate BRL/USD                  | (5%)                   | 5.01         | (6,130)                                           |\n| Alumina price, real term 2022 (USD/mt) | (10)                   | 361          | (4,769)                                           |\n| Cash flow from operating activities    | (5%)                   |              | (1,997)                                           |\n| Discount rate (% point)                | 1%-point               | 17.25%       | (1,649)                                           |",

Future minimum lease payments due under non-cancellable leases are NOK 75 million (2021: NOK 67 million).\n\n## Note 2.6 Leases\n\n## Accounting policies for leases\n\nAt inception of a contract, Hydro assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. Leased assets with a remaining lease period of less than 12 months at inception are excluded from lease accounting. Further, leases of assets of a low value (small asset leases), mainly such items as PCs, office equipment and similar, are excluded from lease accounting. When measuring leases, Hydro include fixed lease payments for extension periods reasonably certain to be used. As a practical expedient, non-lease components are not separated from lease contracts for most asset classes. For production facilities and transportation assets, such as vessels used for transportation of material, the operating cost is a significant non-lease component, and is excluded from lease accounting. Variable lease payments, including service elements related to leases which are fully variable amounts, are recognized as operating expenses in the periods incurred.\n\nRight-of-use assets are included in property, plant and equipment, see note 2.1 Property, plant and equipment. Lease liabilities are included in debt, see note 7.4 Short and long-term debt.\n\n## Significant judgment in accounting for leasing\n\nSignificant judgment is required to determine whether some service contracts conveys the right to control an asset to Hydro, and thus is, or contains, a lease. Hydro has a limited number of such contracts; however, they do exist in some arrangements with service providers for maintenance services, transportation services, and some operational subcontractors. In assessing whether such contracts are leases, Hydro assesses both the share of the supplier's capacity for relevant assets that is available for Hydro as well as how decisions are made.\n\nJudgment is also applied in assessing whether renewal options are reasonably certain to be utilized. In assessing such issues, Hydro considers such factors as the level of operational integration and dependency as well as historic practices for renewals.\n\nFor some contracts where all, or close to all, produced products are purchased by Hydro with no or very limited fixed payments, the contract may be deemed a lease with fully variable payments. Currently, Hydro has no significant such contracts.\n\n## Hydro's leases\n\nHydro uses lease contracts primarily where lease or rental contracts provide operational benefits or flexibility compared to owning assets. Leased land and buildings are used for warehouses, office space and certain other arrangements where the need for such space is of a temporary nature or where land and/or buildings are not available for purchase. This is the case in some countries, and also in co-locations with certain other businesses such as in port areas. Further, Hydro has a lease arrangement for its head office in Oslo, Norway, and certain other office locations where the location is independent of production facilities. Production equipment is leased or rented where the access to the specific assets is combined with significant services, for instance seaborn transport operated by the supplier/lessor. Operational services in combination with leasing of assets is also used for such services as maintenance activities, earth-moving operations, and certain other non-core services. Leasing or rental is in some instances also used for equipment operated by Hydro, often under contracts significantly shorter than the assets' useful life.\n\nHydro determines its incremental borrowing rate by obtaining interest rates from various external financing sources, and makes adjustments for currency and duration to reflect the terms of the lease.",

Special voting rights may extend control beyond what is conveyed through the owners' proportional ownership interest. Such rights may take the form of a specified number of board representatives, the right of refusal for important decisions, or the requirement of a qualified majority for important decisions which effectively results in joint control with the specific ownership situation. Joint ventures are joint arrangement which represents a residual interest in the arrangement rather than an interest in assets and responsibility for liabilities.\n\nAn associate is an equity investment in which Hydro has the ability to exercise significant influence, which is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the entity. Significant influence is assumed to exist when Hydro owns between 20 and 50 percent of the voting rights unless other terms and conditions affect Hydro's influence.\n\nHydro accounts for investments in associates and participation in joint ventures using the equity method. This involves recognizing Hydro's interest based on its proportional share of the entity's equity, including any excess values and goodwill. Hydro recognizes its share of net income, including depreciation and amortization of excess values and any impairment losses, in Share of the profit (loss) in equity accounted investments. Other comprehensive income derived from associates and joint ventures is included in Hydro's Other comprehensive income. Hydro's proportional share of unrealized profits resulting from transactions with associates and joint ventures, including transfer of businesses, is eliminated. Accounting policies used by associates and joint ventures may differ from the accounting policies adopted by Hydro. Differences in recognition or measurement are adjusted for prior to equity accounting.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are tested for impairment when there are indications of a possible loss in value. An impairment loss is recognized if the recoverable amount, estimated as the higher of fair value less cost of disposal or value in use, is below Hydro's carrying value. Impairment losses are reversed if circumstances change and the impairment situation is no longer deemed to exist.\n\nHydro is involved in one associate for which the results of operations is taxable profit or loss for the owners rather than the associate, a tax transparent company. Hydro provides for deferred tax on temporary differences in the associate to the extent such temporary differences are expected to reverse within the foreseeable future, or such reversal is not controlled by Hydro. Deferred tax on other temporary differences is not recognized.\n\nLoans to associates and joint ventures are measured under IFRS 9 Financial instruments. Loans where contractual cash flows are only payments of principal and interest on specific dates are measured at amortized cost with expected credit losses provided for. Other loan arrangements are measured at fair value. Loans and receivables to associates and joint ventures are presented as part of other similar loans to unrelated parties. Income and expenses related to loans are included in finance income and expense.\n\n## Investments in joint operations and jointly owned assets\n\nJoint operations are arrangements under contractually joint control where the joint operators have an interest in the assets; or benefits from the service potential of the assets; as well as have a direct obligation for the liabilities of the joint arrangement. Joint operations can result from the legal form of the arrangement or other facts and circumstances resulting in an interest in the service potential of the asset and obligation for liabilities. Jointly owned assets are arrangements where Hydro and the other partners have a direct ownership in specifically identified assets, but where joint control is not established. Hydro recognizes its share of assets, liabilities, revenues, if any, and expenses of joint operations and jointly owned assets on a line-by-line basis in the group financial statements.\n\n## Note 2.7 Other non-current assets\n\n| Amounts in NOK million                                             | 2022   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Derivative instruments                                             | 1 398  | 490    |\n| Long-term collateral for liabilities                               | 106    | 1 945  |\n| Equity securities at fair value through other comprehensive income | 904    | 989    |\n| Securities at fair value through profit or loss                    | 21     | 14     |\n| Income taxes, VAT and other sales taxes                            | 2 533  | 2 033  |\n| Employee loans                                                     | 12     | 13     |\n| Other receivables                                                  | 622    | 559    |\n| Other non-current assets                                           | 5,596  | 6,045  |",

In assessing whether joint control exists for these arrangements we evaluate the legal framework and contracts governing the arrangement combined with an assessment of which decisions that significantly influence the return from the arrangement. Arrangements owned on a 50/50 basis and/or governed by unanimous decisions constitute the majority of our joint arrangements.\n\nMost of our joint arrangements are joint production facilities supplying metal and other products for Hydro's value chain. Hydro assesses whether joint arrangements are joint operations where Hydro has a direct interest in the assets and direct liability to settle obligations, directly or indirectly, or a joint venture where we have an interest in the net assets of the joint arrangement. In this assessment we evaluate the contracts governing the arrangement and the legal framework for the type of entity in which the arrangement is operated. Hydro is engaged in both joint arrangements that are considered joint ventures, and arrangements that are concluded to be joint operations.\n\n## Hydro's joint operations\n\nOf our joint operations, two are classified as joint operations based on the legal form of the operations. These are Tomago, an aluminium smelter in Australia, and Skafs\u00e5 Kraftverk ANS, a power producer in Norway. The anode producer Aluminium & Chemie Rotterdam B.V., Aluchemie, in the Netherlands, is classified as a joint operation based on contractual arrangements. The operation was closed at the end of 2021 and closure and remediation of the site is ongoing.\n\nTomago and Aluchemie is part of Hydro Aluminium Metal, while Skafs\u00e5 Kraftverk ANS is part of Hydro Energy.\n\n## Hydro's joint ventures\n\nThe following joint venture is considered material for Hydro:\n\nQatar Aluminium Ltd. (Qatalum) is a primary aluminium smelter with a dedicated power plant located in Qatar. Qatalum has an annual production capacity of about 600,000 mt of liquid metal. Qatalum is owned by Hydro and Qatar Aluminium Manufacturing Company Q.P.S.C. (50 percent each). Qatar Energy, previously Qatar Petroleum, controls Qatar Aluminium Manufacturing Company, which is listed on the Qatar Stock Exchange. Qatalum was at the outset granted a ten-year income tax holiday, expiring in 2020. There has been a long period of uncertainty with regards to the applicable tax rate for Qatalum after the expiry of the tax holiday in 2020. It has been Hydro's consistent position that the generally applicable tax rate, currently at 10 percent, should apply to Qatalum after the expiry of the tax holiday. However, the joint venture partners have not been able to agree on a common interpretation of the applicable tax law, and Qatalum filed its 2020 tax return applying a 35 percent tax rate on 30 June 2021. Hydro is pursuing alternative measures to protect its financial interest in this matter.\n\nHydro is committed to sell fixed quantities of alumina and purchase all products from Qatalum at market prices. Purchases of metal from Qatalum amounted to NOK 20,237 million in 2022 and NOK 14,172 million in 2021. Related payables amounted to NOK 2,277 million in 2022 and NOK 1,360 million at the end of 2021. Sales from Hydro to Qatalum amounted to NOK 2,630 million in 2022 and NOK 2,031 million in 2021, primarily alumina. Related receivables amounted to NOK 99 million and NOK 0 million at the end of the periods.\n\nQatalum is part of Hydro Aluminium Metal.\n\n## Hydro's associates\n\nThe following associate is considered material for Hydro:\n\nLyse Kraft DA, a power producer headquartered in Stavanger, operates power plants in the southwest of Norway and holds ownership interests in two arrangements in nearby areas. The company became an associate as of December 31, 2020 when Hydro transferred certain power production assets as a contribution in kind to Lyse Kraft. Hydro owns 25.6 percent of the company, while Lyse AS holds a controlling ownership share of 74.4 percent.\n\nThe annual production of Lyse Kraft DA amounts to about 9.5 TWh, which is contributed in kind to the owners corresponding to ownership share. The owners are responsible for paying all costs in the partnership, both for operating costs and future investments, which for Hydro amounted to expenses of NOK 84 million and related accounts payable of NOK 54 million for the year 2022. Hydro sells or consumes the received power in accordance with its operating needs for power. Hydro is also the operator of the power plants and is compensated for all costs incurred in this respect. Sales of services from Hydro amounted to NOK 289 million and related receivables amounted to NOK 52 million.",

Uncertain outcomes are measured as the expected value of reasonably possible outcomes. Provisions are based on the current legal framework and remediation standards. The provision is measured as the present value of the cash flows estimated to settle the obligation. Expected cash flows are discounted with a risk-free interest rate, usually a government bond rate for the duration to expected settlement.\n\nA contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from a past event, with the resolution of the contingency dependent on uncertain future events, or a present obligation where no outflow is probable. Contingent liabilities are not recognized on the balance sheet, the existence of such contingent liabilities and, if estimable the approximate size, are disclosed unless the possibility of an outflow of economic resources is remote.\n\n## Asset retirement obligations\n\nHydro recognizes liabilities for the estimated fair value of asset retirement obligations (ARO) relating to assets where such obligations exists, in the period incurred in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets. The provision is estimated as the present value of costs relating to the restoration or rehabilitation of industrial or mining sites and/or dismantlement or removal of buildings or other assets. The liability is recognized when an asset is constructed and ready for use or when the obligation is incurred if imposed at a later date. Related asset retirement costs are capitalized and depreciated over the useful life of the asset. Accretion expense is recognized for the change in the present value of the liability and classified as part of Financial expense. Other changes to estimated fair value of ARO are recognized when identified. The increase or reduction to the liability is recognized as an increase or reduction of the value of the asset unless the asset is no longer in use, in which case the change is recognized in operating expenses. Liabilities that are conditional on a future event (e.g. the timing or method of settlement) are recognized when the value of the liability can be reasonably estimated.\n\n## Exit and disposal costs\n\nHydro recognizes a provision in the amount of the direct costs associated with an exit and/or disposal activity when a formal commitment to a detailed exit plan is made and communicated to those affected. A provision for termination benefits to employees is recognized as of the date of notification to individual employees or their representatives.\n\n## Uncertain assets\n\nAssets where the existence of an asset or Hydro's control with the resources is less than virtually certain are contingent assets. Contingent assets are not recognized.\n\nHydro also holds interests in other associates and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method. The most significant interests are part of the business units Hydro Rein and Hydro Batteries, which are parts of Hydro's growth strategy within renewable energy in the segment Hydro Energy.\n\nThe interests held by Hydro Rein consist of entities developing wind and solar power plants, currently in Sweden and Brazil. The projects are under development and further capital contributions are expected before reaching the operational phase. Parts of the future estimated production volume from these projects have been contracted through power purchase agreements at fixed prices with Hydro, both Hydro Energy and units in other segments.\n\nThe batteries business unit in Hydro Energy aims to develop leading sustainable battery businesses in Europe, by investments in the battery value chain. The interests held by Batteries consist of the joint venture Vianode, and the associates Corvus and Hydrovolt. The portfolio includes projects under development that will require further capital contributions as well as technical and commercial development before reaching operational phase.\n\nFor 2022, Hydro has delivered services to these associates and joint ventures amounting to NOK 39 million with a corresponding accounts receivable of NOK 7 million.\n\nThe following table provides a summary of changes in carrying value for Hydro's joint ventures and associates.\n\n| Amounts in NOK million                            | Qatalum   | Other JVs   | Lyse Kraft DA   | Other  associates   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|---------|\n| December 31, 2020                                 | 10,457    | -           | 6,805           | 27                  | 17,288  |\n| Hydro's share of net income (loss)                | 1,507     | (8)         | (64)            | (13)                | 1,422   |\n| Dividends and other payments received by Hydro    | (1,559)   | -           | -               | -                   | (1,559) |\n| Companies acquired/(sold), net                    | -         | 12          | 45              | 454                 | 510     |\n| Amortization                                      | -         | -           | (17)            | -                   | (17)    |\n| Changes elimination of internal gain in inventory | 24        | -           | -               | -                   | 24      |\n| Foreign currency translation and other            | 276       | -           | -               | (2)                 | 274     |\n| December 31, 2021                                 | 10,704    | 4           | 6,768           | 467                 | 17,942  |\n| Hydro's share of net income (loss)                | 1,548     | (49)        | (64)            | (35)                | 1,400   |\n| Dividends and other payments received by Hydro    | (1,237)   | -           | -               | -                   | (1,237) |\n| Companies acquired/(sold), net 1)                 | -         | -           | -               | (145)               | (145)   |\n| Capital increase                                  | -         | 410         | 59              | 1,317               | 1,787   |\n| Amortization                                      | -         | (2)         | (17)            | (20)                | (40)    |\n| Changes elimination of internal gain in inventory | (21)      | -           | -               | -                   | (21)    |\n| Foreign currency translation and other 2)         | 1,444     | -           | 97              | (4)                 | 1,536   |\n| December 31, 2022                                 | 12,438    | 363         | 6,842           | 1,578               | 21,222  |\n\n- 1) A gain of NOK 65 million was recognized in 2022 following the sale of 24% of the ownership share in wind power project Stor-Sk\u00e4lsj\u00f6n.\n- 2) Following a change in legal structure in the associate Lyse Kraft DA, a tax liability was transferred to Hydro consolidated.",

The obligations relate to such actions as remediation, restoration or rehabilitation of industrial or mining sites, disposal of contaminated material and related activities. Hydro has provided for demolition of buildings and installations only where there is a legal or contractual obligation, or a specific decision to demolish, which is the case for few sites. The provision represents the present value of expected outflows at the times of expected payments. There is significant uncertainty both in the timing and amount of these remediation actions, as they are linked to future business decisions as well as decisions and approval by authorities in the jurisdictions we operate. Provisions are based on the current legal framework and standards. Hydro is in the process of assessing whether the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM), issued by ICMM 1 , PRI 2 and UNEP 3 , will require additional effort and costs. Currently, no significant additional obligations have been identified. The GISTM framework may not be fully reflected in the remediation standards used for estimating actions and cost. No significant changes in cost estimates have been identified.\n\nThe most significant provisions relate to the following sites and issues. For Hydro Bauxite & Alumina's mine in Brazil we have obligations to remediate the tailing areas and mining sites, including reforestation of the area and monitoring and maintenance of the site after initial remediation. For Hydro Bauxite & Alumina's alumina refinery in Brazil we have obligations to remediate bauxite residue deposits, including monitoring the contamination levels and other aspects after initial remediation. Some activities related to these obligations are currently performed as integrated processes with ongoing deposit of residues produced in the alumina production. For Hydro Aluminium Metal's closed Kurri Kurri smelter site in Australia we have obligations to remediate certain contaminated areas at the site and have now secured approval for the appropriate long-term containment of historical spent pot lining and certain other waste material. The work is progressing and is expected to be completed early 2024. Once completed, and following a management period of five years, the containment cell will transfer to state ownership. Further, Hydro has provided for various remediation obligations in Hydro Extrusions related to both closed sites, whether previously operated or not, and for some currently active sites. Hydro also has obligations for remediation of contamination on site and in areas related to historic industrial activities, mainly in Germany and Norway, reported in Other and eliminations. The more significant of these sites are the sites in Schwandorf in Germany and the Grenland area in Norway. The GISTM may impact remediation requirements for some of these sites. For many of these provisions, there are no standard remediation methods available and cost is therefore uncertain. The provision also includes remediation of spent pot lining and certain other process related waste in all active smelters, remediation of certain known landfills and removal of limited contaminated material as well as site clearance for certain leased land. Provisions also exist for certain liabilities related to Norwegian power plant concessions to be reverted to the Norwegian Government.\n\nProvisions for employee benefits relate to expected short-term performance bonus payments and short and long-term provisions for expected bonus payments that are based on the number of years of service, primarily for our European operations. Such bonuses are expected to be paid in periods between 10 to 50 years of service, or upon termination of employment.\n\nIndirect taxes include taxes not related to taxable income, such as value added taxes, duties and property taxes. Provision for indirect taxes is mainly related to operations in Brazil.\n\nRationalization and closure cost include provisions in Hydro Extrusions for costs related to plant closures and employee reductions to reduce their footprint in response to challenging market conditions. The provision also includes costs related to the closure of Hydro's joint operation Aluchemie.\n\nOther includes insurance provisions related to insurance contracts issued by Hydro's captive insurance company, Industriforsikring AS, to external parties including associates and joint arrangements, provisions for legal and other disputes, community donations and other contributions committed, certain liabilities related to representation and warranty provisions related to sale of businesses.\n\nHydro has entered into several agreements with authorities at local and state levels in Par\u00e1, Brazil, requiring Hydro to improve operational security and to make additional efforts and investments related to local societies close to the plants and to the social development of communities in Barcarena. The most significant agreements were entered into in 2018 related to the alumina refinery, Alunorte. Total remaining provisions related to these obligations are about NOK 450 million as of December 31, 2022.\n\n## Significant judgment in accounting for contingent assets and liabilities, uncertain assets and liabilities\n\nEvaluation of uncertain liabilities and contingent liabilities and assets requires judgment and assumptions regarding the probability of realization and the timing and amount, or range of amounts, that may ultimately be incurred. Such estimates may vary from the ultimate outcome as a result of differing interpretations of laws and facts.\n\nThe main judgmental assessments falls into two categories; whether a liability exists, and the amount of a possible liability. The existence or non-existence of a liability is a legal and/or factual assessment. The measurement of a possible liability is more challenging for requirements to remediate or rectify alleged wrong-doing than for monetary claims of compensation. In relation to perceived non-compliance with laws and regulations, authorities, nongovernmental organizations, or others may claim that Hydro is responsible for mitigating actions and compensation. The legal basis for such claims as well as cost calculation and other aspects can be difficult to assess.\n\nHydro's industrial and mining activities are subject to a wide range of environmental laws and regulations, including endof-life remediation regulations. The extent of site and off-site contamination, the remediation methods, and requirements that relevant environmental authorities may impose, are uncertain. The long-term use of sites, with increasing awareness of effects of contamination in society, and generally lower acceptance of contamination in communities over time impacts the content of legal standards and the responsibility of companies involved in such activities. Further, changes in remediation methods and requirements and the uncertainty of cost levels for actions to be performed years and decades into the future contribute to the uncertainty in assessing and measuring such obligations. Remediation and closure activities expected to be conducted far into the future are less accurately measured than near-term planned activities. Consequently, there is significant uncertainty inherent in the estimates.\n\nIndirect tax regimes are complex in many jurisdictions and cross-border. Basis for such taxes may differ from actual transaction prices. Tax authorities may challenge Hydro's calculation of taxes and credits from prior periods. Such processes may lead to changes to prior periods' operating or financial expenses to be recognized in the period of change.\n\n## Provisions\n\n| Amounts in NOK million                                         | Short-term   | 2022 Long-term   | Total   | Short-term   | 2021 Long-term   | Total   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------|---------|--------------|------------------|---------|\n| Environmental clean-up and asset  retirement obligations (ARO) | 716          | 3,880            | 4,596   | 535          | 3,670            | 4,205   |\n| Employee benefits                                              | 1,482        | 435              | 1,917   | 1,417        | 387              | 1,804   |\n| Indirect taxes                                                 | 37           | 281              | 318     | 5            | 209              | 215     |\n| Rationalization and closure cost                               | 231          | 48               | 279     | 167          | 45               | 212     |\n| Other                                                          | 540          | 645              | 1,185   | 1,003        | 460              | 1,464   |\n| Total provisions                                               | 3,005        | 5,289            | 8,294   | 3,128        | 4,772            | 7,899   |\n\nThe following table includes a specification of changes to provisions for the year ending December 31, 2022.\n\n| Amounts in NOK million                                   | Environmental  clean-up and ARO   | Employee  benefits   | Indirect taxes   | Rationalization  and closure cost   | Other   | Total   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Specification of change in  provisions                   |                                   |                      |                  |                                     |         |         |\n| December 31, 2021                                        | 4,205                             | 1,804                | 215              | 212                                 | 1,464   | 7,899   |\n| Additions and effect of change in  discount rate         | 348                               | 1,855                | 63               | 126                                 | 623     | 3,015   |\n| Used during the year                                     | (472)                             | (1,700)              | (17)             | (56)                                | (876)   | (3,121) |\n| Reversal of unused provisions                            | (55)                              | (134)                | -                | (13)                                | (252)   | (454)   |\n| Accretion expense and effect of  change in discount rate | 154                               | 5                    | 10               | -                                   | 28      | 197     |\n| Foreign currency translation                             | 416                               | 87                   | 48               | 10                                  | 198     | 759     |\n| December 31, 2022                                        | 4,596                             | 1,917                | 318              | 279                                 | 1,185   | 8,294   |",

Where Hydro considers an obligation to be possible, i.e. not probable yet not remote, it is disclosed as a contingent liability.\n\nHydro is involved in a significant number of tax cases related to various types of taxes. Hydro's businesses in Brazil have a large portfolio of cases disputed by tax authorities, of which the majority relates to indirect taxes. Disputes include cases in the administrative and legal dispute systems with various background and risk of loss. In total known cases amount to about NOK 4 billion, of which losses are considered possible in cases amounting to about NOK 3.3 billion. A significant share of those amounts is covered by tax indemnifications from acquisition. The final outcome of these cases is not expected until several years into the future, and is highly uncertain. Additional cases may be raised by tax authorities based on tax declarations for periods not yet assessed, or when interpretation of tax regulations change. Hydro has provided for individual tax cases where the risk of loss is considered above 50 percent. Provisions for indirect taxes are included in provisions disclosed above, while provisions for income tax expenses are included in Taxes payable.\n\nHydro has environmental liabilities related to several sites and issues. Where remediation is acknowledged as Hydro's responsibility or a legal obligation is deemed to exist, a provision for the best estimate of costs to be incurred is established. For many of our industrial sites, in particular sites where operation is expected to continue indefinitely, remediation costs are difficult to assess. The precise need for remediation actions, their method, timing and cost has not yet been planned, and hence the cost is uncertain. For some impacted areas it is not yet known whether remediation will be required. This may depend on the pace of any natural attenuation, and development in what the environmental authorities judge to be reasonable remediation requirements. For some areas, the exact extent of pollution may be uncertain. If an environmental risk assessment has concluded that the current risk is acceptable, a detailed sampling program may not have been carried out. Obligations for historic contamination of sites and surrounding areas in addition to areas provided for may be identified and deemed Hydro's responsibility in the future, whether related to currently owned or used sites, or sites we previously have owned and/or used. The cost of remediation of any additional contamination deemed Hydro's responsibility is uncertain.\n\nAuthorities and non-governmental organizations have filed several lawsuits related to the Alunorte incident, claiming a combination of mitigating actions and financial compensation. The argumentation, cost calculation and legal basis for these claims is still highly uncertain. Further claims may still be received. Given the limited information about claimed physical and moral damages to be compensated, and the extent and cost of mitigating actions claimed, or the extent or content of other potential claims and lawsuits, it is not possible at this time to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential future exposure for Hydro. It is further not possible to estimate the timing of when such claims may be determined or when any payments may arise.\n\nHydro is also exposed to increased product warranty and product liability responsibilities, both as result of contractual commitments and caused by liability under background law. Product warranty and product liability may impose significant costs depending amongst other things on the application of the product sold. Similarly, disputes over whether failure to deliver products under contract are related to force majeure or not occur from time to time, both for Hydro's delivery obligations and rights. Such disputes may involve significant amounts and outcomes may be difficult to assess.\n\nHydro is exposed to legal cases based on contractual or other basis, including related to contract delivery or purchase obligations or warranties and representations given in relation to sale of businesses. Where a payment is probable, a provision for the likely amount is recognized.",

Sale of energy from other segments represent excess energy purchased under contracts exceeding the operational needs, and relate to periodic maintenance stops or curtailment. Revenue from sale of energy includes the revenue from sale of concession power, a legal requirement to deliver a certain part of volume produced in Norway to local authorities at a reduced price. Revenue from concession power amounted to NOK 77 million and NOK 70 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nRealized and unrealized changes in fair value of commodity derivatives are also presented as part of revenue. These amounts are measured at fair value as required by IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. The instruments are mainly aluminium and power contracts used for risk management purposes, and are included in Other revenue in the table below.\n\nHydro's revenue divided by segment and geographic location of the customer is shown in note 1.4 Operating and geographic segment information. Revenue divided by product type for the main product groups sold are as follows:\n\n| Amounts in NOK million                      | 2022    | 2021    |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Standard ingots                             | 19,824  | 14,207  |\n| Extrusion ingots                            | 37,293  | 28,837  |\n| Foundry alloys                              | 15,957  | 12,496  |\n| Sheet ingots                                | 8,838   | 5,694   |\n| Other casthouse products                    | 6,534   | 5,676   |\n| Extruded profiles                           | 71,676  | 53,665  |\n| Building system products                    | 10,744  | 9,039   |\n| Precision tubing products                   | 5,132   | 3,927   |\n| Alumina                                     | 20,315  | 15,372  |\n| Power                                       | 4,744   | 2,731   |\n| Other goods and services 1)                 | 4,731   | 4,679   |\n| Total revenue from contracts with customers | 205,789 | 156,322 |\n| Other revenue 2)                            | 2,140   | (6,668) |\n| Total revenue                               | 207,929 | 149,654 |\n\n- 1) Includes sale of bauxite, revenue from allocated freight and conversion services for customers' scrap\n\n## Significant judgment in accounting for revenue\n\nThe significant judgment in applying IFRS 15 for Hydro is related to which contracts that qualify for recognition over time, versus recognition at a point in time; at delivery to customer.\n\nHydro's main performance obligations can be described as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 sale of products, produced independent of customer orders\n- \u00b7 sale of products, produced to customer order\n- \u00b7 sale of products made to customer specifications and order\n- \u00b7 sale of electricity\n\nFor products which are not made to the customer's specification, performance obligations are either the individual product, the delivery in total, or an agreed volume of products delivered in more than one delivery. Contracts covering a fixed, committed volume at fixed or determinable prices are relevant for this assessment. Delivery period for such contracts can cover a period of a few weeks, and up to one year. Some few contracts cover more than one year. Prices are usually a combination of fixed elements and market references such as the aluminium price at the London Metal Exchange or other market references, at, or prior to, delivery. Revenue related to products that are not made to the customers' specification is recognized at delivery of products to customers. Such contracts accounts for the majority of sales in the segments Hydro Bauxite & Alumina, Hydro Aluminium Metal and Hydro Metal Markets, and a significant share of sales in Hydro Extrusions. Some of these contracts include an element of freight services, which is considered a separate performance obligation under IFRS 15, and related revenue is recognized over the time of journey.\n\nFor products made to customer specifications and orders, we have assessed whether the finished product has an alternative use to Hydro, and whether Hydro at all times has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date. For contracts where both of these conditions are fulfilled, revenue shall be recognized over time from commencement of production of the specialized product until completion of delivery to the customer. For Hydro's products, the alternative use of customer designed products would, in most cases, be as an input to the production of other products rather than for sale of the product unchanged. We have assessed whether Hydro has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, including a reasonable margin, throughout the production period. The assessment is primarily related to the segment Hydro Extrusions. The main assessment is related to which compensation Hydro would be entitled to in a situation where firm orders are canceled or amended by the customer. Our conclusion is that for close to all contracts we do not have an enforceable right to payment as described in IFRS 15, and revenue is thus recognized at a point in time. However, as our conclusions depends both on legal assessment of a large number of contracts in many countries, and on the understanding of what constitutes an enforceable right to payment under IFRS 15, we might reach a different conclusion in the future for some contracts, or for new contracts covering similar products and customer segments entered into in the future. Also for these contracts, prices are fixed at the time of delivery.\n\n## Payment and warranty terms\n\nPayment terms for products vary between customer segments and regions. The predominant terms vary between 30 to 90 days, and up to 210 days in some markets.\n\nHydro's warranty terms vary by product and business segment. Generally, Hydro provides warranty that product complies with specification, and offer repair, replacement or refund of consideration paid for breaches. Such warranties are limited in time, for most products not exceeding 12 months. Individual contracts may include more extensive warranty clauses where Hydro takes responsibility also for some consequential damages, mainly related to more complex products such as certain automotive parts. Warranty liability is to some degree influenced by legal requirements, which may extend the time period for Hydro's liability.",

See note 8.3 Derivative instruments and hedge accounting.\n\n## Note 5.2 Other income\n\n## Accounting policies for Other income, net\n\nTransactions resulting in income from activities other than normal production and sales operations are classified as Other income, net. This includes gains and losses resulting from the disposal of PP&E and intangible assets, investments in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures as well as government grants, insurance compensation, and rental revenue.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognized in accordance with IAS 20 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance. Grants are recognized when there is a reasonable assurance that Hydro will comply with relevant conditions and that the grants will be received. Government grants are deferred in Other non-current liabilities until the associated activity is performed or expenses recognized. Investment grants are recognized over the period the associated asset is depreciated. All government grants are recognized in Other income, net. Investment grants are included in Investing activities in the statement of cash flows.\n\n## Significant judgment in accounting for government grants\n\nGovernment grants are to varying degree governed by objectively determinable terms. For some government grants, such as the CO2 compensation scheme in Norway, the framework for receiving grants is determined in firm regulations, while the actual aid intensity is politically determined as part of the state budget for the year of payment, which is determined at the end of the year of earning. Hydro estimates the grant to be received for interim periods with updates to the estimates as new information becomes available. Similar mechanisms exist for other grants, for some not concluded at the end of the year of earning. None of these other grant programs are material to Hydro for 2022 or 2021.\n\n| Amounts in NOK million                                                 | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Gain on sale of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets    | 117    | 278    |\n| Net gain (loss) on sale of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures | 131    | 78     |\n| Government grants 1)                                                   | 3,207  | 934    |\n| Insurance compensation                                                 | 659    | 521    |\n| Other                                                                  | 292    | 407    |\n| Other income, net                                                      | 4,406  | 2,219  |\n\n- 1) Government grants includes CO2 compensation and investment grants related to Hydro's pilot facility on Karm\u00f8y.\n\n## CO2 compensation regime in Norway\n\nHydro is entitled to apply for compensation for indirect costs associated with CO2 emittance. The compensation scheme in Norway for the period 2021 to 2030 has been formed and implemented during the period from early 2021 through 2022. Hydro earns compensation during the year of consumption of electricity to produce aluminium. The compensation level is approved by the Norwegian Parliament at the end of the year of earning. The precise amount is approved and paid in the following year. Hydro recognizes estimated entitled CO2 compensation as earned based on the approved regulation and expected compensation level, for sold products. During 2021, Hydro recognized about NOK 650 million for aluminium produced and sold during 2021. During 2022, Hydro recognized about NOK 900 million for aluminium sold in 2021, which is now received. For 2022 Hydro has recognized expected, not approved CO2 compensation of about NOK 2,100 million for aluminium sold in 2022.",

Individual accounts are assessed for impairment taking into consideration indicators of financial difficulty and management assessment. Portfolios of trade receivables where expected losses are more than insignificant are reduced for those expected losses. Discounting generally does not have a material effect on trade receivables, however, in special cases discounting may be applied. Hydro's business model for most trade receivable is to hold the receivables to collect the contractual cash flows. For some portfolios of trade receivables, factoring is applied.\n\n## Significant judgment in accounting for receivables\n\nIn some jurisdictions, including Brazil, significant tax credit amounts are generated for use against future indirect and/ or income tax payments. Repayment in cash is made subject to a set of conditions, including availability of funds at the tax authorities, and cannot be expected on a regular basis. The value of such credits depends on future generation of taxes. Economic conditions and tax regulations may change and lead to a different conclusion regarding recoverability.\n\n| Amounts in NOK million      | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Trade receivables           | 18,154 | 17,350 |\n| VAT and other sales taxes   | 1,585  | 726    |\n| Other current receivables   | 4,687  | 2,891  |\n| Allowance for credit losses | (439)  | (388)  |\n| Trade and other receivables | 23,988 | 20,579 |\n\nOf total trade receivables at year end 2022, about 9 percent were past due, with the majority within 30 days.

Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs of completion and selling costs. Inventory cost includes direct materials, direct labor and a portion of production overhead (manufactured goods) or the purchase price of the inventory. Abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted materials are recognized as expense in the current period. Inventory write-downs to net realizable value occurs when the cost of the inventory is not recoverable, and is reversed in later periods if there is clear evidence of an increase in the net realizable value.\n\n| Amounts in NOK million        | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Spare parts and raw materials | 10,521 | 6,896  |\n| Work in progress              | 3,857  | 2,624  |\n| Alumina                       | 1,888  | 1,883  |\n| Aluminium casthouse products  | 10,426 | 7,250  |\n| Fabricated products           | 3,343  | 3,139  |\n| Inventories                   | 30,035 | 21,791 |\n\nRaw materials include purchased raw materials such as bauxite, caustic soda, oil, coal and other input factors used in the production; however, excluding alumina and aluminium intended for use in Hydro's production of other products.

Hydro targets, over the business cycle, a ratio of average Adjusted net cash (debt) to adjusted EBITDA below 2. Historically, weak cash generation has been the main challenge for Hydro and the aluminium industry in general. Given historical industry cyclicality, this means that the ratio will be well below 2x in the stronger parts of the cycle, to be able to absorb the impact from industry cycle downturns and maintain financial flexibility in periods of adverse market conditions. As a result, capital structure has not represented a credit constraint. In 2022 Hydro introduced a target for Adjusted net debt of around NOK 25 billion over-the-cycle, as a supporting measure on capital structure. At year-end, the Adjusted net debt level will normally be below this target in anticipation of coming dividend payment. Hydro continuously evaluates the efficiency of the capital structure and takes this into account when proposing shareholder distribution.\n\nNet cash (debt) is defined as Hydro's cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments and cash collateral for longterm liabilities, less short- and long-term interest-bearing debt. Adjusted net cash (debt) excludes cash positions regarded as unavailable for servicing debt, and adds other obligations which are considered debt-like in nature.\n\nHydro considers the definition of Net cash (debt) to be a relevant metric for valuation purposes, while the Adjusted net cash (debt) definition is a better indicator of Hydro's financial position at the balance sheet date.\n\nThe tables below present the calculation of Net cash (debt), Adjusted net cash (debt) and the Adjusted net cash (debt) to adjusted EBITDA ratio.\n\n## Section 7 - Capital management and cash management\n\n## Note 7.1 Capital management\n\nHydro's capital management policy is to maximize value creation over time, while maintaining a strong financial position, an investment grade credit rating, and strong liquidity. During 2022 net cash provided by operating activities exceeded net cash used in investing activities plus dividends paid.\n\n## Credit rating\n\nTo secure access to capital markets at attractive terms and remain financially solid, Hydro aims to maintain an investment grade credit rating from the leading agencies, S&P Global (current rating BBB, stable outlook) and Moody's (current rating Baa3, stable outlook). Hydro's key targets for financial solidity are described below.\n\n## Funding and liquidity\n\nHydro manages its funding requirements centrally to cover group operating requirements and long-term capital needs. Hydro has an ambition to access national and international capital markets as primary sources for external long-term funding.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, Hydro held NOK 29.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, NOK 0.8 billion were held as time deposits, classified as short-term investments. These instruments are managed as part of Hydro's liquidity management, aiming to optimize the return on cash positions. Hydro's policy is that the maturity of such positions shall be shorter than 12 months. Time deposits are normally available at shorter notice, subject to bank approval and potential break costs. Hydro has a syndicated USD 1,600 million revolving credit facility maturing in December 2026, including a USD 1,500 million swingline as a sub-facility to cover short-term liquidity needs. In 2022 Hydro established an additional syndicated revolving credit facility of USD 1,300 million to support potential short-term liquidity needs. The facility has an initial 12-month tenor and can be extended two times six months at Hydro's option. Both facilities were undrawn per year-end 2022. In addition, Hydro has access to overdraft facilities and liquidity lines which provide additional short-term liquidity.\n\n## Funding of subsidiaries, associates and jointly controlled entities\n\nNormally the parent company, Norsk Hydro ASA, extends loans or equity to fully-owned subsidiaries to fund capital requirements. All financing is executed on an arm's length basis. To the extent Hydro offers loans to part-owned subsidiaries and investments in associates and joint arrangements, the policy is to participate according to Hydro's ownership share, on equal terms with the other owners. Project financing is used for certain funding requirements mainly to mitigate risk while also considering partnership and other relevant factors.\n\nTrade finance products such as factoring and reverse factoring are used to some extent by subsidiaries, mainly to facilitate risk mitigation in specific trade relations or markets. Hydro has internal guidelines limiting the use of such instruments to where it adds commercial value, as these instruments should not be used as a source for funding. Hydro has set a total limit for such arrangements including any type of sales of receivables. The limit is currently NOK 3.6 billion but was not fully utilized at year-end.\n\n## Shareholder return\n\nLong-term return to shareholders should reflect the value created by Hydro, and consists of dividends and share price development. Hydro aims to provide its shareholders with a competitive return compared with alternative investments in similar companies. Hydro's ambition is, in the long term, to pay out, on average, minimum 50 percent of adjusted net income as ordinary dividend over the cycle, with a dividend floor of NOK 1.25 per share. Dividends for a particular year are based on expected future earnings and cash flow, future investment opportunities, the outlook for world markets and Hydro's current financial position. Share buybacks or extraordinary dividends may be used to supplement ordinary dividends during periods of strong financial results after considering the status of the business cycle and capital requirements for future growth.",

Hydro recognizes cash received when amounts are available on Hydro's bank account. Similarly Hydro recognizes cash payments to settle liabilities when the payment is initiated by Hydro and the amount paid is no longer available.\n\n## Liquidity management\n\nHydro manages its liquidity requirements centrally to cover group operating requirements. Hydro operates cash pools in several currencies where wholly owned subsidiaries participate, to the extent permitted by country legislation. Such cash pool arrangements facilitate netting of cash positions within the group, thereby reducing the requirement for external financing, and centralizing management of aggregated positions. At the end of 2022, NOK 8.0 billion of Hydro's cash position of NOK 29.8 billion was outside such group arrangements, mainly in Brazil and Slovakia.\n\n## Note 7.3 Short-term investments\n\n| Amounts in NOK million        | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Equity securities             | 335    | 1,749  |\n| Debt securities               | 637    | 655    |\n| Time deposits 1)              | 750    | 1,000  |\n| Collateral accounts and other | 2,451  | 3,359  |\n| Total short-term investments  | 4,173  | 6,763  |\n\n- 1) Time deposits in banks with a maturity of three months or more at inception.

The authorization applies from September 20, 2022, until September 20, 2023. The repurchased shares are to be used for cancellation through capital reduction. The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries has agreed to participate in a redemption of a proportional number of shares in order to leave its ownership interest unchanged. Including the share redemption, a total of 100,000,000 shares may be cancelled.

The Annual General Meeting considers this proposal, normally in May, and the approved dividend is then paid to the shareholders. Dividends are usually paid once each calendar year, generally occurring in May. In 2022 there have been two dividend payments. Dividend of NOK 5.40 per share was approved by the Annual General Meeting and paid in May, and an additional dividend of NOK 1.45 per share was approved by the Extraordinary General Meeting and paid in September. For non-Norwegian shareholders, Norwegian withholding tax will be deducted at source in accordance with the applicable Norwegian tax regulations.\n\nFor fiscal year 2022 the Board of Directors has proposed a dividend of NOK 5.65 per share to be paid in May 2023. The Annual General Meeting, scheduled to be held May 10, 2023, will consider this dividend proposal. If approved, this would be a total dividend of approximately NOK 11.540 million. In accordance with IFRS, the fiscal year 2022 proposed dividend is not recognized as a liability in the 2022 financial statements.\n\nDividends declared and paid in 2022 and 2021 for the prior fiscal year, respectively, are as follows:\n\n|                                   | Paid in 2022 for fiscal year 2021   | Paid in 2021 for fiscal year 2020   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Dividend per share paid, NOK      | 6.85                                | 1.25                                |\n| Total dividends paid, NOK million | 14,060                              | 2,564                               |\n| Date proposed                     | February 21 and July 21, 2022       | February 11, 2021                   |\n| Date approved                     | May 10 and September 20, 2022       | May 6, 2021                         |\n| Dividend payment date             | May 20 and September 30, 2022       | May 19, 2021                        |\n\nDividends to non-controlling shareholders in Hydro's subsidiaries are reported as dividends in Consolidated statements of changes in equity.\n\n## Change in Other components of equity\n\nThe table below specifies the changes in Other components of equity for 2022 and 2021.\n\n| Amounts in NOK million                                                                       | 2022     | 2021     |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Items that will not be reclassified to income statement:                                     |          |          |\n| Remeasurement postemployment benefits                                                        |          |          |\n| January 1                                                                                    | 2,697    | (1,314)  |\n| Remeasurement postemployment benefits during the year                                        | 968      | 2,811    |\n| Deferred tax offset                                                                          | (184)    | (435)    |\n| Reclassified to retained earnings on divestment of subsidiaries                              | -

Prices for raw materials and energy are to a limited extent linked to, or correlated with, the aluminium price. Hydro enters into derivative forward sale contracts both on the LME and with banks to secure prices on parts of the planned aluminium production as part of securing a margin level for periods up to about three years combined with locking in prices for a part of raw materials through fixed-price sourcing contracts or derivatives when considered beneficial, whether based on the market situation or to secure cash flow for specific projects.\n\nHydro's sales of primary aluminium and aluminium casthouse products include a premium above the quoted price on LME. The pricing of these premiums can be volatile, and is related to physical demand and supply, with regional and product-related differences. There are limited possibilities for hedging future premiums, except for standard ingot premiums, for which a forward market exists. Hydro has from time to time entered into contracts for standard ingot premiums to mitigate risk in sales contracts.\n\n## Bauxite and alumina\n\nHydro's production of alumina normally exceeds the alumina consumption in its primary aluminium production. In addition, Hydro has long-term agreements to purchase alumina from third parties. The majority of purchase and sale contracts are priced with reference to alumina spot price indexes, however, some long-term contracts with links to the aluminium price on LME exists. Prices for aluminium and alumina have historically been correlated over longer periods, however, price development may differ significantly short term. Alumina forward markets are considered to have limited liquidity.\n\nHydro is a producer and consumer of bauxite. Hydro's need for bauxite is secured through own production as well as by long-term contracts. The purchasing contracts have links to the LME aluminium price and to the alumina spot price development with a certain time-lag.\n\n## Energy\n\nEnergy Hydro is a large consumer of energy in several countries. Energy is consumed as electrical power, natural gas, fuel oil and coal, with power as the main energy carrier. Hydro also has significant power production in Norway. Hydro's power consumption is mainly secured through long-term contracts with power suppliers, including project companies with a limited production portfolio, and through Hydro's own production. Energy production and prices are to an increasing degree volatile, both from the increased volume of renewable energy from solar and wind for which available volume fluctuates with weather conditions, from initiatives to reduce CO 2 emissions through market mechanisms such as cap-andtrade schemes and other regulatory initiatives, as well as the energy shortage in Europe caused by the Ukraine war and related market constrains.\n\nHydro's own electricity production is influenced by hydrological conditions which can vary significantly, and where production short-term is managed to match physical need and market prices. The net power position in Norway is balanced out in the Nordic power market through hourly sales and purchases.\n\nHydro is engaged in development projects for new renewable energy, mainly solar and wind power projects in Brazil and Scandinavia. These projects, which for the main part will commence production during 2023 and later years, are intended partly as energy supply to Hydro's production facilities, and partly for sale to others.\n\nHydro also uses fossil energy carriers, mainly fuel oil and coal in the alumina refinery Alunorte and natural gas for casthouses and other industrial processes. The use of fuel oil and coal is expected to be significantly reduced and replaced with natural gas and electricity towards 2025.\n\nIn order to manage risks related to price and volume fluctuations, Hydro utilizes mainly physical contracts securing purchase of power at fixed prices or with relevant price links, for some contracts to the aluminium price. Fossil fuels are mainly purchased on contracts with a duration of up to four years or contracts priced to observable market prices. Physical sourcing contracts are supplemented with derivatives such as future contracts, forwards and options. Hydro also participates in trading activities within strict volume and risk limits.\n\n## Foreign currency risk exposure\n\nThe prices of Hydro's upstream products bauxite, alumina and primary aluminium, are mainly denominated in US dollars, while sale of mid- and downstream products are mainly priced in US dollars and Euro. Further, the prices of major raw materials used in Hydro's production processes are quoted in US dollars in the international commodity markets, while power is predominantly priced in Euro in Europe, including Norway. Hydro also incurs significant local costs related to the production, distribution and marketing of products in a number of different currencies, mainly Norwegian Krone, Brazilian Real, Euro and US dollar. Hydro's primary operational foreign currency risk is consequently linked to fluctuations in the value of the US dollar and Euro, and in these currencies versus the currencies in which significant costs are incurred. In\n\n## Section 8 - Financial risk and financial instruments\n\n## Note 8.1 Financial and commercial risk management\n\nHydro is exposed to market risks related to the prices of products produced and sold, and the input factors purchased and used, as well as currency risk. Risks may differ short-term and long-term. Short-term risks are to a large extent related to global and regional market volatility. Longer term risks are also impacted by megatrends such as the green shift and relative competition strength for countries and regions.\n\nHydro's products, both aluminium and renewable energy, are important for the green shift. With CO2 intensity well below the industry average and aluminium products with low emissions attracting a premium above generic metal prices we believe we have a competitive advantage. To retain and improve this advantage, we are dependent on succeeding in planned initiatives to further reduce CO2 intensity in our products, such as developing new technology and sourcing sufficient renewable energy. Further, continued market preference for low carbon aluminium will benefit Hydro. Changes in regulatory conditions, such as global or regional carbon prices will impact the competitive landscape. Depending on how and where such carbon prices are introduced, Hydro may benefit from changes, while it is also a risk that some of the plants will experience cost disadvantages during the transition period.\n\nShort- and medium-term price risks are managed based on the margin between sales prices and cost of raw materials and energy cost. Margin risks are managed partly at segment level and partly combined for the group.\n\nHydro's main strategy for managing volatility in the markets is to maintain strong liquidity, a strong balance sheet and an investment grade credit rating. In addition, a combination of financial and physical contracts, including derivatives, is used to manage margin risk.\n\nHydro's sales contracts mainly cover periods for up to one year, supplemented with frame arrangements that can cover several years. Prices are usually determined with reference to observed market prices or fixed, negotiated prices determined no more than one year prior to delivery. Raw materials are purchased with prices fixed for periods varying between a few months up to three years. Some key raw materials, including bauxite and alumina, is purchased under long-term contracts with prices linked to observable market prices. Energy, in particular electricity for use in aluminium smelters, is purchased at long-term contracts with duration up to 20 years, mainly at fixed prices. Energy for other production facilities, including natural gas, fuel oil and coal, is purchased under contracts where prices are fixed for shorter intervals. Hydro secures access to most key input factors through contracts covering at least four months, for many raw materials longer periods. Price risks for raw materials and energy are managed mainly through price clauses in the relevant contracts, supplemented with derivatives where considered beneficial. The main purpose is to manage risks related to market volatility in a period of up to four years.\n\nPrices for products sold and raw material and energy are denominated in various currencies which exposes Hydro to currency risk. Where production margin is subject to significant currency risks, and such risks are not offset across the group, currency derivatives are to some extent used to mitigate unwanted risks.\n\n## Commodity price risk exposure\n\n## Aluminium\n\nRegional market-places for aluminium sold as standard ingot exists several places. London Metal Exchange (LME) is the most important to Hydro, and is the point of reference in many contracts, both for sale and purchase of products and for derivatives. Hydro produces and recycles aluminium, which is partly sold as casthouse products and partly consumed in production of upgraded industrial products in Hydro Extrusions. Hydro also purchases aluminium for use in Extrusions and for recycling. Hydro engages in limited trading activities to optimize capacity utilization, reduce logistical costs and strengthen the market positions, in addition to some speculative trading activities within strict volume and risk limits.\n\nShort-term price risk for aluminium relates to time difference in pricing of purchases of aluminium for use in production of upgraded product or for resale, compared to sale of aluminium. Hydro enters into aluminium future contracts on LME with a maturity of mainly one to three months to mitigate unwanted price risk short term. The main purpose is to achieve an average LME aluminium price on smelter production. In addition, Hydro seeks to mitigate timing risk in the pricing patterns for sale of upgraded products, purchase of aluminium for recycling, and purchase of third-party products (back-to-back hedging). Hydro manages these exposures on a portfolio basis, taking derivative positions based upon net exposures.",

General investment frames are excluded from these amounts.\n\nAn overview of estimated gross cash flows from derivatives accounted for as liabilities and assets is presented below. Many of these assets and liabilities are offset by cash flows from contracts not accounted for as derivatives.\n\nRisk of significant cash payments or margin calls related to derivative instruments is managed within set volume limits, value-at-risk and tenor limits for relevant activities.\n\naddition, Hydro's results and equity are influenced by value changes for the functional currencies of the individual entities and the Norwegian Krone as the Group's presentation currency.\n\nTo mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, long-term debt is mainly maintained in currencies reflecting underlying exposures, liquidity management and cash generation, while considering attractiveness in main financial markets. To reduce the effects of fluctuations in the US dollar and other exchange rates, Hydro also uses foreign currency swaps and forward currency contracts. Commodity derivatives are entered into in various currencies, mainly US dollar, Euro and Norwegian Krone, to reflect currency exposures in the relevant unit.\n\n## Foreign currency risk exposure in receivables, payables and loans\n\nShort-term receivables and payables are often held in currencies other than the functional currency of the unit, predominantly in US dollars and Euro. Borrowings and deposits may be denominated in other currencies than the functional currency of the unit. The majority of exposure in financing arrangements exists in the parent company in Norway and in the part-owned subsidiaries, mainly in Brazil.\n\nEmbedded currency derivatives in non-financial contracts, including the Euro priced electricity contracts in Norway, contains a currency exposure which is separately recognized.\n\n## Interest rate exposure\n\nHydro is exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily as a result of financing its business operations and managing its liquidity in different currencies. Cash and other liquid resources, as well as debt, are currently mainly held in Norwegian Krone, Euro, US dollars and Brazilian real, and carries short-term interest rates.\n\nFinancial instruments and provisions are also exposed to changes in interest rates in connection with valuation and discounting of positions to present value.\n\n## Credit risk management\n\nHydro manages credit risk by setting counterparty risk limits and establishing procedures for monitoring exposures and timely settlement of customer accounts. Credit risk is further limited through use of credit insurance, and, in some markets, sale of receivables to banks. Prepayments or guarantees are required where credit risk is outside the limits set for the relevant counterpart. Hydro is also monitoring the financial performance of key suppliers in order to reduce the risk of default on operations and key projects, and keep in constructive dialogues with relevant contract parties. Our overall credit risk exposure is reduced due to a diversified customer base representing various industries and geographic areas. Enforceable netting agreements, guarantees, and credit insurance, also contribute to a lower credit risk.\n\nCredit risk arising from derivatives is generally limited to net exposures. Exposure limits are established for financial institutions relating to current accounts, deposits and other obligations. Credit risk related to commodity derivatives is limited by settlement through commodity exchanges such as the London Metal Exchange, Nasdaq OMX, Intercontinental Exchange, and banks, and through margin arrangements. Current counterparty risk related to the use of derivative instruments and financial operations is considered moderate.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nVolatile commodity prices and exchange rates as well as fluctuating business volumes and inventory levels can have a substantial effect on Hydro's cash positions and borrowing requirements.\n\nMargin calls for derivative contracts increased during 2021 from the increased use of such instruments. The risk is managed at group level to balance the commodity price risk and liquidity risk, and secure that sufficient funding to meet contractual obligations are available.\n\nTo fund cash deficits of a more permanent nature Hydro will normally raise equity, long-term bond or bank debt in available markets as described in note 7.1 Capital management . Some suppliers have access to supply chain finance facilities, which allows those suppliers to benefit from Hydro's credit profile. The use of such products is limited and does not extend Hydro's credit period beyond normal commercial terms. Further, all other financial liabilities, such as trade payables, with the exception of derivatives, have a final maturity date within one year.",

Financial assets include financial derivatives and commodity derivative contracts, receivables and equity interests, as well as financial instruments used for cash-flow hedges.\n\nFinancial assets are recognized in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at amortized cost, at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Classification depends on the contractual terms, the business model and, for some instruments, the company's choice. Financial assets are derecognized when the rights to receive cash from the asset have expired or when Hydro has transferred the asset.\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nTrade receivables are initially recognized at transaction price, subsequently accounted for at amortized cost and are reviewed for impairment on an ongoing basis. Individual accounts are assessed for impairment taking into consideration indicators of financial difficulty and management assessment. Portfolios of trade receivable where expected losses are more than insignificant are reduced for those expected losses. Discounting generally does not have a material effect on accounts receivable, however, in special cases discounting may be applied. Hydro's business model for most trade receivable is to hold the receivables to collect the contractual cash flows. For some portfolios of trade receivables, factoring is applied.\n\n## Debt instruments\n\nDebt instruments other than trade receivables include bank deposits and all other monetary instruments with a maturity above three months at the date of purchase, investments in debt securities, and certain other receivables. These instruments are measured at amortized cost, with the exception of instruments where cash flows are not contractually fixed and/or consists of other elements in addition to interest and repayments; and thus required to be measured at FVTPL.\n\nShort-term debt instruments are included in Short-term investments. Long-term debt instruments are included in Other non-current assets.\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nHydro's portfolio of trading securities is measured at FVTPL and included in Short-term investments. Other equity investments in companies that are not consolidated or accounted for using the equity method are classified as either FVTPL or FVOCI on an individual investment basis. Hydro classifies investments in other entities with strategic or operational purposes, such as getting access to raw materials or in other ways cooperating with those entities, primarily as FVOCI, as Hydro considers this classification to be more relevant. Any dividend received from such investment is recognized in Finance income. On disposal of these investments, no gain or loss will be recognized in the income statement, however, any related accumulated value change will be reclassified from Other components of equity to Retained earnings.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities represent a contractual obligation by Hydro to deliver cash in the future and are classified as either short- or long-term. Financial liabilities include financial derivatives, commodity derivative contracts and other financial liabilities as well as financial instruments used for cash-flow hedges. Financial liabilities, with the exception of derivatives, are initially recognized at fair value, including transaction costs directly attributable to the transaction, and are subsequently measured at amortized cost. Financial liabilities are derecognized when the obligation is discharged through payment, when Hydro has irrevocably initiated payment, or when Hydro is legally released from the primary responsibility for the liability.\n\n## Derivative instruments\n\nDerivative instruments are measured at fair value through profit and loss, except when the instruments meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting and are designated as hedge instruments. Derivatives, including hedging instruments and embedded derivatives, with expected cash flows within twelve months from the balance sheet date, or held solely for trading, are classified as short-term. Instruments with expected cash flows more than 12 months after the balance sheet date are classified as short and long-term based on the timing of the estimated cash flows.\n\nExpected gross cash flows from derivatives accounted for as financial liabilities and financial assets, respectively, as of end of year:\n\n|                        | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2022   | December 31, 2021   | December 31, 2021   |\n|------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n| Amounts in NOK million | Liabilities         | Assets              | Liabilities         | Assets              |\n| 2022                   |                     |                     | (3,636)             | 3,084               |\n| 2023                   | (2,658)             | 903                 | (2,438)             | 312                 |\n| 2024                   | (408)               | 290                 | (101)               | (30)                |\n| 2025                   | (304)               | 102                 | (16)                | 81                  |\n| Thereafter             | (603)               | 625                 |                     |                     |\n| Total                  | (3,973)             | 1,920               | (6,191)             | 3,447               |\n\nThe cash flows above are to a large extent subject to enforceable netting agreements reducing Hydro's exposure substantially.\n\nFor additional information on contracts accounted for at fair value, see note 8.3 Derivative instruments and hedge accounting.",

The ability to settle net is conditional on simultaneous offsetting cash-flows.\n\nPhysical contracts for commodities that are readily convertible to cash are evaluated on a portfolio basis. Portfolios are defined based on business purpose, internal mandates and internal responsibilities. If a portfolio of contracts contains contracts of a similar nature that are settled net in cash, or the underlying products are not intended for own use, the entire portfolio of contracts is recognized at fair value and classified as derivatives. Physical commodity contracts that are entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of the commodity in accordance with Hydro's expected purchase, sale or usage requirements (own use) are not accounted for at fair value. Commodity purchase contracts are generally considered to be the primary source for usage requirements. Hydro's own production of such commodities, for instance electricity, alumina and primary aluminium, is considered to be available for use or sale at Hydro's discretion unless relevant concessions contain restrictions for use.\n\nFor commodity contracts with certain contingencies such as dependence on a planned production facility, the contracts are evaluated to determine at which time the arrangement represents a firm commitment and thus potentially is a contract in scope of IFRS 9. Generally, Hydro consider arrangements relying on production in a specific facility not yet existing and for which the final construction decision is not made, not to represent a derivative under IFRS 9.\n\nDerivative commodity instruments are marked-to-market with their fair value recorded in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities. Valuation models take into consideration uncertainties and variability in volumes to be delivered or received where not contractually fixed. Changes in the fair value of the instruments are reflected in revenue and/or raw material cost. Forward currency contracts and currency options are recognized in the balance sheet and measured at fair value at each balance sheet date with the resulting gain or loss recorded in Finance expense. Interest income and expense relating to swaps are netted and recognized as income or expense over the life of the contract.\n\nHedge accounting is applied when specific hedge criteria are met, including documentation of the hedge relationship. The changes in fair value of the hedging instruments are offset in part or in full by the corresponding changes in the fair value or cash flows of the underlying hedged exposures. Gains and losses on cash flow hedging instruments are recognized in Other comprehensive income and deferred in the Hedging reserve in Other components of equity until the underlying transaction is recognized in the income statement. Deferred gains and losses relating to forecasted hedged transactions that are no longer expected to occur are immediately recognized in the income statement. Any amounts resulting from hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in the current period's income statement.\n\nAn embedded derivative is accounted for as a separate financial instrument, provided that the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative are not closely related to those of the host contract, a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would meet the definition of a derivative, and the host contract is not accounted for at fair value. Embedded derivatives are classified both in the income statement and on the balance sheet based on the risks in the derivatives' underlying.\n\nFinancial instruments, and contracts accounted for as such, are in the balance sheet included in several line items and classified in categories for accounting treatment.\n\n## Significant judgment in accounting for financial instruments\n\nDetermining whether contracts qualify as financial instruments at fair value or as contracts for own use involves evaluation of markets, Hydro's use of those instruments and historic or planned use of physically delivered products under such contracts. The assessment includes considerations of production volume, sales volumes and the need for raw materials over the period covered by the contract. Determining whether embedded derivatives are required to be separated and accounted for at fair value involves assessing price correlations and normal market pricing mechanisms for relevant products and marketplaces. Where no directly observable market prices exist, fair value is estimated through valuation models which rely on internal assumptions as well as observable market information such as forward curves, yield curves and interest rates. Market stability impacts the reliability of observed prices and other market information, and consequently, the extent of judgment necessary to estimate appropriate market prices for valuation purposes. Volatility also impacts the magnitude of changes in estimated fair value, which can be substantial, in particular on long-term contracts. Historically, financial and commodity markets have been highly volatile.\n\nThe below specification relates to financial statement line items containing financial instruments.

Such collaterals for financial instruments are made in the form of cash deposits, and reported as part of Short-term investments and Other non-current assets. As of December 31, 2022, short-term collateral was NOK 2.5 billion while long-term collateral was NOK 106 million. Corresponding amounts as of December 31, 2021 were NOK 3.4 billion and NOK 1.9 billion, respectively.\n\nImpairment of receivables are disclosed in note 6.2 Trade and other receivables . No other financial assets are currently impaired based on credit losses.\n\n## Gains and losses\n\nRealized and unrealized gains and losses from financial instruments and contracts accounted for as financial instruments are included in several line items in the income statement.

The sensitivity analysis depicted in the tables below reflects the hypothetical gain/loss in fair values that would occur assuming a 10 percent increase in rates or prices and no changes in the portfolio of instruments held in Hydro's continuing operations as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Effects shown below are largely also representative of reductions in rates or prices by 10 percent, but with the opposite sign convention. Only effects that would ultimately be accounted for in the income statement, or equity, as a result of a change in rates or prices, are included. All changes are before tax.\n\n|                                     |                                  | Gain (loss) from 10 percent increase in   | Gain (loss) from 10 percent increase in   | Gain (loss) from 10 percent increase in   | Gain (loss) from 10 percent increase in   | Gain (loss) from 10 percent increase in   | Gain (loss) from 10 percent increase in   | Gain (loss) from 10 percent increase in   |\n|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n|                                     |                                  | Foreign currency   exchange rates         | Foreign currency   exchange rates         | Foreign currency   exchange rates         | Commodity   prices                        | Commodity   prices                        |                                           |                                           |\n| Amounts in NOK million              | Fair value as of  December 31 1) | USD                                       | EUR                                       | Other                                     | Aluminium                                 | Other                                     | Interest-rates                            | Other                                     |\n| 2022                                |                                  |                                           |                                           |                                           |                                           |                                           |                                           |                                           |\n| Derivative financial instruments 2) | (638)                            | (464)                                     | (2,087)                                   | 116                                       | -

Discount rates vary as appropriate for the individual instruments.\n- 2) Includes forward currency contracts and embedded currency derivatives.\n- 3) Includes cash and cash equivalents, investments in securities, bank loans and other interest-bearing short-term debt and long-term debt. Trade payables and trade receivables are also included.\n- 4) Includes all contracts with commodities as underlying, both financial and physical contracts, such as LME contracts and NASDAQ Nordic Power contracts, which are accounted for at fair value.\n- 5) Includes hedging derivatives.\n\nThe above sensitivity analysis reflects sensitivities for the instruments held at the balance sheet dates only. Related offsetting physical positions, contracts, and anticipated transactions are not reflected. The calculations do not take into consideration any adjustments for potential correlations between the risk exposure categories, such as the effect of a change in a foreign exchange rate on a commodity price.\n\nThe above discussion about Hydro's risk management policies and the estimated amounts included in the sensitivity analysis relates to the balance sheet position as of December 31. Outcomes at other dates could differ materially based on actual developments in the global markets and Hydro's positions. The methods used by Hydro to analyze risks discussed above should not be considered as projections of future events, gains or losses.\n\nThe following is an overview of fair value measurements categorized on the basis of observability of significant measurement inputs. Certain items are valued on the basis of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 inputs), others are valued on the basis of inputs that are derived from observable prices (level 2 inputs), while certain positions are valued on the basis of judgmental assumptions that are to a limited degree or not at all based on observable market data (level 3 inputs). Bilateral contracts with reference to observable prices are considered to be level 2 inputs. The level in this fair value hierarchy within which measurements are categorized is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.",

Gains and losses on the hedge derivatives are recognized in Other comprehensive income, and accumulated in the hedging reserve in equity and reclassified into operating revenues or cost when the corresponding forecasted sale or consumption is recognized. In 2022 and 2021, Hydro entered into hedge arrangements for currency in the Alunorte plant and the Albras plant, both in Brazil, to secure the exchange rate between Brazilian Real and US dollar for the period 2021 to 2024. As of 31 December 2022, an amount of USD 664 million is sold forward for 2023-2024 at an average rate of 6.04 Brazilian Real to US dollar.\n\nNo ineffectiveness was recognized in the income statement in 2022 or 2021.\n\nThe table below gives aggregated numbers related to the cash flow hedges for 2022 and 2021.\n\n| Amounts in NOK million                                               | 2023   | 2022   |   2021 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Expected to be reclassified to the income statement during the year  | 264    | (176)  |     75 |\n| Reclassified to the income statement from Other components of equity |        | 231    |     41 |\n\nAn asset of NOK 515 million and liability of NOK 431 million were recognized as the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments for December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nHydro performs trading operations to reduce currency exposures on commodity positions. The effect of such operations is recognized as a part of Financial expense in the income statement.\n\nFor the after tax movement in Hydro's equity relating to cash-flow hedges for 2022 and 2021, please see note 7.6 Shareholders' equity.\n\n## Fair Value of Derivative Instruments\n\nThe fair value of derivative financial instruments such as currency forwards and swaps are based on quoted market prices. The fair market value of aluminium and electricity futures/forwards and option contracts is based on quoted market prices obtained from the London Metals Exchange and NASDAQ Nordic Power/EEX (European Energy Exchange) respectively. The fair value of other commodity over-the-counter contracts and swaps is based on quoted market prices, estimates obtained from brokers and other appropriate valuation techniques. Where long-term physical delivery commodity contracts are recognized at fair value in accordance with IFRS 9, such fair market values are based on quoted forward prices in the market, and assumptions of forward prices and margins where market prices are not available. Where volumes, delivery profile or other elements are uncertain or contingent on variables outside the parties' control, management's best estimate of such factors and the range of reasonably possible outcomes is reflected in the valuation. Hydro takes credit-spread into consideration when valuating positions when necessary.\n\nFor further information on fair values, see note 1.2 Measurement of fair value. See note 8.2 Financial instruments for a specification of the classification of derivative positions according to a fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Note 8.3 Derivative instruments and hedge accounting\n\n## Accounting policies for classification of embedded derivatives\n\nEmbedded derivatives are classified based on the underlying in the contract feature constituting a separable embedded derivative in the table below. Where there is more than one embedded derivative in the same host contract, those embedded derivatives are offset in settlement and thus presented net on the balance sheet.\n\nChanges in the fair value of commodity derivatives are included in operating revenues or cost of goods sold based on classification of underlying risk for embedded derivatives and on the purpose of the instrument for freestanding derivatives. Currency derivatives, whether embedded derivatives or separate instruments, are classified as Finance expense.\n\n## Significant judgment for embedded derivatives\n\nSome non-financial contracts contain pricing links that affect cash flows in a manner different than the underlying commodity or other product in the contract. For accounting purposes, these embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and recognized at fair value for links not closely related to the product in the host contract. Which price links that are closely related requires judgment, assessing common pricing patterns and market development over time. Hydro has separated and recognized at fair value embedded derivatives related to currency and aluminium links from the underlying contracts, mainly in energy contracts.\n\n## Commodity derivatives\n\nThe following types of commodity derivatives, including embedded derivatives, were recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Contracts that are designated as hedge instruments in cash flow hedges are not included. Hydro's risk management, including use of derivative instruments, is discussed in note 8.1 Financial and commercial risk management.\n\nFair values for derivative instruments in the table below includes traditional derivative instruments such as futures, forwards and swaps, physical contracts accounted for at fair value, as well as embedded derivatives.\n\n| Amounts in NOK million                  | 2022    | 2021    |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Assets                                  |         |         |\n| Electricity contracts                   | 709     | 3,221   |\n| Aluminium futures, forwards and options | 549     | 479     |\n| Other                                   | 281     | 146     |\n| Total                                   | 1,539   | 3,845   |\n| Liabilities                             |         |         |\n| Electricity contracts                   | (1,098) | (403)   |\n| Aluminium futures, forwards and options | (2,443) | (5,739) |\n| Other                                   | (81)    | (10)    |\n| Total                                   | (3,621) | (6,152) |",

The members of Hydro's Corporate Management Board and the members of Hydro's board of directors during 2022 and 2021 and their individual remuneration is reported in Norsk Hydro ASA Remuneration report 2022.\n\n| Amounts in NOK thousand          | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Salary paid                      | 45,151 | 45,697 |\n| Other short-term benefits        | 20,009 | 22,928 |\n| Pension benefits                 | 6,270  | 4,763  |\n| Long-term incentive              | 11,432 | 4,250  |\n| Total Corporate Management Board | 82,862 | 77,638 |\n| Fees Board of Directors          | 6,293  | 5,242  |\n| Total                            | 89,155 | 82,880 |\n\n## Note 9.1 Related party information\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, The Norwegian state had ownership interests of 34.7 percent of total shares outstanding (2021: 34.6 percent) in Hydro through the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries. In addition, Folketrygdfondet, which manages the Government Pension Fund - Norway 1 held 6.0 percent (2021: 7.0 percent). There are no preferential voting rights associated with the shares held by the Norwegian State. Hydro has concluded that the Norwegian state's shareholding represents a significant interest in Hydro, and that the State thus is a related party.\n\nHydro's share buyback program authorized at the extraordinary general meeting in September 2022 has as a prerequisite for buybacks and subsequent cancellation of shares that these transactions do not result in a change to the ownership interest of 34.26 percent of issued shares of the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries. Share redemptions from the Norwegian state will be carried out at the same price terms as for the buybacks via the stock exchange.\n\nThe Norwegian state has ownership interests in a substantial number of companies. The ownership interests in 70 companies are managed by the ministries and covered by public information from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries 2 . We have not assessed which of these companies that are controlled by the State. Hydro has business transactions with a number of these companies, including purchase of power from Statkraft and bank services from DNB. Generally, transactions are agreed independently of the possible control exercised by the State.\n\nA significant share of Hydro's defined benefit post-employment plans is managed by the independent pension trust, Norsk Hydros Pensjonskasse. Employees managing and operating the pension trust are employees of Norsk Hydro ASA. Their salaries and other benefits are reimbursed by the pension trust on a monthly basis, in total NOK 11 million for 2022 and NOK 10 million for 2021. Further, the pension trust is located in Hydro's head office. Office costs, including heating and administrative services, are charged with a total of NOK 1 million for both 2022 and 2021. The pension trust provided services to Hydro for administration of unfunded pension plans with NOK 4 million for both 2022 and 2021.\n\nThe pension trust owns some of the office space rented by Hydro. The current rental arrangement was entered into in 2015 representing a partial continuation of a rental agreement from 2006, and priced based on market price benchmarks at the time of the agreement in 2006. Hydro has paid a rental of NOK 65 million and NOK 70 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. The current term of the rental contract expires in February 2027. Hydro also sold electricity to the pension trust for its operational needs at the same office site for a total amount of NOK 20 million in 2022 and NOK 8 million 2021. As of the end of 2022, Hydro's outstanding receivables on Norsk Hydros Pensjonskasse were NOK 5 million, while Hydro's payable to Norsk Hydros Pensjonskasse amounted to NOK 4 million, all settled during January 2023.\n\nHydro's significant joint arrangements and associates; and transactions with those entities are described in note 3.1 Investments in joint arrangements and associates. Hydro's relationship with partners in joint arrangements are generally limited to a combined effort within a limited area. Hydro considers the joint venture partners as competitors in other business transactions, and do not see these relationships as related party relationships.\n\nSome of the board members or their close members of family serve as board members or executive directors in other companies. In addition, some members of Hydro's corporate management board or their close members of family serve as board members in other companies. Hydro has transactions with some of those companies; however, have not identified any transactions where the relationship is known to have influenced the transaction. Some close family members of members of Hydro's management are employed in non-executive positions in Hydro.\n\nTransactions with related parties are at arm's length principles.\n\n- 1 Shareholding is based on information from the Norwegian Central Securities Depositary (VPS) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Due to lending of shares, an investor's holdings registered in its VPS account may vary.\n- 2 According to information on the Government web site www.regjeringen.no, state ownership.",

The cost of providing pension benefits under a defined benefit plan is determined separately for each plan using the projected unit credit method. Past service costs are recognized immediately in the income statement. The interest component of the periodic cost is included in Finance expense. Remeasurement gains and losses are recognized in Other comprehensive income.\n\nContributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the income statement in the period in which they accrue. Multiemployer defined benefit plans where available information is insufficient to use defined benefit accounting are accounted for as if the plan were a defined contribution plan.\n\n## Significant judgment in accounting for post-employment benefits\n\nMeasurement of pension expense and obligations under defined benefit plans requires numerous assumptions and estimates that can have a significant impact on the recognized pension cost and obligation, such as discount rates, mortality, and future pension increases and salary levels.\n\n## Employee retirement plans in Hydro\n\nHydro provides post-employment benefits covering a substantial portion of employees. Plans and benefit levels vary between companies and countries. In recent years, there has been a shift from traditional final salary defined benefit plans to defined contribution and contribution-oriented plans. Many defined benefit plans have been closed to new entrants, and in some defined benefit plans, large groups of employees have converted to defined contribution arrangements. Still, a declining number of employees continues to earn benefits under defined benefit plans.\n\n## Pension expense\n\n|                                                          | 2022   | 2022    | 2022   | 2022   | 2021    | 2021    | 2021   | 2021    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|--------|--------|---------|---------|--------|---------|\n| Amounts in NOK million                                   | Norway | Germany | Other  | Total  | Norway  | Germany | Other  | Total   |\n| Defined benefit plans                                    | 87     | 22      | 55     | 164    | 105     | 18      | 48     | 172     |\n| Defined contribution plans                               | 216    | -       | 413    | 630    | 198     | -       | 318    | 516     |\n| Multiemployer plans                                      | 52     | -       | -      | 52     | 46      | -       | -      | 46      |\n| Termination benefits and other                           | 69     | 11      | 46     | 126    | 121     | 12      | 22     | 155     |\n| Social security cost                                     | 51     | -       | 19     | 70     | 54      | -       | 22     | 76      |\n| Pension expense                                          | 475    | 33      | 533    | 1,041  | 525     | 30      | 410    | 965     |\n| Interest expense (income)                                | (61)   | 29      | 10     | (22)   | (23)    | 16      | 14     | 7       |\n| Remeasurement (gain) loss in  other comprehensive income | (84)   | (616)   | (268)  | (968)  | (2,462) | (16)    | (333)  | (2,811) |\n\n## Note 9.2 Employee remuneration\n\n## Accounting policies for employee remuneration\n\nShare-based compensation\n\nHydro accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based Payment. Share-based compensation expense is measured at fair value over the service period and includes social security taxes that will be paid by Hydro at the settlement date. All changes in fair value are recognized in the income statement.\n\n## Employee benefits\n\nPayments to employees, such as wages, salaries, social security contributions, paid annual leave and bonus agreements are accrued in the period in which the associated services are rendered by the employee.\n\n## Employee share purchase plan\n\nHydro has established a share purchase plan for employees in Norway. The plan payout is based on whether the share price (adjusted for dividend paid) increases with at least 12 percent or not during the performance period. Employees are eligible to receive an offer to purchase shares under this plan if they were 1) employed by Norsk Hydro ASA or a more than 90 percent owned Norwegian subsidiary, and 2) employed as of December 31 through the final acceptance date of the share purchase offer. Employees are invited to purchase shares with a rebate of 50 percent for a value of NOK 15,000 or NOK 30,000, depending on shareholder return. The share purchase is financed through a non-interest bearing loan from the company with a repayment period of 12 months.\n\nCompensation expense related to the 2021 performance measurement period was accrued and recognized over the service period of December 31, 2021 through March 31, 2022, the final acceptance date of the offer. Details related to the employee share purchase plan are provided in the table below.\n\n## Performance measurement period\n\n|                                                      | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total shareholder return performance target achieved | \u226512%   | \u226512%   | \u226512%   |\n| Employee rebate offered, NOK                         | 15,000 | 15,000 | 15,000 |\n\n## Share purchase plan compensation\n\n|                                                         | 2022      | 2021      |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Award share price, NOK                                  | 90.48     | 54.70     |\n| Number of shares issued, per employee                   | 340       | 648       |\n| Total number of shares issued to employees              | 1,044,820 | 2,350,944 |\n| Compensation expense related to the award, NOK thousand | 48,548    | 74,208    |\n\n## Employee benefit expense\n\nThe average number of employees in Hydro's continuing operations for 2022 and 2021 was 31,770 and 30,982, respectively.

The main plans are unfunded. Hydro's main plans are closed to new entrants, and all new employees are now offered benefits under defined contribution-oriented plans. These plans are unfunded and treated as defined benefit plans for financial reporting purposes. Following Hydro's sale of its Rolling business in 2021, the impact of these benefit plans was reduced significantly.\n\n## Other\n\nOther includes Hydro's post-employment benefits outside Norway and Germany. Most employees affected are covered by defined contribution plans. Defined benefit plans relate largely to the UK and the US, where the majority of the benefit obligation is financed and administered through independent pension trusts.\n\n## Norway\n\nHydro has closed the main defined benefit plans for new members, and the majority of employees are now covered by defined contribution plans. The defined benefit plans are both funded and unfunded. The main funded plan is managed by Norsk Hydros Pensjonskasse, a separate, regulated legal entity. Hydro's pension plans complement the public pension schemes in Norway.\n\nHydro participates in a tariff-based pension plan that entitles the majority of its Norwegian employees life-long supplementary benefits. The benefits are financed through a pooled arrangement by private sector employers (avtalefestet pensjon, AFP) where also the Norwegian state contributes. The plan is a defined benefit plan with limited funding and where plan assets are not segregated. The information required to calculate the share of the plan and account for the plan as a defined benefit plan is not available from the plan administrator. Hydro therefore accounts for the plan as if it were a defined contribution plan.

The market for covered bonds has developed in size and liquidity, and we deem this market to be sufficiently deep to serve as reference for the discount rate for our post-employment benefit plans in Norway.\n\nThe sensitivities shown in the table below have been calculated for the main Norwegian plans illustrating the effects of changing one assumption while keeping the other assumptions unchanged.

Taxable profit also excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. Hydro's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted as of the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred income tax expense is calculated using the liability method in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current in the balance sheet and are measured based on the difference between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and their tax basis when such differences are considered temporary in nature. For items recognized as an asset and a liability at inception, such as an asset retirement obligation or a lease, temporary differences related to the asset and liability are considered in combination, and deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized on changes to the temporary differences through the life of the items. Temporary differences related to intercompany profits are deferred using the buyer's tax rate. Deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability every balance sheet date, and the amount probable of recovery is recognized.\n\nDeferred income tax expense represents the change in deferred tax asset and liability balances during the year, except for the deferred tax related to items recognized in Other comprehensive income or resulting from a business combination or disposal. Changes resulting from amendments and revisions in tax laws and tax rates are recognized when the new tax laws or rates become effective or are substantively enacted. Uncertain tax positions are recognized in the financial statements based on management's expectations.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority, and when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\n\nDeferred taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of subsidiaries when the timing of the reversal of this temporary difference is controlled by Hydro and is not expected to happen in the foreseeable future. This is applicable for the majority of Hydro's subsidiaries.\n\n## Significant judgment in accounting for income taxes\n\nHydro is involved in a significant number of tax cases related to various types of taxes. Hydro's widespread business operations expose us to several tax regimes and their interaction. We see that tax authorities challenge transfer prices to an increasing degree. Although Hydro currently has no significant transfer price disputes with tax authorities, the long value chain with a large number of internal transactions and business operations covering multiple tax jurisdictions expose us to such disputes, both related to prior and future transactions.\n\nValuation of deferred tax assets is dependent on management's assessment of future recoverability of the deferred benefit. Expected recoverability may result from expected taxable income in the future, planned transactions or planned tax optimizing measures, all of which may be uncertain. Economic conditions may change and lead to a different conclusion regarding recoverability. Tax authorities in different jurisdictions may challenge Hydro's calculation of taxes payable from prior periods. Such processes may lead to changes to prior periods' taxable income, resulting in changes to income tax expense in the period of change, as well as interest and fines.",

Development costs are capitalized as intangible assets at cost in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets when the recognition criteria are met, including probable future economic benefit and that the cost can be measured reliably.\n\nSee note 2.2 Intangible assets for further details.\n\n## Research and development in 2022 and 2021\n\nHydro carries out its main research and development activities through research centres in the business areas. Total expensed research and development cost was NOK 655 million in 2022 and NOK 512 million in 2021. The greater part of the expensed research and development costs relates to in-house research and application development organizations, while the remainder represents work carried out by external institutions. Government grants have been received on basis of some of the projects, recognized as other income, i.e. have not deducted in the amounts mentioned above.\n\nHydro undertakes research and development activities to deliver on its strategic direction, including meeting its sustainability ambitions. Hydro is committed to achieving net-zero emissions in terms of Scope 1 and 2 by 2050 or earlier and expects to have initiatives in place for cutting own carbon emissions by 30 percent by 2030. To deliver on this commitment, new technologies enabling the delivery of net zero products and net zero operations are needed, to which research and development activities have been initiated. The activities are carried out throughout the value chain of Hydro.\n\n## Alumina\n\nBauxite residue is a leftover material from the process of refining bauxite into alumina at the Alunorte refinery. Hydro and Senai Institute of Innovation in Mineral technologies (ISI-TM) initiated a partnership in 2019 to develop methods and processes for the reuse of bauxite residues, including industrial application and extraction of other minerals from the residues, and opportunities for applying the residue as a soil conditioner in local agriculture.\n\nDevelopment projects also include development of methods for replacing coal fired boilers with electrical boilers at the alumina refinery Alunorte with the aim of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## Primary aluminium production\n\nAluminium production is an industry with hard-to-abate emissions, requiring development and maturement of technologies to reduce emissions. Hydro is pursuing technology pathways toward near zero aluminium. To secure the value of existing primary aluminium plants, Hydro is developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) solutions that can be retrofitted into the existing plants. Hydro is planning to test and pilot the most promising CCS technology, up to industrial scale pilot by 2030.\n\nAnother pathway more suited for greenfield aluminium plants is Hydro's proprietary HalZero technology. This technology converts alumina to aluminium chloride prior to electrolysis in a process where chlorine and carbon are kept in closed loops, resulting in a fully decarbonized process. Hydro has been working on lab-scale development of this technology for five years and has now developed a roadmap to bring this to an industrial scale pilot before 2030.\n\n## Aluminium recycling\n\nZero-carbon aluminium can also be achieved by recycling more post-consumer scrap. Using only post-consumer scrap, Hydro will be able to produce a near-zero carbon product at a competitive cost. Hydro has patented aluminium sorting technology, and regularly seek to improve and further develop technology and processes, including sorting technology for post-consumer scrap.\n\nHydro is also preparing to test casthouse decarbonization technology for the recycling and primary plants to reach netzero. Hydrogen based processes is developed and planned to be tested at pilot scale for furnaces.\n\n## Tax effects of temporary differences and tax loss carryforwards giving rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities\n\n| Amounts in NOK million                  | Assets 2022   | Liabilities 2022   | Assets 2021   | Liabilities 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------|---------------|--------------------|\n| Inventory valuation                     | 530           | (327)              | 495           | (252)              |\n| Accrued expenses                        | 2,105         | (268)              | 1,782         | (215)              |\n| Property, plant and equipment           | 8,546         | (12,747)           | 7,136         | (11,457)           |\n| Intangible assets                       | 1,564         | (2,290)            | 1,310         | (2,067)            |\n| Pensions                                | 1,467         | (1,875)            | 1,840         | (1,887)            |\n| Derivatives                             | 978           | (598)              | 1,981         | (838)              |\n| Other                                   | 1,052         | (2,628)            | 794           | (1,680)            |\n| Tax loss carryforwards                  | 6,171         |                    | 4,711         |                    |\n| Subtotal                                | 22,413        | (20,733)           | 20,049        | (18,397)           |\n| Of which not recognized as tax asset    | (4,312)       |                    | (2,729)       |                    |\n| Gross deferred tax assets (liabilities) | 18,101        | (20,733)           | 17,320        | (18,397)           |\n| Net deferred tax assets (liabilities)   |               | (2,632)            |               | (1,077)            |\n\n## Reconciliation to balance sheets\n\n|                                       | 2022    | 2021    |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Deferred tax assets                   | 2,163   | 2,588   |\n| Deferred tax liabilities              | 4,796   | 3,665   |\n| Net deferred tax assets (liabilities) | (2,632) | (1,077) |\n\nRecognition of net deferred tax asset is based on expected taxable income in the future.\n\nAt the end of 2022, Hydro had tax loss carryforwards of NOK 20,479 million, mainly in Brazil, Spain, Australia and Italy.

The resulting unrealized gain or loss is presented in Financial income, net.\n\nNorsk Hydro ASA has decided to utilize the option in the regulation to exclude embedded derivatives and contracts deemed to be derivatives based on the underlying product being readily convertible to cash and not for own use when the contract is with a subsidiary, i.e. such features are not separated from the host contract.\n\n## Loans and other financial liabilities\n\nLoans and other financial liabilities include issued bonds, bank loans and similar. Loans are measured at amortized cost.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions are recognized when Norsk Hydro ASA has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable (more likely than not) that Norsk Hydro ASA will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount, taking into account the risks and uncertainties. The provision is measured at the present value of the cash flows estimated to settle the obligation. Uncertain outcomes are measured as the expected value of reasonably possible outcomes.\n\n## Contingencies and guarantees\n\nNorsk Hydro ASA recognizes a liability for the fair value of obligations it has undertaken in issuing guarantees. Contingencies are recognized in the financial statements when probable of occurrence and reliably estimable.\n\n## Share-based compensation\n\nNorsk Hydro ASA accounts for share-based payment in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment. See note 9.2 Employee remuneration to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Risk management\n\nFor information about risk management in Norsk Hydro ASA see note 8.1 Financial and commercial risk management to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nDeferred income tax expense is calculated in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes. Under IAS 12, deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the differences between the carrying values of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and their tax basis which are considered temporary in nature. Deferred income tax related to remeasurements of pension obligations are recognized through Other comprehensive income. The tax effect of equity transactions, excluded transfers to owners, is recognized as a part of the equity transaction and do not affect the income tax expense. Other changes in deferred income tax asset and liability balances during the year represent the deferred income tax expense. Changes resulting from amendments and revisions in tax laws and tax rates are recognized when the new tax laws or rates are enacted.\n\n## Note 1\n\n## Summary of significant accounting policies\n\nThe financial statements of Norsk Hydro ASA are prepared in accordance with the Norwegian accounting act and regulation on simplified application of international accounting standards (forskrift om forenklet anvendelse av internasjonale regnskapsstandarder - simplified IFRS).\n\nFinancial statement preparation requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as disclosures of contingencies. Actual results may differ from estimates. Interest rates used for calculating net present values are rounded to the nearest 10 basis points for postemployment benefits, to the nearest 25 basis points for other non-financial assets and liabilities. As a result of rounding adjustments, the figures in one or more columns included in the financial statements may not add up to the total of that column.\n\n## Shares in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures\n\nShares in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are presented according to the cost method. Group relief received is included in dividends from subsidiaries. Dividend from subsidiaries is recognized in the year for which it is proposed by the subsidiary to the extent Norsk Hydro ASA can control the decision of the subsidiary through its share holdings. Shares in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed the recoverable amount of the investment. An impairment loss is reversed if the impairment situation is deemed to no longer exist.\n\n## Employee retirement plans\n\nNorsk Hydro ASA accounts for employee retirement plans in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits. See note 9.3 Employee retirement plans to the consolidated financial statements for description of the accounting policies.\n\n## Foreign currency\n\nThe functional currency of the company is the Norwegian krone, NOK. Realized and unrealized currency gains or losses on transactions denominated in other currencies than NOK, as well as currency gains or losses on assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than NOK, are included in Financial income, net.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash, bank deposits and all other monetary instruments with a maturity of less than three months at the date of purchase.\n\n## Short-term investments\n\nShort-term investments include bank deposits and all other monetary instruments with a maturity between three and twelve months at the date of purchase and current listed equity and debt securities held for trading and valued at fair value. The resulting unrealized holding gains and losses are included in Financial income, net. Investment income is recognized when earned.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. According to IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, such assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The impairment of long-lived assets is recognized when the recoverable amount determined as the higher of fair value less cost to sell or value in use of the asset or group of assets is less than the carrying value. The amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying value and the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed if the impairment situation is deemed to no longer exist.\n\n## Leased assets\n\nLeased assets are recognized as right-of-use assets in accordance with IFRS 16 Leases, with contractually fixed future payments recognized as lease liabilities. When measuring leases, fixed lease payments for extension periods reasonably certain to be used are included. As a practical expedient, non-lease components are not separated from lease contracts. Leases of assets of a low value, manly such items as PCs, office equipment and similar, are excluded from lease accounting. Right-of-use assets are included in Property, plant and equipment, and lease liabilities are included in Longterm debt. See note 2.6 Leases to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets acquired individually or as a group are recognized at fair value when acquired, in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful life and tested for impairment whenever indications of impairment are present.",

In addition, a smaller group of employees earns benefits on salaries above 12G in a defined contribution based plan closed to new entrants. Norsk Hydro ASA has closed the main defined benefit plans covering a declining number of employees. The defined benefit plans are funded for benefits earned on salaries up to 12G and unfunded for salaries above this level and for early retirement and termination benefits. The plans comply with legal requirements for occupational pensions in Norway.\n\nNorsk Hydro ASA participates in a pension plan that entitles the majority of its employees life-long benefits in addition to other pension benefits. The benefits are financed through a pooled arrangement by private sector employers (avtalefestet pensjon, AFP) where also the Norwegian state contributes. The plan is a defined benefit plan with limited funding and where plan assets are not segregated. The information required to calculate the share of the plan and account for the plan as a defined benefit plan is not available from the plan administrator. Hydro therefore accounts for the plan as if it were a defined contribution plan. The employer contributions are included in Multiemployer plans.\n\n## Pension cost\n\n| Amounts in NOK million                                  | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Defined benefit plans                                   | 28     | 32     |\n| Defined contribution plans                              | 37     | 35     |\n| Multiemployer plans                                     | 6      | 6      |\n| Termination benefits and other                          | 6      | 1      |\n| Social security cost                                    | 9      | 8      |\n| Pension expense                                         | 86     | 82     |\n| Interest expense (income)                               | (65)   | (43)   |\n| Remeasurement (gain) loss in other comprehensive income | (57)   | (780)  |\n\n## Recognized defined benefit assets and liability\n\n| Amounts in NOK million                 | 2022    | 2021    |\n|----------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Defined benefit obligation major plans | (4,676) | (5,212) |\n| Plan assets                            | 8,260   | 8,587   |\n| Reimbursement rights                   | 262     | 287     |\n| Liability other plans                  | (5)     | (4)     |\n| Social security cost                   | (316)   | (347)   |\n| Net defined benefit asset              | 3,525   | 3,310   |\n| Recognized prepaid pension             | 6,080   | 6,125   |\n| Recognized pension liability           | (2,554) | (2,815) |\n| Net amount recognized                  | 3,525   | 3,310   |",

The proposed payment demonstrates the company's commitment to provide a predictable dividend to shareholders. Hydro's dividend policy reflects our ambitions to lift performance and cash returns to shareholders over the cycle. The dividend policy is to pay out a minimum of 50 percent of adjusted net income over the cycle with a NOK 1.25 per share dividend floor.\n\nAccording to section 3-3a of the Norwegian Accounting Act, the Board of Directors confirms that the financial statements have been prepared on the assumption of a going concern.\n\nOslo, February 13, 2023\n\n| Dag Mejdell  Chair                | Rune Bjerke  Deputy chair       | Arve Baade  Board member   | Petra Einarsson  Board member   | Kristin F.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nImpairment assessment of goodwill, intangible and non-current assets\n\nRefer to Note 1.1 Reporting entity, basis of preparation and significant accounting policies, Note 2.1. Property, plant and equipment, Note 2.2 Intangible assets, Note 2.3 Goodwill, Note 2.4 Depreciation and amortization expense, and Note 2.5 Impairment of non-current assets\n\n## The key audit matter\n\n## How the matter was addressed in our audit\n\nThe Group's operations are sensitive to certain commodity prices and other factors, including aluminum and alumina prices, energy prices, inflation rates, relevant foreign exchange rates and production volumes which impact key assumptions in cash flow forecasts and can give rise to impairment indicators.\n\nManagement exercise judgement related to expected timing of future cash flows and key assumptions.\n\nThe economic environment and volatility of longterm assumptions indicate that impairment could be a risk related to specific assets and cash generating units (CGUs) and can also impact the assessment of impairment of goodwill. Impairment indications could also arise from transactions in which the agreed consideration is below the carrying value of the asset or CGU.\n\nCertain plants are also sensitive to the uncertainty related to renewal of power contracts expiring within 1 to 5 years.\n\nImpairment charges of NOK 336 million were recognized in 2022, consisting of:\n\n- \uf0b7 NOK 77 million in relation to the business area Hydro Aluminium Metal\n- \uf0b7 NOK 258 million in relation to the business area Hydro Extrusions\n\nAs at 31 December 2022, the Group has goodwill of NOK 5,557 million, Property, plant and equipment of NOK 62,656 million and other intangible assets of NOK 3,722 million.\n\nOur audit procedures in this area included:\n\n- \uf0b7 Assessing management's process and results for identification and classification of CGU's and assessing whether they were appropriate and in accordance with relevant accounting standards\n- \uf0b7 Evaluating management's assessment of impairment indicators\n- \uf0b7 Performing retrospective reviews of the accuracy of management's estimates in terms of timing of cash outflows and other assumptions such as long-term pricing where historical data is available\n- \uf0b7 Evaluating and challenging the forecasted cash flows including timing of future cash flows applied in the models with reference to historical accuracy and approved business plans\n- \uf0b7 When impairment is caused by a sales transaction, confirming the agreed consideration to the sales and purchase agreement, as well as re-calculating the impairment charge and relevant adjustments\n- \uf0b7 Testing the sensitivity of movements in key assumptions\n- \uf0b7 Evaluating, with assistance from our valuation specialists, key assumptions such as aluminium and alumina prices, inflation rates, energy and fuel prices, relevant foreign exchange rates and discount rates by reference to external sources and relevant benchmarks\n- \uf0b7 Testing the mathematical accuracy of the models used to calculate value in use\n- \uf0b7 Assessing the adequacy of the disclosures related to impairment.\n\n## Independent auditor's report\n\nKPMG AS S\u00f8rkedalsveien 6 P.O.

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company and the Group as required by relevant laws and regulations in Norway and the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge and belief, no prohibited non-audit services referred to in the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 5.1 have been provided.",

Such potential obligations are dependent on the jurisdictions in which the Group operates and changes in the relevant political and legislative environments.\n\nManagement decisions to expand, curtail or terminate operations in specific locations can impact obligations as described above.\n\nEstimating and calculating such environmental obligations require significant management judgement. The risk of inaccurate estimates is increased due to the uncertainty of scope and timing of such obligations and the limited amount of historical data available.\n\nThe Group has recognized provisions for environmental clean-up and asset retirement obligations of NOK 4,596 million as explained in note 4.1 Uncertain assets and liabilities.\n\nOur audit procedures in this area included:\n\n- \uf0b7 Assessing the estimated cost and timing of activities applied in the calculations by comparing management forecasts with prior year estimates.\n- \uf0b7 Comparing management's assumptions to relevant market data to test the reasonableness of discount rates, inflation rates, foreign exchange rates and other key assumptions used in the calculations.\n- \uf0b7 Assessing the accounting treatment for compliance with IFRS and consistency of application, in particular related to the extent to which obligations are capitalized or expensed and the amortization period for capitalized assets.\n- \uf0b7 Testing, with assistance from our valuation specialists, the mathematical accuracy of the models used to calculate provisions and asset retirement obligations.\n- \uf0b7 Assessing the adequacy of the disclosures pertaining to estimation uncertainty, provisions and contingent liabilities.\n\n## Other Information\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director (management) are responsible for the other information accompanying the financial statements. The other information comprises information in the annual report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information accompanying the financial statements. The purpose is to consider if there is material inconsistency between the other information accompanying the financial statements and the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or whether the other information accompanying the financial statements otherwise appear to be materially misstated. We are required to report if there is a material misstatement in the other information accompanying the financial statements. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\nBased on our knowledge obtained in the audit, it is our opinion that the information presented in the annual report concerning the financial statements, required by the Norwegian Accounting Act sections 3-3a, 3-3b, 3-3c and 3-3d (the Board of Director's report, the statements on Corporate Governance and Environment and Social Responsibility and the report on payments to governments), and the going concern assumption is consistent with the financial statements and contains the information required by applicable legal requirements.\n\nResponsibilities of Management for the Financial Statements\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in\n\naccordance with simplified application of international accounting standards according to the Norwegian Accounting Act section 3-9, and for the preparation and true and fair view of the consolidated financial statements of the Group in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \uf0b7 identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \uf0b7 obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's and the Group's internal control.\n- \uf0b7 evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- \uf0b7 conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's and the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company and the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- \uf0b7 evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves a true and fair view.\n- \uf0b7 obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control",

We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\nReport on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\nReport on Compliance with Requirement on European Single Electronic Format (ESEF)\n\n## Opinion\n\nAs part of the audit of the financial statements of Norsk Hydro ASA we have performed an assurance engagement to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements included in the annual report, with the file name '549300N1SDN71ZZ8BO45-2022-12-31-nb', have been prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the requirements of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 on the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF Regulation) and regulation pursuant to Section 5-5 of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act, which includes requirements related to the preparation of the annual report in XHTML format, and iXBRL tagging of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements, included in the annual report, have been prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the ESEF regulation.\n\n## Management's Responsibilities\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the annual report in compliance with the ESEF regulation. This responsibility comprises an adequate process and such internal control as management determines is necessary.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities\n\nOur responsibility, based on audit evidence obtained, is to express an opinion on whether, in all material respects, the financial statements included in the annual report have been prepared in compliance with ESEF. We conduct our work in compliance with the International Standard for Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 - 'Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information'. The standard requires us to plan and perform procedures to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements included in the annual report have been prepared in compliance with the ESEF Regulation.\n\nAs part of our work, we have performed procedures to obtain an understanding of the Company's processes for preparing the financial statements in compliance with the ESEF Regulation. We examine whether the financial statements are presented in XHTML-format. We evaluate the completeness and accuracy of the iXBRL tagging of the consolidated financial statements and assess management's use of judgement. Our procedures include reconciliation of the iXBRL tagged data with the audited financial statements in human-readable format. We believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nOslo, 13 February 2023 KPMG AS\n\nLars Inge Pettersen State Authorised Public Accountant\n\nNote: This translation from Norwegian has been prepared for information purposes only.",

Part-owned entities have implemented similar adjustments.\n\n- \u00b7 Unrealized derivative effects on LME related contracts include unrealized gains and losses on contracts measured at market value, which are used for operational hedging purposes related to future expected sales and purchase transactions, both fixed-price customers and supplier contracts and transactions at not yet determined market prices. Also includes elimination of changes in fair value of certain internal physical aluminium contracts.\n- \u00b7 Unrealized derivative effects on power and raw material contracts include unrealized gains and losses on embedded derivatives in raw material and power contracts for Hydro's own use and for physical and financial power contracts used for managing price risks and volume changes. Unrealized derivative effects on certain power contracts in a business model with the combined aim to manage hydrological risk in own production, differences in power needs in existing and new business activities in Hydro as well as supporting development of new renewable energy projects are also adjusted for. Adjustments also comprise elimination of changes in fair value of embedded derivatives within certain internal power contracts.\n- \u00b7 Significant rationalization charges and closure costs include costs related to specifically defined major projects, and not considered to reflect periodic performance in the individual plants or operations. Such costs involve termination benefits, dismantling of installations and buildings, clean-up activities that exceed legal liabilities, etc. Costs related to regular and continuous improvement initiatives are included in underlying results.\n- \u00b7 Significant community contributions Brazil refers to the provision recognized in relation to the TAC and TC agreements with the Government of Par\u00e0 and Minist\u00e8rio P\u00f9blico made in 2018, including later cost adjustments and certain similar agreements.\n- \u00b7 Other effects include insurance proceeds covering asset damage, legal settlements, etc. Insurance proceeds covering lost income in the same or a previous period are included in adjusted results.\n- \u00b7 Pension includes recognition of pension plan amendments and related curtailments and settlements.\n- \u00b7 Transaction related effects reflect the (gains) losses on divestment of businesses and individual assets, the net remeasurement (gains) losses related to previously owned shares in acquired businesses as well as inventory valuation expense related to acquisitions.\n- \u00b7 Adjusted items in equity accounted investments reflects Hydro's share of adjusting items from adjusted net income in Qatalum and are based on Hydro's definitions, including both timing effects and material items not regarded as part of underlying business performance for the period.\n- \u00b7 Impairment charges (PP&E and equity accounted investments) relate to significant write-downs of assets or groups of assets to estimated recoverable amounts in the event of an identified loss in value. Gains from reversal of impairment charges are also adjusted for.\n- \u00b7 Depreciation relate to excess depreciation for assets with significantly reduced expected useful life related to a decision to close the plant or similar significant changes.\n- \u00b7 Realized foreign exchange gain (loss) on risk management instruments represents such items as foreign currency derivatives entered into and managed to mitigate currency risk in the production margin, i.e. the difference between sales price for products such as aluminium or alumina versus the cost of raw materials and energy used in production. Realized embedded currency derivatives in certain power contracts in Norway denominated in Euro are also adjusted for. Such currency effects are included in currency gains and losses in finance expense in the income statement, and included in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT.\n- \u00b7 Net foreign exchange (gain) loss: Realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and payable, funding and deposits, embedded currency derivatives in certain power contracts and forward currency contracts purchasing and selling currencies that hedge net future cash flows from operations, sales contracts and operating capital, with the exception of the realized foreign currency exchange gain (loss) on risk management instruments mentioned above.\n- \u00b7 Calculated income tax effect: In order to present adjusted net income on a basis comparable with our adjusted operating performance, the adjusted income taxes include adjustments for the expected taxable effects on adjusted items to income before tax.\n- \u00b7 Other adjustments to net income from continuing operations include other major financial and tax related effects not regarded as part of the underlying business performance of the period.\n\n## Alternative Performance Measures (APM)\n\nAlternative performance measures, i.e. financial performance measures not within the applicable financial reporting framework, are used by Hydro to provide supplemental information, by excluding items that, in Hydro's view, does not give an indication of the periodic operating results or cash flows of Hydro, or should be assessed in a different context than its classification according to its nature. Financial APMs are intended to enhance comparability of the results and cash flows from period to period, and it is Hydro's experience that these are frequently used by analysts, investors and other parties. Management also uses these measures internally to drive performance in terms of long-term target setting and as basis for performance related pay. These measures are adjusted IFRS measures defined, calculated and used in a consistent and transparent manner over the years and across the company where relevant. Operational measures such as, but not limited to, volumes, prices per mt, production costs and improvement programs are not defined as financial APMs. To provide a better understanding of the company's underlying financial performance for the relevant period, Hydro focuses on adjusted EBITDA in the discussions on periodic underlying financial and operating results and liquidity from the business areas and the group, while adjusting effects to adjusted EBITDA, EBIT and net income (loss) are discussed separately. Financial APMs should not be considered as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with the IFRS. Disclosures of APMs are subject to established internal control procedures.\n\n## Hydro's financial APMs\n\n- \u00b7 EBIT: Earnings before financial items and tax.\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EBIT: EBIT +/- identified adjusting items to EBIT as described below.\n- \u00b7 EBITDA: EBIT + depreciation, amortization and impairments, net of investment grants.\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA: EBITDA +/- identified adjusting items to EBITDA as described below.\n- \u00b7 Adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations: Net income (loss) from continuing operations +/- adjusting items to net income (loss) as described below.\n- \u00b7 Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations: Adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Hydro shareholders divided by weighted average of outstanding shares (ref.: note 7.6 to the consolidated financial statements).\n- \u00b7 Investments: Additions to property, plant and equipment (capital expenditures) plus long-term securities, intangible assets, long-term advances and investments in equity accounted investments, including amounts recognized in business combinations for continuing operations.\n- \u00b7 Net cash (debt): Short- and long-term interest-bearing debt adjusted for Hydro's liquidity positions.\n- \u00b7 Adjusted net cash (debt): Net cash (debt) adjusted for liquidity positions regarded unavailable for servicing debt, pension obligation and other obligations which are considered debt-like in nature.\n- \u00b7 Adjusted net cash (debt) to adjusted EBITDA ratio: Adjusted net cash (debt) / adjusted EBITDA\n- \u00b7 (Adjusted) RoaCE: (Adjusted) RoACE is defined as (Adjusted) 'Earnings after tax' divided by average 'Capital employed'. (Adjusted) 'Earnings after tax' is defined as (adjusted) 'Earnings before financial items and tax' less 'Adjusted income tax expense'. Since RoaCE represents the return to the capital providers before dividend and interest payments, adjusted income tax expense excludes the tax effects of items reported as 'Finance income (expense), net' and in addition, for adjusted figures, the tax effect of adjusting items. 'Capital employed' is defined as 'Shareholders' Equity', including non-controlling interest plus long-term and short-term interest-bearing debt less 'Cash and cash equivalents' and 'Short-term investments'.\n- \u00b7 Capital expenditure (Capex): 'Purchase of property, plant and equipment' plus 'Purchase of other Long-term investments', adjusted for elements that are not considered cash effective.\n- \u00b7 Cash effective change in net operating capital: Changes to 'Trade and other receivables' plus/minus changes to 'Inventories' plus/minus changes to 'Trade and other payables' as reported in the statements of cash flows.\n- \u00b7 Free cash flow: 'Net cash provided by operating activities' less 'Net cash used in investing activities', adjusted for 'Purchases of short-term investments, 'Sales of short-term investments' and net cash received or paid for short- and long-term collateral.\n\n## Adjusting items to EBITDA, EBIT, net income (loss) and earnings per share\n\nHydro has defined two categories of items which are adjusted to results in all business areas, equity accounted investments and at group level. One category is the timing effects, which are unrealized changes to the market value of certain derivatives. When realized, effects of changes in the market values since the inception of the instrument are included in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT. Changes in the market value of the trading portfolios are included in adjusted results. The other category includes material items which are not regarded as part of underlying business performance for the period, such as major rationalization charges and closure costs, effects of disposals of businesses and operating assets, major impairments of property, plant and equipment, as well as other major effects of a special nature, and realized effects of currency derivatives entered into for risk management purposes. Materiality is defined as items with a value above NOK 20 million. All adjusting items to results are reflecting a reversal of transactions recognized",

Hydro uses this measure to drive financial performance. Hydro has increased the use of financial derivatives for risk management purposes compared to previous periods. The definition of free cash flow was therefore amended in 2021 to exclude the impact from changes in collateral. In addition, an adjustment is made for the cash effect from net sales (purchases) of trading securities, as these are related to liquidity management activities and do not reflect the underlying cash generation from business activities. Hydro believes this is a better illustration of the underlying cash generation in the group. The values include continuing operations only.\n\n| NOK million                                                 | 2022     | 2021    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|\n| Net cash provided by operating activities 1)                | 29,393   | 10,680  |\n| Adjusted for changes in collateral 2)                       | (3,187)  | 4,582   |\n| Adjusted for Net (sales) purchases of trading securities 3) | (1,398)  | 1,441   |\n| Net cash used in investing activities 1)                    | (10,561) | (4,684) |\n| Adjusted for Purchases of short-term investments 1)         | 1,250    | 3,000   |\n| Adjusted for Sales of short-term investments 1)             | (1,500)  | (4,500) |\n| Free cash flow (continuing operations)                      | 13,997   | 10,519  |\n\n.\n\n## Adjusted net cash (debt) and adjusted net cash (debt) to adjusted EBITDA ratio\n\nHydro's capital management measures are described in note 7.1 Capital management in the Financial statements, including reconciliations and comparable information\n\n## Adjusted Return on average Capital Employed (RoaCE)\n\nHydro uses adjusted RoaCE to measure the performance for the group as a whole and within its operating segments, both in absolute terms and comparatively from period to period. Management views this measure as providing additional understanding of the rate of return on investments over time in each of its capital intensive businesses and in the operating results of its business segments. RoaCE is calculated as (Adjusted) EBIT after tax divided by average Capital employed for the respective period. The definition of capital employed was amended during 2021 to be consistent with the amended definition of Net cash (debt), and excludes long-term collateral.\n\nCapital employed for 2021 excludes Assets held for sale and Liabilities in disposal groups, as results from the divested Hydro Rolling business is separately reported as Income (loss) from discontinued operations.\n\n## Earnings after tax\n\n|                                | Reported   | Reported   | Underlying   | Underlying   |\n|--------------------------------|------------|------------|--------------|--------------|\n| NOK million                    | 2022       | 2021       | 2022         | 2021         |\n| EBIT                           | 30,715     | 17,887     | 31,179       | 20,786       |\n| Adjusted Income tax expense 1) | (7,489)    | (4,314)    | (7,654)      | (5,255)      |\n| Earnings after tax             | 23,226     | 13,572     | 23,525       | 15,531       |\n\n## Capital employed\n\n| NOK million                                     | Dec 31  2022   | Sep 30  2022              | Jun 30  2022   | Mar 31  2022   | Dec 31  2021   | Sep 30  2021   | Jun 30  2021 Mar 31  2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------------------|\n| Current assets in continuing operations 2)      | 55,149         | 64,723                    | 65,122         | 55,912         | 46,027         | 39,689         | 36,952  31,439              |\n| Property, plant and equipment                   | 62,656         | 62,369                    | 58,920         | 56,599         | 54,605         | 54,642         | 56,353  53,890              |\n| Other non-current assets 3)                     | 46,728         | 51,007                    | 46,876         | 45,932         | 42,250         | 42,144         | 41,951  39,749              |\n| Current liabilities in continuing operations 4) | (36,061)       | (38,356)                  | (39,880)       | (37,666)       | (33,140)       | (27,277)       | (25,494) (21,498)           |\n| Non-current liabilities 4)                      | (21,984)       | (23,502)                  | (24,309)       | (26,418)       | (24,574)       | (27,020)       | (24,643) (22,402)           |\n| Capital Employed                                |                | 106,488  116,241  106,728 |                | 94,360         | 85,167         | 82,177         | 85,119  81,178              |\n\n## Return on average Capital Employed (RoaCE) 7)\n\n|       | Reported   | Reported   | Adjusted   | Adjusted   |\n|-------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|       | 2022       | 2021       | 2022       | 2021       |\n| Hydro | 21.9 %     | 16.3 %     | 22.2 %     | 18.6 %     |",

September 2022 a new High Price Contribution for hydropower related income for power prices above 0,7 NOK/ KWh was introduced. The effect of this is limited for Hydro as the majority of our production is sold at contract prices below the threshold.\n\n## Taxation in Brazil\n\nPayments to authorities per project and authority (exploration and extractive activities, alumina refining and aluminium production) in 2022 is presented in the first table below.\n\n## Other tax contributions to authorities in Brazil\n\nThe Brazilian tax system is complex and volatile. In addition to the direct taxes reported above on income, profit and production, Brazil has several indirect taxes levied at the federal and state levels, and other taxes levied at the municipal level.\n\nFor Hydro, there are three relevant indirect tax mechanisms not covered by the country-by-country requirements, i.e., ICMS and PIS/COFINS.\n\nICMS is a Brazilian indirect state tax on the sale of goods, freight and certain services. ICMS is intended a noncumulative tax, which means that sales are generating ICMS debits with the seller, and purchases are generating ICMS credits with the buyer. However, as export transactions are exempt from ICMS and not generating ICMS debits, exporters accumulate ICMS credits that cannot be offset with any other taxes. As ICMS is an indirect tax, the amounts are reported as expenses in Hydro's financial statements rather than as income tax.\n\nIn the state of Par\u00e1, Hydro is subject to an ICMS deferral which aiming to prevent accumulation of ICMS credits, as well as to reduce net payable ICMS. Hydro's operations in Para generates ICMS tax revenue to the state mostly on local purchases of electricity (Albras), diesel and fuel oil, and on sale of goods to customers located outside the state.\n\nIn 2015, the state of Par\u00e1 granted a renewal of the ICMS deferral until 2030 for Hydro Paragominas, Hydro Alunorte and Albras This deferral aims to prevent accumulation of ICMS credits as well as to reduce net payable ICMS. The ICMS deferral is conditional upon Hydro's fulfilment\n\n## Country-by-country report\n\nHydro's country by country report has been developed to comply with legal requirements as stated in the Norwegian Accounting Act \u00a73-3d and the Norwegian Security Trading Act \u00a75-5a, valid from 2014, and updated in 2017, and replaces our former reporting on payments to host governments according to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Our reporting includes, and goes beyond, the EITI requirements. According to the Norwegian Accounting Act, the country-by-country reporting should be on a project level, and payments should be reported per public authority. Following a thorough evaluation, we have defined 'project' as legal entity in the report, and 'public authority' as the three levels federal; state(s); and municipality(-ies).\n\nThe reporting requirement applies to Hydro as a Norwegian listed company with exploration and extractive activities. Currently, this includes Hydro's consolidated operations in Brazil, through exploration and extractive activities in Paragominas, in the state of Par\u00e1. On a voluntary basis, and in line with our EITI reporting since 2005, we also include the alumina refinery Alunorte. Alumina is refined from bauxite and is the commercial product from Hydro's Bauxite & Alumina business area.\n\nHydro's primary aluminium production facility Albras is also closely linked to the extraction of raw materials in Par\u00e1. In order to better illustrate the tax contribution from Hydro's aluminium value chain in Par\u00e1, Albras is included on a voluntary basis in the country-by-country report. In addition, Hydro voluntarily report on indirect tax contributions not covered by the requirements in the country by country report.\n\nTo comply with the Norwegian country-by-country regulation, Hydro is required to report on certain information at corporate level related to legal entities, where they are registered, number of employees, and interest paid to other legal entities in Hydro within another jurisdiction. It is also required to give a short description of each legal entity's activities, revenue, income before tax, tax accrued and paid in the reporting year, and accumulated earnings. For additional reporting in accordance with the GRI 207 Tax standard, please see Hydro's GRI index.\n\nThe Country-by-country report is approved by the board of directors and included in their responsibility statement.\n\n## Taxation\n\n## Global tax policy\n\nHydro is committed to sustainable value-creation for its stakeholders, and the communities where it operates. Hydro's global tax policy regulates the global framework for tax management and governance in the group, is updated yearly in response to regulatory changes and in dialogue with internal and external stakeholders. Most recent update in 2021 particularly considered sustainability focus, comments from Ministry of Trade, Industry and Fisheries (NFD), and a comparative study with peers. The policy was approved by Hydro Board of Directors in May 2022 and is published on Hydro.com. Hydro is committed to transparency and accuracy in its tax management and based on a principle to pay taxes where the economic value is generated.\n\nIn addition to this section, tax related disclosures are found in note S7 Current income tax to the Sustainability statements, and in the Risk section.\n\n## Taxation of hydropower production in Norway\n\nProfits from Hydro's hydropower production in Norway are subject to ordinary income tax at 22 percent for the income year 2022. Revenue for ordinary income tax purposes is based on realized prices. Dams, tunnels, and power stations are, for tax purposes, depreciated on a linear basis over 67 years, and machinery and generators over 40 years. However, such fixed assets are depreciated over the concession period if that is shorter. Transmission and other electrical equipment are depreciated at a 5 percent declining balance.\n\nA natural resource tax of NOK 13 per MWh is currently levied on water-generated electricity. The tax is fully deductible from the ordinary income tax.\n\nIn addition, a special resource rent tax, is imposed on hydropower production in Norway. For income year 2022 the effective tax rate was increased from 37 percent to 45 percent. All new investments and upgrade/maintenance cost can be expensed/excluded from the basis for the resource rent tax. The marginal tax rate for 2022 increased from 59 percent to 67 percent.",

All obligations are related to verticalization of the aluminium value chain in the state of Par\u00e1, contribution to development in the region and enabling sustainable growth in the state.\n\nFor more information about ICMS deferral, see risk review 11. Material tax change.\n\nPIS and COFINS are two federal social contribution taxes charged on gross income, in most cases at a rate of 9.25 percent. Hydro entities in Brazil are charged under a noncumulative system that resembles VAT. Like for ICMS, export transactions are exempted. As a result, Brazilian exporters, like Alunorte , accumulate credits that can be either reimbursed or offset against debts of other federal taxes.\n\nIn addition to the indirect taxes described above, Brazilian municipalities levy a property tax. The property tax, IPTU, is a tax levied on the ownership or possession of urban land and property located in the urban area within the municipality. IPTU is due yearly based on the value of the property, according to rates and conditions foreseen in each municipality's legislation.\n\nThe following table includes Hydro entities operating in the state of Par\u00e1.",

In the table below both revenue streams are included per legal entity, but in Hydro's consolidated financial statements all internal transactions have been eliminated to arrive at Hydro's revenue. The sum of the different items for Hydro's subsidiaries will therefore not add up to the respective consolidated figures.\n\nIn order to present a Grand Total in the country by country report that is comparable to Hydro's consolidated financial statements, we have included all group eliminations as a separate line. These include, but are not limited to, eliminations of internal revenue and cost, internal receivables and payables, distributed profit such as dividends within the group, goodwill and excess values not attributable to individual legal entities, accumulated profits allocated to noncontrolling interests and all joint operations and joint ventures.\n\nAssets and liabilities in subsidiaries that have been acquired have been remeasured to fair value in Hydro's financial statements. This value adjustment, often referred to as excess value, represents the difference between the fair value of the company as paid by Hydro, and the carrying value of assets and liabilities as recognized by the subsidiary at the time of purchase. This premium is not reflected in the subsidiaries local statutory reporting. Due to this, figures reported in Hydro's country by country report are not necessarily comparable to the entities' local statutory reporting. Acquired entities are included from the date of acquisition. As a result of rounding adjustments, the figures in one or more of the columns in the table below may not add up to the total of that column.\n\nThe information is included in the independent auditor's assurance report.",

In 2022, we have developed a framework for supporting a just transition and established a forum for Human Rights in Hydro. Solutions for increased traceability and transparency of sustainability data in the value chain has been piloted with some key customers during 2022. A roadmap for implementation across all business areas by 2025 is developed. We educated almost 25,000 people as part of our ambition to provide quality education and capacity building to 500,000 people by 2030, achieving 31 percent of the target on aggregate. Moreover, we contributed NOK 69 million in community investments, charitable donations and sponsorships around the world.\n\nThe total recordable injury rate was 2.4 per million hours worked in 2022, an improvement from 3.3 in 2021. The majority of injuries were classified as minor, with one life chang -ing injuries and zero fatalities recorded during the year.\n\nThe diversity, inclusion and belonging strategy was further developed in 2022 and implementation is continuing in all business areas. Our gender balance increased improved by 2 percentage points, with 22 percent of the Hydro workforce comprising women by the end of 2022.\n\n## Sustainability reporting\n\nThese Sustainability statements include detailed performance indicators and our principles for measuring and reporting sustainability performance. The Sustainability statements should be read together with the Sustainability chapter, which presents Hydro's management of material climate, environmental and social issues. Our materiality assessment is presented in the section on Sustainability reporting the Hydro way, in the Governance chapter.\n\n## Sustainability statements\n\nSustainability is an integrated part of Hydro's strategy to lift long-term profitability and positioning in the market. By reducing our footprint, improving relations with stakeholders and neighbors, managing impacts, increasing resource efficiency and developing new markets, Hydro will reduce risk and create new opportunities. We have quantified ambitions towards 2030 and 2050 that will improve our performance on climate, environment, and social responsibility.\n\n## Climate performance\n\nHydro's ambition is to be a net-zero company by 2050 or earlier, delivering net-zero products and enabling a netzero society. In 2022, Hydro's total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were 6.5 percent lower than the 2018 climate strategy baseline, and we are still on track in to deliver on our target of total emission reductions of 10 percent by 2025. We recycled 321,000 tonnes of post-consumer aluminium scrap, enabling the production of 100 tonnes of CIRCAL with 100 percent post-consumer scrap, and 50,000 tonnes of Hydro CIRCAL based on aluminium made with a minimum of 75% recycled post-consumer aluminium scrap. In 2022, Hydro has also set reduction targets for scope 3 emissions towards 2030 - a 15 percent reduction in total emissions and a 30 percent reduction in scope 3 emissions per tonne aluminium delivered to market, both from a 2018 baseline.\n\n## Environmental performance\n\nThe goal of Hydro's environment strategy is to minimize impact across our operations by addressing environmental challenges. In 2022, we met our rehabilitation target for our mining site in Paragominas, Brazil and established a Global Procedure on biodiversity and ecosystem services management. We have a target to eliminate all recoverable waste generated by our operations, by 2040. In 2022, we recycled 71 percent of our waste and have started to develop specific roadmaps to eliminate the landfilling of the remaining recoverable waste. For bauxite tailings and residue, specifically, the Tailings Dry Backfill (TDB) methodology, implemented in 2021, has eliminated the need to build new tailings storage facilities in Paragominas. We continue R&D activities into bauxite residue reuse. In 2022, 66 percent of tailings generated at our mine were diverted to temporary storage for drying with the TDB method.",

This applies to all Hydro's operations, including consolidated subsidiaries, if not otherwise stated. Such data are based on the corporate reporting system for incident reporting, IMS and Synergi. The units report incidents to the systems on a regular basis in accordance with a corporate procedure on HSE incidents and sick leave data. Employee data are reported based on Hydro's SAP system.\n\nWhere applicable, we have indicated to which GRI Standards disclosure the different notes or parts of the notes are applicable. Please refer to our GRI Index for more information at: Hydro.com/gri.\n\n## Main reporting changes\n\nHydro's Annual Report 2022 has been restructured so that the sustainability chapter corresponds to the material sustainability topics identified in the Materiality assessment. We have made changes to the reporting on E4.2 Water to be better aligned with ICMM requirements and GRI Standard 303 (2018). Information on Ethics and compliance has been moved from the Governance chapter to the Sustainability chapter. Other changes to the sustainability reporting are minor and described in the Materiality assessment.\n\n## Assurance principles and scope\n\nWe have requested our company auditor to review our sustainability reporting 2022 and provide limited assurance over the reporting in accordance with the international audit standard ISAE 3000 - Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information (revised), issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB). The external auditor's limited assurance report is attached.\n\n## Sustainability reporting\n\n## About the reporting\n\n## Principles for sustainability reporting\n\nThe purpose of Hydro's reporting is to provide stakeholders with a fair and balanced picture of relevant aspects, engagements, practices and results for 2022 at a corporate level. We believe that the reporting in total satisfies this purpose. Our reporting on sustainability is aligned with the main reporting principles of the GRI Standards and the requirements of the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM). The selection of elements reported is based on extensive dialogue with stakeholders. In addition, the reporting builds on processes that are part of our daily operations. Important stakeholders include authorities, investors and financial analysts, employees and their representatives, potential employees, customers, non-governmental organizations and local communities affected by major development projects or restructuring processes. Reporting is not necessarily the target of the dialogue process, but when relevant, we use the outcome to improve our reporting, see Stakeholder dialogue.\n\nWe have endeavored to provide information that is in accordance with the principles of sound reporting practice. The absence of generally accepted reporting standards and practices in certain areas may nevertheless make it difficult to compare results with reports compiled by other companies, without the availability of further data, analyzes and interpretations.\n\nThe information in the Governance and Sustainability chapters in the annual report have been approved by the Board of Directors, while the Environmental and social statements have been approved by the Corporate Management Board.\n\n## Reporting scope and limitations\n\nThe scope of the sustainability reporting in Hydro's Annual Report 2022, is Hydro's global organization for the period January 1 to December 31, 2022.Operations sold or demerged during the year have in general not been included. Health and safety data for all previously consolidated operations are, however, included in the historical data for the period the unit was owned by Hydro. Climate and environmental data (emissions, energy consumption etc.) for new operations or operations acquired during the reporting year are included for the year in full. Data from operations that have been closed down, are included for the part of the reporting period it was under operation unless otherwise stated. Minority-owned operations are not included in the reported data except from data based on ownership equity (certain greenhouse gas emissions data), certain qualitative information as well as additional data for 50/50-owned companies presented in see note E8 Environmental data for 50/50-owned companies and note S14 Social data for 50/50-owned companies.\n\nData have been prepared from individual reports in accordance with corporate procedures. Data compiled at each operational unit according to local management systems applicable at the respective operational units are typically based on process data systems, measurements, calculations and/or purchasing data. The data are then aggregated at corporate level, and is not intended to include detailed information that is primarily of significance for individual sites, processes, activities and products.\n\nThe reporting is based on input from many units and sources of data. Emphasis has been placed on ensuring that the information is neither incomplete nor misleading. However, the scope of the reporting, and varying certainty of data may result in some inherent uncertainties. Please see \"Reporting principles\" for the specific note to the environmental or social statements for more details.\n\nClimate, environment, energy and resource data are reported through the corporate data reporting tool HERE on an annual basis covering all consolidated operational units (defined as Hydro's ownership share exceeding 50 percent). Data reported to HERE should be based on specific environmental, energy and resource data reporting processes that have been established for management purposes at site, business unit, business area, and corporate level within Hydro. Data are reported on a 100 percent basis for all consolidated operational units if not otherwise stated.\n\nData reported in HERE are compiled at each operational unit according to local environmental management systems and typically based on process data, measurements, calculations and/or purchasing data. Climate and environmental performance data for December 2022 are estimated based on monthly average from the year to date, previous year data or planned production volumes.",

PFC (perfluorocarbon) emissions are calculated based on automatic process measurements. PFC emissions comprise the two greenhouse gases CF4 and C2F6 which are formed during anode effect situations in the aluminium electrolytic cells. Anode effect is mainly a result of production instability, e.g. in connection to power outages. The reported direct emissions are comparable to Scope 1 emissions as defined by the GHG protocol.\n\nIndirect GHG emissions are calculated based on Hydro's consumption of electricity. Reported indirect emissions cover GHG emissions from purchased electricity and emissions from Hydro's ownership share in the gas-fired power plant at Qatalum. The reported indirect emissions are comparable to scope 2 emissions according to the GHG protocol. We report indirect emissions according to the location-based method in the revised GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, based on emissions factors from the International Energy Agency (IEA). For our operations in Canada and the primary aluminum producer Albras in Brazil, indirect emissions reflect the regional grid mix. For Hydro's Annual Report 2022 we have updated the factors back to 2018, and historical figures have been updated accordingly. We have chosen not to report indirect emissions according to the market-based approach.\n\nGHG emissions based on ownership equity are calculated based on our ownership share as per year end 2022. The reported emissions includes Hydro's share of emissions from all operations including non-consolidated operations where Hydro has a minority interest. The emissions are reported per segment, and by country.\n\nIndirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions are reported for emissions related to purchased goods and services, fuel and energy related activities, upstream transportation and distribution, downstream transportation and distribution, and processing of sold products. The calculation and reporting of our Scope 3 emissions are based on the IAI Scope 3 Calculation Tool Guidance.\n\nGHG intensity of alumina refining is calculated based on the total GHG emissions and production volumes at our Alunorte alumina refinery. The reported GHG intensity covers all alumina refining in Hydro.\n\nGHG intensity of the electrolysis process is calculated based on greenhouse gas emissions and production volumes in Hydro's smelters, based on ownership equity. This is an operational target that excludes extraordinary emissions resulting from e.g. start-up of curtailed capacity. The methodology for calculation is site specific, and historical figures may be subject to change.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nE1.1\n\nTotal greenhouse gas emissions in consolidated activities\n\nTotal direct and indirect (Scope 1 and Scope 2) GHG emissions in Hydro consolidated activities.

The emissions reductions in primary aluminium is primarily linked to the production stop at our Slovalco plant in 2022. The implementation of electric boilers for steam generation at Alunorte and process improvements resulted in improvements to specific emissions (ie. emissions per tonne product produced) compared to 2021, while the curtailments announced in the fourth quarter 2022 has resulted in less stable production and a consequent increased PFC emissions at the associated primary aluminium smelters.\n\nProduction at our alumina refinery Alunorte in Bauxite & Alumina was impacted by the embargo in 2018 and 2019, and returned to normal levels during 2020. To learn more about the embargo imposed on Alunorte in 2018, see Hydro's Annual Report 2018 and the section 'The Alunorte situation'.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions per country - consolidated activities\n\n| Million tonnes CO2e   |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Brazil                |   5.46 |   5.61 |   4.83 |   4.3  |   3.8  |\n| Direct                |   4.44 |   4.64 |   4.23 |   3.73 |   3.29 |\n| Indirect              |   1.02 |   0.98 |   0.59 |   0.57 |   0.51 |\n| Norway                |   2.04 |   2.12 |   1.95 |   2    |   1.93 |\n| Direct                |   1.97 |   2.05 |   1.84 |   1.82 |   1.77 |\n| Indirect              |   0.07 |   0.07 |   0.11 |   0.18 |   0.16 |\n| Slovakia              |   0.3  |   0.63 |   0.56 |   0.67 |   0.72 |\n| Direct                |   0.14 |   0.3  |   0.28 |   0.31 |   0.32 |\n| Indirect              |   0.15 |   0.33 |   0.29 |   0.36 |   0.4  |\n| Other                 |   0.94 |   0.96 |   0.87 |   0.99 |   1.07 |\n| Direct                |   0.61 |   0.63 |   0.58 |   0.65 |   0.67 |\n| Indirect              |   0.32 |   0.33 |   0.29 |   0.34 |   0.4  |\n| Total GHG emissions   |   8.73 |   9.33 |   8.21 |   7.95 |   7.52 |",

Hydro regards the carbon footprint of process scrap as equal to its metal origin, Hydro's Scope 3 upstream emissions are significant when including externally sourced metal. Industry players who do not take the inherent carbon footprint of process scrap input into account will report significantly lower Scope 3 emissions. Hydro believes that this method of accounting is inaccurate, as it accounts for process scrap being carbon neutral, when in reality the process scrap has the same inherent carbon footprint as its metal origin. Hydro believes that we need to focus on what drives real change towards the green transition and we need to exercise our role as a responsible supplier and customer to influence the right development. If Hydro were to regard process scrap as carbon neutral, Hydro's upstream Scope 3 emissions would be significantly lower. See the section on Increasing recycling of aluminium in the Climate Change chapter of the annual report for more information.\n\nHydro's downstream Scope 3 emissions are dominated by processing of sold alumina. As this processing happens at aluminium smelters outside of Hydro's control, our ability to influence these emissions are limited. Nevertheless, reporting of these emissions contributes in giving a holistic perspective on the total emissions of the value chain of our sold products.\n\nHydro's targets on scope 3 emissions only includes upstream scope 3 emissions, as downstream scope 3 emissions are beyond Hydro's control.",

Other diffuse emissions are not included.\n\nFluorides cover emissions to air of gaseous and particulate fluorides from production of primary aluminium.\n\nNMVOC (non-methane volatile organic compounds) emissions to air stem primarily from Extrusions.\n\nPAH (poly-aromatic hydrocarbons) to air is primarily from anode production. Emissions to air are monitored according to PAH-16 US EPA and emissions to water are monitored according to PAH-16 US EPA.\n\nSulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide to air are primarily from the use of coal as an energy source in Alunorte, Brazil. Another large contributor to Hydro's total sulfur dioxide to air is related to the aluminium electrolysis process where the majority of the total emissions come from Albras in Brazil and Slovalco in Slovakia. SO2 emissions from the Norwegian smelters are considerably lower due to different waste gas treatment techniques used at these plants.\n\nSpills and leakages are reported when an incident results in a spill or leak, including significant spillages with short-term reversible damage. Spillages and leakages to the external environment (ground, water or air) are registered in Synergi and/or in IMS, our reporting tools for incidents regarding health, safety, security and environment. Spills and leakages reported in E2.2 comprise incidents that have resulted in emissions to the external environment that are categorized as severe or major, i.e. unintended and sustained spills and leakages. Spills and leakages are categorized as severe or major if the leakage is uncontained but the impact of the leakages is reversible, or where the leakage is uncontained and the impact is irreversible. A spillage or leakage can be reclassified according to changes in the actual consequence of the spillage or leakage, and historical figures are updated accordingly. Several reported incidents can be closely related and therefore classified as the same spillage.\n\nPermit breaches are reported when an incident occurs that in any way relates to an environmental permit. This definition is in certain cases stricter than the legal definition, i.e. not all reported incidents are related to breach of legal criteria in an environmental permit. The reported cases are based on monthly monitoring and reported in Synergi and/or in IMS. Permit breaches reported in E2.3 comprise breaches that are classified as severe or major, which mean the incidents require regulator contact and/or have led to permit breaches with possible fine or suspension. The reported permit breaches may be related to spillages and leakages covered in E2.2. Several reported incidents can be related to the same permit and will be reported as one breach. Historical figures may be subject to change due to time lag in administrative procedures.\n\n## E1.4 Direct GHG emissions per GHG type in consolidated activities\n\nBreakdown of reported direct GHG emissions, by greenhouse gas type\n\n## Direct GHG emissions per GHG type - consolidated activities\n\n| Million tonnes CO2e   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| CO2                   | 7.00   | 7.35   | 6.72   | 6.27   | 5.84   |\n| PFC                   | 0.17   | 0.27   | 0.20   | 0.24   | 0.20   |\n| Other                 | -      | -      | -      | -      | -      |\n| Total GHG emissions   | 7.17   | 7.62   | 6.93   | 6.51   | 6.05   |\n\n## E1.5 GHG intensity\n\nGHG intensity of our alumina refining at the Alunorte alumina refinery and GHG intensity of the electrolysis process from Hydro's smelters, based on ownership equity.\n\nGRI Reference: GRI Standards 305-4 (2016)\n\n## GHG intensity - Alumina refining at Alunorte alumina refinery\n\n|                          |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| mt CO2e per mt aluminium |   0.62 |   0.63 |   0.65 |   0.71 |   0.79 |\n\n## GHG Intensity - Electrolysis, based on ownership equity\n\n|                          |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |\n|--------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| mt CO2e per mt aluminium |   1.57 |   1.64 |   1.59 |    1.6 |    1.6 |\n\nThe implementation of electric boilers for steam generation at Alunorte and process improvements have resulted in an improvement in emissions per tonne alumina refined compared to 2022.\n\nSlovalco is excluded from 2022 due to production curtailment.

Additional improvements at Albras contributed to further reductions in fluorides to air. Lower heavy fuel oil consumption at Alunorte is the main driver for reduced nitrogen oxide emissions.\n\n2021 data on dust and particles and sulphur dioxide are updated to adjust for an error in calculated emissions from Alunorte.\n\nHydro's emissions of dust and particles, nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide decreased significantly in 2018 due to the embargo at Alunorte, and curtailment at Albras and Paragominas. This is partly reversed in 2019 and 2020 due to lifting of the embargo and ramp-up of production.\n\nIn addition to non-GHG emissions reported, above, Hydro reports estimated emissions of ozone-depleting substances. Hydro uses ozone depleting substances in certain applications in its Brazilian operations, and to some extent also in Extrusions. In 2022, Hydro used in total 6.5 metric tonnes of such substances in its operations. The reported value corresponds to the purchased amount of such substances and can vary significantly according to the need of refilling existing cooling devices. In Brazil, such substances are registered and reported according to Brazilian legal requirements. In Hydro Extrusions, hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) accounts for around one third of ozone depleting substances.\n\nElemental mercury is emitted to air in the refining process at Alunorte. Through a mass balance approach, this is estimated to equate ca. 3 metric tonnes per year, at full production. See the section on Environment in the Sustainability chapter for information on our initiatives to reduce mercury emissions.\n\nE2.2\n\n## Spillages and leakages\n\nTotal reported severe and major spills and leakages from Hydro consolidated activities.\n\nGRI-reference: GRI Standards 306-3 (2016)\n\n## Spillages and leakages to the external environment\n\n| 2022   | 2021   |   2020 |   2019 | 2018                       |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|----------------------------|\n| -      |        |      5 |      1 | Spillages, leakages 1 7 1) |\n\n- 1) The reported incidents mainly relate to leakages to air in Norway\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nE2.3\n\n## Permit breaches\n\nTotal reported severe and major permit breaches in Hydro consolidated activities.\n\n## Permit breaches\n\n|                 |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 | 2019   |   2018 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Permit breaches |      3 |      2 |     11 | 1 1)   |     23 |\n\n- 1) Figures for 2019 are not comparable to previous years due to harmonization of definitions between Extrusions and the other business areas in Hydro.\n\nPlease also see note S10.2 Non-compliance cases.",

Electricity derived from biofuels, waste, hydro, geothermal, solar, wind and tide are considered renewable.\n\nEnergy intensity of the alumina refining at Alunorte is calculated based on total energy consumption at Alunorte divided by total alumina production.\n\nEnergy intensity in Hydro's consolidated smelters is calculated based on direct current consumption in the electrolysis process per kg aluminium.\n\n## E3.1 Energy consumption and energy production\n\nTotal energy consumption in Hydro's consolidated activities, reported by energy carrier, sector use and country of consumption.\n\nGRI Reference: GRI Standards 302-1 (2016)\n\n## Energy consumption per energy carrier - consolidated activities 1)\n\n| Petajoule (PJ)                  |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Coal                            |   13.5 |   13.1 |   14   |   13.4 |   13.2 |\n| Coke                            |   14.8 |   16.1 |   15.9 |   15.4 |   14.8 |\n| Electricity                     |   98.6 |  102.1 |   97.8 |   95.7 |   88   |\n| Gasoline                        |    0   |    0   |    0   |    0   |    0.1 |\n| Natural gas                     |   12.2 |   12.4 |   11.9 |   13.1 |   13.6 |\n| Natural gas liquids             |    1   |    1   |    2   |    1.4 |    1.5 |\n| Oil                             |   26   |   28.9 |   23.7 |   19.1 |   15   |\n| Other                           |    5.9 |    5.9 |    5   |    4.6 |    3.5 |\n| Total energy consumption in PJ  |  171.8 |  179.5 |  170.3 |  162.6 |  149.7 |\n| Total energy consumption in TWh |   47.8 |   49.9 |   47.3 |   45.2 |   41.6 |\n\n- 1) With the sale of Hydro Rolling in 2021, we have excluded historical figures on energy consumption associated with the business area.",

Flocculants are also used at our Bauxite mine at Paragominas.\n\nWater is reported based on water withdrawals and water interactions. For disclosure on water withdrawals by country, we report separately on the three countries with the largest water withdrawal volumes and aggregate the rest under 'Rest of the World'. For disclosure on water interactions, across all of our operational assets and assets located in water-stressed areas, we have aligned with ICMM's minimum water reporting commitments, including their definitions of water quality (ICMM 2021. Water Reporting: Good practice guide, 2nd edition). From 2019, Hydro has used the WRI Aqueduct tool to analyze water withdrawal from water stressed areas, and historical data may not be comparable. Baseline water stress measures the ratio of total water withdrawals to available renewable surface and groundwater supplies. Areas categorized as high and extremely high with regard to baseline water stress are included in the reporting under note E4.2.\n\nRecycling is reported based on the amount of recycled aluminium scrap used in Hydro Aluminium Metal and Hydro Extrusions. Hydro uses a definition for recycling agreed on by the European Aluminium Association. The definition was implemented in Hydro in 2013. The definition divides recycled scrap in two: process scrap, which includes pre-consumer scrap from downstream casthouses, and post-consumer scrap. Reporting of recycling data is based on our production software and ERP system.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## E4.1 Materials\n\nMain raw materials used in the alumina refining process and electrolysis process in Hydro's consolidated activities.\n\nGRI Reference: GRI Standards 301-1 (2016)\n\n## Materials\n\n| 1,000 metric tonnes   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|-----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Alumina               | 3,113  | 3,323  | 3,032  | 2,954  | 2,858  |\n| Aluminium fluoride    | 28     | 32     | 32     | 31     | 28     |\n| Lime                  | 43     | 45     | 45     | 39     | 35     |\n| Caustic soda          | 620    | 590    | 513    | 435    | 353    |\n| Sulphuric acid        | 20     | 22     | 22     | 21     | 29     |\n| Flocculants           | 6      | 6      | 4      | 4      | 3      |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nE4.2\n\n## Water\n\nTotal water withdrawal by country and water interaction in Hydro consolidated activities.\n\nGRI reference: GRI Standards 303-3, 303-4 and 303-5 (2018)\n\n## Total water withdrawal by country\n\n| million m 3            | 2022    |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |\n|------------------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Norway                 | 218.1   |  216.1 |  224.8 |  218.4 |  218.1 |\n| Brazil                 | 62.6 1) |   67.1 |   54.5 |   58.7 |   57.8 |\n| United States          | 4.6     |    4.8 |    4.2 |    5   |    5.1 |\n| Rest of the world      | 4.0     |    4.6 |    3.9 |    5.1 |    5.6 |\n| Total water withdrawal | 289.3   |  292.7 |  287.5 |  287.2 |  286.6 |\n\n- 1) Includes 26,6 million m3 of rainwater that is treated and discharged.

These water sources are vast and are not significantly affected by Hydro's operations. All sea water withdrawal in Norway is used in fume treatment plants enabling the primary production smelters to clean dust, SO2 and fluoride emissions to air. Sea water absorbs the pollutants and mitigates the environmental impact from the production process.\n\nAlunorte receives a large volume of water, entrained in the bauxite product that it receives from Paragominas, through the pipeline. In 2022, Alunorte received 11.7 million m3 of freshwater from Paragominas. Alunorte is reusing more than 42 percent of this water in the refining process.\n\nIn 2022, approximately 74 percent of Paragominas' water demand was met by recovery of water from the beneficiation process, and 11 percent from water captured in the reservoirs. These actions have all contributed to reducing operational dependency on new water withdrawals from the Parariquara river.\n\n## Withdrawal from water-stressed areas\n\n| Million m 3                                 | High quality   | Low quality   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|---------------------------------------------|----------------|---------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of locations                         |                |               | 36     | 36     | 37     | 36     | 36     |\n| Water withdrawal, by source                 |                |               |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Surface water (e.g. river, stream, lake) 1) | -              | -             | -      | -      | -      | -      | -      |\n| Surface water withdrawal                    | -              | -             | -      | -      | -      | -      | -      |\n| Rainwater capture                           | -              | -             | -      | -      | -      | -      | -      |\n| Ground water                                | 0.1            | -             | 0.1    | 0.1    | 0.1    | 0.1    | 0.1    |\n| Seawater                                    | -              | -             | -      | -      | -      | -      | -      |\n| Third-party Supply (e.g. municipal)         | 0.7            | 0.2           | 0.9    | 0.9    | 0.8    | 0.9    | 1.0    |\n| Total Water withdrawal                      | 0.9            | 0.2           | 1.0    | 1.1    | 0.9    | 1.1    | 1.1    |\n| Water discharges, by destination            |                |               |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Surface water (e.g. river, stream, lake)    | 0.1            | -             | 0.1    | 0.1    | 0.1    | 0.1    | 0.1    |\n| Ground water                                | -              | -             | -      | -      | -      | -      | -      |\n| Seawater                                    | -              | -             | -      | -      | -      | -      | -      |\n| Third-party Supply (e.g. municipal)         | 0.1            | 0.5           | 0.6    | 0.7    | 0.6    | 0.7    | 0.7    |\n| Total water discharges in stressed areas    | 0.2            | 0.5           | 0.7    | 0.8    | 0.7    | 0.8    | 0.8    |\n| Water consumption, by type                  |                |               |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Evaporation                                 | 0.2            | -             | 0.2    | 0.2    | 0.2    | 0.2    | 0.3    |\n| Entrainment in product                      | -              | -             | -      | -      | -      | -      | -      |\n| Entrainment in waste                        | -              | -             | -      | -      | -      | -      | -      |\n| Process loss                                | -              | -             | -      | -      | -      | -      | -      |\n| Other                                       | -              | 0.1           | 0.1    | -      | -      | -      | -      |\n| Total water consumed in stressed areas      | 0.2            | 0.1           | 0.3    | 0.3    | 0.2    | 0.3    | 0.3    |\n| Water Reuse/Recycle                         |                |               |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Reuse/recycle                               | -              | -             | -      | -      | -      | -      | -      |\n| Total water Reused/Recycled                 | -              | -             | -      | -      | -      | -      | -      |\n\n- 1) From 2021 we have updated the definition of surface water to include rainwater and have updated previous years' data to reflect this.\n\nIn 2022, 32% of our operational assets were located in areas considered to have high or extremely high baseline water stress, representing less than 1% of Hydro's total freshwater withdrawals in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nE4.3\n\n## Aluminium recycling\n\nRecycled aluminium scrap used in Hydro Aluminium Metal and Hydro Extrusions.\n\n## Recycling 1)\n\n| 1,000 metric tonnes          | 2022   | 2021   |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Recycled post-consumer scrap | 321    | 335    |    104 |     98 |    104 |\n| Recycled pre-consumer scrap  | 963    | 1018   |    317 |    340 |    371 |\n| Total recycled metal         | 1 285  | 1 353  |    421 |    438 |    474 |\n\n- 1) 2021 is the first year we have consolidated recycling data from Hydro Extrusions, making the 2021 results not directly comparable to previous years' data\n\nWe have adjusted historical data on recycling to exclude volumes processed by Rolling which was sold in 2021, which accounted for approximately 840,000 metric tonnes of pre-consumer and post-consumer scrap in 2020.",

Paragominas is Hydro's only consolidated mine. In the Plateau tailings storage facility, the tailings undergo a drying cycle that can take approximately 30 or 60 days, during the dry and rainy season, respectively. After the drying process, the material has a minimum of 60 percent solid content and is then excavated and deposited back into the mined areas. This method is what Hydro refers to as 'Tailings Dry Backfill'. In 2022, 3.84 million cubic meter of dried material was reclaimed and returned to the mined areas.\n\nThere was a significant decrease in 2018 is due to the Alunorte embargo (bauxite residue) and the corresponding Paragominas curtailment (tailings). This is reversed from 2021 and onwards due to lifting of the embargo and ramp-up of production.\n\n## Impact Tailings Dry Backfill (TDB) from the Plateau Tailings Storage Facility\n\n| million Cubic meter (m3)                                  |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Tailings stored at the start of reporting year            |   6    |   3.73 |   4.08 |\n| Tailings deposited during reporting year                  |   3.07 |   3.67 |   2.66 |\n| Tailings excavated for TDB during reporting year          |   3.84 |   1.4  |   3.02 |\n| Tailings stored at the end of reporting year              |   5.22 |   6    |   3.73 |\n| Net change in tailing volume stored during reporting year |  -0.78 |   2.27 |  -0.36 |\n\n## Note E5 - Waste\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nTailings from bauxite extraction consist of mineral rejects from the extraction process mixed with water.\n\nBauxite residue , is a by-product of the alumina refining process. The residue is washed with water to lower the alkalinity, and recovered caustic soda is recycled for use in the production process. Residue is dry-stacked as a claylike substance with a low moisture content.\n\nWaste is measured and reported according to a harmonized categorization within Hydro, based on the common names of key waste streams relevant to our operations (e.g. bauxite residue, SPL, waste caustic soda). This facilitates aggregation of data at a group level and avoids the use of multiple waste codes for the same waste category. Operations maintain more detailed waste registries that align with local requirements and legislation.\n\nHazardous waste includes SPL from the electrolysis cells used in primary aluminium production. The production of SPL varies with the relining of smelter cells which is normally done every 4-7 years for established smelters. New plants will get a relining peak at the same interval after start-up. See also SPL figures on a five year rolling average in the Environment and social responsibility chapter. A significant amount of hazardous waste from the Extrusions business area is in the form of spent caustic resulting from the die cleaning process, with a large proportion of this being recycled.\n\nWaste treatment includes both onsite and offsite treatment. In many cases waste is managed by a third party, which is required to adhere to the Hydro Supplier Code of Conduct. A non-compliance with or breach of the principles in Hydro's Supplier Code of Conduct, that is not corrected within a reasonable period, may lead to termination of the supplier contract. All Hydro locations are required to ensure safe transport of hazardous waste in accordance with global and local regulations and evaluate critical waste receivers and include these in a supplier development system. Tailings and bauxite residue are deposited in appropriately engineered and managed on-site landfills, and are not included in waste treatment figures reported in note E5.3.",

This is the only mine within Hydro's consolidated operations.\n\nAreas are measured using the ArcGIS Platform, and is based on year end data.\n\nThe rehabilitation data are reported to ANM (the Brazilian National Mining Agency) and SEMAS (the Secretary of State for Environment and Sustainability in Par\u00e1), as part of the clearing permit renewal process.\n\nThreatened species i s classified using federal database updated by ICMBio researchers. The conservation status of species registered in the reference databases can change. As a result, the species list is updated and species added, removed and/or moved from one status to another.\n\nReported species are cumulative and represent all species observed within the premises of Hydro's mining activities in Paragominas, Brazil, since monitoring and registration started in 2003.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## E6.1 Overburden moved\n\nTotal volume (in metric tons) of overburden moved in mine within consolidated operations.\n\nGRI Reference: GRI Standards 303-4 (2018) and G4-MM3\n\n## Overburden moved\n\n| Million metric tonnes   |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |   2018 |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Overburden moved        |     82 |     79 |     67 |     45 |     48 |\n\nThe overburden volume increase in 2022 is considered within normal annual variation and the level of bauxite production in 2022. The increase from 2019 to 2020 is due to increased production following the lifting of the embargo and ram-up of the production levels.\n\nHydro uses strip mining in Paragominas, a technique that avoids the formation of an overburden stockpile. Thus, all overburden moved for mining purpose is used to reconstruct the topography of the strip previously mined, prior to rehabilitation of the mined areas. Part of the overburden (laterite) is also used for paving roads and for raising the heights of existing tailing dams and constructing new ones.\n\nThe sterile soil is untreated and has no dangerous properties. Leaching potential due to overburden removal is negligible. There is a water resource management program in place to mitigate silting from the plateau areas.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nE6.2\n\n## Land use and rehabilitation\n\nLand use and rehabilitation in Hydro's consolidated mining activities\n\nGRI Reference: G4-MM3\n\nIn our mining operation, we strive to rehabilitate the total mined area that is available for rehabilitation, within two hydrological cycles. This is what we refer to as our 1:1 rehabilitation target.\n\nThe mining cycle is made up of several steps. When a given area of land is to be developed, the first step is clearing, when vegetation and soil are removed. The area is then classified as area cleared for future mining. After an area is mined, it is either classified as tailings dams and other mining infrastructure or area available for rehabilitation. All areas available for rehabilitation will be rehabilitated as soon as possible and subsequently classified as an ongoing rehabilitation area.\n\nWhen tailings facilities are closed, they will become available for rehabilitation after settling for minimum five years. We will then get a significant increase in the tailings dam infrastructure available for rehabilitation. There may be additional movements between different statuses from year to year due to reclassification.\n\nDuring 2022, we cleared 507 hectares (ha) of land and mined 411 ha. A total area of 259 ha underwent rehabilitation in 2022, and an area of 182 ha was released from the mining operations, to be rehabilitated within two hydrological cycles as part of Hydro's 1:1 rehabilitation target. This area must be completely rehabilitated by the end of 2024 in order to meet this target.\n\nOf the 150 ha made available for rehabilitation in 2020, 100 percent was rehabilitated by end of 2022, and we met the 1:1 rehabilitation target. Of the 150 ha that were made available for rehabilitation in 2021, 89 percent was rehabilitated by the end of 2022 and the remaining 11 percent will be completed in 2023.\n\nThe clearing, mining and rehabilitation cycles are constantly ongoing and are not synchronized. Clearing and mining are at their peak in the dry season, whilst rehabilitation happens primarily in the wet season. The three cycles are also influenced by different drivers such as permits for the clearing cycle, land available for rehabilitation, and rainfall for the rehabilitation cycle. As a result, there is no direct link between the area cleared each year and the area mined or rehabilitated that same year (e.g. an area cleared in 2017 may be mined late 2018 and then rehabilitated in the 2019 wet season). Due in large part to this complexity, the figures presented above cannot be directly deducted from the figures in the land use and rehabilitation table below.",

Number of employees is based on where the employee actually is stationed, and will in some cases differ from the Country-by-country report, which shows in which legal company she or he is employed.\n- 2) Joint operations (Alunorf and Aluchemie from 2016 to 2019) are excluded from the payroll figures in the table above. Those entities are included in Hydro's financial statements on a line-by-line basis. Please see note 3.1 to the consolidated financial statements for more information about joint operations.\n- 3) Payroll figures for Extrusions is only available from 2018.\n- 4 ) The demerge of Rolling in 2021 reduced number of permanent employees by approx. 4,000, with the majority of these being in Germany.\n\n## Age distribution permanent employees\n\n|          | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   | 2018   |\n|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Under 30 | 14%    | 12%    | 14%    | 15%    | 15%    |\n| 30-49    | 53%    | 53%    | 52%    | 52%    | 52%    |\n| 50 +     | 33%    | 35%    | 34%    | 33%    | 33%    |\n\n## Note S1 - Employees\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nPermanent and temporary employees are based on data from Hydro's human resources SAP system. Data presented represent status at year end, December 31.\n\nPayroll is based on Hydro's consolidated financial statements. Payroll, as provided in the table below, does not include pension costs.\n\nTemporary employees include among others apprentices, but exclude contractor employees. Legal requirements and customs may vary from country to country, making direct comparison difficult. Agency workers that are engaged by Hydro for three months or longer are included in the numbers for temporary employees.\n\nNumber of full-time equivalents of contractor employees as included in the social statements is estimated based on the total hours worked by contractor employees (reported in Hydro's incident reporting system Synergi and IMS as basis for calculation of injury frequency) divided by 1,850 working hours per year. Contractor employees represented in total about 16,900 full-time equivalents during 2022. The majority relates to Hydro's Bauxite & Alumina activities.\n\nPart-time employees include all persons being employed in positions that are not full-time (less than 100 percent).\n\nThe total employee turnover rate includes resignations, retirements and manning reductions of all permanent employees, but excludes closures and divestments.\n\nVoluntary employee turnover rate includes permanent employees who voluntarily resigned in the reporting period.\n\nFor a very limited number of employees, we do not have gender information. These employee is included in the statistics as male.",

In Norway, sick leave was 5.8 percent in 2022 compared to 4.9 percent in 2021. Women in Norway had a sick leave rate of 7.1 percent, while men had 5.4 percent.\n\n## Parental leave\n\nIn 2022, men and women in Hydro Norway typically used the allocated numbers of parental leave in line with the national guidelines. Further details for Norway can be found in note S4.3.\n\nIn Brazil, the legal requirement is 120 days of maternity leave and five days of paternity leave. Since 2019, Hydro has offered 180 days of maternity leave and 10 days of paternity leave to all employees. In the U.S., there are no general legal rights for paid maternity and paternity leave. Hydro Extrusions North America offers four weeks of paid parental leave, in addition to six-eight weeks of maternity leave provided under its employee insurance. Hydro Precision Tubing in the U.S. offers six-eight weeks of paid maternity leave under its employee insurance program.\n\nIn 2022, Hydro conducted a mapping on our leave benefits in terms of maternity, paternity, adoption and sick leave in the 18 countries with the highest number of employees. The finding from this mapping is that Hydro are in line and competitive with local market practices. Further work related to the topic will be carried out in 2023 to review the opportunities linked to potential global policy in this area. In our employee engagement survey, we track perceptions of healthy balance between work and spare time, and found stress level as important indicators for a sustainable work environment.\n\nVoluntary employee turnover by age group, gender and country in 2022 1)\n\n|                   | Total   | Under 30   | 30-49   | 50+   |\n|-------------------|---------|------------|---------|-------|\n| Norway            | 3%      | 5%         | 5%      | 1%    |\n| Women             | 4%      | 5%         | 6%      | 0%    |\n| Men               | 3%      | 5%         | 5%      | 1%    |\n| Germany           | 4%      | 11%        | 4%      | 1%    |\n| Women             | 5%      | 13%        | 5%      | 2%    |\n| Men               | 3%      | 10%        | 4%      | 1%    |\n| France            | 3%      | 8%         | 3%      | 1%    |\n| Women             | 4%      | 17%        | 5%      | 1%    |\n| Men               | 3%      | 7%         | 3%      | 1%    |\n| Hungary           | 10%     | 22%        | 9%      | 7%    |\n| Women             | 12%     | 23%        | 10%     | 6%    |\n| Men               | 9%      | 21%        | 8%      | 7%    |\n| Other Europe      | 7%      | 16%        | 8%      | 3%    |\n| Women             | 7%      | 14%        | 7%      | 3%    |\n| Men               | 7%      | 17%        | 8%      | 3%    |\n| Brazil            | 5%      | 5%         | 5%      | 5%    |\n| Women             | 5%      | 3%         | 6%      | 2%    |\n| Men               | 4%      | 6%         | 4%      | 5%    |\n| United States     | 25%     | 53%        | 27%     | 12%   |\n| Women             | 30%     | 65%        | 33%     | 14%   |\n| Men               | 24%     | 51%        | 26%     | 12%   |\n| Rest of the world | 13%     | 34%        | 11%     | 5%    |\n| Women             | 14%     | 32%        | 10%     | 8%    |\n| Men               | 13%     | 34%        | 12%     | 5%    |\n| Total             | 10%     | 22%        | 10%     | 5%    |\n| Women             | 11%     | 21%        | 11%     | 5%    |\n| Men               | 9%      | 23%        | 9%      | 5%    |\n\n- 1) This is a new indicator, data from previous years is not accessible",

The compensation should also be holistic, performance oriented, transparent, fair and objective. Salaries in the organization are reviewed on a regular basis. There are no significant gender-pay differentials for employees earning collective negotiated wages in Norway and Brazil. We have evaluated salary differences for all Hydro employees in Hungary and based on our overall figures we find no significant gender related salary differences.\n\nWe have investigated the salary conditions for all Hydro employees in the U.S., including at the remelters, extrusion plants and precision tubing facilities. Based on our initial analysis, on average there are no significant gender-related salary differences in Extrusion North America. Also, in Brazil we do not see any gender-pay differentials for employees earning collectively negotiated wages.\n\nIn addition, we have included a gender-related compensation analysis starting in 2022 in countries where we have large presence.\n\n## Median ratio of women base salary over men's base salary for 2022 1)\n\n| Job level   | Belgium   | Denmark   | France   | Italy   | Norway   | Spain   | Sweden   | United  Kingdom   |\n|-------------|-----------|-----------|----------|---------|----------|---------|----------|-------------------|\n| Level 1     |           | 118%      |          |         | 100%     |         |          |                   |\n| Level 2     | 96%       | 100%      | 95%      | 95%     | 100%     | 88%     | 97%      | 89%               |\n| Level 3     | 104%      |           | 100%     |         | 106%     | 84%     | 96%      | 87%               |\n| Level 4-5   | 87%       | 86%       | 95%      | 110%    | 108%     | 86%     | 94%      | 93%               |\n| Level 6-7   | 106%      |           | 87%      | 88%     | 101%     | 88%     | 79%      | 80%               |\n| Level 8-9   |           |           |          |         | 94%      |         |          |                   |\n\n- 1) The data is based on annual base salary for permanent employees.

The aim is to increase knowledge and skills, and strengthen the learning culture in the organization. Typical courses include leadership & production development and programming.\n\nWe do not have full overview of all training in Hydro since it is often administered at a local level.

Engagement has improved from 2020. In 2018, Extruded Solutions was not part of the survey, and the results are thus not directly comparable. Engagement has improved and is now on par with the industry benchmark.\n\nThe engagement survey is a tool to work with organizational development, therefore the most important part is that teams discuss the results, implement actions and follow-up results.\n\n## S2.2\n\n## Annual total compensation ratio\n\nGRI-reference: GRI Standards 2-21 (2021)\n\nLast year, we started the process to obtain reliable data for calculating the median employee compensation per country, until this work is completed, we will present the ratio between the highest base salary and the median base salary for all permanent employees in Norway. This ratio equals 17.28. Additionally, we are currently in the process of conducting living wage gap analyses for our main operations and geographies, which we aim to finalize in 2023. This will contribute to a better understanding of median pay in all of our operations.\n\nPlease see our Remuneration report in the Appendices to the annual report for more information on highest paid salary.\n\n## S2.3 Standard entry level wage\n\nGRI reference: GRI Standards 202-1 (2016)\n\nEntry level wages have been checked for some significant locations of operation. In Brazil, entry level wages are controlled by the labor agreement. We looked into salary differences in 2022, and the ratio compared to national minimum wage in Albras was 1.25 and for both genders, 1.16 for both genders in Alunorte and 1.6 for women and 1.7 for men in Paragominas.\n\nIn Norway, the entry level wages are defined by tariff agreements. In the Norwegian operations, minimum entry wage for staff with certificates of apprenticeship is about 9 percent higher than the tariff minimum.\n\nFor Hydro Extrusions' significant location of operation, Hungary, we have reviewed entry level wage. The standard entry level wage ratio is 1.5 compared to the national minimum wage. In the USA, Hydro's most significant country of operations based on number of employees, the ratio of entry level wages across all sites to the federal minimum wage was 2.5, and are higher than applicable state level minimum wages at all sites.",

Open positions in Hydro are normally posted at hydro.com and in local media. To secure competence transfer, it is important that there are also senior employees with experience from other units. This may also be the case at the blue-collar level, especially during start-up of new plants or equipment.",

For a description of our approach and work related to diversity and inclusion in Hydro, the activities being undertaken to identify and analyze risk of discrimination, see Our People chapter.\n\nWe reported last year on pay equality and involuntary part-time, and will report next year again in accordance have the Norwegian Equality and Anti-Discrimination Act.\n\nPart-time employees normally work full time. The opportunity to work part time is considered a benefit for which a special application must be made. In 2021, we reviewed if there were any cases of involuntary part-time work in our Norwegian activities. The review confirmed that all employees working part time had applied for reduced working hours. See note S1.2 for more information.\n\n## Hydro Monitor results for Norwegian subsidaries for 2022\n\n|                             | Employee  Engagement Index (EEI)   | Psycosocial Risk  Index (PRI)   | Integrity Culture  Index (ICI)   | Inclusion Index   |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Norsk Hydro ASA 1)          | 74%                                | 75%                             | 75%                              | 76%               |\n| Women                       | 75%                                | 74%                             | 77%                              | 79%               |\n| Men                         | 73%                                | 74%                             | 75%                              | 75%               |\n| Hydro Aluminium AS          | 71%                                | 72%                             | 72%                              | 72%               |\n| Women                       | 76%                                | 76%                             | 77%                              | 74%               |\n| Men                         | 71%                                | 73%                             | 72%                              | 71%               |\n| Hycast AS                   | 48%                                | 58%                             | 55%                              | 81%               |\n| Women                       | 40%                                | 48%                             | 47%                              | 81%               |\n| Men                         | 49%                                | 61%                             | 57%                              | 81%               |\n| S\u00f8r-Norge Aluminium         | 73%                                | 74%                             | 74%                              | 81%               |\n| Women                       | 72%                                | 73%                             | 71%                              | 81%               |\n| Men                         | 73%                                | 74%                             | 74%                              | 81%               |\n| Hydro Energy AS             | 80%                                | 81%                             | 86%                              | 76%               |\n| Women                       | 83%                                | 76%                             | 83%                              | 76%               |\n| Men                         | 79%                                | 82%                             | 86%                              | 76%               |\n| Hydro Extruded Solutions AS | 92%                                | 92%                             | 92%                              | 76%               |\n| Women                       | 97%                                | 96%                             | 96%                              | 75%               |\n| Men                         | 90%                                | 85%                             | 85%                              | 76%               |\n| Hydro Extrusion Norway AS   | 63%                                | 78%                             | 71%                              | 76%               |\n| Women                       | 62%                                | 70%                             | 63%                              | 75%               |\n| Men                         | 62%                                | 81%                             | 73%                              | 76%               |\n\n- 1) Includes all employess in Norway.",

We also identify and share best practices more effectively through our HSE auditing process and use of digital tools, in addition to continuously improve our procedures, guidance documents, training and HSE tools.\n\nDespite zero fatal accidents in 2022, we have sadly recorded one fatality in February 2023, when a contractor employee at minority-owned MRN lost his life in an accident involving a vehicle. At the time of publishing our annual report, the accident is under investigation by the police and MRN.\n\nWe have a fatality prevention protocols and associated lifesaving rules and behaviours across all business areas. The fatality prevention protocols, also known as the 'critical seven', are:\n\n- \u00b7 Energy Isolation (Lockout, Tagout and Verify, LOTO etc.)\n- \u00b7 Fall Prevention (working at height, below floor level, falling objects etc.)\n- \u00b7 Mobile Equipment (free moving vehicles such as forklift trucks, traffic management)\n- \u00b7 Overhead Crane Safety (overhead travelling crane, mobile crane, tower crane etc.)\n- \u00b7 Confined Space Entry (entering tanks, pits etc.)\n- \u00b7 Molten Metal Safety (preventing explosion)\n- \u00b7 Contractor Management (preventing injury during projects and other work to contractors and those providing contracted services)\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nEmployees are workers under direct supervision of Hydro. For the purpose of recording health and safety statistics, employees includ agency workers. Health and safety statistics for employees are included for the period they are employed by or otherwise in service for Hydro.\n\nContractors are workers who are under contract to execute work for Hydro, and who are under the direct supervision of the contractor, but who operate at Hydro premises under Hydro's indirect supervision. Contractors are included during the period they are employed by or otherwise in service for Hydro.\n\nTotal recordable injuries (TRI) is calculated as the sum of LTI + RWC + MTC. See definitions of the components further down. TRI rate is calculated per one million hours worked.\n\nLost time injury (LTI) is a personal injury at work leading to unfitness for work and absence beyond the day of the accident.\n\nRestricted work case (RWC) is a personal injury at work that does not lead to absence beyond the day of the accident, because of alternative job assignment.\n\nMedical treatment case (MTC) is treatment, other than first aid, administered by a physician or registered professional personnel under the standing orders of a physician.\n\nAbsenteeism for Hydro globally includes all absence due to injuries, work related and other illness, measured as number of hours lost due to sick leave as percent of number of hours worked plus number of hours lost due to sick leave.\n\nSick leave includes all absence due to illness, measured as number of days lost due to sick leave as percent of number of possible working days excluding holidays. There are challenges in ensuring consistent reporting practice on sick leave across the company due to legislative and cultural differences between countries.\n\nHigh risk incidents include major accidents and incidents with major potential. High risk incidents (HRI) rate is calculated as the number of high risk incidents per million hours worked, employees and contractors combined.\n\nOccupational illness rate measures occupational ill health. It is required as a minimum that all potential cases shall be reported. Actual occupational illnesses are defined by Hydro as illnesses that:\n\n- \u00b7 have been confirmed by relevant authorities/insurance companies or doctors (depending on the national system)\n- \u00b7 have led to any kind of permanent disability, disablement pension, loss of function and/or are a listed occupational disease\n\nStandardized statistics, as defined above, are prepared and reported to management on a monthly basis based on data registered in Synergi and IMS, the reporting tools for incidents regarding health, safety, security and environment. Data covers all organizational units within Hydro, including sales offices and administrative functions.",

The most dominant types of recordable injuries in 2022 were associated with ergonomics and falls. Injuries to fingers, hands and arms, representing 58 percent of all injuries with legs, knees, ankles and feet 25 percent, the upper body 6 percent and the head 11 percent.

The numbers include discontinued operations.\n\nReporting of work-related ill-health cases has improved and will continue in 2023 through clarification of reporting requirements in the relevant procedure and guideline. Development is tracked through a corporate reporting tool.\n\nThe majority of ill-health cases reported for 2022 were related to exposure to noise (hearing threshold shifts), musculoskeletal disorders, and two occupational asthma cases. We use our proactive tool for work environment risk assessment (WERA) to identify health risk and implement risk reducing measures e.g. substitution of hazardous chemicals, noise reduction, personal protective equipment to avoid development of new occupational illness cases. Through the work we have reduced the frequency of occupational illness cases related to noise and pot room asthma.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nS5.4\n\n## Wellness\n\nHydro cares about the health and wellbeing of our employees, and offers a variety of initiatives to promote physical and mental health.\n\nThe majority of Hydro's sites offer wellness initiatives, ranging from healthy eating, exercise opportunities, weight management, stop smoking campaigns and work-life balance management. Several sites have access to a social worker or counselor to address psychological health and safety, and health and wellness is also addressed at site Health and safety-day events.\n\nThe focus on Health and wellbeing has continued in 2022 with a stress management pilot including a more in-depth stress risk assessment. Following the pilot a number of tools were developed to support future stress risk assessments such as E-learning training aimed at general awareness and for leaders, management competency tool and guidelines. Celebration of the World Mental Health Day is an annual event as part of the DIB calendar.",

Those entities are included in Hydro's financial statements on a line-by-line basis. Please see note 3.1 Investments in joint arrangements and associates to the consolidated financial statements for more information about joint operations.\n\n## Note S6 - Labor rights\n\nThe vast majority of operational sites within Hydro Aluminum Metal and Energy have established formal joint management-worker health and safety committees covering all employees. At certain sites, also contractor employees are included.\n\nHydro's major sites in Europe and Brazil are unionized. Extrusions has a major presence in North America, and about 60 percent of our US and Canadian employees are working at a unionized site. In total, we estimate that around 70 percent of all employees are unionized. Non-organized workers in Norway in general receive the same working conditions as the organized employees, negotiated on industry level. For the rest of Hydro, the working conditions of non-organized employees are based on company results, competitive analysis, inflation, individual performance, and negotiation. Learn more about dialogue with the employee representatives under Stakeholder dialogue.\n\nIn regions where unions are not allowed we are striving to establish alternative worker-management relations.\n\nNo strikes exceeding one week and no lock-outs took place in 2022.",

Outcomes for Hydro and the society are also included in the reporting requirements. All sites report annually on all community investments, charitable donations, sponsorship and other related initiatives.\n\nEducation refers to initiatives within the formal educational system, from elementary school to university. Examples of initiatives include training of teachers and external scholarships.\n\nCapacity , or competence, building refer to all training and competence building outside formal educational systems.

The total costs account for 228 million NOK, and is part of the agreement after the 2018 extreme rainfall and subsequent flooding in Bacarena. In particular, we spent close to 50 MNOK on a technical school in Barcarena. The increase in 2018 included NOK 35 million related to emergency relief following the same incident. It also includes around NOK 10 million to foodcards as part of the TAC agreement. See the section 'The Alunorte situation' in Hydro's Annual Report 2018.\n\nHydro is subject to income taxes in the countries where we operate. The nominal tax rates typically vary between around 20 and 35 percent. The effective tax rates may differ from the nominal tax rates, among other things as a result of differences in depreciation rates and other tax deductions.\n\n- \u00b7 The marginal tax rate for our power production in Norway is 59 percent.\n- \u00b7 The general corporate income tax rate in Brazil is 34 percent. Hydro's bauxite, alumina and aluminium operations in Brazil have been granted income tax incentives encouraging investments in the northern provinces of Brazil, reducing the tax rate on operating income to between 20 and 34 percent up to 2017. No tax incentives have been valid or applicable for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020. In 2021, Hydro Paragominas has been granted renewal of a SUDAM income tax incentive for a 10-year period, reducing the tax rate on operating income to between 15,25 and 34 percent from 2020 to 2029. In addition, Hydro's operations in Brazil are subject to a number of significant indirect taxes.\n- \u00b7 Hydro is present in some countries with at tax rate below 10 percent. In Switzerland, we have bauxite, alumina and aluminium sales activities, and aluminium sales activities in Singapore, both are taxed at rates of around 10 percent. In addition, Hungary has a tax rate of 9 percent.\n\nQatalum, a 50/50 joint venture with Qatar Petroleum, had a 10 year exemption from income taxes in Qatar, which expired in 2020. It has been Hydro's consistent position that the generally applicable tax rate, currently at 10 percent, should apply to Qatalum after the expiry of the tax holiday. However, the joint venture partners have not been able to agree on a common interpretation of the applicable tax law, and Qatalum filed its 2020 tax return applying a 35 percent tax rate on 30 June 2021. Hydro is pursuing alternative measures to protect its financial interest in this matter.\n\nHydro reports according to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and Norwegian legal requirements, see Hydro's Country by country report . We also report on financial assistance from public organization related to R&D activities, see note S8 Financial assistance from governments.\n\n## Note S8 - Financial assistance from governments\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nR&D expenses are collected through Hydro's financial reporting, see Hydro's financial statements note 10.2 Research and Development to the consolidated financial statement. R&D funding is gathered from Hydro's corporate technology office and our main R&D centers, located in \u00c5rdal (smelter technology) and Sunndal (alloys and casting) in Norway and Brazil (Bauxite & Alumina). The R&D centers in Hydro Extrusions are in Finsp\u00e5ng, Sweden, and Detroit, USA.

Note that the 2020 results were significantly higher due to one particular initiative in India, reaching close to 30,000 people.\n\n## Note S10 - Compliance\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nCompliance data have mainly been collected from Group Internal Audit and Investigations' overview of alerts reported to line management, to supporting staff functions, and Hydro's AlertLine. In addition, compliance data has been obtained from quarterly compliance reporting by business areas, and a self-assessment filled in by each business area at year-end. Some information has also been collected through other sources including Hydro's Legal department and Procurement Network.\n\nSignificant non-compliance cases are defined as all material pending or threatened litigation and claims to which a consolidated Hydro company is party. Disputes for an amount in excess of MNOK 75 have been regarded material.\n\n## S10.1 Reported and confirmed cases of non-compliance\n\nGRI reference: GRI Standards GRI 406-1 (2016) and 205-3 (2016)\n\nNon-compliance cases are normally reported to line management and/or supporting staff functions including Group Compliance, Group Internal Audit and Investigations, Human Resources, Legal, HSE, Finance and Accounting. Noncompliances can also be reported through Hydro's AlertLine, which offers the possibility of anonymous reporting, unless otherwise prohibited by local law. Although separate reporting statistics have been kept for Extrusions (acquired 2017) and the rest of Hydro, the figures from 2018 are consolidated.\n\nThe number of dismissals due to breach of Hydro policy is limited to cases reported to Hydro's Internal Audit.\n\nIn 2022, Hydro received 8,612 notices in Canal Direto, the grievance channel designed for external stakeholders in Brazil. Out of the total, 1% were submitted anonymously. The majority of the entries, 99,01%, relate to information request ranging from supplier registration, contracts, human resources and inquiries about Food Cards distribution process, part of the Term of Adjusted Conduct (TAC) agreement with the Government of Par\u00e1 and public attorney in relation to the Alunorte situation in 2018.\n\nThe majority of notices received were registered through our toll-free number (0800), while 2,25% came from email and 3,14% through Hydro website. A set of improvements were performed in Canal Direto along 2022: service extended for all operations in Brazil, including Rein and extruded products; the third-party service supplier team was trained on ways to improve service quality as well as on human rights related aspects.",

All of the 102 are ongoing and awaiting a final decision in the lower Court.\n\nOn February 5, 2021, CAINQUIAMA and nine Brazilian individuals filed a lawsuit with the Rotterdam District Court, in the Netherlands, against Hydro's Dutch entities and Norsk Hydro ASA (Hydro) seeking compensation for alleged financial damages and personal injuries suffered as a result of Alunorte and Albras activities in the municipality of Barcarena. According to the plaintiffs, Hydro's Dutch entities and Hydro are part of Alunorte and Albras' corporate group and, therefore should be liable for the alleged environmental violations caused in the municipality of Barcarena throughout the years. The lawsuit is ongoing and a hearing about the merits of the lawsuit in the lower court is expected to take place during Q2 or Q3 2023 .\n\n## Bauxite & Alumina Labor cases\n\nFebruary 2017: The union at Paragominas filed in February 2017 a claim representing all employees, asking to be compensated for hours spent commuting back and forth from work. Following the labor law reform in November 2017, the obligation to compensate for commuting if the place of work is not served by regular public transportation or if the public transportation is not satisfactory to meet the demand, is not valid. Due to this change, the period in question is February to November 2017. The case was partially granted by the initial ruling and is currently being re-evaluated by the Court of Appeals. On June 30 2022, the Superior Court issued a decision reactivating all the cases that were suspended. The Supreme Court have ruled the applicability of commuting hours and all the cases related thereto had to be revisited by all Labor Courts. Therefore, on August 2nd 2022 the Labor Court of Appeals reviewed the decision and the case was totally dismissed. The labor Union filed an appeal against such decision and the case is now pending judgment.\n\nApril 2019: Minera\u00e7\u00e3o Paragominas ('MPSA') Employees Union filed a Collective Labor Lawsuit on behalf of all employees asking for additional salary differences related to night shift work for employees working on rotating shifts, as well as weekly rest payments for those working for seven consecutive days. The case was dismissed in the initial ruling. When re-ruling the case, the Labor Court of Appeals changed the decision and granted additional pay for night shift workers and dismissed the claim on weekly rest payment without analysis of its merits. Both parties appealed to the Superior Labor Court,. both parties field an interlocutory appeal to the Superior Labor Court of Appeals aiming to have their appeal accepted and ruled, both interlocutory appeals was denied and we filed a new one that is pending judgment.\n\n## Other cases\n\nFollowing an overflow of storm water from the bauxite residue deposits at Alunorte in 2009, there are still legal issues pending.

In short, the complaint states that the products used in Brazil in order to refine bauxite are more toxic than the ones used in Norway. Further, it argues that the amount of coal and heavy fuel oil consumed per year by Alunorte released into the atmosphere is harmful to the environment (as it can cause, e.g., acid rain and contamination of soil and water) and to humans (as it can cause respiratory illness and premature death). Lastly, it mentions that the ICMS tax benefit given to defendants must be lifted, because Alunorte has not changed the energy source from fuel oil to natural gas as agreed with the government through one of the commitments in the ICMS agreement.

A non-compliance with or breach of the principles in Hydro's Supplier Code of Conduct that is not able to be corrected within a reasonable period, may lead to termination of the supplier contract.\n\n## S10.6 Cyber security training\n\nHydro continue to emphasize security awareness for end-users, and provide e-learnings for all users with access to Hydro Academy. Guidelines are published in relevant channels for all users.\n\nHydro offers a mandatory cyber security training for all IT users in all business areas. A total number of approximately 11,000 employees participated in the training, which covered essential topics of cyber security.\n\n## Note S11 - Spending on local suppliers\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nLocal suppliers are defined as a supplier situated in the same country as the operational site. Selection of local partners and suppliers/contractors shall be based on competitive bidding to the extent feasible, and in compliance with competition laws and regulations as well as Hydro's requirements.\n\nMost significant locations of operation for the business areas Bauxite & Alumina, Aluminum Metal and Hydro's project organization are considered to be Brazil, Norway and USA based on economic importance.\n\n## Spending on local suppliers\n\nSpending on local suppliers vary from site to site depending on which goods and services are available. Local spend in our Brazilian Bauxite & Alumina operations was estimated to be 71 percent in 2022. Most of the raw materials used at the aluminum plants in Norway are imported, while electricity and services are sourced locally. In the Norwegian smelters local procurement mainly relates to maintenance services etc. and is about 31 percent in 2022. Hydro Extrusions has a local spend of about 48 percent in 2022, whereas Hydro Energy has 80 percent local spend.\n\n## Note S12 - Public affairs and lobbying\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nData on public affairs and lobbying is gathered from Hydro's Communication & Public Affairs department in Norway and Brazil, in addition to our office in Brussels that follows up EU affairs. These units cover all consolidated activities.\n\n## Public affairs and lobbying\n\nIn 2022, a total of 14 full-time equivalents (FTE) are dedicated to public affairs and lobbying. This includes seven FTEs in Brazil and four in the EU (Brussels office). In Norway three FTE are dedicated to public affairs and lobbying. Within the EU, lobbying activities are publicly reported through the EU Transparency Register. To get a full overview of all Hydro's memberships in different industry associations see Hydro.com.\n\nAccording to our global directives, Hydro may not make financial contributions to political parties. We have no indications that such contributions took place in 2022.\n\n## S10.3 Confirmed significant human rights breaches\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nWe define significant human rights breaches as either one or more confirmed cases of forced labor, child labor abuse, or confirmed breach of ILO 169 caused, contributed or linked to Hydro. We also include cases where a municipality/region/ area of more than 100 people has been irreversibly impacted by confirmed cause, contribution or link to Hydro (e.g. spill, systematic pollution over time, involuntary relocation). The confirmed impact to people in the municipality/region/area is life-long and/or life-shortening.\n\nRelocation of people may at times be necessary in connection with our operations. No voluntary or involuntary relocation of people with legal or prescriptive rights to their dwellings, took place in Hydro's operations in 2022. In Barcarena in Par\u00e1, Brazil, in an area surrounding Hydro's operations and regulated for industrial purposes, illegal logging and settlements have accelerated since 2016. We realize that we need to better understand the situation in collaboration with the relevant stakeholders, the municipality and civil organizations.\n\nHydro did not detect severe human rights impacts in our own operations in 2022.\n\nIncidents of harassment and discrimination are reported separately from (other) human rights breaches in note S10.1 Reported and confirmed cases of non-compliance . Occupational health and safety incidents, including fatalities, can be found in note S5 Health and Safety.\n\n## S10.4 Compliance training\n\nIn Hydro, compliance awareness training is provided on a range of topics and consists of classroom-training, workshops, town hall meetings and various e-learning modules. In 2022, training was provided e.g. on the topics of anti-corruption, Hydro's code of Conduct, competition law, data privacy, trade sanctions, human rights, integrity and market regulations. Compliance training is mainly prepared and executed by Group Compliance and Group Legal, but other group functions also contribute.\n\nThe various compliance awareness and training modules were in total completed 56,516 times. The various compliance e-learning training modules were in total completed 41,160 times. Furthermore classroom training (virtual or face-to-face) was provided to 15,356 employees.\n\n## S10.5 Screening of business partners and supplier audits\n\nAs part of the integrity risk management process, approximately 6,500 of Hydro's potential or existing counter-parties were screened for human rights violations, corruption, money-laundering, politically exposed persons and violations relating to sanctions using the RDC integrity risk tool during 2022. This mostly relates to suppliers, but also some customers, agents and other business partners were included. New business partners related to most operations are screened before registered in our ERP system. Furthermore, operations in North America uses the denied parties risk tool MK Denial to screen suppliers against 16 official sanction lists multiple times a year. In 2022, approximately 14,000 customers and suppliers were screened in MK Denial.\n\nAll suppliers, customers and other business partners registered in our main accounting systems are screened on a weekly basis against recognized international sanction lists.\n\nIn total 200 supplier audits were conducted in 2022 in Hydro. Most of the supplier audits included topics related to health, safety, environment and social responsibility. Around 30 percent of the audits led to action plans, and by the end 2022, almost 100 percent of the corrective actions proposed by Hydro resulted in improved performance. All audits are risk based emphasizing topics relevant for the suppliers operations, e.g., quality, safety, environmental, human rights and governance.",

GRI collaborates with the United Nations Environment Program and UN Global Compact. Hydro has reported according to GRI since 2003.\n\nWe believe that our reporting is in accordance with GRI's reporting principles in all material respects as defined by the GRI Universal Standards (2021). Hydro's GRI Content Index 2022 can be found at Hydro.com/gri.\n\nThe sustainability reporting's adherence to the GRI Standards is subject to limited assurance by our external auditors, KPMG. The assurance, as outlined in the Independent Auditor's Assurance report, concludes that the report is presented, in all material respects, in accordance with the GRI Standards.\n\n## UN Global Compact Communication of progress\n\nWe support the principles of the UN Global Compact. Human rights, international labor standards, working against corruption and environmental considerations are fundamental to our approach to corporate responsibility.\n\nHydro has played an active role in the Global Compact since its formation. Our commitment is expressed by the Chair of the Board of directors and the CEO in their letter to stakeholders. Our Communication on progress (COP) in relation to the Compact's 10 principles is at the Advanced level and thus also reflects the Global Compact's 21 advanced criteria. The consistency of the information in Hydro's annual report 2022 with the information in the Hydro Communication on Progress 2022 has been reconciled by our auditors. See Hydro.com for more information.\n\n## UN Sustainable Development Goals\n\nThe UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) embrace a universal approach to the sustainable development agenda. They explicitly call on business to use creativity and innovation to address development challenges and recognize the need for governments to encourage sustainability reporting. Hydro has an impact on all of the 17 development goals, but some more than others. For an assessment of how Hydro's activities impacts each of the 17 SDGs, see the SDG Index.\n\nAccording to Hydro's policy, all operational sites shall comply with, but not necessarily be certified according to ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and ISO 45001. Certification according to these standards is a decentralized responsibility based on identified business needs.\n\nHydro's power plants in Norway have chosen not to be certified. However, they are fulfilling the requirements given in the mentioned standards. In addition, the power plants need to comply with the requirements given by the Norwegian Water Resource and Energy Directorate (NVE), i.e. concessions for operations as well as environmental, third person safety, security and emergency preparedness regulations. The table below shows the distribution of certification of the other operational sites in Hydro.\n\nIn addition to the mentioned ISO and ASI standards below, a number of sites are also certified according to different sector and customer specific standards. Examples of such certifications are the IATF 16949 for the automotive industry, and the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative.\n\n## Share of relevant operational sites certified\n\n|                      | ISO 9001  1)   | ISO 14001   | ISO 45001  2)   | ASI   |\n|----------------------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|-------|\n| Eligible             | 93             | 92          | 92              | 92    |\n| Certified            | 82             | 84          | 67              | 61    |\n| Percentage certified | 88%            | 91%         | 73%             | 66%   |\n\n- 1) IATF 16949 is fully alligned with the structure and requirments of ISO 9001. IATF 16949 is required by customers that produce service parts or parts for car assembly. Hence, 4 sites have chosen to only get the IATF 16949.\n- 2) OHSAS 18001 is discontinued and has been replaced by ISO 45001.\n\nOf our sites delivering to the automotive industry, 88 percent are certified according to the IATF 16949. Hydro's most energy intensive sites and operations comply with the ISO 50001 Energy Management systems.\n\n## Note S14 - Social data for 50/50-owned companies\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nHydro has an ownership share of 50 percent in Qatalum. As only operations owned more than 50 percent are included in most of the information in Hydro's Environmental and social statements, we have chosen to disclose certain social information about this partly-owned company and its total performance. The reporting principles of each indicator might differ from the ones used by Hydro and in-between the companies. For information about environmental data, see note E8 to the environmental statements.\n\n## Social data for 50/50-owned companies\n\n|         | Main product    | Number of  employees   | Share of  women   |   TRI,employees |   TRI,  contractors | LTI,  employees   |   LTI,  contractors | Fatal  accidents   |\n|---------|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------|\n| Qatalum | Aluminium Metal | 1,064                  | 3.2 %             |             0.6 |                   3 | -                 |                   2 | -                  |",

Principles on Business and Human Rights\n\nThe United Nations (UN) Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (hereafter UNGPs) were endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council in June 2011. They have provided a clear, global understanding of governmental duties and corporate responsibilities for human rights. The UNGPs articulate that wherever and however a company operates, it must refrain from violating human rights. Companies are expected to be fully aware of their human rights impacts, take concrete steps to address them and implement measures to mitigate negative impacts in the future. Companies are also expected to communicate any impacts or risks of impacts, and mitigating actions. Hydro is committed to transparency, including through this annual report.\n\nHydro uses the GRI document 'Linking G4 and the UN Guiding Principles' document as basis for how we report on our adherence with the UNGPs, and report on this in the GRI index 2021. This is also included in external auditor's consistency check of Hydro's GRI index 2021. We also report according to relevant laws that are based on the UNGPs, including the Norwegian Transparency Act 2021 (valid from 2022), the UK Modern Slavery Act 2015, and the Australia Modern Slavery Bill 2018. The most salient and prioritized human rights issues are reported the Human rights chapter.\n\nThrough Hydro's human rights due diligence processes, we did not detect severe human rights impacts in 2021 and therefore have nothing to report for 2021 on the GRI B4 'Additional severe impacts'.\n\n## ICMM\n\nHydro is a member of the International Council on Mining and Metals and reports according to the ICMM requirements. That includes Hydro's reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards, see the section about GRI above. The Environment and social responsibility 2021 reporting is prepared in line with the requirements found in the ICMM 10 principles and position statements. The complete Environment and social reporting is - according to the ICMM requirements - assured by our external auditor.\n\nAs part of our ICMM commitments, we disclose mineral development contracts granted or entered into from 1 January 2021 that we have signed with host governments, see hydro.com\n\n## ASI\n\nThe Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI) is a global, multi-stakeholder, non-profit standards setting and certification organization. The ASI works toward responsible production, sourcing and stewardship of aluminium following an entire value chain approach.\n\nHydro is an active member of the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative. ASI's mission is to recognize and collaboratively foster the responsible production, sourcing and stewardship of aluminium. We have been involved at all stages in the multistakeholder development of ASI standards to date. We have participated in developing ASI's certification program. The third-party certification platform was launched in December 2017. Until publication of this report, 65 production sites have been certified according to the ASI Performance Standard, covering Hydro's value chain from bauxite mining to finished products. Hydro has also certified several sites according to the Chain of Custody standard, and delivered the first ASI certified metal to a customer in July 2019.\n\nHydro reports in the GRI index 2021 on how we relate to ASI's 11 principles and underlying criteria. This is also included in external auditor's consistency check of Hydro's GRI index 2021.

TCFD was formed by the Financial Stability Board in 2015. The recommendations were made public in June 2017. Hydro launched a new climate strategy in 2019 that takes into account scenario analysis. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 New policies: similar to a 2\u00b0C scenario in line with the Paris agreement\n- \u00b7 Current policies: similar to a 4\u00b0C scenario and in line with already adopted measures\n- \u00b7 Physical risks: stress testing of physical risks under a 6\u00b0C scenario\n\nThe table below shows an overview of Hydro's initial approach to the recommendations.

For 2022, we have made a self-assessment of our fulfillment of the performance expectations for Hydro Paragominas, Alunorte and Albras, all in Brazil, and Hydro's five fully-owned primary aluminium production plants, all in Norway.\n\nAll the operations are certified according to the ASI Performance and Chain of Custody standards. ICMM indicators that are aligned with ASI certified indicators are, according to the ICMM methodology, regarded as externally validated. Remaining indicators have been subject to a self-assessment. The self-assessments of the Brazilian sites have been reviewed by our external auditor KPMG as part of their limited assurance of Hydro's ESG reporting 2022, please see the external auditor's limited assurance report.\n\nIn accordance with ICMM requirements, we also need to prioritize the self-assessments of each operation for third party validation required from the financial year 2023 within a three year cycle. Our prioritization is risk based (industry and geography) and in the following order:\n\n- 1. Bauxite and alumina production in Brazil (Paragominas and Alunorte)\n- 2. Primary aluminium production in Brazil (Albras)\n- 3. Primary aluminium production in Norway (Husnes, H\u00f8yanger, Karm\u00f8y, Sunndal, \u00c5rdal)\n\n| Site        | Activity                     | Ownership  share   | ASI certified  indicators   | Self-assessed indicators   | Self-assessed indicators   | Self-assessed indicators   | Total     | Total         | Total          | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|-------------|------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|-----------|---------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|             |                              |                    | Fully met                   | Fully met                  | Partially met              | Not applicable             | Fully met | Partially met | Not applicable |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Paragominas | Bauxite mining               | 100%               | 23                          | 12                         | 1                          | 2                          | 35        | 1             | 2              | Performance Expectation 6.3 is partially met: GISTM requirements  are applicable to Paragominas, expected to be in conformance within  the applicable deadlines.                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Alunorte    | Alumina refining             | 94%                | 23                          | 12                         | 1                          | 2                          | 35        | 1             | 2              | Performance Expectation 6.3 is partially met: GISTM requirements  are applicable to Alunorte, expected to be in conformance within the  applicable deadlines.                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Albras      | Primary aluminium production | 51%                | 23                          | 9                          | 2                          | 4                          | 32        | 2             | 4              | Albras partially meets the performance expectation 6.2 and has a  roadmap in place for full adherence including water management  improvement.                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Husnes      | Primary aluminium production | 100%               | 23                          | 11                         | 0                          | 4                          | 34        | 0             | 4              | Performance Expectation 6.5 is partially met: The planned fuel switch  project is aligned with the expectation.

The technical screening criteria refer to the production of liquid aluminium through electrolysis of alumina.\n\nHydro's primary aluminium plants have reduction facilities with potlines and casthouses, where liquid and remelted aluminium is cast to form value-added products such as extrusion ingot, primary foundry alloys, sheet ingot and wire rod, in addition to standard ingot. When cast into these products, alloying metals and externally purchased cold metal is added. The amount of cold metal added varies with market circumstances and available casthouse capacity.\n\nHydro has five fully owned primary aluminium production facilities in Norway, aluminium production facilities operated by part-owned subsidiaries in Slovakia and Brazil, and partownership in facilities in Australia and Canada, all included in the scope of taxonomy. Hydro also has a part-ownership in a primary aluminium producer in Qatar, reported as a joint venture and thus outside the scope of Hydro's reporting.\n\nTo make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation, primary aluminium production facilities must meet the technical screening criteria set out in the taxonomy. To be a Taxonomy-aligned activity, the manufacturing of primary aluminium must also comply with the criteria for determining whether that economic activity causes no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives ('Do no significant\n\nharm (DNSH) criteria') for aluminium production, and Hydro must comply with the criteria for processes and outcomes related to human rights, bribery and corruption, taxation, and fair competition ('Minimum Safeguards').\n\n## Manufacture of secondary aluminium\n\nThe manufacture of secondary aluminium is an eligible and transitional activity according to the taxonomy. Process scrap and post-consumer scrap are purchased from third parties for recycling into extrusion ingot. Standard ingot and alloying metal are added to meet customer specifications. Hydro has a portfolio of stand-alone recyclers, in addition to recyclers located wall-to-wall alongside our extrusion plants.\n\nAll manufacturing of secondary aluminium is defined by the taxonomy as making a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation. To be a Taxonomy-aligned activity, the manufacture of secondary aluminium must also comply with the DNSH criteria for manufacture of aluminium, and Hydro must comply with the criteria for processes and outcomes related to human rights, bribery and corruption, taxation, and fair competition ('Minimum Safeguards').\n\n## Electricity generation from hydropower\n\nOperation of facilities that generate electricity from hydropower is an eligible activity under the taxonomy. Hydro owns and operates 40 hydropower plants in Norway, with a combined installed capacity of 2.7 GW. The purpose of Hydro's hydropower assets is to secure a stable power supply to our primary aluminium plants located in Norway, which means the hydropower is mainly generated and used for internal consumption.\n\nTo make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation, hydropower production must meet the technical screening criteria set out in the taxonomy. To be a Taxonomyaligned activity, the hydropower production must also comply with the DNSH criteria for hydropower production, and Hydro must comply with the criteria for processes and outcomes related to human rights, bribery and corruption, taxation, and fair competition ('Minimum Safeguards').\n\n## End-use contribution from Hydro's activities\n\nA range of the products we manufacture contribute to climate change mitigation as constituent parts of technologies,\n\ninfrastructure and complex products needed in a lowcarbon society. Examples are battery casings used in the manufacture of electric vehicles, window frames contributing to energy-efficient buildings, and aluminium frames for solar panels. The taxonomy does not provide clear guidance on how to define eligibility in the supply chain of taxonomyeligible activities. Consequently, we have chosen to report for 2022 based on the taxonomy-eligible activities of primary and secondary aluminium production, rather than on end-use of the aluminium we produce.\n\nDetermining whether eligible activities are aligned with the Taxonomy criteria\n\n## Manufacture of primary aluminium and manufacture of secondary aluminium\n\nHydro's primary aluminium production that is based on renewable electricity meets the substantial contribution criteria for manufacture of aluminium, defined as smelters' energy efficiency below 15.5 MWh/t Al and carbon intensity for the electricity used below 100g CO2e/kWh.\n\nAll aluminium remelting activity qualifies for substantial contribution under the taxonomy's manufacture of secondary aluminium activity.\n\nOperations in Europe meet the DNSH criteria for all environmental objectives as long as they are within normal, lawful operations, comply with emission permits to air and water, have performed environmental impact assessments and taken necessary action required. Hydro's major production sites have performed a climate risk and vulnerability assessment.\n\nFor Hydro's operations outside of Europe it is more challenging to determine if the DNSH criteria are met as they reference EU law. Based on our assessment, the most challenging criteria to meet is the DNSH criteria for pollution prevention and control, which are linked to achievable emission levels associated with application of the best available techniques (BAT-AEL). Our primary smelters outside of Europe do not meet the emission ranges in EU Best Available Technique Reference (BREF) Documents, and remelters without a bag house filter do not meet criteria for",

Hydro believes that the hydropower activities comply with the DNSH criteria for sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources by complying with requirements from the local and regional implementation of EU's Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC. The EU requirements are incorporated the concession and follow-up of permits for our existing hydropower operations. The DNSH criteria for protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems are linked to EU's Environmental Impact Assessment Directive 2011/92/ EU, which is implemented by Norwegian authorities. We believe we comply with the relevant requirements through our cooperation with Norwegian authorities for environmental impact assessments related to our hydropower operations.\n\n## Compliance with criteria for minimum safeguards\n\nHydro's activities are carried out in compliance with the minimum safeguards. Please refer to the following sections for information on Hydro's processes and outcomes related to minimum safeguards:\n\npollution prevention and control. The remaining DNSH criteria are met for our two remelters that operate with bag houses.\n\n## Electricity generation from hydropower\n\nAll of our hydropower operations are located in Norway. We have been working together with the Norwegian Energy Association ('Energi Norge') and other Norwegian hydropower producers to establish a guidance for interpreting and reporting on the Taxonomy criteria for electricity generation from hydropower in Norway.\n\nOur analysis shows that all our hydropower stations that are connected to artificial reservoirs make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation as the power density of the electricity generation facilities is above 5 W/m2. We have used guidance from the research institute SINTEF to estimate and document our assessments. In addition, we have one run-of-river hydropower facility that does not have an artificial reservoir, and therefore complies with the criteria for substantial contribution to climate change mitigation. Hydro's hydropower operations have been included in\n\n## ELIGIBLE ACTIVITIES\n\n## NON-ELIGIBLE ACTIVITIES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSecondary aluminum production\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nExtrusion activities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPrimary aluminium production\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMining and alumina refining\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRenewable energy production Taxonomy revenue\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCommercial activities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u009f Human rights, including workers rights, consumer rights and the rights of communities: Refer to the chapter on Human rights in our Annual report, and note S10.3 in our Appendix containing the Environmental and social statements for 2022.\n- \u009f Bribery and corruption: Refer to the chapter on Ethics and compliance in our Annual report, and note S10.1 in our Appendix containing the Environmental and social statements for 2022.\n- \u009f Taxation: Refer to our Country-by-country report, which also describes and links to our global tax policy, and note S7 on income tax in our Appendix containing the Environmental and social statements for 2022, and note 10.1 on income tax to our Consolidated financial statements.\n- \u009f Fair competition: Refer to the chapter on Ethics and compliance in our Annual report, and note S10.1 on noncompliances and note S10.4 on compliance training in our Appendix containing the Environmental and social statements for 2022.\n\n## IDENTIFYING ACTIVITIES\n\nPERFORMANCE",

In production of casthouse products, in particular for recycling of post-consumer scrap, cold metal with a known purity is added to achieve the intended properties of the casthouse product. Purchased standard ingot is the primary source for this purpose. As this element is neither manufacture of primary nor secondary aluminium, the revenue is adjusted for the share of aluminium added on a tonnage basis. The eligible share of revenue from sale of casthouse products only covers the sale of aluminium produced by Hydro.\n\nMetal purchased for resale, including metal produced by the joint venture Qatalum, is excluded.\n\nThe metal value of revenue from sale of extruded products is included to reflect the similar value as for casthouse products. The metal value is calculated the same way as for casthouse products, also excluding the value of added cold metal whether in recyclers set up close by the extrusion plants, or in the primary smelters and separate recycling facilities also supplying the extrusion plants.\n\nThe value of upgrading the products through such processes as extruding profiles for customers' application, further fabrication of those profiles, surface treatment and other processes that might apply is also excluded.\n\nRevenue from sale of electricity consists of revenue from spot sales of daily excess production from Hydro's power plants in Norway above what is consumed in Hydro's own activities. To the extent Hydro sells power purchased from other producers, that revenue is excluded from the eligible share together with any revenue from power trading.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nCapEx comprises additions to property, plant and equipment, represented by the gross amount of purchase, development or lease as specified in note 2.1 Property, plant and equipment to the Financial statements. It also includes the gross amount of purchase or development of intangible assets as specified in note 2.2 Intangible assets.\n\nAny amount of gross additions to property, plant and equipment or intangibles resulting from business combinations is included in CapEx under this metric. Further, any lease capitalized is included with the addition (or reduction) required by IFRS.\n\nShort-term leases and small asset leases as well as variable lease payments are not recognized as fixed assets and are thus not included in this indicator. Any goodwill recognized in a business combination is not included in the indicator. Further, financial investments, including capital injections in associated companies and joint ventures, are excluded from the metric.\n\nAdditions to property, plant and equipment and to intangible assets for eligible activities include both sustaining investments in existing plants engaged in eligible activities and expansions or new facilities within such activities. As a starting point, entire plants including associated and supporting functions are included. However, several of our aluminium smelters have on-site production of anodes, an activity that is not described in the taxonomy. Where a smelter has an associated anode production facility, these are excluded from investments in a smelter. For extrusion plants, the eligible share of CapEx covers the recycling facilities as such including furnaces and casthouse equipment. Extrusion presses, other facilities and support facilities mainly serving the extrusion activities are fully excluded from eligible CapEx.\n\nFor future reporting of the aligned share of CapEx, the aligned share is intended to include sustaining and expansion investments in activities meeting the criteria for aligned activities, as well as investments in activities that are not aligned which form part of a plan to meet the criteria within a period of a maximum of ten years.\n\nInvestments in activities that are not aligned at the time of investment, and where the activities will not become aligned, are not included as aligned investments. Such investments include investments with the purpose of reducing the carbon footprint of our non-taxonomy-eligible activities, including our investments to replace heavy fuel oil with natural gas at the Alunorte alumina refinery. For more detail on non-eligible investments that contribute to reduced GHG emissions, refer to our chapters on Climate change and Innovation and technology transition.\n\n## Operating expenditure\n\nOpEx comprises Hydro's total expenses from the specified functions and represent a sub-set of expenses presented in the consolidated financial statement, primarily in the line items Employee benefit expense and Other expenses. Operating expenditure is described as a share of the expenses included in the sub-total EBIT in the income statement. The regulation\n\n## Measuring performance\n\nHydro's activities are linked to the boundaries of the reporting entity as defined by IFRS and described in the group financial statements, See Hydro's consolidation principles in note 1.1 Reporting entity, basis of presentation and significant accounting policies to the Financial statements.\n\nIn combination, these indicators are intended by the taxonomy to express the company's activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable.\n\n## Revenue (turnover)\n\nRevenue represents Hydro's total revenue from contracts with customers as specified in note 5.1 Revenue from contracts with customers to the Financial statements. This amount excludes income (loss) from realized and unrealized changes in fair value of derivative instruments which is considered not eligible activities under the taxonomy.\n\nRevenue associated with eligible activities comprises the following elements from external revenues:\n\n- \u009f Revenue from sale of liquid metal\n- \u009f Revenue from sale of casthouse products to customers\n- \u009f The metal value of revenue from sale of extruded products\n- \u009f Revenue from sale of electricity\n\nHydro's eligible activities are primary aluminium production, secondary aluminium production and production of electricity. The output from these activities is partly sold directly to customers, partly upgraded to more advanced products for sale to customers through further processes not described in the taxonomy, and partly consumed in the production process.\n\nRevenue from sale of liquid metal is the direct output from the production of primary metal. No adjustments are made to the prices agreed with customers. The amount is limited as liquid metal cannot be stored or transported over longer distances.\n\nRevenue from the sale of casthouse products to customers is the most directly associated commercial product resulting from aluminium production, whether primary or secondary. The majority of the value of a casthouse product results from its aluminium content, while most products also contain alloying material to achieve the intended properties for use.\n\nAlloying material varies from less than 1% up to around 11%. The value of alloying materials is considered an integral",

Expenses include such items as employee benefits, use of research facilities including operating expenses and depreciation of property, plant and equipment, and external services both for specific services to projects managed internally, for outsourced projects managed by external parties as well as financing of initiatives conducted jointly with other companies or industry associations.\n\nBuilding renovation measures are currently of limited relevance to Hydro, as there are no significant such projects ongoing.\n\nShort-term leases and leases for low value assets are described in note 2.6 Leases to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nMaintenance and repair expenses include Hydro's maintenance and repair cost not qualifying for capitalization as part of the relevant asset. The maintenance expenses are only partly captured in Hydro's financial reporting, as Hydro presents its operating expenses by nature of expenses and not by function. Repair and maintenance activities consist of employee expenses, consumables and spare parts, and various services. The total expenses related to these activities have been estimated based on management reporting in units and business areas, which is not necessarily fully consistent. Management considers the amounts to be a reasonable expression of such expenses in Hydro.\n\nHydro's total estimated expenses from the specified functions represent primarily the maintenance and day-to-day servicing costs for assets used in the eligible activities. In addition, research and development projects with the aim of improving production methods for primary and secondary aluminium are included as eligible activities.",

The scope also excludes information contained in webpages referred to in the Report unless specified in this limited assurance report.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOur conclusion has been formed on the basis of, and is subject to, the matters outlined in this limited assurance report.\n\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusions.\n\nBased on the procedures performed and the evidence obtained nothing has come to our attention, to indicate that the Report is not presented, in all material respects, in accordance with the GRI Standards and the applied reporting criteria as described in the About the reporting section on page 209 of the Report.\n\n## Management's responsibilities\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the Report, and the information and assertions contained within it, is in accordance with the GRI Standards and the reporting criteria as described in the About the reporting section on page 209 of the Report.\n\nManagement is also responsible for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of a Report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and for preventing and detecting fraud and for identifying and ensuring that Hydro complies with laws and regulations applicable to its activities.\n\nOffices in:\n\n\u00a9 KPMG AS, a Norwegian limited liability company and a member firm of the KPMG global organization of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

The standard requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Report is free from material misstatement.\n\n## Procedures performed\n\nA limited assurance engagement consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the preparation of information presented in the Report, and applying analytical and other evidence gathering procedures, as appropriate. The procedures selected depend on our understanding of the Report and other engagement circumstances, and our considerations of areas where material misstatements are likely to arise. Our procedures included:\n\n- \u00b7 A risk analysis, including a media search, to identify relevant sustainability issues for Hydro in the reporting period;\n- \u00b7 Inquiries of management to gain an understanding of Hydro's processes for determining the material issues for Hydro's key stakeholder groups;\n- \u00b7 Interviews with senior management and relevant staff at corporate and business area level, and selected sites, concerning sustainability strategy and policies for material issues, and the implementation of these across the business;\n- \u00b7 Interviews with relevant staff at the corporate and business area level responsible for providing the information, carrying out internal control procedures and consolidating the data in the Report;\n- \u00b7 Site visits to four production sites to review the source data and the design and implementation of controls and validation procedures at local level;\n\n2",

Our engagement is not designed to detect all weaknesses in the internal controls over the preparation of the Report, as the engagement has not been performed continuously throughout the period and the procedures performed were undertaken on a test basis.\n\nOslo, 13 February 202 3 KPMG AS\n\nMonica Hansen State Authorized Public Accountant\n\nTorbj\u00f8rn Westman Sustainability Specialist\n\n3",

Uncertainty remains for certain aluminium production facilities as high global energy prices and volatile market conditions continue to put pressure on smelter margins. As a result, many producers in Europe and the US have curtailed parts of their production. For 2022, external sources are estimating a global deficit of primary aluminium of around 0.3 million mt, and a surplus of around 0.1 million mt for 2023.\n\nHydro is addressing the volatile market landscape, and completed the curtailment of 130 thousand tonnes of primary aluminium production at Hydro Husnes and Hydro Karm\u00f8y in response to reduced market demand for aluminium billets in Europe in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for Aluminium Metal improved slightly in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, mainly due to positive contribution from power sales and positive currency effects, partly offset by lower all-in metal prices, lower sales volumes, and higher raw material cost and fixed cost.\n\nEuropean demand for extrusions in the fourth quarter of 2022 is estimated to have decreased 16 percent, compared to the same quarter last year and 9 percent compared to the third quarter of 2022, partly driven by seasonality. North American extrusion demand is estimated to have decreased 8 percent during the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter last year and 14 percent (decrease) compared to the third quarter of 2022. CRU estimates that the European and North American demand for extruded products will decrease 18 percent and 5 percent respectively for the first quarter of 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for Extrusions increased in the fourth quarter, compared to the same quarter last year, due to increased results from the recyclers driven by higher sales premiums. This was partly offset by lower sales volumes and higher fixed and variable costs.\n\nHydro continues to position the company to capture value from growing demand for greener and circular aluminium. Greener aluminium with a lower-carbon footprint is an important enabler for the green transition. The demand for\n\naluminium towards 2030 in Hydro's main markets is set to grow at around 3 percent per year, and low-carbon aluminium demand is expected to outpace the rest of the market, with a current estimate of 20 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2022 to 2030. External consultants expect lowcarbon and recycled aluminium will make up a majority of the EU and American market in 2030.\n\nAddressing the growing demand for greener aluminium, Hydro announced a new strategic partnership with MercedesBenz in the fourth quarter. In 2023, Hydro will deliver REDUXA 3.0 (defined as below 3.0 kg CO 2 / kg Al from mine to metal) to a range of Mercedes-Benz models, ultimately reducing the material carbon footprint.\n\nRecycling is a key strategic growth area and an important enabler to strengthen Hydro's position in low-carbon aluminium. Hydro is well on track to deliver on the 2020 recycling ambition to double post-consumer scrap by 2025. The announced acquisition of the Polish recycler Alumetal is currently in Phase II with the European Commission. The provisional deadline for a Phase II decision is end of May 2023. At the Capital Markets Day in the fourth quarter, Hydro further increased the recycling EBITDA growth target towards 2025 by NOK 500 million, and an additional NOK 500 million by 2027, through lifting the ambition to recycle PCS by an additional 140 thousand tonnes, requiring an increased capital allocation towards recycling in the range of NOK 2-2.5 billion.\n\nExtrusions is another important growth area and Hydro continues to position itself for future growth through key investments. In the fourth quarter, Hydro announced its acquisition of Hueck building systems and extrusion business. The acquisition will strengthen Hydro's presence in Germany and other European markets, and create a solid platform for further growth of the combined businesses. The transaction is expected to close in late first quarter.\n\nIn order to deliver on Hydro's 2025 strategy, a strong commitment to reduce costs and improved operational excellence within the asset base is critical. Hydro has delivered on the improvement program target for 2022, and at the company's Capital Markets Day, Hydro increased its improvement target for 2025 from the original target of NOK\n\n## Key developments fourth quarter 2022\n\nHydro's adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2022 was NOK 7,184 million, compared with NOK 9,011 million for the same quarter last year, resulting in an Adjusted RoaCE of 22 percent for 2022. Lower all-in metal and alumina prices, and higher raw material costs were partly offset by positive currency effects and a gain from the sale of excess power.\n\nHydro experienced record results for the full year 2022, with an Adjusted EBITDA of NOK 39.7 billion. This is a 42 percent increase from 2021. Higher realized all-in metal and alumina prices, record high results in both Extrusions and Energy, and positive currency effects were offset by higher fixed and raw material costs upstream.\n\nHealth and safety is Hydro's top priority for both employees and the communities where Hydro operates. An injury free environment is the ultimate goal, and Hydro is continuously working to avoid incidents. The 2022 total recordable injury rate (TRI) was 2.4, which is a strong improvement from 3.3 in 2021, and the lowest TRI level ever reported in Hydro.\n\nThe war in Ukraine, energy crisis in Europe and high inflation continues to impact economic growth. Monetary policy tightening, combined with high energy prices and disruptions from China's zero-Covid policy, put downward pressure on global growth in the fourth quarter. Forecasts of GDP growth for 2023 have been adjusted upwards to around 3 percent as inflation concerns ease and macroeconomic environment improves in line with the reopening of the Chinese economy.\n\nNordic power prices are on average higher in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year but declined significantly compared to the third quarter of 2022. Significant price area differences in the Nordic region have continued, however they were considerably lower compared to the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for Energy decreased compared to the same quarter last year, mainly due to loss on internal fixed price contract, lower production and lower gain on price area differences, partly offset by higher prices.\n\nThe average Platts alumina index (PAX) decreased in the fourth quarter of 2022 to USD 317 per mt, compared to USD 338 per mt in the third quarter 2022. Adjusted EBITDA for Bauxite & Alumina decreased significantly compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, mainly driven by lower alumina sales",

For 2024-2026, the guidance is NOK 12.5 billion, reflecting currency and inflation, in addition to strengthened growth ambitions within Recycling and Extrusions. The long-term sustaining capex is estimated at NOK 7.0 billion.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Hydro utilized its sustainable financing framework and EMTN program in the issuance of NOK 3 billion sustainability linked bonds, fixed and floating with 6 year tenor. This was the first sustainability linked bond issues in the Norwegian corporate investment grade market.\n\nIn light of Hydro's solid balance sheet and strong financials, the Board of Directors propose to distribute 61.6 percent of 2022 adjusted net income to its shareholders, as a combination of NOK 5.65 per share of cash dividends and NOK 2 billion of share buybacks. The final shareholder distribution for 2022 is subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting on May 10, 2023.\n\nHydro's existing share buyback program, initiated on September 23, 2022, covers purchase of up to 100,000,000 shares with a maximum value of NOK 2,000 million, inclusive of the proportional redemption of shares owned by the Norwegian State. As of February 6, 2023, Hydro has purchased 13,494,000 own shares and owns a total of 29,946,403 shares, corresponding to 1.45 percent of Hydro's share capital. The redemption and cancellation of shares held by the Norwegian state is subject for approval by Annual General Meeting on May 10, 2023.\n\n## Other Key financials\n\nCompared to the third quarter, Hydro's adjusted EBITDA decreased from NOK 9,721 million to NOK 7,184 million in the fourth quarter 2022. Lower realized all-in metal and alumina prices were partly offset by increased production volumes from Energy. In addition, results for the third quarter 2022 were positively impacted by a revision of prior periods CO 2 compensation.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2022, increased compared to the same period last year. Higher realized all-in metal and alumina prices, record high results in both Extrusions and Energy and positive currency effects were offset by higher fixed and raw material costs upstream.\n\nNet income from continuing operations amounted to NOK 158 million in the fourth quarter. In addition to the factors\n\ndescribed above, net income from continuing operations included a net foreign exchange gain of NOK 356 million, a NOK 2,538 million unrealized loss on power and raw material contracts, and a NOK 486 million unrealized loss on LME related contracts.\n\nIncome tax expense amounted to NOK 1,519 million for the fourth quarter of 2022, about 91 percent of income before tax. The quarter was mainly impacted by the reassessment of recoverability of deferred tax assets resulting in a net charge of about NOK 1,400 million related to tax losses carried forward.\n\nHydro's net debt 1 declined from NOK 3.1 billion at the end of the third quarter to a net cash position of NOK 1.3 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities of NOK 8.4 billion included an increase of NOK 1.5 billion in collateral requirements. Net cash used in investment activities, excluding short term investments, amounted to NOK 4.2 billion.\n\nAdjusted net debt decreased from NOK 7.8 billion to NOK 6.0 billion, largely driven by turning the third quarter net debt position to a net cash position in fourth quarter, partly offset by increased collateral of 1.3 billion and a decrease in pension assets of 1.2 billion. The collateral requirements amounted to NOK 2.6 billion at the end of the quarter, mainly relating to strategic and operational hedging positions.\n\n8.5 billion to NOK 10 billion by 2025, and NOK 11 billion by 2027. Positive traction for greener products, improved product mix, higher margins and market share growth, support the 2025 commercial ambition of NOK 2.5 billion. Towards 2027, Hydro aims to further increase the commercial ambition by NOK 500 million up towards NOK 3 billion, with NOK 1.4 billion to be delivered in the coming years.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Hydro continued to strengthen its sustainability position by launching new Scope 3 ambitions where the company aims to reduce upstream Scope 3 emissions per tonne aluminium delivered to the market by 30 percent. On total upstream Scope 3 emissions, Hydro aims to reduce emissions by 15 percent by 2030. The new Scope 3, 2030 targets, will mainly be achieved by lowering footprint of purchased metal.\n\nThe transition to a lower-carbon society also provides opportunities for Hydro's new energy areas. In the fourth quarter Hydro, Eviny and Zephyr announced a partnership to explore an onshore wind project located in the area between H\u00f8yanger and Sunnfjord. The renewable power will be used by existing industry and enable new industrial development in the region. In 2023, Hydro will rehabilitate an additional 100 hectares in its legal reserve, which comprises degraded land not impacted by Hydro operations, and aims to pilot new technology to reutilize bauxite residues in other industries.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Hydro Havrand announced a 5 MW green hydrogen pilot project at Hydro's H\u00f8yanger smelter in Norway. Hydro Havrand is maturing the project, which is pending funding support from Enova.\n\nHydro's renewable energy company, Hydro Rein, is delivering on its portfolio strategy. The EBITDA contribution in 2026 from the four projects currently in construction is estimated to around NOK 400 - 450 million. In the fourth quarter Hydro Rein and Commerz Real entered into an agreement on forming a joint venture to acquire and develop two early phase solar projects in Jylland, Denmark. Construction is expected to commence in 2024, with production starting in early 2026, and the ambition is to grow the portfolio to 1 GW. The process to raise capital for Hydro Rein is still ongoing.\n\nCapex for 2022 was NOK 11.5 billion. Capex for 2023, excluding mergers & acquisitions and Hydro Rein, is estimated to be NOK 13.6 billion. This includes a NOK 2.2 billion carry over from 2022, and NOK 1.7 billion in currency",

Monetary policy tightening combined with high energy prices and disruptions from China's zero-Covid policy put downward pressure on global growth and external sources have downgraded estimated global economic growth in 2022 to around 3 percent.\n\nForecasts of GDP growth for 2023 have been adjusted upwards to around 3 percent as inflation concerns ease and macroeconomic environment improves in line with the reopening of the Chinese economy. Uncertainty remains surrounding the pace of the fall in inflation, the continuing war in Ukraine, and the overall geopolitical situation.\n\n## Bauxite and alumina\n\nThe average Platts alumina index (PAX) decreased in the fourth quarter of 2022 to USD 317 per mt, compared to USD 338 per mt in the third quarter 2022.\n\nThe Platts alumina index (PAX) was stable around USD 315 per mt from the beginning of the quarter until early December, reflecting price levels of domestic alumina in China. PAX increased to USD 330 per mt at the end of the quarter driven by higher Chinese domestic alumina prices as refineries in China curtailed some capacity. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, the average Platts alumina index was 23 percent lower. Alumina prices have continued increasing during January 2023 due to a production curtailment in Australia, and is currently trading around USD 360 per mt.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, China imported 571kt of alumina, mostly from Australia and Indonesia. Alumina exports from China to Russia initiated in the second quarter 2022 continued, reaching a total of 184kt in the fourth quarter.\n\nChina imported 31 million mt of bauxite in the fourth quarter 2022, 19 percent higher than the same period a year ago driven by a 61 percent increase in imports from Guinea. Imports from Indonesia have declined 45 percent as the market adjusts to Indonesia's announced bauxite export ban starting in June 2023. Guinea, Australia, and Indonesia accounted for 98 percent of China's bauxite imports in the period.\n\nThe average Chinese bauxite import price was USD 61 per mt CIF in the fourth quarter of 2022, up from USD 52 per mt CIF in the fourth quarter 2021 mainly driven by higher oil prices and ocean freight rates.\n\n## Primary aluminium\n\nThe three-month aluminium price increased in the fourth quarter of 2022, starting the quarter at USD 2,162 per mt and ending at USD 2,378 per mt. The end of China's zero covid policy and re-opening of the economy led to higher demand expectations going forward into the new year. During January prices continued to increase trading around USD 2,600 per mt.\n\nUncertainty remains for certain aluminium production facilities as high global energy prices and volatile market conditions put pressure on smelter margins. As a result, many producers in Europe and the US have curtailed parts of their production.\n\nEuropean duty paid standard ingot premiums ended the fourth quarter at USD 260 per mt, down from USD 382 per mt at the end of the third quarter. The US Midwest premium remained fairly stable decreasing from USD 511 per mt at the beginning of the quarter to USD 490 per mt at the end of the quarter. During January European duty paid and US Midwest premiums increased trading around USD 290 per mt and USD 660 per mt respectively supported by increasing demand.\n\nShanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE) prices increased by USD 109 per mt ex. VAT during the quarter, ending at USD 2,376 per mt ex. VAT. Average for the quarter was down USD 50 per mt ex. VAT compared to the third quarter.\n\nGlobal primary aluminium consumption was down 1 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, driven by a decrease of 9 percent in Europe, partly offset by an increase of 2 percent in China.\n\nFor 2022 external sources 1 are estimating a global deficit of primary aluminium of around 0.3 million mt, and a surplus of around 0.1 million mt for 2023.\n\nThe European consumption of extrusion ingot and sheet",

This development was driven mainly by lower prices in Southern Norway but also higher prices in the Northern part of the Nordic market due to more normal hydrological conditions.\n\nThe Nordic hydrological balance ended the quarter around 13 TWh below normal, compared to around 11 TWh below normal at the end of the previous quarter and 17 TWh below normal at the end of the same quarter last year. Hydrology in Norway improved in the fourth quarter, but reservoir levels are still below normal. Total hydropower reservoirs were at 65 percent of full capacity at the end of the year, which is 3 percentage points below the normal level. In Southwestern Norway (NO2) the reservoirs were 63 percent full at the end of December, 10 percentage points below the normal level. The Norwegian transmission system operator, Statnett, no longer consider the energy security in Southern Norway as a concern during the winter.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Premiums\n\nEnergy spot price\n\n## Energy spot price\n\n5,000\n\nNOK/MWh\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- n System price\n- n NO2 price (Kristiansand)\n- n NO3 price (Molde, Trondheim)\n\ningot decreased in the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the same period 2021 while consumption of primary foundry alloys increased the same period due to increased automotive demand.\n\nTotal global stocks at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022 were estimated to be 9.1 million mt, down 0.1 million mt compared to the third quarter and down 0.6 million mt compared to the fourth quarter 2021.\n\n## Extruded products\n\nEuropean demand for extrusions in the fourth quarter of 2022 is estimated to have decreased 16 percent compared to the same quarter last year and 9 percent compared to the third quarter of 2022, partly driven by seasonality. Demand for the industrial and the building & construction segments have continued to weaken into the fourth quarter while growth in automotive demand is improving as supply-chain issues are easing. Some sub-segments such as renewables is also showing robust growth.\n\nOverall, extrusion demand is estimated to have decreased by 3 percent in 2022 compared to 2021.CRU estimates that the European demand for extruded products will decrease 18 percent in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter last year mainly driven by a weaker macro environment.\n\nNorth American extrusion demand is estimated to have decreased 8 percent during the fourth quarter of 2022 compared to the same quarter last year, and decreasing 14 percent compared to the third quarter of 2022. Demand is moderating in the building & construction sector amid softening housing market indicators, while the automotive segments is improving as vehicle production is picking up.\n\nOverall, extrusion demand is estimated to have increased by 2 percent in 2022 compared to 2021. CRU estimates that the North American demand for extruded products will decrease 5 percent in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter last year.\n\n## Energy\n\nNordic power prices are on average higher in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last year but declined significantly compared to the third quarter of 2022. The decrease in power prices was due to increased water inflow, warm and windy weather, and lower continental power prices.",

The quarter was mainly impacted by the reassessment of recoverability of deferred tax assets resulting in a net charge of about NOK 1,400 million related to tax losses carried forward. The tax expense also includes positive effects of the legal restructuring of the associate Lyse Kraft DA, resulting in lower power surtax of about NOK 550 million.\n\nIncome tax expense amounted to NOK 7,984 million for 2022, about 25 percent of income before tax.",

Financial income and expense are not allocated to the segments. There are no reconciling items between segment EBIT to Hydro EBIT. Therefore, a separate reconciliation table is not presented.\n\n## Notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements\n\n## Note 1  Accounting policies\n\nAll reported figures in the financial statements are based on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Hydro's accounting principles are presented in Hydro's Financial Statements - 2022.\n\nThe condensed consolidated interim financial information should be read in conjunction with Hydro's Financial Statements - 2022 that are a part of Hydro's Annual Report - 2022.\n\nAs a result of rounding adjustments, the figures in one or more columns may not add up to the total of that column.\n\n## Note 2  Operating segment information\n\nHydro identifies its reportable segments and discloses segment information under IFRS 8 Operating Segments. This standard requires Hydro to identify its segments according to the organization and reporting structure used by management. See Hydro's Financial statements - 2022 note 1.4 Operating and geographic segment information for a description of Hydro's management model and segments, including a description of Hydro's segment measures and accounting principles used for segment reporting.\n\nThe following tables include information about Hydro's operating segments.\n\n| NOK million             | Fourth quarter   2022   | Fourth quarter   2021   | Year               2022   | Year  2021   |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|--------------|\n| Total revenue           |                         |                         |                           |              |\n| Hydro Bauxite & Alumina | 7,986                   | 8,713                   | 33,951                    | 27,699       |\n| Hydro Aluminium Metal   | 13,129                  | 14,164                  | 65,483                    | 42,548       |\n| Hydro Metal Markets     | 18,222                  | 19,715                  | 90,968                    | 65,061       |\n| Hydro Extrusions        | 19,819                  | 18,509                  | 91,176                    | 70,296       |\n| Hydro Energy            | 3,037                   | 3,477                   | 12,614                    | 10,149       |\n| Other and eliminations  | (18,118)                | (18,146)                | (86,264)                  | (66,099)     |\n| Total                   | 44,075                  | 46,433                  | 207,929                   | 149,654      |\n| External revenue        |                         |                         |                           |              |\n| Hydro Bauxite & Alumina | 5,091                   | 5,471                   | 21,649                    | 17,088       |\n| Hydro Aluminium Metal   | 2,638                   | 3,681                   | 13,087                    | 5,373        |\n| Hydro Metal Markets     | 15,132                  | 16,993                  | 76,821                    | 54,165       |\n| Hydro Extrusions        | 19,881                  | 18,505                  | 90,892                    | 69,883       |\n| Hydro Energy            | 1,324                   | 1,780                   | 5,467                     | 3,257        |\n| Other and eliminations  | 9                       | 2                       | 13                        | (113)        |\n| Total                   | 44,075                  | 46,433                  | 207,929                   | 149,654      |",

Materiality is defined as items with a value above NOK 20 million. All adjusting items to results are reflecting a reversal of transactions or other effects recognized in the financial statements for the current period. Part-owned entities have implemented similar adjustments.\n\n- \u00b7 Unrealized derivative effects on LME related contracts include unrealized gains and losses on contracts measured at market value, which are used for operational hedging purposes related to future expected sales and purchase transactions, both fixed-price customer and supplier contracts and transactions at not yet determined market prices. Also includes elimination of changes in fair value of certain internal physical aluminium contracts.\n- \u00b7 Unrealized derivative effects on power and raw material contracts include unrealized gains and losses on embedded derivatives in raw material and power contracts for Hydro's own use and in physical and financial power contracts used for managing price risks and volume changes. Unrealized derivative effects on certain power contracts in a business model with the combined aim to manage hydrological risk in own power production, differences in power needs in existing and new business activities in Hydro as well as supporting development of new renewable energy projects are also adjusted for. Adjustments also comprise elimination of changes in fair value of embedded derivatives within certain internal power contracts.\n- \u00b7 Significant rationalization charges and closure costs include costs related to specifically defined major projects, and not considered to reflect periodic performance in the individual plants or operations. Such costs involve termination benefits, dismantling of installations and buildings, clean-up activities that exceed legal liabilities, etc. Costs related to regular and continuous improvement initiatives are included in adjusted results.\n- \u00b7 Significant community contributions Brazil refers to the provision recognized in relation to Alunorte's TAC and TC agreements with the Government of Par\u00e0 and Minist\u00e8rio P\u00f9blico made in September 2018, including later cost adjustments and certain similar agreements.\n- \u00b7 Other effects include insurance proceeds covering asset damage, legal settlements, etc. Insurance proceeds covering lost income or expenses incurred in the same or a prior period are included in adjusted results.\n- \u00b7 Pension includes recognition of pension plan amendments and related curtailments and settlements.\n- \u00b7 Transaction related effects reflect the (gains) losses on divested of businesses and individual assets, the net remeasurement (gains) losses relating to previously owned shares in acquired business as well as inventory valuation expense related to acquisitions.\n- \u00b7 Adjusting items in equity accounted investments reflects Hydro's share of items excluded from adjusted net income Qatalum and are based on Hydro's definitions, including both timing effects and material items not regarded as part of underlying business performance for the period.\n- \u00b7 Impairment charges (PP&E, intangible assets and equity accounted investments) relate to significant write-downs of assets or groups of assets to estimated recoverable amounts in the event of an identified loss in value. Gains from reversal of impairment charges are also adjusted for.\n- \u00b7 Realized foreign exchange gain (loss) on risk management instruments represents such items as foreign currency derivatives entered into and managed to mitigate currency risk in the production margin, i.e. the difference between sales price for products such as aluminium or alumina versus the cost of raw materials and energy used in production. Realized embedded currency derivatives in certain power contracts in Norway denominated in Euro are also adjusted for. Such currency effects are included in currency gains and losses in finance expense in the income statement, and included in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT.\n- \u00b7 Net foreign exchange (gain) loss: Realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency denominated accounts receivable and payable, funding and deposits, embedded currency derivatives and forward currency contracts purchasing and selling currencies that hedge net future cash flows from operations, sales contracts and operating capital, with the exceptions of the realized foreign currency exchange gain (loss) on risk management instruments mentioned above.\n- \u00b7 Calculated income tax effect: In order to present adjusted net income from continuing operations on a basis comparable with our adjusted operating performance, the adjusted income taxes include adjustments for the expected taxable effects on adjusting items to income before tax.\n- \u00b7 Other adjustments to net income from continuing operations include other major financial and tax related effects not regarded as part of the business performance of the period.\n\n## Alternative performance measures (APM)\n\nAlternative performance measures, i.e. financial performance measures not within the applicable financial reporting framework, are used by Hydro to provide supplemental information, by adjusting for items that, in Hydro's view, does not give an indication of the periodic operating results or cash flows of Hydro, or should be assessed in a different context than its classification according to its nature. Financial APMs are intended to enhance comparability of the results and cash flows from period to period, and it is Hydro's experience that these are frequently used by analysts, investors and other parties. Management also uses these measures internally to drive performance in terms of long-term target setting and as basis for performance related pay. These measures are adjusted IFRS measures defined, calculated and used in a consistent and transparent manner over the years and across the company where relevant. Operational measures such as, but not limited to, volumes, prices per mt, production costs and improvement programs are not defined as financial APMs. To provide a better understanding of the company's underlying financial performance for the relevant period, Hydro focuses on adjusted EBITDA in the discussions on periodic adjusted financial and operating results and liquidity from the business areas and the group, while adjusting effects excluded to EBITDA, EBIT and net income (loss) are discussed separately. Financial APMs should not be considered as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with IFRS. Disclosures of APMs are subject to established internal control procedures.\n\n## Hydro's financial APMs\n\n- \u00b7 EBIT: Income (loss) before tax, financial income and expense.\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EBIT: EBIT +/- identified adjusting items to EBIT as described below.\n- \u00b7 EBITDA: EBIT + depreciation, amortization and impairments, net of investment grants.\n- \u00b7 Adjusted EBITDA: EBITDA +/- identified adjusting items to EBITDA as described below.\n- \u00b7 Adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations: Net income (loss) from continuing operations +/- adjusting items to net income (loss) as described below.\n- \u00b7 Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations: Adjusted net income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Hydro shareholders divided by weighted average number of outstanding shares (ref.: the interim financial statements).\n- \u00b7 Investments: Additions to property, plant and equipment (capital expenditures) plus long-term securities, intangible assets, long-term advances and investments in equity accounted investments, including amounts recognized in business combinations for continuing operations.\n- \u00b7 Net cash (debt): Short- and long-term interest-bearing debt and Hydro's liquidity positions\n- \u00b7 Adjusted net cash (debt): Net cash (debt) adjusted for liquidity positions regarded unavailable for servicing debt, pension obligation and other obligations which are considered debt-like in nature.\n- \u00b7 Adjusted RoaCE is defined as Adjusted Earnings after tax for the prior 12 months divided by average Capital employed for the four most recent quarters. Adjusted Earnings after tax is defined as adjusted EBIT less Adjusted income tax expense. Since RoaCE represents the return to the capital providers before dividend and interest payments, adjusted income tax expense excludes the tax effects of items reported as Finance income (expense), net and the tax effect of adjusting items. Capital employed is defined as Shareholders' Equity, including non-controlling interest plus long-term and short-term interest-bearing debt less Cash and cash equivalents and Short-term investments.\n- \u00b7 Aluminium Metal specific adjustment to EBITDA:\n- \u00b7 Qatalum 50% pro rata represent an adjustment to illustrate Hydro's share of EBITDA in Qatalum rather than Hydro's share of net income in Qatalum. The adjustment reflects the relevant elements of Qatalum's results as included in Hydro's income statement.\n- \u00b7 Metal Markets specific adjustments to EBITDA:\n- \u00b7 Currency effects include the effects of changes in currency rates on sales and purchase contracts denominated in foreign currencies (mainly US dollar and Euro for our European operations) and the effects of changes in currency rates on the fair valuation of derivative contracts (including LME futures) and inventories mainly translated into Norwegian kroner. Hydro manages its external currency exposure on a consolidated basis in order to take advantage of offsetting positions.\n- \u00b7 Inventory valuation effects comprise hedging gains and losses relating to inventories. Increasing LME prices result in unrealized hedging losses, while the offsetting gains on physical inventories are not recognized until realized. In period of declining prices, unrealized hedging gains are offset by write-downs of physical inventories.\n\n## Adjusting items to EBITDA, EBIT, net income (loss) and earnings per share\n\nHydro has defined two categories of items which are adjusted to results in all business areas, equity accounted investments and at group level. One category is the timing effects, which are unrealized changes to the market value of certain derivatives. When realized, effects of changes in the market values since the inception are included in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBIT. Changes in the market value of trading portfolios are included in adjusted results. The other category includes material items which are not regarded as part of underlying business performance for the period,",

Management views this measure as providing additional understanding of the rate of return on investments over time in each of its capital intensive businesses and in the operating results of its business segments. RoaCE is calculated as adjusted EBIT after tax divided by average Capital employed for the respective period. The definition of capital employed was amended during 2021 to be consistent with the amended definition of Net cash (debt), and excludes long-term collateral.\n\nCapital employed for 2021 excludes Assets held for sale and Liabilities in disposal groups, as results from the divested Hydro Rolling business is separately reported as Income (loss) from discontinued operations.\n\n| NOK million                    | Reported 2022   | 2021    | Adjusted 2022   | 2021    |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------|---------|-----------------|---------|\n| EBIT                           | 30,715          | 17,887  | 31,179          | 20,786  |\n| Adjusted Income tax expense 1) | (7,489)         | (4,314) | (7,654)         | (5,255) |\n| EBIT after tax                 | 23,226          | 13,572  | 23,525          | 15,531  |\n\n| NOK million                                     | December 31, 2022   | September 30, 2022   | June 30, 2022   | March 31, 2022   | December, 31 2021   | September 30, 2021   | June 30, 2021   | March 31, 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------|------------------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Current assets in continuing operations 2)      | 55,149              | 64,723               | 65,122          | 55,912           | 46,027              | 39,689               | 36,952          | 31,439           |\n| Property, plant and equipment                   | 62,656              | 62,369               | 58,920          | 56,599           | 54,605              | 54,642               | 56,353          | 53,890           |\n| Other non-current assets 3)                     | 46,728              | 51,007               | 46,876          | 45,932           | 42,250              | 42,144               | 41,951          | 39,749           |\n| Current liabilities in continuing operations 4) | (36,061)            | (38,356)             | (39,880)        | (37,666)         | (33,140)            | (27,277)             | (25,494)        | (21,498)         |\n| Non-current liabilities 4)                      | (21,984)            | (23,502)             | (24,309)        | (26,418)         | (24,574)            | (27,020)             | (24,643)        | (22,402)         |\n| Capital Employed                                | 106,488             | 116,241              | 106,728         | 94,360           | 85,167              | 82,177               | 85,119          | 81,178           |\n\n|                                               | Reported   | Reported   | Reported   | Adjusted   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n|                                               | 2022       | 2021       | 2022       | 2021       |\n| Return on average Capital Employed (RoaCE) 5) | 21.9%      | 16.3%      | 22.2%      | 18.6%      |\n\n- 1) Adjusted Income tax expense is based on reported and adjusted tax expense adjusted for tax on financial items.\n- 2) Excluding cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.\n- 3) Excluding long-term collateral related to strategic and operational hedging activities.\n- 4) Excluding interest-bearing debt.\n- 5) Average Capital Employed measured over the last 4 quarters to reflect the return for the full year.",

Various factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in a forwardlooking statement or affect the extent to which a particular projection is realized. Factors that could cause these differences include, but are not limited to: our continued ability to reposition and restructure our upstream and downstream businesses; changes in availability and cost of energy and raw materials; global supply and demand for aluminium and aluminium products; world economic growth, including rates of inflation and industrial production; changes in the relative value of currencies and the value of commodity contracts; trends in Hydro's key markets and competition; and legislative, regulatory and political factors.\n\nNo assurance can be given that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Hydro disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.",
