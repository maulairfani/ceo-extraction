        "page_content": "## Interview with our Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How do you look back on 2022?\n\n'It was another turbulent year, which of course will be remembered for the start of the war in Ukraine. The continuing violence has claimed thousands of lives and forced millions of people out of their homes. I'm deeply saddened by all this suffering and devastation so close to home.\n\nIt is clear that we are living in a world of converging crises. We were just coming out of the Covid-19 crisis when Russia invaded Ukraine. The ongoing energy crisis aggravated inflationary pressures, and now we also find ourselves in an economic downturn. And remember, even before the pandemic, we were already dealing with the climate crisis and the cost of creating a more sustainable economy.'\n\n## What does this world of converging crises mean for the bank and its clients?\n\n'To start with our clients, I continue to be amazed by their flexibility, which already became apparent during the Covid-19 crisis. Just as things were starting to look better, we were faced with the war in Ukraine and an unprecedented rise in energy prices leading to higher cost of living for our clients. Once again, many companies rose to the challenge and found ways to significantly reduce their energy usage without impacting production levels. Is it sustainable? 2023 will tell. But the ability of our clients to innovate and navigate change is admirable, though this adaptability comes at a price.\n\nFor the bank, it means that crises feed into each other, so you can't deal with them in isolation. A good example is our new climate strategy. Although it outlines how we will play our part in limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C, this strategy is not just about climate. In line with our purpose, 'Banking for better, for generations to come', we strive to achieve a just transition.",

        "page_content": "We simply cannot take decisions on climate without considering the social consequences, and we can't expect to make progress if there's no governance.'\n\n## Despite the challenging environment, the bank delivered a strong performance in 2022. How do you explain that?\n\n'The quick answer is that we started to benefit from changing interest rate conditions, which significantly boosted our net interest income. But what you're also clearly seeing is that our strategy is starting to deliver. In 2020, we decided to de-risk the bank by winding down our CB non-core portfolio, and the past year has confirmed that we made the right choices. Our risk profile has improved and we're seeing continued volume growth in the three transition sectors we focus on: energy, mobility, and digital. If we had not de-risked the bank, we would have been much more vulnerable in the current environment. In fact all client units contributed to better results in 2022 and our cost discipline began to pay off.\n\nA big milestone this past year was our inaugural share buyback. I'm very pleased with our strong capital position, which allows us to continue to operate and grow the bank, to weather crises and to do what's right for our owners, which is to pay dividend and to return capital if and when we are able to.'\n\n## It sounds like the bank's transformation is starting to pay off. How do you view the strategic progress made last year?\n\n'We made another big step forward in being a personal bank in the digital age, serving clients where we have a right to win in the Netherlands and Northwest Europe. We have almost completed the wind-down of our CB non-core activities and made good progress on our AML remediation programme, which we expect to finalise by the end of this year. Going into 2023, we remain on track to deliver on our strategic promises to stakeholders. Our ROE for 2022 was 9% and our ambition of 10% is clearly within reach. At the same time, our cost levels are clearly not where we want them to be. We are working hard to reach our cost target for 2024, though this has become more challenging in the current environment.'\n\n## Apart from costs, what else will you focus on in 2023?\n\n'We will look at everything we do through the lens of our people and clients. Although most of our clients appreciate the convenience of digital banking, our Net Promoter Score, or NPS, remains an area of concern. Especially in personal banking, our scores are affected by negative sentiment, the increasing costs of payment packages and a further reduction in the number of branches. In 2023, we will work very hard to improve our NPS across the bank.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSecondly, we will continue to focus on the engagement of our people as our employee engagement scores took a clear hit. We have been through several reorganisations, which created a lot of uncertainty, and we had very intense negotiations about a new collective labour agreement in the Netherlands. I'm pleased that we were able to reach a solution that provides clarity and stability for the next two years. In 2023, we will try our utmost to help people reconnect with the bank and our purpose. As we continue to change the bank, we need to have the courage to have honest and sometimes extremely difficult discussions amongst ourselves. This is particularly important as we try to find our way in the era of hybrid working.'\n\n## It looks like 2023 will be another challenging year. How will that affect the bank's priorities?\n\n'Despite all the uncertainty, our priorities will remain the same. We have clarity on what we want to deliver and we can keep that at the forefront as we work through difficult times. We will continue to push the consistency of our execution, while coming together as one bank to support our clients in the best way possible. In line with our purpose, that also means we have to take care of vulnerable groups of clients who can't move at the same pace as the digital world. We will continue to offer financial care coaches to help them keep up with changes in digital banking and we are always looking for ways to better support them.'\n\n## Looking back on the past year, what are you proud of?\n\n'I'm proud that we've proven to be a stable pillar in society, supporting our clients and providing lending solutions also in times of crises. Not so long ago, banks used to be part of the problem. Today, we are part of the solution. Our business, our capital position and our liquidity levels show resilience, and we are staying very close to our clients, assuring them that we are there when they need us. Also, I continue to be proud of our colleagues worldwide, who through changing circumstances continue to stay close to our clients and our bank.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to extend a huge word of thanks to the people in the bank, for whom I have great admiration. 2022 was not only challenging because of everything going on in the world around us, but also because of our ongoing transformation. It was a year full of reorganisations, which was extremely difficult for everyone involved. Despite all those changes and challenges, our people stayed committed to our clients. I can't stress enough how crucial this is for the bank that we aspire to be. If we maintain our personal focus in a digital age, I'm confident that 2023 will be a successful year of delivery on our strategy.'\n\n## Robert Swaak\n\nCEO of ABN AMRO Bank N.V.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2",

        "page_content": "## Our operating environment\n\n## Economic and business environment\n\nFor most of 2022, economic activity remained strong, though the war in Ukraine triggered a rise in energy prices, squeezing consumer spending and slowing growth in the second half of the year. Higher inflation also brought an end to historically low interest rates and contributed to a cooling-off in the Dutch housing market.\n\n## Dutch economy\n\nThe Dutch economy continued to grow in 2022, pursuing its recovery from Covid-19 and as supply chain issues became less pressing. GDP growth started to weaken in the second half of the year, however. The conflict in Ukraine triggered a sharp rise in energy prices, squeezing consumer spending. Despite this slowdown, the Netherlands continues to outperform other economies in Europe.\n\n## Number of bankruptcies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: CBS Statistics Netherlands.\n\nUnemployment remained at historic lows throughout the year, fuelling continued skills shortages across the economy, particularly in areas such as data analytics and digital technologies. Unemployment remains lower than during the previous downturn in the Dutch economy, which followed the 2008 financial crisis. Corporate bankruptcies have been at historic lows, largely because of government support for companies during the pandemic. With the economic slowdown, bankruptcies started to increase from August, but remained below pre-pandemic levels.\n\n## Interest rates\n\nInterest rates began to rise in 2022 as the European Central Bank (ECB) responded to higher inflation in the wake of the war in Ukraine, ending a prolonged period of historically low rates. The ECB increased its deposit rate four times during the year; there were also increases at other central banks,\n\nincluding the US Federal Reserve. Mortgage rates in the Netherlands followed suit, reaching their highest level for more than five years. 1\n\n## Real estate market\n\nHigher interest rates - and the squeeze on household budgets due to rising inflation and energy prices - triggered a cooling-off in the Dutch property market. Prices for both residential and commercial property began to weaken in the second half of the year. With rising interest rates, mortgage borrowers showed a renewed interest in shorter-term loans. Defaults on mortgages in the Netherlands remain historically low, given the country's strict loan-to-income lending rules. 2 Investment in commercial property - both retail and office - started to weaken from mid-2022 as a result of higher interest rates and increased economic uncertainty. For 2022 as a whole, house prices rose by 14%; however, the number of homes sold declined by 15%.\n\n## Dutch mortgage rates\n\n(% change)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Statista 2022.\n\n## SMEs under pressure\n\nSmall and medium-sized companies (SMEs) are under increasing pressure. Many received financial support from the government during the Covid-19 crisis; this has now expired. At the same time, SMEs have to pay taxes deferred during the pandemic; some are also facing higher energy costs, which will squeeze margins, particularly if consumer spending slows amid a weakening economy. The result could be an increased risk of bankruptcies and loan defaults. Even so, unemployment is likely to remain low, given the currently tight labour market.\n\n- 1 For shorter-term mortgages of less than 10 years.\n- 2 Low unemployment and the relatively small number of interest-only loans have also helped to reduce default rates.",

        "page_content": "## Society, climate and technology\n\nThe war in Ukraine has caused considerable disruption in society. Higher energy prices have led to a higher cost of living in many countries, including the Netherlands. The war has also added to a sense of uncertainty at a time when society is still recovering from the after-effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n## Climate change\n\nDuring 2022, we saw increased evidence of climate change. Europe experienced a long heatwave during the summer. The EU has pledged carbon neutrality by 2050; companies, including ABN AMRO, are making similar pledges. According to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), we are currently on course for global warming of +2.8\u00b0C, above the +1.5\u00b0C target set out in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. 1 Therefore, climate change remains a priority for ABN AMRO, both in managing climate risk in our own business and in supporting our clients' transition to new, low-carbon business models.\n\n## Digital technologies\n\nDigital technologies have become a fixture in our lives - in everything from shopping, communications and transport to banking. At ABN AMRO, we are using digital technologies to improve client service, increase efficiency and reduce operating costs. Data is giving us new insights into what our clients need and want. At the same time, digital technologies bring new risks - we are constantly monitoring cyber and privacy risks, for example, to protect our systems and keep our clients' money safe.\n\n## Regulatory change\n\nBanking is one of the most highly regulated industries. We are constantly adapting to new regulations in all areas of our business, ranging from risk management to payment services and consumer protection. New capital rules are being introduced under Basel IV. EU regulators have also introduced new rules on sustainable finance - these include the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), which applies to asset managers and investment advisers, and the planned Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), due to come into effect from 2024.\n\nAs of 2025, the CSRD will require all large companies 2 to report more on their social and environmental performance, an important step in increasing funding for more sustainable businesses. See page 349 for full details of regulatory developments in 2022.\n\n## Cost of living\n\nMany households are struggling with rising prices, particularly for food and energy. According to the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy, poverty rates have increased to 6.7% in 2022. 3 As one of the Netherlands' leading retail banks, we are supporting our clients where possible. Government intervention will soften the effect of rising consumer prices, particularly among lower-income groups struggling to pay household bills. The government's 2023 budget excises duty on fuel and increased social security payments for the worst-off. The government also agreed a separate price cap with energy companies to limit household bills.\n\n## Changing societal attitudes\n\nSocietal attitudes continue to change, and we are seeing a greater emphasis on diversity, inclusion and fairness following the pandemic. At the same time, attitudes in the workplace are changing. The increase in at-home working since Covid-19 has highlighted the importance of well-being, with renewed pressure on employers to support mental health.\n\n- 1 Source: UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2022.\n- 2 Companies must report under the CSRD if they meet at least two of the following criteria: they have more than 250 employees, annual turnover of more than EUR 40 million or assets exceeding EUR 20 million.\n- 3 Source: Dutch Central Planning Bureau (September 2022 estimate).\n\n<!-- image -->",

Just over 42 million shares were repurchased at an average price of EUR 11.77. ABN AMRO's largest shareholder - the Dutch government's NL financial investments (NLFI) participated fully in the buyback, and as a result retained its 56.3% stake in the bank.\n\nIn line with our capital framework we have since announced another share buyback programme of EUR 500 million to further optimise our capital position, superseding the EUR 250 million conditional share buyback permission. This programme will commence on 9 February and is expected to end no later than June 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Two-year labour agreement signed\n\nABN AMRO signed a new two-year Collective Labour Agreement (CLA) with Dutch trade unions.

We asked Ewald Bontje, owner and Commercial Director of Grozette, how his business is coping with increased costs.\n\n- 'Grozette produces grated and powdered cheese, mainly for the catering, food processing and retail industries. We export to around 35 countries.\n\nWe need a lot of energy to dry the cheese, which we receive from cheese producers. And in the past few months, we've seen a significant increase in energy prices. Energy now accounts for a major part of our overall cost base.\n\nIt's not just energy, either. We've also had price rises for the cheese we buy, as well as for transport, packaging and machine parts, and even for inputs like cardboard.\n\nOf course, we're working closely with our suppliers and customers. But, inevitably, these price increases are cutting into our margins. Hopefully, prices will come down as we get closer to summer, but we're still living in uncertainty for the time being.\n\nWe're fortunate that we started building a new factory two years ago. That factory is now fully up and running.\n\nWe used a combination of gas and electricity in the past, but are now using only electricity. Although it hasn't made much difference in terms of price, it does give us an advantage in another area.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Given the importance of moving away from gas in the Netherlands, our new factory means we're well positioned for the future\n\nGiven the importance of moving away from gas in the Netherlands, our new factory means we're well positioned for the future. If we had to make a similar investment decision today, with the increased prices and interest rates, the outcome would most likely be different.\n\nABN AMRO helped us with the financing; the bank provided a green loan. Our factory was built to the latest BREEAM sustainability standards, and it's double the size of our old one in terms of square metres.'\n\n## Ewald Bontje\n\nOwner and Commercial Director, Grozette B.V.",

It is the basis for how we shape and deliver on our strategy, and encourages high performance and engagement from our employees. Our strategy has three strategic pillars: customer experience, sustainability and future-proof bank . These are our guiding principles in acting on our purpose.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our positioning and strategy\n\nThrough our strategy, we are becoming a personal bank in the digital age. We have long-term client relationships built on trust and supported by sector and sustainability expertise. Our trusted relationships with clients, together with our capabilities across all client segments, enable us to support them at all important financial steps in their lives.\n\nWe have made clear choices, resulting in a distinct profile and focus, serving clients where we have scale in the Netherlands and Northwest Europe. We are fully committed to our moderate risk profile and role as a gatekeeper of the financial system. Our culture and licence to operate remain clear priorities.\n\nIn 2022, we continued to execute our strategy. At the beginning of the year, we re-organised the bank into three new client units to ensure we always put clients' interests first. We have now almost completed the wind-down of our former Corporate & Institutional Banking business outside Europe. On Customer experience, we introduced updated digital signatures, continued to expand video banking and put in place a new three-layered client service model to deliver both convenience and expertise. On Sustainability, we published our climate strategy, aimed at achieving 'net zero' across all our portfolios by 2050 at the latest - in line with the Paris Climate Agreement. We also provided more budget coaches and debt counsellors during the year to those struggling to meet the higher cost of living. Meanwhile, on Future-proof bank, we digitalised more of our processes to further improve customer service, made progress on our Anti-Money Laundering (AML) programme and signed a new two-year collective labour agreement for our employees in the Netherlands.",

We offer both convenience and expertise. We deliver a convenient daily banking experience increasingly digitally. At moments that matter we support our clients with sector and sustainability expertise. We are focusing on attractive segments in the Netherlands and Northwest Europe where we can grow profitably. In the Netherlands, we will further develop our positions in mortgages and among SMEs with new propositions, and we are pursuing growth in the market for wealthy clients, affluent and high-income clients and mid-to-large corporates, where we can leverage our expertise.\n\nWe aim to achieve positive Net Promoter Scores (NPS) and to increase our market share to above 20% in both mortgages and SMEs. In Corporate Banking Northwest Europe, we are building on our expertise in the Netherlands and will focus on the energy, mobility and digital transitions, aiming for a top-three position in selected niches. We remain open to acquisitions that accelerate our strategy execution and are developing new business models in areas such as sustainability and digital banking. For details of progress made against our customer experience pillar, see page 30.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sustainability has been a core element of our strategy since 2018 and is core to our\n\npurpose. Our goal is to help clients transition to more sustainable business models. We are focused on the wider sustainability shift: our efforts are designed to help mitigate climate change, accelerate circular business practices and create positive social impact. We also strive to lead by example, reducing our carbon emissions, strengthening our approach to human rights, increasing our positive social impact and also improving gender diversity of our staff particularly among those at the 'sub-top' immediately below the most senior management levels. In early 2022 we confirmed our commitment to achieve net zero emissions across our portfolios and operations by 2050, in line with the trajectory to limit global warming to a maximum temperature increase of 1.5\u00b0C from pre-industrial levels. During 2022, we developed a bank-wide approach to achieve our net zero ambitions and mitigate the transition risks associated with climate change. We aim to support our clients in decarbonising their business models and footprint through continuous engagement, offering advice and financing solutions. We have formalised our climate commitment by joining the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, becoming part of a global group of banks committed to aligning their lending and investment portfolios with net zero emissions by 2050. To integrate sustainability across our businesses, we established a Sustainability Centre of Excellence, headed by our new Chief Sustainability Officer. We have set clear 'sustainability acceleration' targets. By 2024, our aim is to have more than one-third of loans and client investments allocated to sustainable businesses, projects or assets. For details of progress made against our sustainability pillar, see page 33.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are building a future-proof bank by simplifying and centralising our operating model, delivering a better experience for our clients, while at the same time delivering on cost-saving programmes.\n\nThis means further digitalising our business processes, streamlining our product offering and introducing a new client engagement model. By 2024, we aim to have approximately 90% of high-volume processes digitalised end-to-end and to have reduced the size of our product portfolio by around 60%. At the same time, we place great value on fostering a culture within the bank in which everyone feels respected and valued. Our employees are the foundation of the bank of the future and therefore we support our people as part of our drive to develop and transform our workforce.

Through our loans, we may be indirectly damaging the environment or financing companies with a poor record of respecting labour rights. To minimise these risks, we set strict rules for lending and investment.\n\n## Our stakeholders\n\nWe define our stakeholders as any group or individual the bank affects through its activities or products and services or who, in turn, may affect the bank's ability to achieve its goals.\n\nUsing this 360\u00b0 definition, we recognise four main stakeholder groups: our clients, employees, investors and society.

To demonstrate this, our value creation model uses six capitals, based on the Integrated Reporting <IR> Framework: manufactured, financial, intellectual, human, social and natural.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For example through mortgage lending, which gives clients access to home ownership. In the case of the Dutch housing market, this is an asset that increases in value for clients. We also create value through our extended loans and advances to support businesses and job creation. We measure our value for specific focus segments through our Net Promoter Score.\n\n## Net Promoter Score\n\n\u00c5\n\n0 NPS Mortgages\n\n\u00c5\n\n-38\n\nNPS SMEs\n\nIn exchange for our services - our manufactured capital - clients and counterparties transferred considerable financial capital to ABN AMRO by paying interest on loans or mortgages and paying transaction fees. Value created for investors rose sharply, mainly driven by an increase in ABN AMRO's share price and a rebound in the bank's net profit for the year.\n\n- \u00c5 EUR 1.96 earnings per share\n- \u00c5 9% return on equity\n- \u00c5 16% CET 1 ratio (Basel IV)\n\n- \u00c5 EUR 5.3 billion absolute cost base\n- \u00c5 3 bps cost of risk\n\nWe created intellectual value for clients by providing advice, by investing in innovation & technology and by maintaining the stability and reliability of the our banking payment system. We also received intellectual capital from others, including suppliers and business partners. At the same time, there were adverse effects, for instance resulting from cybercrime incidents\n\n- \u00c5 201 client complaints relating to data privacy breaches (1 substantiated)\n- \u00c5 90 total client complaints relating to breaches of other regulatory or voluntary codes\n- in the Netherlands (4 substantiated)\n- \u00c5 21 (potential) violations of the Banking Sector Disciplinary Regulations\n\nThroughout the year, Covid-19 continued to deplete value, affecting our employees' occupational health and safety. At the same time, we created value by providing desks and other equipment to improve home working. In 2022 our workforce grew, creating more value through contributed time, skills and knowledge. In return, we created value for our employees through salaries and benefits. In addition to skill development, we also focused on attracting and retaining talent by offering our employees reskilling and upskilling.\n\n- \u00c5 78% employee engagement score\n- \u00c5 2,749 new internal hires\n\nOur social capital is impacted significantly by our relationships. We have reduced our value creation as reflected in a lower NPS for Personal & Business Banking and a decrease in ABN AMRO's brand value. Social value got depleted through discrimination, underpayment and child labour. However, we created value in 2022 by further reducing financial distress due to difficulties in repaying loans.\n\n- \u00c5 31% D&I at sub-top\n- \u00c5 Net Promoter Score (NPS) 2022\n- \u00c5 -16 P&BB (Consumer & Affluent)\n- \u00c5 -38 P&BB (Business Clients & Ecosystems)\n- \u00c5 12 Wealth Management\n- \u00c5 8 Corporate Banking\n\nWe are aware that, like any business, our activities may also cause harm. By financing growth and through our own operations, we are also indirectly damaging the environment. In 2022 we continued to reduce our impact on the environment and use of natural resources, largely as a result of further winding down our CB non-core activities. In addition, to offsetting our own operations emissions, we worked to further minimise our negative impact through, among other things, circular transactions and sustainable products. This impact is measured through our sustainability (acceleration) asset volume KPI.\n\n- \u00c5 2.70 kTon of carbon emissions from our scope 1 own operations\n- \u00c5 2.93 kTon of carbon emissions from our scope 2 own operations\n- \u00c5 40.62 kTon of carbon emissions from our scope 3 own operations\n- \u00c5 22,587 million tonnes of carbon emitted as a result of the bank's lending and investment activities (scope 3)\n\nMuch of the value we create is financial in nature, though it may also be social or environmental. To demonstrate this, our value creation model uses six capitals, based on the Integrated Reporting <IR> Framework: manufactured, financial, intellectual, human, social and natural. Inputs and output metrics are included for illustrative purposes only. All figures are for 2022, unless otherwise stated.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We asked Teun van Leijsen, founder of Stoov \u00ae , what the new approach - known as Entrepreneur & Enterprise means in practice.\n\n- 'My relationship with ABN AMRO goes back to 2005. I used to be a banker myself, so I know the ins and outs. I see ABN AMRO as a trusted advisor, on both a personal and business level.\n\nA few years ago, I decided I wanted to live a more sustainable life personally and professionally. I spotted a gap in the market: outdoor terrace heaters for bars and restaurants are very inefficient and costly, and so my idea was to warm the person, not the air around them. I quit my job and set up Stoov \u00ae . We make a whole range of heating cushions, pillows and covers, and we're selling right across Europe.\n\nThe business has been doing really well. So, I wanted to make a few changes in my personal life. It was actually my advisor at ABN AMRO who suggested I should pursue my dream of building my own net-zero energy house. I thought it wouldn't be possible because all my money is tied up in the business. But the bank arranged everything, taking my personal and business finances into account.\n\nWe just recently finished the house. I'm really pleased with it. It's built from wood, and it's 100% energy neutral. We don't use gas - we have solar panels on the roof and electric charging for our cars. It's exactly what I meant when I said I wanted to live a more sustainable life.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhat I appreciate about my advisors at ABN AMRO is that they're always there for me. And there are no hidden agendas. I have an idea, I call them, and a few days later they're sitting in my living room, saying 'What do you need, how can we help you?'.'\n\nI spotted a gap in the market: outdoor terrace heaters for bars and restaurants are very inefficient and costly, and so my idea was to warm the person, not the air around them\n\n## Teun van Leijsen\n\nFounder and CEO, Stoov \u00ae B.

In 2022, we continued to expand our digital banking proposition. We also made it easier for clients to make appointments online, extended our Entrepreneur & Enterprise service and worked closely with corporate clients on accelerating the sustainability shift.\n\n## Personal through convenience\n\nTo bring convenience to daily banking, we are moving to a full digital service. Most of our products - approximately 95% - are now available remotely through, for example, video banking. During 2022, we also extended digital onboarding for new clients. Since October 2022, business can apply ZealiD - an app by a Swedish company certified to issue electronic signatures - for Dutch clients and prospects to sign documents remotely. 1\n\nThe increase in digital banking means fewer clients are visiting our branches 2 . The introduction of electronic signatures is likely to lead to a further decline in visitors. As branches close, we make sure clients still have access to banking services by mobilising our contact centres and financial care coaches to help those who need assistance with digital banking. Over the past year, we further expanded video banking, which gives clients quick and easy access to specialists. In 2022, 98% of meetings with mortgage clients took place by video (compared with 96% in 2021). Digital signatures means loans, mortgages and other paperwork can be finalised and signed at online meetings.\n\nMeanwhile, we are also building on the success of the Tikkie app. Since its launch in 2016, Tikkie has become a fixture of daily life in the Netherlands: in 2022, it had over eight million users. Last year, we added a group payments function and launched Tikkie Zakelijk, a separate made-for-\n\nbusiness version. During the year, we also began to merge Grip, our personal finance app, with our main ABN AMRO app. Merging the two apps will give approximately three million active ABN AMRO app users access to Grip functions, offering them at-a-click oversight of their personal finances.\n\n## Personal in expertise\n\nWe want clients to have access to our advice and expertise when making key financial decisions at important moments in their lives. For individual clients, that may be when they buy a house or get married. For companies, it may be when they need financing to grow their business or acquire another company. Expanding digital banking allows our front-office staff to spend more time with clients where support is needed.\n\nFor corporate clients, we continued to expand our sustainability advisory business and introduced a Product-asa-Service (PaaS) desk to support clients looking for funding for such businesses. This is a fast-growing sector and we now have a PaaS loan portfolio of around EUR 250 million. At the same time, we continued to develop Beyond Banking products for SMEs, one of our other key growth areas. These products include online bookkeeping and invoicing and help with recruitment through our partner HR Office. We also extended our Entrepreneur & Enterprise (E&E) service for Wealth Management clients, combining management of entrepreneurs' personal and business needs.\n\n- 1 In addition to electronic signatures, we are also using ID.me, a system that allows people to provide proof of identify online. By the end of 2022, ID.me had been approved for use in dozens of client processes.\n- 2 Client visits have declined by more than 82% since 2019; by the end of 2022, we had reduced the number of ABN AMRO branches in the Netherlands to 27.",

This model has three layers:\n\n- \u00c5 Full digital self-service: clients can access most products themselves online, as well as make payments, open accounts and provide proof of identity.\n- \u00c5 Assisted self-service: if needed, clients can get more information through click-to-chat and our contact centres. Anna, the ABN AMRO chatbot, now handles around half of all online client requests.\n- \u00c5 Personal expertise: clients can get advice from our experts when they need it through video and in-person meetings.\n\n## Focus markets\n\nAs part of our strategy, we are focusing on specific markets in the Netherlands and Northwest Europe:\n\n## Netherlands\n\n## Northwest Europe\n\n- \u00c5 Affluent and wealthy clients\n- \u00c5 E&E service\n- \u00c5 Mortgage clients\n- \u00c5 Medium-sized and large enterprises\n- \u00c5 Wealthy clients\n- \u00c5 E&E service\n- \u00c5 Medium-sized and large enterprises\n- \u00c5 SMEs (including self-employed)\n- \u00c5 SMEs (including self-employed)\n\nWe have also set targets to grow our market share among SMEs and mortgages to 20% by 2024. Among SMEs, our market share declined to 16% in 2022, down from 18% the year before, while our share of the mortgages market increased to 17%, up from 16%.\n\n## Market share for SMEs and mortgages\n\n(in %)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSMEs\n\nMortgages\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strong demand for mortgages\n\nMortgages are an important part of our business residential mortgages account for more than 60% of our loan book. During 2022, we saw continued strong demand for mortgages in the Netherlands, driven mainly by clients trying to lock in the low mortgage rates as these were beginning to rise. With interest rates rising, borrowers also turned to shorter-term mortgages, where ABN AMRO has a well-established presence. By the end of 2022, our share of the Dutch mortgage market had risen to 17%, up from 16% the year before. In recent years, we have digitalised many of our mortgage processes. We are also working with clients to improve the energy efficiency of their homes.\n\n## Ending negative interest rates\n\nIn October 2022, we stopped charging negative interest rates on clients' accounts. Like other banks, we introduced negative rates in 2019 because we were paying interest on deposits held at the European Central Bank (ECB) and eventually passed these rates on to clients with total deposits exceeding EUR 100,000. At that amount, only around 5% of clients had to pay negative rates. We were able to stop charging negative rates in October 2022. In December, we raised rates on our savings accounts to 0.25%.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Over the past year, we provided more financing to businesses and individuals making the shift to sustainability. We also put in place a plan to fulfil our ambition of becoming net zero across all portfolios by 2050 or sooner.\n\nWe are supporting the shift to sustainability in various ways: by working closely with clients to adopt more sustainable business models, by investing more in renewable energy than we did in 2021 and by encouraging property owners to make their homes and buildings more energy-efficient.\n\nOur three main focus areas in sustainability are climate change, the circular economy and social impact (see below).\n\n## Sustainability governance\n\nStrong governance is essential to the success of our approach to sustainability. We want to ensure that all decision-making within the bank takes into account our sustainability objectives. In 2022, we established a Sustainability Centre of Excellence and a Group Sustainability Committee to oversee implementation of our sustainability strategy. Please refer to page 231 for more information on our sustainability governance.\n\n## Sustainability acceleration targets\n\nTo support our objectives, we set clear sustainability acceleration targets. We want more of our loans, proportionally, to go to businesses that meet our sustainability standards and more of our Wealth Management clients to choose ESG funds and strategies. With more focus on sustainability across the economy, we are seeing continued demand from businesses and individual investors.\n\nWe aim to increase the asset volume of sustainable client loans (including mortgages and corporate loans) and ESG and impact investments as part of the bank's outstanding mortgage loan book, corporate loan book and relevant client asset volume from around one-fifth to over one-third in 2024. We are making good progress, with a score of 31% at the year-end.\n\n## Operational sustainability targets\n\n|                                                         | Targets   | Targets   | Targets   | Results   | Results   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n|                                                         | 2024      | 2023      | 2022      | 2022      | 2021      |\n| Percentage sustainability (acceleration) asset volume 1 |           |           |           |           |           |\n| - ESG + impact investments 2                            | 42%       | 40%       | 38%       | 46%       | 38%       |\n| - Residential mortgages                                 | 34%       | 31%       | 28%       | 28%       | 25%       |\n| - Corporate loans to clients 3                          | 27%       | 21%       | 16%       | 19%       | 14%       |\n| Total                                                   | 36%       | 32%       | 29%       | 31%       | 27%       |\n| External rating                                         |           |           |           |           |           |\n| S&P Global ESG Dow Jones Sustainability Index 4         | top 5%    | top 5%    | top 5%    | top 15%   | top 15%   |\n\n- 1 The definition of sustainability (acceleration) asset volume is based on ABN AMRO's Sustainability Acceleration Standards. These standards contain clear definitions with regard to clients' sustainability policies, practice and governance. The overall target for sustainability (acceleration) asset volume is calculated as the sum of sustainability (acceleration) asset volume (mortgages and corporate loans) and sustainability (acceleration) client asset volume, divided by the sum of the outstanding mortgage loan book, corporate loan book and relevant client asset volume.\n- 2 In the past our assessment of the Sustainability Acceleration Standard (SAS) KPI has been conservative when data was unavailable or of low quality.\n- 3 Corporate loans were previously reported separately as loans from our Corporate & Institutional Banking and Commercial Banking businesses. This figure is now reported as corporate loans in line with the new client units introduced at the start of 2022. Corporate loans includes loans from all three client units. Non-core loans from our former Corporate & Institutional Banking unit are not included. Results for 2021 have been adjusted accordingly to allow like-for-like comparison.\n- 4 The result indicates to which extent ABN AMRO deviates from the highest score of the industry leader.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2",

        "page_content": "## Note on Green Asset Ratio\n\nIn 2022, we carried out an initial Green Asset Ratio (GAR) pilot. The aim of the GAR pilot was to better understand the complexities and processes, and how to cope with potential data gaps for next year's disclosure. As published information regarding alignment of NFRD companies is not yet available, the pilot was based on the assumption that these companies were not aligned with the Taxonomy. For our Dutch portfolio of loans collateralised by residential properties, we were able to estimate alignment based on assumptions.\n\nThe criteria used for determining a substantial contribution for properties are based on building permit year, property type and energy performance (A-labels and BENG2). Loans highly exposed to physical risks were excluded from the GAR calculation. Since the exact interpretation of all the criteria is not yet clear and many assumptions were made when analysing this pilot, we chose to disclose an estimate to reflect the uncertainty in the regulation.\n\nBased on two plausible scenarios, we calculated a preliminary Green Asset Ratio estimate of approximately 8-9%, where we used ABN AMRO's total covered assets as the denominator of the GAR and the potential aligned assets as the numerator. We chose to use the total covered assets in the denominator so as to align with next year's compulsory GAR disclosure. The detailed methodology of the underlying numbers can be found in the definitions section of this report.\n\n## Climate change\n\nTo facilitate and accelerate climate action, we have an inclusive and expertise-based approach. For us, engaging with clients to support their transition is fundamental to truly making a difference. Our sustainability efforts aim to support our clients in decarbonising their business models or assets and their environmental footprint in order to structurally reduce carbon emission in the real economy, accelerate circular business practices and create positive social impact. In line with our purpose, we strive to achieve a responsible and just transition that is socially inclusive and demonstrates respect for human rights.\n\nOur climate strategy, launched in 2022, is an action plan designed to achieve our goal of bringing our portfolios into line with the scenario of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C and supporting the transition to a net zero economy by 2050. We have set intermediate targets for 2030 for five sectors: oil and gas, power generation, shipping, commercial real estate and residential mortgages (the largest asset class in our books). We have also set a carbon reduction ambition for our client assets portfolio and aim to achieve carbon neutrality in our own operations in 2030. We will replace our Mission 2030 target with these new climate targets, both for CRE and residential mortgages.\n\nTo engage with our clients in a meaningful way, we need to know where our clients are on their journey towards net zero and how they are progressing. For the sectors in scope, we will therefore carry out a review process to assess where clients in these priority sectors are on this journey. For our Corporate Banking clients, our client engagement process will be further enhanced to include sector-specific questionnaires assessing the risks and opportunities. As we gain deeper insight into our clients' needs, we will look to capitalise on opportunities by providing access to capital, expertise and partnerships, our key tools for change as a bank.\n\n- \u00c5 In  Corporate  Banking,  we  are  mobilising  capital  to support the sustainability transition through products such as GroenBank loans, sustainability-linked loans and bonds. Our teams are working closely with clients to address relevant sector topics such as upcoming disclosure requirements and climate change related risks and opportunities. At the same time, we are helping clients through initiatives such as Impact Nation, designed to support our clients with their key sustainability challenges. We are also working through the Poseidon Principles to decarbonise international shipping. We have a program in place to facilitate corporate real estate clients making their assets more sustainable and we are providing advice to clients on possible government support and subsidies.\n- \u00c5 In Wealth Management, we have a dedicated ESG & Sustainability investment team to support clients. ESG investment is the default option across our wealth management business. As part of the bank's climate strategy, we will be working with clients to set ambitions for their investments, based on carbon intensity. As securing reliable data is still a challenge in many areas, we will start with equity investments in discretionary portfolios before moving to other asset classes.",

        "page_content": "- \u00c5 In Personal & Business Banking, we are working directly with mortgage clients to improve the energy efficiency of their homes. The Mortgage Advice Policy stipulates that every advisor is required to discuss additional financing options for sustainability improvements at every mortgage consultation and list the options customers have for making their properties more sustainable. This subject is also included in the mortgage advice report. We use the Energy Saving Check to provide insight into energy-saving measures. We have also made it easier for residential buy-to-let projects if properties have an A or B energy efficiency label. Personal & Business Banking has a dedicated team, drawn from different departments, that focuses on executing the bank's climate strategy. We have stepped up training among bank staff and intermediaries to support better client engagement. As one of the country's leading mortgage providers, we have a longstanding commitment to improving energy efficiency in homes and offices.\n\n## Circular economy\n\nAs part of our approach to sustainability, we want to be a frontrunner in the circular economy. Since 2019, we have provided financing for nearly 190 circular deals that re-use waste materials, reducing pressure on often scarce natural resources. These deals include businesses such as:\n\n- \u00c5 Fairphone, which provides more socially responsible mobile phones. These phones are provided in a PaaS model to clients\n- \u00c5 In Ovo, which has developed a machine for sexing chicks, thus avoiding the unnecessary slaughter of millions of birds. These machines are provided in a PaaS model where the client pays per use of the machine and In Ovo is responsible for maintaining and repairing the machines.\n\nIn total, we have committed over EUR 1.7 billion to circular economy deals, putting us on course to meet our EUR 3.5 billion target by 2024. In 2022, we agreed additional financing for a total of EUR 361 million, which is the same amount as in the previous year. Demand for circular deals has been growing steadily in recent years: in 2022, the Dutch government included the circular economy in its Green Projects Regulation, a decision that may also create opportunities for more financing via ABN AMRO's Groenbank. To reach our target, we are also encouraging leasing and Product-as-a-Service (PaaS) deals, which can prolong a product's shelf-life and reduce waste (see page 30).\n\n## Financing for ReintenInfra's new 'circular' premises\n\nFinanced by ABN AMRO, ReintenInfra B.V. built new premises using recycled materials from its own road example of our commitment to the circular economy.\n\nconstruction and demolition business. This is an The new premises, in Borne in the eastern Netherlands, consist of a workshop and offices. Eighty per cent of the materials for the building from carpet tiles to wooden walls and suspended ceilings - came from the company's own demolition and other projects. Even the concrete used to build the new premises was reclaimed. Funding for the project came from ABN AMRO's Groenbank (green bank), which commits at least 70% of client savings to finance sustainable projects like ReintenInfra's.\n\n## Social impact\n\nSocial issues have gained in prominence in recent years first with the Covid-19 pandemic, now with higher costs of living. As a bank, we have a responsibility to help clients in financial difficulty, where we can, and to make sure that everyone has equal access to the financial system. Over the past year, rising prices have increased poverty 1\n\nand financial hardship in the Netherlands.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe have 117 budget coaches and debt counsellors to support clients with money problems before their debt becomes problematic. In 2022, these budget coaches worked with more than 70,000 households potentially unable to repay loans or keep up to date with household bills 2 . We also joined the National Coalition for Financial Health, along with ING and Deloitte, with the aim of halving the number of households in the Netherlands with financial worries.\n\nDuring the year, our primary focus was on prevention, given that many clients are anxious and unaware that we provide help in these circumstances, or leave it too late before seeking help. We also focused on younger people and\n\n- 1 Source: Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, CPB (August 2022).\n- 2 Our budget coaches support clients with money problems, while we also have financial care coaches to help vulnerable clients with digital and online banking.",

These salient issues are based on an initial analysis carried out in 2020 and a further intermediate assessment in 2022.\n\nWe have strengthened different elements of our client and credit acceptance due diligence procedures for temporary employment agencies and companies that work with migrant workers. Here, we aim to cover the entire spectrum of issues that are relevant to the issues of fair pay and decent working and living conditions among vulnerable migrant workers in the Netherlands.

We believe ABN AMRO should reflect the diversity of that society, not just because it is the right thing to do, but because it brings us closer to our clients and leads to more effective decision-making within the bank. We want our employees to be free to be who they are and feel comfortable in the workplace.\n\nWe have targets for both gender and cultural diversity.

To support our work in this area, we have a detailed Human Rights Statement, which sets out our commitments. Consideration for human rights is also integrated into our Sustainability Risk Framework. We use quarterly risk reviews to identify, manage and address our human rights risks and impacts (described in further detail in our Human Rights Report 2022). As part of our compliance with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, we have also identified our salient human rights issues - those issues we believe are most at risk through our activities and business relationships.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2",

Over the past year, we have simplified our organisation and digitalised more of our processes to improve customer service and continued with our Anti-Money Laundering (AML) programme. We also signed a new two-year collective labour agreement for our employees in the Netherlands.\n\n## Simpler organisation\n\nWe restructured our organisation in 2022. We replaced our Executive Committee with an eight-member Executive Board and introduced three new client units 1 , appointing a Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) for each unit; all three CCOs have a seat on the Executive Board. These changes bring us closer to our clients as the units are organised around client needs.\n\nMeanwhile, we have nearly completed the wind-down of the non-core part of our former Corporate & Institutional Banking business, currently part of Corporate Banking. In 2022, we closed our offices in Dubai, Shanghai, Sydney and Brazil (note these last two locations will continue as Clearing locations). By the end of 2022, we have decreased 93% of CB non-core loans and advances. The wind-down has significantly improved the bank's risk profile; as part of our strategy, we are committed to maintaining a moderate risk profile.\n\nDuring the year, we also continued to digitalise more of digitalised 63% of these high-volume processes, putting\n\nour processes. To achieve this, we are focusing first on processes with the highest volumes, including savings, mortgages and payments. By the end of 2022, we had ourselves on track to meet the 2024 target of 90%.\n\nDigitalisation reduces operational risk, supports our new client service model and adds convenience to our clients' daily lives. Clients can now have video meetings with their bankers and advisors and sign documents remotely (see page 30).\n\nIn line with our digital-first approach, we are simplifying our product portfolio, with the aim of reducing the number of products by 60% by 2024. We are also migrating more of our operations to the cloud and extending our use of DevOps - where IT Development and IT Operations work in joint teams to speed up the adoption of new digital processes. By the end of 2022, 316 teams had made the switch to DevOps, an increase from 244 in the year before.\n\n## Straight-through-processing rate of high-volume processes (in %)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Innovation and use of data\n\nThroughout 2022, we pursued our innovation strategy, focused on three main goals:\n\n- \u00c5 To contribute to a smarter, more sustainable living environment\n- \u00c5 To help safely issue, store and trade digital assets, such as digital currencies or non-fungible tokens (NFTs)\n- \u00c5 To support digital platforms that offer innovative financial services\n- 1 Previously, the bank was organised around four business units: Retail Banking, Private Banking, Commercial Banking and Corporate & Institutional Banking.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Through innovation, we are looking to create the next generation of products and services and generate new fee income by employing new digital technologies. We are working on initiatives for each of the goals above. These include PayDay, speeding up payments to employees in the gig economy and ID& Pay, which allows users to identify themselves and make payments within a single app.\n\nWe are also working with fintech partners in areas ranging from personal data management to open banking and anti-money laundering. ABN AMRO Ventures, our venture capital arm, currently has EUR 150 million invested in up-and-coming fintech companies. Its latest investment was in Oper Credits, a Belgian software-as-a-service company involved in mortgage lending. In 2022, we also ran our second Future of Finance Accelerator programme with our partner Techstars and continued to support the alumni from the first cohort on their journeys. Moreover, we consolidated our innovation activities through our Strategy & Innovation department.\n\nAlongside innovation, we are stepping up our use of data, as this gives us insight into client needs and supports new product development. Our data strategy focuses on three areas: making sure our data is fit to be used, distributing that data quickly and securely within the bank, and 'unlocking its value'; in other words, ensuring that the data can be analysed and used by our teams to develop new products and services to meet our clients' needs.\n\n## Cybersecurity\n\nTo successfully drive secure banking in the digital age, we need to be able to continually adapt to emerging threats and global trends. Cybercrime will not be slowing down any time soon and cyber criminals are becoming more professional in their attacks. We have a responsibility to protect our clients' data, privacy and money. We therefore have in place strong capabilities to secure our bank and we are also continuing to invest in our security measures and our capacity to adapt to change, so we can respond quickly to new threats. In 2022, we did not have any significant loss of client data as a result of cyber attacks to report and we were able to maintain a very high level of availability of our internet banking services. The bank works every day to keep our clients safe - a responsibility that is shared by every employee within the bank. Attending security awareness training is part of the mandatory banking licence of every employee.\n\n## Workforce fit for the future\n\nTo support our strategy, we need a workforce that is fit for the future. Like other companies, we are seeing significant skills shortages in the labour market in areas such as data analytics, digital technologies, project management and advisory. During the past year, we increased our use of people analytics to help us identify skills gaps at the bank. In recent years, we have stepped up our recruitment efforts, in part to support digitalisation and AML. In 2022 we had 2,749 new hires, compared to 1,737 in 2018.\n\nGenerally, we prefer to reskill or upskill rather than recruit from outside. Over the past year, we spent nearly EUR 39 million on external training and development. We have extensive education programmes in place, including the Compliance Academy, the AML Academy and the Circl Academy, which is responsible for our sustainability training courses. Our approach emphasises the importance of self-learning; in other words, of learning by doing. We have also simplified our job model to encourage mobility within the bank. Over time, we believe we will need a smaller workforce, given the wind-down of our CB non-core operations and increased automation in certain areas. Most of which, we believe, will be achieved through natural attrition, i.e. people retiring or leaving the bank.\n\n## New internal hires\n\n(headcount, 2018-2022)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Hybrid workplace\n\nPost-pandemic, we have moved to a more hybrid way of working, with employees dividing their time between the office and home. We encourage all staff to spend at least one day a week at the office to strengthen teamwork and make team agreements that contribute to have an effective and impactful workday. Alongside the shift to more hybrid working, we are seeing an increased focus throughout society on mental health and well-being. In 2022, we continued to build on our MyWellbeing programme, which now encompasses physical, mental and social well-being, with initiatives ranging from regular health checks to help with family care and advice on maintaining a healthy work-life balance.",

We currently have more than 4,000 employees working on AML. We are now moving into a new phase under the AML NXT programme. In this phase, we will aim to be smarter and more efficient in the way we work, focusing on higher-risk transactions and automating more of our processes. Costs associated with AML peaked in 2021 but during the past year we were able to reduce the number of staff working in this area by nearly 20%. Although we are making progress in our AML remediation programmes, ongoing efforts are required to complete the programmes by the end of 2023 and embed the ongoing AML set-up and execution for ABN AMRO. 1\n\n- 1 In April 2021, ABN AMRO accepted a settlement with the Netherlands Public Prosecution Service for shortcomings in the bank's anti-money laundering activities. To address these shortcomings, the bank put in place remediation programmes in coordination with the Dutch central bank.\n\n## Collective Labour Agreement\n\nAfter several months of negotiations, we agreed a new two-year collective labour agreement (CLA) with the trade unions. The CLA, which covers most of our employees in the Netherlands, includes a pay increase of 4% from October 2022 and a further 2.5% from July 2023. It also includes a one-off payment of EUR 2,000 for each employee 1 and increases in working-from-home and commuting allowances to help employees manage the rising cost of living.\n\n## Employee engagement\n\nHaving an engaged, motivated workforce will help us attract and retain the skills we need to execute our strategy. Every year, we conduct an employee engagement survey. The results for 2022 showed a decline in our overall engagement score to 78 (compared to 82 in 2021), below our target of 82 for the year; there were lower scores in all categories, but the largest decreases were in senior management and vision & direction. A total of 68% of employees took part in the survey, down from 70% in 2021.\n\nResponses from employees highlighted pay and personal recognition as areas where the bank could do better. At the same time, there was appreciation for learning & development and recent improvements to employees' work-life balance.\n\n- 1 On a full-time basis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs in previous years, the survey results were broken down by team, and discussed within each team to decide on specific follow-up actions.

For us, this means doing:\n\n- \u00c5 What we have to do - complying with all relevant laws and regulations.\n- \u00c5 What we can do - being able to pursue commercial opportunities, and\n- \u00c5 Importantly, what we want to do - behaving in a morally responsible way.\n\nPlease refer to our Leadership & governance section (pages 179-235) for further details of our internal policies and controls, and our approach to compliance.\n\nTo further strengthen our approach in this area in 2022, we rolled out our updated Code of Conduct and a new, bank-wide Behavioural Risk Policy. We also pressed ahead with our Speak-Up programme to reinforce a speak-up culture within the bank, so that employees feel safe reporting violations or discussing ethical dilemmas. We encourage employees to speak out if they know of risks or behaviours that may violate our principles or standards. Employees can discuss concerns with their manager or report their suspicions through, for example, the bank's whistle-blower procedure, also open to external parties.

We also decided to expand our reporting of potential violations of our standards to include all investigations into allegations of wrongdoing within the bank and the action we took where appropriate.\n\n## Reported violations, 2022\n\n| Category                                                     | Number of  violations or   | Reprimanded                 | Left the bank               | Status FBEE 1                     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|                                                              | potential violations       | Sanctions taken by ABN AMRO | Sanctions taken by ABN AMRO |                                   |\n| Share trading irregularities                                 | 4                          | 2                           | 2                           | Settled, with  follow-up measures |\n| Nepotism (favouring yourself, friends, family or loved ones) | 5                          | 1                           | 4                           | Pending                           |\n| Fraud                                                        | 3                          | 0                           | 3                           | Pending                           |\n| Unlawful transmission of/access to private data              | 4                          | 1                           | 3                           | Pending                           |\n| Forgery or counterfeit                                       | 3                          | 2                           | 1                           | Pending                           |\n| Professional irregularities in carrying out work             | 2                          | 0                           | 2                           | Pending                           |\n| Total                                                        | 21                         |                             |                             |                                   |\n\n- 1 Status refers to FBEE follow-up investigation.\n\nThis table shows violations reported by ABN AMRO to the Independent Foundation for Banking Ethics Enforcement (FBEE). The FBEE enforces the Code of Conduct enshrined in the Banker's Oath, which is obligatory for all banking sector employees in the Netherlands. Status refers to the FBEE follow-up investigation - all potential or actual violations are investigated to establish if there has been a breach of the Banking Sector Disciplinary Regulations. This is the first year ABN AMRO has published these figures. Future years will also include year-on-year comparisons.\n\n## Financial crime\n\nLike other banks, ABN AMRO has an important role as a gatekeeper to help protect the wider financial system against crime and fraud. To do this, we look to improve internal policies, processes and controls so as to comply with regulations and minimise risk for the bank and its stakeholders.\n\n## Combating bribery, corruption and fraud\n\nCorruption undermines fair business, hampers trade, reduces investor confidence and may affect economic growth and stability. Our responsibility is to conduct business free of bribery and corruption. To do so, and in line with relevant regulatory requirements, we monitor risks associated with bribery, corruption, fraud, money laundering and terrorist financing. We also maintain a strong framework of internal controls, including annually assessing risks in our Systematic Integrity Risk Analysis (SIRA).\n\n## Due diligence\n\nWe carry out extensive due diligence with regard to clients and other third parties to minimise the risk of being involved in financial wrongdoing. We monitor clients' activities and report suspicious or unusual transactions to the relevant authorities. Clients in high-risk situations are subject to enhanced due diligence, including those with political exposure, or living and active in countries or sectors with a higher incidence of financial crime.\n\nUnacceptable risks may lead to a prospective client or third party being rejected or - in the case of existing clients to an 'exit' from the bank. We have a dedicated AML programme to further strengthen controls on money laundering and terrorist financing.",

We are committed to complying with the letter, intent and spirit of tax legislation in all the countries we operate in. This means paying the right amount of tax at the right time.\n\nOur basic principles are aligned with the Confederation of Netherlands Industry and Employers' (VNO-NCW) Tax Governance Code:\n\n- \u00c5 We use business structures that result from commercial decisions, are in line with business activities and have genuine commercial purpose.\n- \u00c5 Our relations with tax authorities are characterised by respect, transparency and trust.\n- \u00c5 We provide regular information to stakeholders 1 on our approach and the taxes we pay.\n\n## Governance\n\nOur Executive Board oversees management of tax issues. Tax is also discussed regularly in the Supervisory Board's Audit Committee (see pages 198-199). We have tax principles, contained in our tax policy, that guide our actions and decision-making.\n\nWe report taxable income and income taxes paid for each country we operate in 2 and file a country-by-country report to the Dutch tax authorities.\n\nThe following pie chart shows the various taxes paid and collected by ABN AMRO. Where indicated, this information is limited to the Netherlands for VAT, payroll taxes and dividend tax withheld. The other taxes are global.\n\n## Total taxes paid/borne and collected 2022\n\n(in millions)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are committed to improving the level of transparency further in future years.\n\nWe comply with transparency rules with respect to clients, including the worldwide Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). We also report aggressive and potentially aggressive cross-border arrangements under the EU Directive on Mandatory Disclosure Rules DAC6.\n\n## Managing tax risk\n\nWe have a Tax Control Framework, which is updated when necessary to reflect changes in regulations or stakeholder interests. Tax is also integrated into our broader risk management cycle, and included in risk assessments for new products or business activities. We monitor compliance with our tax policy and have controls in place to ensure that tax returns are filed in good time and that tax positions are promptly identified and reported.\n\nWe engage pro-actively with tax authorities to ensure we fully understand our tax obligations. With the rise in new technologies, we regularly exchange information with tax authorities, in line with domestic and international regulations. We expect these requirements to be extended further in view of the introduction of more automated tax filing.\n\n## Client tax integrity\n\nClient tax integrity has grown in importance in recent years. Our standards in this area are based on ABN AMRO's core values and moderate tax risk appetite and are in compliance with our wider risk profile and the expectations of the Dutch central bank.\n\nWe organise training to ensure staff remain aware of integrity risks, given changing international tax rules. In the case of clients, we look to steer clear of aggressive tax planning and tax avoidance; our intention is always to offer products complying with the letter, intent and spirit of tax legislation and that are commercially sound rather than tax-driven. This approach is included in our tax policy, tax principles and product approval process, and monitored through our Tax Control Framework.\n\n## International developments\n\nOver 100 countries have stated that they support the introduction of a global minimum tax of 15%. ABN AMRO is currently looking into the implications of this new regime, known as Pillar 2. The current expectation is that this will have limited impact on our effective tax rate.\n\n- 1 For this tax the scope is: The Netherlands.\n- 1 These stakeholders include investors, policymakers, employees, contractors, civil society and the general public.\n- 2 See Note 11 to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements, showing our revenue, tax expenses and income taxes paid for each country.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2",

Coming out of the Covid-crisis, we started the year with positive energy. We were excited about our strong foundation to build and grow from. Then the war in Ukraine started, which completely changed the dynamics. We were confronted with a new set of circumstances, including rising energy prices, high inflation, and a return to positive interest rates and we once again demonstrated our resilience in a challenging environment.\n\n## Key indicators\n\n| (in millions)                               | 2022   | 2021   | Change   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|\n| Net interest income                         | 5,422  | 5,210  | 4%       |\n| Net fee and commission income               | 1,778  | 1,664  | 7%       |\n| Other operating income                      | 640    | 724    | -12%     |\n| Operating income                            | 7,841  | 7,597  | 3%       |\n| Personnel expenses                          | 2,458  | 2,324  | 6%       |\n| Other expenses                              | 2,968  | 3,482  | -15%     |\n| Operating expenses                          | 5,425  | 5,806  | -7%      |\n| Operating result                            | 2,415  | 1,791  | 35%      |\n| Impairment charges on financial instruments | 39     | -46    |          |\n| Profit/(loss) for the period                | 1,867  | 1,234  | 51%      |\n| Other indicators                            |        |        |          |\n| Common Equity Tier 1 ratio                  | 15.2%  | 16.3%  |          |\n| Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (Basel IV)       | 16%    | 16%    |          |\n| Net interest margin (NIM) (in bps)          | 129    | 127    |          |\n| Return on average Equity 1                  | 8.7%   | 5.8%   |          |\n| Dividend per share (in EUR) 2               | 0.99   | 0.61   |          |\n\n- 1 Annualised profit/(loss) for the period, excluding payments attributable to AT1 capital securities and results attributable to non-controlling interests, divided by the average equity attributable to the owners of the company excluding AT1 capital securities.\n- 2 Interim/final dividend per share over the relevant period as declared/proposed by the company, subject to approval at the annual general meeting (AGM).\n\nWe delivered a strong financial performance. The financial results for 2022 were marked by the normalisation of the interest rate environment and low impairments, while fee income increased by 6%. Our return on equity for 2022 was 8.7%. The normalised interest rate environment creates an easier relationship with our clients, and it has a very positive impact on our net interest income. We also saw strong performance in our fee businesses, driven by higher payment volumes, pricing, and the increased diversification of our revenue base. At Wealth Management, asset management fees fell as last year's stock market losses pushed down our AUM. But this was offset by Clearing, which benefited from higher transaction volumes on the back of the increased market volatility.\n\nAll our three client units did better than in the previous year. In corporate loans, our loan portfolio grew as we continued to pass on the benefits from TLTRO to our clients. In mortgages, we became the market leader in the Netherlands, as we benefited from our ability to target different market segments with our various labels and our strong relationship with intermediaries. At the same time, growth in sustainability financing in our core segments was strong enabling us to maintain the overall size of our loan portfolio.\n\nOverall, we are demonstrating strict discipline on costs, but we have to work much harder to manage the impacts of inflation on our cost base. The pressure on costs was intensified across the board. We are starting to see the cost",

        "page_content": "## Large incidentals\n\nPlease find below an overview of the largest incidentals affecting our results for the year. More detailed information on other large incidentals disclosed can be found in the quarterly reports.\n\n## Provision for variable interest compensation\n\nIn 2021, a cumulative provision of EUR 306 million was booked in Personal & Business Banking for the compensation scheme regarding revolving consumer credit with floating interest rates. In 2022, the Appeals Board of the Dutch Financial Services Complaints Authority (Kifid) ruled that clients with interest rates that were not sufficiently aligned with market rates should also be compensated for compound interest (interest on interest) and the provision was increased by EUR 110 million for client compensation.\n\n## TLTRO\n\nThe 2022 figures include EUR 189 million discount from the TLTRO programme (until 23 November 2023), which was recorded in net interest income. The figures for 2021 include EUR 93 million. Most of this benefit is being passed to our clients.\n\nDuring last quarter of 2022, ECB announced that TLTRO III terms and conditions changed from 23 November 2022 onwards. As a results of this change, the hedge held for interest rate sensitivity was no longer effective and led to a loss of EUR 319 million, which was booked in Other Operating Income at Group Functions.\n\nreduction benefits from the wind-down of CB non-core. We also made very good progress in our AML-remediation, which will help alleviate costs going forward. We are on track to complete the program in 2023, after which we will approach AML on a business-as-usual basis. This is already visible in the number of people dedicated to the program, which fell by more than 15% last year.\n\nOur capital position remains very strong, with a fully-loaded Basel III CET1 ratio of 15.2% and a Basel IV CET1 ratio of around 16%. In line with our capital framework, we propose a final cash dividend equivalent to EUR 0.67 per share. In addition, we have announced a share buyback of EUR 500 million, superseding the conditional share buyback permission announced in Q2. Our strong capital position enables us to consider further share buybacks. We are aiming for a gradual reduction of capital over time, in constructive dialogue with our regulator.\n\n## AML\n\nIn 2022 EUR 84 million was added to the provisions for the AML remediation programmes. The scope of the provision was further updated to incorporate additional requirements agreed with the Dutch central bank (DNB) and, after a review, more AML remediation related activities were added to the provision.\n\nIn 2021, ABN AMRO accepted a settlement offer from the Netherlands Public Prosecution Service following the latter's investigation into the bank's anti-money laundering (AML) activities in the Netherlands. As part of the settlement, ABN AMRO agreed to pay a fine of EUR 300 million and a disgorgement of EUR 180 million.\n\n## Sale and leaseback of head office in Amsterdam\n\nIn 2021, ABN AMRO completed the sale and leaseback of its head office at the Gustav Mahlerlaan in Amsterdam for a total consideration of EUR 765 million. The transaction resulted in a gain of EUR 327 million (EUR 245 million net of tax) in other operating income at Group Functions.\n\nLooking forward, for 2023 the financial results will also depend on economic developments. The European economy is proving more resilient than expected, but we still expect slower growth and remain cautious about the longer-term effects of inflation. In the Netherlands higher interest rates will continue to put pressure on the housing market, but excess savings post-Covid and a still very strong labour market are dampening the impact of inflation. More likely than not, inflationary pressures will continue and, as a bank, we will probably have to manage higher risk costs due to an increase in unemployment and bankruptcy filings. Also, we need to be prepared for further surprises coming out of the war in Ukraine. We haven't yet seen a significant deterioration in asset quality. If the situation worsens, we are well positioned to navigate this environment. We maintain very strong capital and liquidity buffers and we have taken a proactive approach to loan loss provisions to cushion the impact should it materialize.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The decline was mainly caused by TLTRO III programme repayments, fair value adjustments from hedge accounting and the decrease in professional lending.\n\nCash and balances at central banks decreased by EUR 6.0 billion due to TLTRO repayments; we participated in the TLTRO III facility from June 2020 onwards.\n\nLoans and advances customers decreased by EUR 14.3 billion, totalling EUR 243.9 billion at 31 December 2022, largely due to a decrease of EUR 8.4 billion in professional lending (with several Clearing clients reducing their positions and self-financing their deposit and margin contributions) and to a decrease in fair value adjustments from hedge accounting. This was partially mitigated by an increase in client loans.\n\nClient Loans increased by EUR 5.0 billion to EUR 240.1 billion at 31 December 2022. The increase was mainly attributable to an increase in residential mortgages, reflecting strong operational capabilities, and corporate loans, mainly in Corporate Banking core and in line with our strategic objectives for Northwest Europe.",

We spoke to Mrs Karijadi about how she is working closely with her debt counsellor at ABN AMRO to ensure she can keep up with the bills.\n\n'Every year, I sit down with a debt counsellor and we go through my finances. This year, the debt counsellor was Angela Brand. I currently have a service loan with ABN AMRO. Angela and I regularly look at how I'm doing: whether I need to cut my spending, or if I'm getting all the income I'm entitled to.\n\nEvery year, I sit down with a debt counsellor and we go through my finances\n\nJust lately, I've seen prices really going up, particularly for groceries. Everyone is talking about the cost of living at the moment. I don't have any expenses that are out of the ordinary. Apart from the monthly repayments on my loan, I have my shopping, heating bills and insurance - just like everyone else. I'm lucky - I go to the same supermarket to buy food every day. Of course, I notice that costs have risen, but I haven't had to cut back.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEven so, I am on a tight budget. I used to work in the clothing industry. I retired from my job two years ago. I get the state pension. But that's not enough, so I also get healthcare and rental allowances. And I live on my own. There's nobody else bringing in money, so I have to rely on what I have.\n\nThis year, I spoke with Angela and, together, we thought I could actually increase my repayments. It's only a small increase, but it's reduced the duration of the loan by a third, which was a really nice surprise. It's great to have someone like Angela. She's very helpful. And we work together, that's important. She gives me a sense of control. At the moment, I've got no immediate money worries, and every reason to be optimistic about the future.'\n\n## Mrs Karijadi\n\nABN AMRO Personal & Business Banking Client",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nGoing into 2023, we expect a tougher economic environment. The cost of living will remain a concern for thousands of households across the Netherlands. We also expect to see a further cooling-off in the Dutch housing market, continued skills shortages across the economy and ongoing political pressure to act on climate change.\n\n## Economic and business environment\n\nThe European economy has proven more resilient than expected. In 2023, however, we forecast slower growth for the Netherlands and a moderate recession for the eurozone as a whole. Activity is no longer being stimulated by pent-up demand or by the recovery of supply chains in the aftermath of lockdowns. We expect a small increase in corporate bankruptcies, after the record lows seen during the pandemic thanks to government support measures.\n\nHousehold spending is being hampered by higher inflation. Though inflation is coming down as the upward effect of increased energy prices wanes, we expect the ECB will stick to its tightening stance. Interest rates have risen substantially on the back of tightened monetary policy. These higher interest rates will continue to put pressure on the Dutch housing market, where the number of transactions has dropped and prices have started to correct after increasing sharply during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n## Climate change and society\n\nPolicymakers will continue to focus on climate change. Pressure remains on governments to accelerate the phasing-out of fossil fuels to reach the +1.5\u00b0C global warming limit set out in the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. We expect companies across the Netherlands and Europe to continue adopting more sustainable business models, supporting our strategy.\n\nSkills shortages are likely to persist, especially in areas such as data analytics and digital technologies, which are in strong demand across the economy. With low unemployment, we expect the current tight labour market conditions to continue well into 2023.\n\nPolitically, the cost of living will remain a priority, with continued uncertainty about energy prices. However, the Dutch government support package announced in September 2022 is helping households to pay their energy bills.\n\nGeopolitical concerns are likely to remain, with no immediate end in sight to the war in Ukraine and the prospect of continued tensions between the US and China.\n\n## Bank performance\n\nEconomic uncertainty could lead to lower demand for corporate loans as more companies put investment plans on hold. In the housing market, we expect a correction in house prices and pressure on the number of transactions, feeding through into lower demand for mortgages. In the coming year, we will continue to deliver on our strategic objectives. We aim to further diversify our income sources by increasing our fee income and realising further growth in our focus segments. We will finalise our remediation while increasing the efficiency of our AML processes. Cost discipline remains high on the agenda, given the pressure from higher inflation and additional investments. We are working hard to reach our cost target of below EUR 4.7 billion in 2024, though this has become more challenging in the current environment. For 2023, we expect non-core and AML-related costs to come down in line with our strategy. However, these cost savings will be largely offset by increasing investments. For example, we are building up our sustainable finance regulation capabilities. In addition, we are also investing in our data capabilities, for example, linked to risk models and further digitalisation of our processes.\n\n## The European economy has proven more resilient than expected\n\nFor 2023, we expect non-core and AML-related costs to come down in line with our strategy.

        "page_content": "## Introduction\n\n## About risk, funding & capital\n\nThis section provides an introduction to the Risk, funding & capital chapter. As this chapter of the Integrated Annual Report contains information based on EU IFRS as well as CRD V/CRR2, this section provides more information on differences in scope and consolidation.\n\n## Regulatory requirements\n\nThe Risk, funding & capital chapter presents the disclosures required under the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wet op financieel toezicht - Wft), title 9 book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and EU IFRS. ABN AMRO also embraces the Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF) principles and recommendations. For non-financial disclosures required under the Dutch Decree on non-financial disclosures, ABN AMRO follows the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), including its guidelines. Certain disclosures in the Risk, funding & capital chapter are an integral part of the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements (AFS) and contain audited information. The audited parts concern risk disclosures of financial instruments (IFRS 7) and capital disclosures (IAS 1). Audited information in these sections is labelled as 'Audited' in the respective headings, including the sub headings. The audited section runs until the next heading of the same level is mentioned without an audited label.\n\n## Risk exposure measurement and scope differences\n\nRisk measures vary according to the purpose for which the exposure is calculated: EU IFRS or the determination of regulatory or economic capital (CRD V/CRR2).\n\n## EU IFRS reporting scope\n\nThe objective of the financial statements is to provide the primary users of these financial statements with useful financial information about the bank to support their decisions. Financial information is useful when it is relevant and reliably represents what it purports to represent. Financial statements provide information about the financial position of the bank and the effects of transactions and other events that change the bank's financial position. The consolidation scope of ABN AMRO is determined in accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements. More information can be found in Note 1 Accounting policies in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements.\n\n## Regulatory reporting scope\n\nThe objective of regulatory reporting is to take a risk view on the bank's portfolio and to ensure that the bank maintains sufficient capital buffers to cover unexpected losses, and sufficient liquidity buffers. The scope of consolidation for the purpose of calculating regulatory and economic capital (based on the CRD V and CRR2) is generally the same as the consolidation scope under EU IFRS and includes subsidiaries that are directly or indirectly controlled by ABN AMRO and active in the banking and financial sectors. Subsidiaries consolidated under EU IFRS but active in sectors other than banking and finance are excluded from the regulatory scope of consolidation.\n\nThe objective of the financial statements is to provide primary users with useful financial information about the bank to support their decisions\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Loans and advances\n\nIn 2022, total loans and advances decreased to EUR 258.2 billion (31 December 2021: EUR 261.4 billion). Other loans and advances showed the largest decrease, primarily driven by lower trading positions of Clearing clients at year-end 2022. Furthermore, lower commodity prices and outflows towards segregated client accounts caused a decrease in margin contributions for Clearing clients. This decrease in loans and advances was partly offset by an increase in residential mortgages.\n\nCorporate Banking's non-core portfolio further decreased to EUR 1.2 billion at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: EUR 2.0 billion). Approximately EUR 0.5 billion of this portfolio was classified as stage 3 (31 December 2021: EUR 0.6 billion).\n\n## Exposure at Default\n\nEAD decreased to EUR 391.1 billion (31 December 2021: EUR 417.2 billion), largely because of the decrease in loans and advances and, to a lesser extent, lower cash and balances at central banks due to repayment of TLTRO III facilities.\n\n## Credit quality indicators\n\nWith the exception of the stage 2 ratio, credit quality indicators improved in 2022. The forbearance ratio improved to 2.7% (31 December 2021: 4.3%). This improvement is especially evident in residential mortgages and corporate loans. Many clients for whom Covid-19-related forbearance measures were applied in 2020 came to the end of the two-\n\n## RWA flow statement credit risk\n\n(in millions)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Economic capital\n\nEconomic capital (EC) rose to EUR 20.7  billion (31 December 2021: EUR 19.0 billion) reflecting higher own funding spread risk EC (EUR 1.0 billion), higher credit risk EC (EUR 0.9 billion) and higher business risk EC (EUR 0.6 billion), partly offset by lower market risk EC (EUR 0.7 billion). The increase in own funding spread risk EC is primarily attributable to changes in the balance sheet\n\ncomposition. EC for credit risk increased mostly due to additional credit risk model add-ons and business developments. The increase in business risk EC resulted from updated scenarios of future economic developments in the EC measurement. Market risk banking book EC decreased mainly due to a lower client behaviour risk contribution as a result of the higher interest rate\n\nyear forbearance probation period during 2022 and ceased to be foreborne.\n\nCompared to 31 December 2021, total arrears declined modestly from EUR 2.1 billion to EUR 2.0 billion, resulting in a past due ratio of 0.8% (unchanged). While the past due ratio for residential mortgages and consumer loans remained stable, the past due ratio for corporate loans declined further to 1.0%. A change in the past due accounting of the recourse portfolio at Asset Backed Finance contributed to this decline.\n\nThe stage 3 ratio decreased to 2.0% at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: 2.6%), attributable to the outflow of clients due to repayments and clients returning to stage 2. The stage 3 coverage ratio decreased from 28.3% to 25.6% due to the write-down or return to stage 2 of some highly provisioned loans.\n\n## Risk-weighted assets\n\nTotal RWA rose to EUR 128.6 billion (31 December 2021: EUR 117.7 billion), predominantly driven by credit risk RWA. Credit risk RWA was up as a result of a new model risk add-on and the migration of specific portfolios from the Advanced IRB approach to Foundation IRB and to the Standardised Approach, partly offset by model updates and changes in asset quality. Market risk RWA also increased over the year, but came down in the second half of the year. CVA risk RWA (counterparty credit risk) rose slightly over the year as a whole, while operational risk RWA remained relatively stable.",

        "page_content": "environment.  EC for operational risk remained relatively flat at a level of EUR 2.1 billion.\n\n## Liquidity and funding indicators\n\nThe Loan-to-Deposit (LtD) ratio decreased to 96% at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: 103%). Loans and advances to customers decreased, while due to customers showed an increase, reflecting a continued rising trend in client savings. The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) both remained well above 100% throughout 2022.\n\n## Capital ratios\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1 and total capital ratios were 15.2%, 16.7% and 20.9%, respectively (31 December 2021: 16.3%, 18.0% and 22.4%, respectively). The CET1 capital ratio decreased compared to 31 December 2021 due to an increase in RWA, partly offset by an increase in CET1 capital. The latter increased, mainly due to the net profit for 2022 (after dividend and AT1 coupon payments) and partly offset by the permission granted by the ECB to repurchase shares totalling EUR 500 million. All capital ratios were in line with the bank's risk appetite and were comfortably above regulatory requirements.\n\nThe leverage ratio increased to 5.2% at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: 5.0%), mainly due to a decrease in on-balance sheet exposures, including those due to TLTRO repayments, and an increase in CET1 capital, while MREL improved to 30.1% (31 December 2021: 27.9%), mainly due to issuances of senior non-preferred instruments and the increase in CET1 capital, partly offset by RWA increases.\n\n## Emerging risks\n\nIdentifying and mitigating emerging risks early on forms an important part of our risk management framework. Material emerging risks are recorded in our Risk Event Register and serve as input for our risk monitoring, stress testing and the review of our risk taxonomy. For more information on our Risk Taxonomy, please refer to the Risk framework section. During 2022, the following emerging risks were assessed to be material.\n\n## War in Ukraine\n\nOur expectation is that the war in Ukraine will persist well into 2023 and that geo-political tensions and risks will continue to have an impact on energy and food supplies. Supply chain issues could remain in force in the upcoming year, which could be amplified by further sanctions and export restrictions. We will continue to monitor the impact on our clients and prudent buffers will remain in place. The direct impact of the war is low, given our limited exposure in Ukraine and Russia.\n\n## Cyber risks\n\nThe increase in cyber threats poses a risk to the business continuity of the bank. Given the increased use of data and cloud solutions, cyber-related attacks have the potential to significantly threaten our operational resilience. We see that the degree of sophistication demonstrated by hackers and in hacker tooling is increasing, making cyber defence more challenging. In addition, and without mitigating measures, increased dependence on third parties increases our vulnerability to cyber attacks. For details of our mitigating actions, please refer to the Operational (non-financial) risk section.\n\n## Inflation\n\nInflation has been rising, driven by the post-Covid economic effects and the war in Ukraine. Looking forward, inflationary pressures will remain significant, assuming a prolonged war, further geopolitical tensions and supply chain issues. This could impact on future economic growth and subsequently on our clients. We use our credit risk framework and additional reviews of our credit portfolio to monitor and assess the impact of increased inflationary pressure.\n\n## Rising interest rates\n\nGiven that central banks across the globe steadily raised interest rates in 2022, economic growth could be further hampered. The increases in interest rates, which are expected to continue in 2023, could further undermine economic recovery. However, the expected trajectory of interest rate increases will most likely decrease. We actively manage interest rate risk in our loan book. Potential second-order effects are covered in our macroeconomic scenarios, which form the basis for our expected credit loss (ECL) calculations.\n\n## ESG-related risks\n\nEnvironmental, Social & Governance-related risks are gaining in importance and could create risks and also opportunities for our clients and the bank's business model. Conclusions from our materiality assessment on climate and environmental risks (CER) are elaborated in the subsequent risk chapters. In our home market, the Dutch government's nitrogen emission reduction targets could further impact on our clients active in the agricultural/ livestock, construction and other emission-intensive industries. Management overlays on ECL have been taken for specific climate and environmental risk-related events that are not (or not yet) included in the macroeconomic forecasts.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2",

How does this relate to your work as Chief Risk Officer?\n\n'Our climate strategy shows how we plan to align our portfolios with our ambition to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C and support the transition to a net zero economy. This is crucial for the planet, but also for the bank and all our stakeholders. Even if we manage to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C, we will still experience more extreme weather conditions going forward. This entails a higher risk of property damage arising from flooding, storms or prolonged drought, which could have serious implications for our clients and our portfolios.\n\nAs we transition to a more sustainable economy, our clients have to ensure they can keep up with changes in regulations, consumer preferences and technology. The increased regulatory pressure in recent years has broadened the scope of our dialogue with clients. In conversations, we don't just talk about the financials, we also help clients understand the changing regulatory landscape to minimise their transition risk.'",

        "page_content": "## Apart from climate, what other risks have emerged in the past year?\n\n- 'One thing is clear - 2022 was a year in which risks increased. We were faced with the war in Ukraine and inflationary pressures and, of course, we are now in a rising interest rate environment. As a result, it has become more expensive for clients to get funding, and we're already witnessing a price correction in the housing market. Add this to the increased macroeconomic uncertainty, and it's easy to see that the environment in which we operate has become much uncertain over the past year.\n\nAnother risk which, in our digital society, is continually growing is cybercrime. We are investing in our systems to improve our own cybersecurity and we are working closely with clients to increase their awareness about threats like malware, CEO fraud and phishing.'\n\n## As you mentioned, the current environment has also increased risks for clients. What do you think about their performance in 2022?\n\n- 'I'm very impressed with how clients found ways to adapt to changing circumstances. 2022 turned out to be a very different year than we had all anticipated. The war in Ukraine and the subsequent energy crisis created a much more challenging environment. Clients responded very well, for example by reducing their energy consumption.\n\nWhat also helps are the changes in our portfolio. Our focus on Northwest Europe and the energy, mobility, and digital has helped reduce our exposure to the countries and sectors that were hit hardest by the crisis. At the same time, we benefited from growth among clients active in the transition sectors. In 2022, the increased resilience of our portfolio translated into very moderate loan impairments. As a result, we stayed well below our guidance for throughthe-cycle cost of risk.'\n\n## Still, risk-weighted assets increased by EUR 11 billion in 2022. How do you explain that?\n\n'An important part of the increase credit risk is mainly due to changes in the models we use as we prepare for Basel IV, which is scheduled to take effect in 2025. Many of our outstanding loans will still be on our books then, which is why we decided to already bring our models in line with the upcoming changes. For some parts of our portfolio, Basel III is stricter than Basel IV, which is why our Basel III CET1 is lower than our Basel IV CET1.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## How do you see the bank's risk profile as we go into 2023?\n\n- 'I feel comfortable about our risk profile. Risks have increased, but this doesn't mean there will be issues for the bank if those risks materialise. We have stress-tested many negative scenarios, which showed that the bank is strong enough to withstand shocks. We are very well capitalised, and we have a strong liquidity position.\n\nOf course, we are closely monitoring the macroeconomic situation. We have developed all kinds of scenarios, positive and negative, and applied them to the bank's balance sheet and profit and loss accounts to assess the possible implications. We also conduct more frequent deep dives into certain parts of our portfolio that might be more exposed, such as commercial real estate. There's a lot of uncertainty, but we feel comfortable that the provisions we have made are sufficient. Clients still have buffers. We are seeing resilience in our portfolio but also in society more generally, because of the buffers clients have.'\n\n## You are personally involved in various Diversity & Inclusion activities at the bank. How do these efforts feed into your work as CRO?\n\n'An inclusive work environment is incredibly important for good risk management. If people feel free to share unpleasant messages, risks will come to light sooner. It's also about including different perspectives: in a diverse and inclusive environment, multiple perspectives and opinions are brought to the table, which makes it more likely that we will be prepared for the unexpected.'\n\n## Tanja Cuppen\n\nCRO of ABN AMRO Bank N.V.",

The visual below summarises these risks. The risk taxonomy is reviewed and updated on an annual\n\nbasis, or sooner if any new material risk type emerges and requires an update.\n\nABN AMRO is committed to being a well-capitalised and sufficiently liquid bank that focuses on delivering sustainable value to all of its stakeholders. This is defined by our strategic risk appetite statement and ensured by our risk management framework, which is further explained in this chapter.\n\nThe financial impact is assessed on the basis of capital and net profit. The key financial risk types related to our business model are credit risk, market risk in the banking book and liquidity risk. The non-financial impact is determined by the Net Promoter Score (NPS), sustainability (acceleration) asset volume and environmental and social footprint. In 2022, ABN AMRO recognised sustainability risk as a standalone risk type and defined it in the broader context of Environmental, Social and Governance-related\n\nrisks factors.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Boards are accountable for setting, approving and overseeing the implementation of the bank's risk management framework, including:\n\n- \u00c5 an adequate and effective internal governance and control framework.

In the risk decision-making framework, the Executive Board has set up three executive risk management committees: the Group Risk Committee, the Group Central Credit Committee and the Group Regulatory Committee, each of which is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer. The mandates of the executive risk committees are summarised below.\n\n## Group Risk Committee\n\nThe Group Risk Committee (GRC) is mandated by the Executive Board to monitor, assess and manage the bank's risk profile within the approved risk appetite. The GRC monitors and approves all material risks as defined in the bank's risk taxonomy. The GRC has delegated specific approval powers to sub-committees, including Business Risk Committees for the bank's main client units, the Financial Crime Risk Committee, the Methodology Acceptance Group, the Scenario and Stress Testing Committee, and the Impairment and Provisioning Committee.\n\nThe Group Central Credit Committee (CCC) is mandated by the Executive Board to make decisions on the acceptance of credit and counterparty risk in respect of individual persons, legal persons and public administrative bodies relating to credit proposals falling within the scope of the risk appetite and limits determined by the Executive Board. In addition, the CCC is also responsible for approving and monitoring large intercompany credit facilities.\n\n## Group Regulatory Committee\n\nThe Group Regulatory Committee is mandated by the Executive Board to ensure a good understanding and adequate overview of regulatory changes. This Committee makes choices and decisions on matters relating to timely compliance with new and changing national and international legislation and regulations affecting the bank.\n\nFor further information on governance, please refer to the Leadership and governance chapter.\n\n## Risk measurement\n\nWe develop and use internal models to quantify the risk for most risk types in the risk taxonomy. The models for credit, operational, market, liquidity and business risk are the most widely used to measure the level of risk. They support day-to-day decision making, as well as periodic monitoring and reporting on developments in the bank's portfolios and activities. In many cases, models quantify the probability and severity of an event, i.e. the likelihood that an event will occur and the loss the bank may suffer as a consequence of that event occurring. This outcome of the models serve as the basis for ABN AMRO's internal measures of risk (economic capital) and as key input for calculating the minimum regulatory capital requirements according to the Basel framework (regulatory capital).\n\nNew models require approval before being implemented and used. Internal approval for the use (or continued use) of a model is obtained from the Methodology Acceptance Group (MAG), a sub-committee of the Group Risk Committee. This approval usually follows the validation performed by independent model validators, who highlight the potential risks and deficiencies of the models and formulate an advice to the MAG accordingly. If required, external approval is requested from the supervisor. Supervisory approval is always required for Pillar 1 new models and models that witness a material change due to redevelopment.\n\nThe independent model risk management department validates internal models. The model risk management framework, which includes model validation standards and procedures, ensures that models are validated in a consistent manner. Model data, methodology, performance and implementation are checked according to these standards and reviewed against internal and regulatory requirements.",

        "page_content": "## Capital measurement\n\n## Regulatory capital (CRD V/CRR2) b\n\nUnder the Basel framework as implemented in European legislation (CRD V and CRR2), banks are required to hold capital to cover for financial and non-financial risks. As an intermediate step in determining the minimum level of capital, banks need to calculate risk exposure amounts for three major risk types (credit, operational and market risk). The outcome of the internal models serve as input for this calculation. The capital requirements are stated as a percentage of RWA. Under Pillar 1, banks are required to hold a regulatory fixed percentage of RWA in capital. Under Pillar 2, supervisors impose a bank-specific percentage of RWA in addition to the Pillar 1 requirement.\n\n## Economic capital\n\nFor Pillar 2, we calculate the economic capital (EC) in addition to regulatory required capital. The economic capital covers all risk types in our risk taxonomy for which capital is deemed to be the mitigating instrument to cover unexpected losses, and is used as the key metric for internal risk measurement and management. It is the amount of capital we reserve in order to achieve a sufficient level of protection against large unexpected losses that could result from extreme market conditions or events.\n\nInternal models are used to calculate EC at a 99.95% confidence level and a one-year time horizon. This implies that the estimated capital figure for the coming year is sufficient to cover a level of loss that will be exceeded in only 0.05% of all possible cases. The confidence level is aligned with the definition of total available financial resources (total AFR). In addition, the ratio of core AFR versus EC is monitored. Core AFR is the amount of capital that is available to cover losses on a continuity-based approach (i.e. excluding AT1, Tier 2 and senior non-preferred instruments).\n\nEC is aggregated for all risk types (without applying inter-risk diversification) to determine the total EC at bank level and to support capital adequacy assessment, capital allocation, ex-post performance measurement and risk appetite setting, such as industry concentration risk limits.\n\n## Stress testing and scenario analysis b\n\nABN AMRO uses stress testing and scenario analysis as an important risk management instrument, looking at profitability, capital and liquidity from a bank-wide perspective in various scenarios on a regular basis. The stress testing framework covers both internal and external stress test requirements. In addition, sub-portfolio and risk type-specific stress testing and scenario analyses are performed.\n\n## Stress testing purposes\n\nABN AMRO applies stress testing for several purposes, including:\n\n- \u00c5 Business planning: various macroeconomic scenarios for budget purposes;\n- \u00c5 Capital planning: stress testing is used to gain insight into the resilience of our capital under adverse changes in the economic environment and ABN AMRO-specific circumstances;\n- \u00c5 Risk appetite setting and monitoring: the outcome of stress testing is used for setting and monitoring risk appetite limits and targets, including limits under stress;\n- \u00c5 Contingency planning: stress testing is used to assess and strengthen the triggers and measures in the liquidity and capital contingency and recovery plans. Reverse stress testing is performed to gain deeper insight into plausible events that could put the continuity of ABN AMRO under pressure;\n- \u00c5 Risk type-specific and client unit stress testing, such as market risk trading and banking book and mortgage stress testing;\n- \u00c5 Supervisory stress testing, based on prescribed scenarios and assumptions. This includes stress test programme of the European Banking Authority (EBA), designed to assess banks' resilience to adverse economic or financial developments, and ECB economywide climate stress test aimed at evaluating the impact of alternative climate scenarios on the resilience of the bank over a time horizon of 30 years in the future.\n\nThe figure below shows the stress testing and scenario analysis cycle.\n\n## Stress test & scenario analysis cycle Audited\n\n<!-- image -->",

The stress testing framework also comprises the sensitivity scenarios that address the impact of various severe events on specific portfolios, countries and/or sectors, as well as the annual reverse stress test in line with regulatory requirements. Moreover, climate related and environmental risks are incorporated into our bank-wide stress testing framework through inclusion of specific events related to physical risks and drivers of transition risk, such as carbon prices (for\n\ndefinitions of physical and transition risks, see the sustainability risk chapter). In 2022, ABN AMRO took part in the EU-wide ECB Climate Stress Test. This exercise was aimed at identifying vulnerabilities and industry best practices, and assessed the challenges faced by banks due to increasing climate risks. Even though the exercise was of a regulatory nature, it did not have any capital or SREP implications. The results and lessons learned from the ECB Climate Stress Test will be integrated into a more robust framework to improve methodology, internal scenario development and data collection, and will also be used further in the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2",

Lending clients are subject to more stringent rules, for which client assessment tools and processes are in place.\n\n## CASY NextGen\n\nCASY NextGen is a client assessment tool for assessing the ESG performance of companies that the bank finances. The tool collects relevant data to help safeguard the bank against sustainability and reputational risks, and provides a basis for having strategic discussions on sustainability with clients. At a client level, CASY NextGen includes a questionnaire that addresses clients' compliance with the bank's sustainability risk framework by focusing on ESGrelated regulations, sustainability commitments and the capacity to manage sustainability risks and track records and is mandatory for all corporate clients with an exposure above EUR 1 million. Depending on the client's level of compliance with the bank's sustainability risk framework, the outcome of a CASY assessment will be above, on or below par, and will serve as the basis for further engaging with the company.\n\n## Credit Risk Sustainability\n\nCredit Risk Sustainability, as the second line of defence, conducts client-level due diligence and oversees engagement both for lending and non-lending clients. Clients with a high sustainability risk level require an additional second-line advice from Credit Risk Sustainability, which validates  the first-line assessments conducted through CASY NextGen and assesses clients against the bank's sustainability risk framework.\n\nIf a client is not fully compliant with the sustainability risk framework, but demonstrates sufficient commitment and capacity to comply, the second line could accept the client relationship or credit line, subject to certain conditions.

The qualitative and quantitative details of the credit risk associated with the loan are assessed prior to approval. Information must be provided on matters such as the purpose, details and structure of the proposed credit facility, the borrower and other counterparties, the industry and geography, management and owners, and financial and non-financial analyses. Compliance with internal policies is checked. After the assessment, an analysis is performed by Risk Management. The credit decision is based on independent assessments by both the commercial and the credit risk functions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthat a client is moving towards full compliance with the sustainability risk framework. Non-compliance is then considered a driver of credit risk, which could negatively impact a counterparty's creditworthiness or collateral and result, for example, in physical and transition risk or in prosecution for health and safety breaches. Typically, the conditions require clients to be more transparent and guide them towards better management of risks related to biodiversity, climate mitigation, climate adaptation, human rights and animal rights.\n\nIf a client does not demonstrate sufficient capacity or commitment to comply with the bank's sustainability risk framework, the Credit Risk Sustainability process could result in a negative conclusion. This means that the credit committee is advised to exit the relationship and, given the bank's inclusive strategy, is the risk response of last resort.\n\nThe cases for which advice was given in 2022 comprised 50 rejected cases, 214 approved cases and 250 cases in which approval was subject to conditions. In 2022, second-line sustainability advice included 157 information conditions, 90 monitoring conditions and 207 engagement conditions. The rise in the number of cases for which advice was given in 2022, compared to 2021, is due to the inclusion of advice given for non-lending clients in the overview for 2022.\n\n## Conclusion of advice\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Credit risk monitoring\n\nConsistent and regular monitoring of counterparties, exposures, risk mitigants and ongoing compliance with internal policies helps to safeguard the bank's position in relation to all risks associated with the counterparty, credit type or portfolio. Monitoring starts when the credit facility is granted and periodically continues throughout the lifecycle of the credit facility and the relationship with the counterparty until the exposure is repaid and/or the limit is cancelled.\n\nCredit facilities are subject to an annual review to assess whether the credit risk is still acceptable.

        "page_content": "## CER materiality assessment\n\nIn 2022, we assessed the materiality of climate-related and environmental risk in relation to traditional risk types. The initial assessment was qualitative. For some risk types this was further substantiated quantitatively whereby a distinction between materiality in the short term (within 1 year), medium term (within 5 years) and long term (within 30 year) horizon was made, where possible. To ensure consistency across risk types, we looked at a set of predefined CER events, including climate-related risk events such as floods and drought (physical risk) and policy and technology development (transition risk), as well as environmental risk events such as water stress and biodiversity loss (physical risk) and policy and technology development (transition risk). The results for credit risk are summarized below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|             | Climate Risk    | Climate Risk   | Environmental Risk   |\n|-------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------------|\n| Credit Risk | Transition Risk | Physical risk  | Transition risk      |\n\nThe quantitative materiality assessment performed in 2022 showed that the impact of climate and environmental risk on credit risk is material on the longer term and, to a lesser extent, on the short term.\n\nThe materiality assessment for climate risk has been based on a combination of the outcomes of the climate risk heatmap, the climate scenario analyses for four key portfolios in the bank and the ECB climate stress test (CST). The basis for the materiality assessment for environmental risk was a combination of the environmental risk heatmap and a set of pollution-based risk coefficients, derived from academic literature on the subject of environmental risk in prudential regulation.\n\n## Climate physical risk\n\nThe impact of climate physical risk on total bank level is expected to gradually materialise over a long-term horizon (up to 2050) and in particular impacts the mortgage and commercial real estate (CRE) portfolio due to physical damage on collateral caused by severe flooding events and the gradual increase of foundation issues (e.g. pole rot).\n\n## Climate transition risk\n\nClimate transition risk impacting the corporate lending portfolio materialises on the short, medium and long term through a potential deterioration of the creditworthiness of certain clients in GHG emission intensive sectors due\n\nor creditworthiness compared to the criteria and the assessment at the point of loan origination. For programme lending portfolios, the entire risk management framework defined in a product programme must be reviewed at least\n\nannually. Individual credit reviews are performed based on pre-defined triggers for risk based credit reviews. For non-programme lending all counterparties are subject to at least an annual review.\n\nto possibly not meeting the necessary GHG emission reduction requirements. Sectors contributing the most to the materiality of climate risk in these scenarios are the manufacture of animal protein food products, manufacture of chemicals and chemical products, construction, electric power generation, shipping and commercial real estate activities. The latter three are the largest in terms of credit exposure and therefore included in the first wave of our climate strategy, published in December 2022.\n\n## Environmental risk\n\nFor environmental physical and transition risk the materiality assessment showed a gradually increasing material impact on the corporate lending sectors due to their impact and dependency on biodiversity, eco system and clean air, water and soil.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nFinancial impact on the short term can be mitigated by adequate capitalization and provisioning. The materiality assessment on credit risk cannot be used for this purpose due to the uncertainties surrounding the applied scenarios and the lack of (historical) data, and therefore constitutes the first step in our enterprise risk management framework, being risk identification. We will further investigate possibilities to understand potential (capital) impact.\n\nABN AMRO is also taking steps to incorporate ESG factors and associated risks into its credit acceptance process for both programme lending and non-programme lending. In 2022 we performed various activities to gain deeper insight into how climate risk influences our clients. This included identifying transmission channels, which are the causal chains through which climate factors represent financial risks to ABN AMRO, for four strategically important portfolios:\n\n- \u00c5 Real Estate\n- \u00c5 Energy (including oil & gas, power generation and renewables)\n- \u00c5 Shipping\n- \u00c5 Agriculture\n\nFinally, we included three of the sectors most contributing to the materiality of climate transition risk into the first wave of sectors, for which we defined carbon reduction targets in our climate strategy, aimed at achieving net zero by 2050.",

        "page_content": "If a situation arises in which an individual counterparty shows signs of credit risk deterioration and action is required in order to avoid the credit risk evolving into a default classification, a 'watch' status is assigned. A 'watch' status indicates that a counterparty is subject to increased monitoring and appropriate follow-up measures in order to prevent further deterioration or a default. Indicators for this status are changes in risk profile, liquidity problems, management issues, the market outlook, potential breach of a credit agreement, solvency issues and uncertain continuity.\n\n## Restructuring & Recovery\n\nCredit facilities that are subject to a default event are mandatorily transferred to the Financial Restructuring & Recovery department (FR&R). Credit facilities identified as having a significantly high risk can be transferred to FR&R if specialised restructuring knowledge is required. If a 'going concern' approach is applicable and return to a performing status is considered likely, the credit facility is transferred to the Restructuring team, which then devises a plan aimed either at rehabilitation or at enhancing the likelihood of full repayment. In all other cases, the credit facility is transferred to the Recovery team. Programme lending contracts are transferred to the Restructuring team if a default status is assigned because payments have been past due for more than 90 days or because another default trigger applies. If restructuring is ultimately ineffective, the client is transferred to other internal departments or external parties (such as Flanderijn) for debt collection. Once a client is considered able to meet its future payment obligations and the involvement of FR&R is no longer required, the client is transferred back to the client unit. FR&R plays a significant role in the execution of the bank's non-performing exposure (NPE) strategy. Policies on the management of NPE include valuation of collateral, monitoring of the NPE ratio and ensuring this ratio remains well below the threshold of 5%. We have set NPE targets for each business segment and specific strategies for sectors with increased levels of non-performing loans.\n\n## Counterparty credit risk\n\nCounterparty credit risk (CCR) refers to the risk that the counterparty to a transaction defaults before final settlement of the transaction's cash flows. In line with the regulatory definition of CCR, ABN AMRO incurs counterparty credit risk in two business activities: firstly through over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and securities financing transactions with corporate clients and financial institutions (including positions taken to manage our interest rate hedging and liquidity position) and secondly in the business of ABN AMRO Clearing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo manage these risks, credit limits are set in accordance with the bank's risk appetite. Limit requirements are set against the creditworthiness of the counterparty and take into account a range of factors, including the mark-tomarket value and the potential future exposure (PFE) of the transactions. The effectiveness of the limits is verified by monitoring trades and exposures at the second line of defence and by escalating limit breaches to the competent management levels when necessary. The bank can use credit risk mitigants to reduce the size of the credit risk exposure or likelihood of suffering losses. Counterparty credit risk mitigation includes the use of proper legal documentation, collateralisation, netting, trade or portfolio compression and central clearing.\n\n## Credit concentration risk b\n\nCredit concentration risk is the risk of loss arising from large exposures, relative to the bank's total risk exposure, to a single counterparty or to counterparties that are positively and highly correlated. As limiting excessive concentrations is fundamental to our credit risk strategy, we aim to keep the credit risk portfolio sufficiently granular and diversified. To avoid excessive credit risk concentrations, Risk Management sets maximum levels for subgroups in the following categories:\n\n- \u00c5 Single counterparty and groups of related counterparties (counterparty concentration);\n- \u00c5 Countries (geographic concentration);\n- \u00c5 Industries (industry concentration);\n- \u00c5 Products (product concentration).\n- \u00c5 Counterparty concentration\n\nCounterparty concentration credit risk is the risk of loss arising from relatively large exposures to counterparties belonging to the same risk group. The One Obligor Exposure (OOE) is the exposure to a risk group and includes all drawn and undrawn credit facilities granted, plus all indirect exposure to the risk group, including guarantees and any other recourse claims.\n\nA risk group is an interrelated group of counterparties with a high degree of dependency on each other due to a control relationship. This control relationship may be attributable to direct or indirect majority interests being held by the same shareholder or group of shareholders.\n\nCounterparty credit concentration risk is measured by the OOE and the Economic Capital (EC) per counterparty. The bank limits its counterparty credit risk by setting OOE and EC limits. Additionally, all credit applications with an OOE and/or EC above a certain threshold are reviewed by the Executive Board.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2",

        "page_content": "## Geographic concentration\n\nWe recognise geographic concentration in our books for climate risks in the Netherlands and for cross-border risks outside the Netherlands. ABN AMRO has branches and subsidiaries located outside the Netherlands, as well as clients who operate internationally. Consequently, the bank is exposed to country risk, which is the risk of credit losses arising from country-specific events or circumstances.\n\nManagement of country risk focuses on cross-border risk, which includes the risk that funds, goods or services cannot be transferred out of a country as a result of actions by local authorities in that country or other events. These risks are managed by setting country credit limits, based on individual country analyses by economic, compliance and country risk experts.\n\nCountry limits are reviewed at least once a year. Each country also has an annually reviewed internal credit rating, which is an important factor in managing country concentration risks. As the Netherlands is our home country, it is not included in any concentration risk appetite statement or setting of credit limits. Since the bank's strategic shift in 2020 and its redefined focus on Northwest Europe, ABN AMRO's country risk exposure has declined significantly.\n\nFor managing climate risks in the residential mortgages book, the bank monitors and limits the percentage of properties with relatively high climate risks in the portfolio and relatively high-risk clients within a severe climate risk area.\n\n## Industry concentration\n\nIndustry concentration risk is the risk of loss arising from a relatively large credit exposure to counterparties active in a single industry. Industry concentration risk arises when deterioration in a specific industry has an effect on all credit exposures relating to that industry. ABN AMRO manages\n\nits industry concentrations by setting limits on economic capital (EC) for credit risk in each industry as a percentage of total EC for credit risk. Industries with a concentration limit are financial institutions, industrial transportation, industrial engineering and food & beverages. In addition to the EC limits, EC concentration checkpoints are set to facilitate timely and sufficient management interventions so as to avoid limits being breached.\n\n## Product concentration\n\nProduct concentration risk is the risk of loss arising from relatively large credit exposures in a specific asset or product class. This asset or product class concentration occurs e.g. in residential mortgages, commercial real estate and leveraged loans. In line with our risk appetite, ceilings are defined per product type and breaches of these concentration ceilings are managed through credit risk insurance.\n\n## Credit risk quality and impairment\n\n## b\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe continuously monitor the credit portfolio for signs indicating that the counterparty may become credit impaired in the future. Loans at risk are classified into different risk categories for individual counterparties and into days-in-arrears buckets for groups of aggregated counterparties in order to optimise the monitoring and review of these loans.\n\n## Forbearance\n\nForbearance is the process of making concessions to clients who are or will soon be experiencing financial difficulty (such as Covid-19-impacted clients), with the intention of bringing them back within their payment capacity. A forborne asset is any contract that has been entered into with a counterparty who is in or about to face financial difficulty, and that has been refinanced or modified on terms and conditions that we would not have accepted if the counterparty had been financially healthy.\n\n<!-- image -->",

If the contract is considered to be performing at the time the forbearance measure is taken, an assessment is made to determine whether the counterparty will be able to meet the revised conditions of the contract and whether full repayment of the credit facility is expected. A forborne contract will cease to qualify as forborne only when all the following conditions are met:\n\n- \u00c5 The contract is considered performing;\n- \u00c5 A minimum probation period of at least two years has passed since the last forbearance measure and/or the date the forborne contract was considered performing (whichever is later);\n- \u00c5 Regular and timely payments of more than an insignificant amount of principal or interest have been made during at least half of the probation period;\n\n## Accounting policy for measuring allowances for expected credit losses (ECL)\n\nThe IFRS 9 impairment requirements are applicable to financial assets measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI), loan commitments, lease receivables and contract assets and financial guarantee contracts. At each reporting date, these financial instruments are classified into one of three risk stages, depending on current credit quality, or as purchased or originated credit-impaired (POCI).\n\nPOCI assets, which are credit-impaired at initial recognition, are accounted for at fair value (i.e. net of the initial lifetime ECLs) and do not carry an impairment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00c5 The counterparty does not have any contract, within the credit agreement, that is more than 30 days past due at the end of the probation period.\n\nIf the forborne contract is or has become non-performing at the time of the forbearance measure, a mandatory cure period of at least one year applies to the contract before it is returned to performing status. The cure period starts when the contract becomes non-performing or, if the contract was already non-performing, when the last forbearance measure was taken.\n\n## Past due credit exposures\n\nA financial asset is past due if a counterparty fails to make a payment on the contractual due date or if the counterparty has exceeded an agreed credit limit. ABN AMRO starts counting days past due from the first day that a counterparty is past due on any financial obligation.\n\nallowance. Instead, a credit-adjusted effective interest rate (EIR), which is calculated using expected cash flows including initial lifetime ECLs, is applied to the amortised cost. Subsequently, the cumulative changes in lifetime ECLs since initial recognition, which are discounted at the credit-adjusted effective interest rate, are recognised in the profit or loss statement as an impairment gain or loss, and presented under impairment charges on financial instruments.\n\nOnce a financial asset is classified as POCI, it retains that classification until it is derecognised (in the event that a substantial modification loss larger than 10% is applicable).

The LPD represents the likelihood that a counterparty will default during the lifetime of the financial instrument and depends on credit risk drivers such as:\n\n- \u00c5 product characteristics (e.g. repayment and interest terms, term of the product);\n- \u00c5 the financial condition of the borrower;\n- \u00c5 the number of days past due;\n- \u00c5 expected developments in the economy.\n\nThe lifetime PD deterioration (LPDD) measures the relative difference between the remaining lifetime PD at reporting (LPDR) and the remaining lifetime PD at origination (LPDO) as LPDD = LPDR/LPDO.

ABN AMRO assigns the watch status to counterparties with an increased credit risk. This process comprises intensive monitoring, early detection of deterioration in the credit portfolio and appropriate follow-up measures;\n- \u00c5 A delinquency-based regulatory backstop is in place, such that the credit risk of financial assets that are more than 30 days past due will be assumed to have significantly increased.\n\n## Reclassification to stage 1\n\nAs a general rule, favourable changes in credit risk are recognised consistently with unfavourable changes, and a financial instrument is transferred back to stage 1 if quantitative or qualitative triggers are no longer met. In some cases, a probation period applies:\n\n- \u00c5 Forborne financial instruments are transferred back from stage 2 to stage 1 only after a probation period of at least two years has ended, in line with the ABN AMRO forbearance policy. Stage 3 forborne instruments transfer back to stage 2 after a cure period of at least one year;\n- \u00c5 For financial instruments that are 30 days past due, a three-month probation period is applied for transfers from stage 2 to stage 1.\n\n## Classification in stage 3\n\nA transfer to stage 3 will always be the result of the default of a financial instrument. Our definitions of default and impaired are aligned and comply with the European Banking Authority (EBA) guidelines on the application of the definition of default.\n\nAll models use a consistent definition of default, which has been specified in line with regulations. A default is deemed to have occurred when:\n\n- \u00c5 the counterparty is past due by more than 90 days on any material financial credit obligation to the bank; or\n- \u00c5 the bank considers the borrower to be unlikely to meet its contractual obligations (unlikely to pay, or UTP).\n\nThe materiality of a financial obligation past due is assessed against an absolute and a relative threshold, in line with regulatory standards. To determine unlikeliness to pay, the bank has specified both mandatory default triggers (always resulting in the assignment of a default status, whereby no additional expert judgement is allowed) and judgemental triggers (requiring an assessment by credit risk managers to determine whether the UTP indications should result in a default classification).\n\nThe mandatory triggers include the reporting of a forborne exposure under probation as non-performing for being 30 days past due or owing to an additional forbearance measure being applied. As a result, the definitions of non-performing and default are materially aligned.\n\nthreshold, the LPD is considered to be significantly deteriorated. The exposure is then transferred to stage 2 and impairment allowances equal to the lifetime expected credit loss are recognised. If the LPD deterioration subsequently reduces and falls below the threshold, the client is transferred back to stage 1. When determining the thresholds, ABN AMRO distinguishes between various portfolios within consumer lending, residential mortgages and corporate loans. A specific threshold is calculated for each portfolio, based on a statistical method. The following table shows LPD deterioration thresholds that triggered transfers to stage 2 as at 31 December 2022. The table provides ranges, as each product class uses multiple ECL models and thresholds are determined for each ECL model.",

For forborne exposures, a twelve-month cure period\n\nstarts from the moment the last forbearance measure or default trigger was applied. After the cure period, an assessment is performed to establish whether the improvement in the credit quality is factual and permanent (including, for example, no remaining past due amounts).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Calculation method\n\nABN AMRO recognises loss allowances based on the Expected Credit Loss model (ECL) of IFRS 9, which is designed to be forward-looking. The amount of ECL is based on the probability-weighted present value of all expected cash shortfalls over the remaining life of the financial instrument for both on- and off-balance sheet exposures. ABN AMRO distinguishes between two types of calculation methods for credit loss allowances:\n\n- \u00c5 Individual Lifetime ECL (LECL) for credit-impaired (stage 3) financial instruments with exposures above EUR 3 million;\n- \u00c5 Collective 12-month ECL (stage 1) and LECL (stage 2 and 3) for financial instruments that have similar credit risk characteristics (e.g. residential mortgages, consumer loans and SME loans) are clustered in portfolios and collectively assessed for impairment losses. A collective impairment calculation approach based on individual parameters is also applied to stage 3 exposures below EUR 3 million. ABN AMRO has models to quantify the Probability of Loss (PL), Loss Given Loss (LGL) and Exposure at Loss (EAL) for the purpose of calculating the collective 12-month ECL and LECL for these financial instruments.\n\n## Lifetime expected credit loss\n\nABN AMRO defines the lifetime of credit as the maximum contractual period during which the bank is exposed to credit risk; we do not apply a longer period, even if that longer period is consistent with business practice. For some contracts, such as overdraft facilities or credit cards, no end date is specified or amounts can be contractually withdrawn by the lender at short notice. In these cases, ABN AMRO uses behavioural maturity models that rely on historical client behaviour to determine future expected exposures.\n\n## Forward-looking information\n\nFor expected credit loss calculations, ABN AMRO uses three different scenarios of future economic developments: a baseline (or most likely) scenario, a negative scenario and a positive scenario. The three scenarios are incorporated into the expected credit loss calculation and risk stage determination in a probabilityweighted manner. In order to incorporate the latest economic outlook, the scenarios and their weights are reviewed each quarter and adjusted if necessary. Details of the scenarios and their weights used in the reporting period can be found in the Credit risk review section. The baseline scenario entails our Group Economics analysts'\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "current macroeconomic base scenario, which usually covers the current year and subsequent year. For the purpose of scenario analysis under IFRS 9, this baseline is extended by three additional calendar years, after which it is assumed that macroeconomic variables (MEVs) gradually move to their potential or equilibrium values. At least once every quarter, Group Economics compares its forecasts with those of institutions like CPB, DNB, ECB, IMF or OECD, in order to determine possible differences and to analyse whether it can underpin those. This external benchmarking exercise is a standard input to the Scenario Booklet that is presented to the bank's Scenario and Stress Testing Committee for approval. Group Economics also develops a negative and a positive scenario. These scenarios are designed to give an impression of the bandwidth within which the economy, interest and FX rates, and other relevant variables are likely to move in the next four to five years, with a probability of around 85% (roughly corresponding to a standard deviation of plus and minus one and a half). Hence, these scenarios produce upper and lower boundaries, with a resulting bandwidth between the outcomes of the negative ('bad weather' in terms of financial results of the bank) and positive ('good weather') scenarios. To determine these boundaries, Group Economics may look at historical developments, medium-term (non-baseline) scenarios made by the aforementioned institutions, and other relevant developments.\n\n## Management overlays and other adjustments\n\nWhere necessary to reflect the credit risk dynamics not captured by our models, management judgement is applied via a management overlay or other IFRS 9 adjustment. A management overlay is a temporary adjustment in a loss allowance until a long-term solution (e.g. model adjustment) is effective, and must be an amount commensurate to the model limitation. All overlays require a decision of the Impairment and Provision Committee (IPC). The main types of management overlays that ABN AMRO distinguishes are: post-model adjustments (adjustments to model outcomes), adjustments in the weightings of macroeconomic scenarios and stage overrides. Other adjustments such as adjustments to model parameters or input data are not considered management overlays, but follow the same internal approval process.\n\n## Climate and environmental risks in ECL\n\nIncorporating climate risk explicitly into ECL models is challenging due to the lack of historical data and the horizon on which climate and environmental risks are expected to materialise. We are taking steps to gain deeper insight into how climate and environmental risks affect our clients, and to eventually embed them into\n\nour IFRS 9 ECL models. The target state is to have CER reflected in all four modelling frameworks (IRB models, IFRS, stress testing and EC).\n\nAlthough the impact of climate risk on ECL can only be estimated with a high degree of uncertainty regarding amounts of losses and the time horizon on which it will materialize, it is partially embedded into our ECL estimates through our macroeconomic forecasts. Climate and environmental risks are playing an increasing role in government policies and macroeconomic developments. To capture climate and environmental risks in ECL and related scenario processes, each macroeconomic scenario is accompanied by an overview that illustrates which of these risks are included in the various projected macroeconomic indicators. For short term identifiable events that are not (yet) included in the macroeconomic forecasts, management overlays on ECL can be taken. These are currently limited to an overlay for the potential impact of the government's nitrogen reducing measures. With the combination of macroeconomic scenarios and this management overlay we deem to be adequately provisioned for climate and environmental risks.\n\n## Cured financial assets\n\nWhen a credit impaired financial asset cures, the interest that was previously unrecognised is reported as an impairment release in the impairment charge rather than as a credit to the interest income calculated using the effective interest method.\n\n## Write-off\n\n- \u00c5 For non-programme lending, a write-off must be recorded if all possible means of recovery have been exhausted and it has become clear that there is a low probability of recovering the debt, either in part or full.\n- \u00c5 Most of the programme lending facilities are automatically written-off after 1,080 days in default.\n\nSuch loans are written off after all the necessary procedures have been completed and the amount of the loss has been determined. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to impairment charges on financial instruments in the income statement.",

All models are subject to the bank's model risk management framework. They undergo initial validation by the independent model validation function before their first use, and annually thereafter. Independent validation is also required when a model undergoes a material change.\n\nThe Probability of Default (PD) indicates the likelihood that a counterparty or exposure defaults within a one-year time orizon. For the non-programme lending portfolio, the model score is mapped to and expressed as an internal uniform counterparty rating (UCR). The UCR rating scale consists of 14 performing ratings, each representing a fixed PD range. The indicative mapping of the internal UCR rating scale to external rating agency ratings is shown in the following table.\n\n## Internal rating scale mapped to external ratings\n\n| Grade Category       | UCR   (internal rating)   | Low   PD%   |   Mid   PD% | High   PD%   | Standard &  Poor's equivalent   | Moody's   equivalent   | Fitch   equivalent   |\n|----------------------|---------------------------|-------------|-------------|--------------|---------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|\n| Investment grade     | UCR 1                     | 0.000       |        0.03 | 0.035        | AAA to A+                       | Aaa to Aa3             | AAA to AA-           |\n|                      | UCR 2+                    | 0.035       |        0.04 | 0.045        | A+                              | A1                     | AA-                  |\n|                      | UCR 2                     | 0.045       |        0.05 | 0.071        | A                               | A1 to A2               | A+                   |\n|                      | UCR 2-                    | 0.071       |        0.1  | 0.127        | A-                              | A3                     | A to A-              |\n|                      | UCR 3+                    | 0.127       |        0.16 | 0.200        | BBB+                            | Baa1                   | BBB+                 |\n|                      | UCR 3                     | 0.200       |        0.25 | 0.300        | BBB                             | Baa2                   | BBB                  |\n|                      | UCR 3-                    | 0.300       |        0.36 | 0.465        | BBB-                            | Baa3                   | BBB-                 |\n| Sub-investment grade | UCR 4+                    | 0.465       |        0.6  | 0.775        | BB+                             | Ba1                    | BB+                  |\n|                      | UCR 4                     | 0.775       |        1    | 1.285        | BB                              | Ba2                    | BB                   |\n|                      | UCR 4-                    | 1.285       |        1.65 | 2.225        | BB-                             | Ba3 to B1              | BB- to B+            |\n|                      | UCR 5+                    | 2.225       |        3    | 4.243        | B+ to B                         | B2                     | B                    |\n|                      | UCR 5                     | 4.243       |        6    | 8.485        | B-                              | B3 to Caa1             | B-                   |\n|                      | UCR 5-                    | 8.485       |       12    | 16.971       | CCC/C                           | Caa2 to Caa3           | CCC/C                |\n|                      | UCR 6+                    | 16.971      |       24    | 99.999       | CCC/C                           | Ca                     | CCC/C                |\n| Default              | UCR 6-8                   |             |      100    |              | D                               | C-D                    | D                    |\n\n## Rating assignment\n\nFor non-programme lending, the ratings are individually assigned to each counterparty (PD) and facility (LGD) by the business account manager (first line) and approved by credit risk (second line). For programme lending, exposures ratings are not assigned individually but assigned to pools with similar characteristics. For all exposures, the EAD estimation is assigned automatically based on the facility type and the undrawn part of the facility.\n\n## Loss given default\n\nLoss Given Default (LGD) models estimate the amount the bank would lose if the counterparty were to default. LGD is expressed as a percentage of the outstanding amount at default. For credit facilities that are not in default, LGD estimates are influenced by the risk mitigating techniques used by the bank (such as collateral coverage and/or third party protection), the credit facility's seniority and structure, and the bank's view on the creditor-friendliness of the relevant country's legal framework.\n\n## Exposure at default\n\nExposure at Default (EAD) models estimate the expected exposure at the time a counterparty defaults. If all or a part of a facility is undrawn (i.e. the outstanding amount is less than the approved limit) at the time of the EAD calculation, a portion of the undrawn amount is added to the exposure to reflect the tendency of counterparties to utilise larger portions of their approved credit facilities when nearing default.\n\n## Capital for credit risk\n\n## Regulatory capital\n\nFor the purpose of determining capital requirements for credit risk, ABN AMRO applies the Advanced Internal Rating Based (A-IRB) approach to most of its portfolios. Under this approach, the previously described internal estimates for PD, EAD and LGD are used to calculate Credit Risk RWA. For a number of smaller portfolios and the large Central Governments and Central Banks portfolio, RWA is determined according to the Standardised Approach (SA). This approach prescribes the risk weights to be applied to the exposure value in order to calculate RWA.",

        "page_content": "## Economic capital\n\nThe EC model for credit risk uses a Monte Carlo simulation to determine a full portfolio loss distribution, taking into account specific portfolio characteristics and diversification effects. Loan facilities are valued on an economic value (mark-to-market) basis to ensure that loss estimates can be based not only on defaulting borrowers, but also on possible credit migrations and changes associated with the market values of loans.\n\n## Credit risk mitigation\n\nCredit risk mitigation techniques are used by the bank to reduce the credit risk associated with its credit exposures. Such techniques relate mainly to collateral management and guarantees, offsetting financial assets and liabilities, and enforcing master netting agreements or similar instruments. In our acceptance policy, we currently do not actively make use of credit risk mitigation for physical risks.\n\nCredit risk mitigation techniques themselves entail risks and, as such, have to meet certain requirements so they can be used effectively and in line with the bank's risk appetite. For this reason, ABN AMRO has established mandatory, bank-wide policies governing the use and management of credit risk mitigation techniques. These are in line with regulatory requirements, as well as the needs of the bank and its clients. These bank-wide policies provide the overarching rules to be met by business-specific procedures and processes related to credit risk mitigation.\n\n## Collateral management and guarantees\n\nCollateral and guarantees represent assets with material value that have been received by (or pledged to) the bank to secure obligations under a credit facility or other exposure. To be effective, such security must give the bank the right to appropriate and liquidate collateral on time and without impediment so that losses on the exposure at default are minimised.\n\nIn addition to minimising exposure risk, eligible collateral and guarantees can also reduce the regulatory and economic capital the bank is required to hold as a buffer for unexpected losses. The Capital Requirements Regulation prescribes the criteria that collateral must meet to become eligible for capital reduction. These criteria, which provide for legal effectiveness and for the enforceability, valuation and monitoring of collateral, are aimed at the effective and timely realisation of collateral.\n\nResidential mortgages, followed by commercial real estate, represent the largest collateral category in our books. We manage our collateral risk through lending criteria such as Loan to Value, and for commercial real estate financing we apply a minimum energy label.\n\n## Accounting policy for offsetting financial assets and liabilities b\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset, and the net amount is reported on the EU IFRS balance sheet, if there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The bank applies netting to debtor and creditor balances, such as current accounts, where offsetting is justified by formal agreement with the client, provided they meet the applicable criteria.\n\n## Accounting policy for enforceable master netting agreements or similar instruments b\n\nEnforceable master netting arrangements take into account all agreements containing conditions that allow offsetting in the event of default. In addition, agreements are enforceable if the bank has a legally enforceable right to offset and no ability and/or intention to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. These arrangements include derivative clearing agreements, global master repurchase agreements and global master securities lending agreements.",

Compared to 31 December 2021, the share of the portfolio with an investment grade (UCR 1 to UCR 3 bucket) decreased marginally, mainly in mortgages and corporate loans. Approximately 2% of the bank's portfolio is reported in UCR 6+. Clients where revision of the UCR is overdue are classified as UCR 6+ until a new rating is available.

The bank actively manages and monitors the development of its country risk exposures, based on the country at risk. The country at risk may be different from the country of domicile, for example if the bank finances a project in a country other than the borrower's country of incorporation.\n\n## Geographic concentration by EAD b\n\n|                                           | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2022    | 31 December 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------|--------------------|\n| (in millions, Exposure at Default)        | The Netherlands    | Rest of   Europe   | USA                | Asia               | Rest of   the world | Total              |\n| Central governments and central banks     |                    |                    |                    |                    |                     |                    |\n| Institutions 1                            | 1,151              | 4,903              | 1,268              | 222                | 439                 | 7,983              |\n| Corporates                                | 62,957             | 31,255             | 1,532              | 727                | 4,611               | 101,083            |\n| Retail                                    | 159,910            | 475                | 45                 | 64                 | 31                  | 160,525            |\n| -

To provide a meaningful view of the credit risk in our lending book, the figures presented in this section therefore relate to loans and advances.

The table now shows total loans and advances to be more consistent with other risk disclosures in this report.\n- 3 Gross carrying amount excludes fair value adjustments from hedge accounting.\n\nTotal forborne assets decreased from EUR 11.2 billion at 31 December 2021 to EUR 6.9 billion at 31 December 2022, mainly for residential mortgages and corporate loans. This decrease is specifically attributed to loans for which a payment deferral was granted after the outbreak of Covid-19 in 2020 and that came to the end of their twoyear forbearance probation period. Under the forbearance rules, these loans ceased to be forborne if they were performing in accordance with the payment conditions. On 31 December 2022 the exposure subject to Covid-19 related forbearance measures was EUR 0.8 billion.\n\n## Past due not classified as stage 3\n\nb\n\n|                                        |                            |                                             | Days past due   | Days past due          | Days past due   | Days past due                             | Days past due    |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| (in millions)                          | Gross   carrying  amount 2 | Assets not   classified as  stage 3 or POCI | \u2264 30 days       | > 30 days &  \u2264 90 days | > 90 days 3     | Total past due,  but not stage 3  or POCI | Past due   ratio |\n| Loans and advances banks               | 2,990                      | 2,990                                       |                 |                        |                 |                                           | 0.0%             |\n| Residential mortgages                  | 150,762                    | 149,619                                     | 879             | 52                     | 7               | 939                                       | 0.6%             |\n| Consumer loans                         | 10,232                     | 9,869                                       | 104             | 50                     | 23              | 178                                       | 1.7%             |\n| Corporate loans 1                      | 86,731                     | 83,066                                      | 635             | 181                    | 84              | 900                                       | 1.0%             |\n| Other loans and advances customers 1   | 7,497                      | 7,493                                       | 4               |                        | 17              | 21                                        | 0.3%             |\n| Total loans and   advances customers 1 | 255,222                    | 250,047                                     | 1,623           | 284                    | 131             | 2,038                                     | 0.8%             |\n| Total loans and advances 1             | 258,212                    | 253,038                                     | 1,623           | 284                    | 131             | 2,038                                     | 0.8%             |\n\n- 1 Excluding loans at fair value through P&L.\n- 2 Gross carrying amount excludes fair value adjustments from hedge accounting.\n- 3 Materiality thresholds are applied for counterparties transferring to stage 3.

AMRO changed its presentation compared to previous reports. The table now shows total loans and advances to be more consistent with other risk disclosures in this report.\n- 3 Gross carrying amount excludes fair value adjustments from hedge accounting.\n- 4 The allowances for credit losses excludes allowances for financial investments held at FVOCI (31 December 2022: EUR 1 million; 31 December 2021: EUR 1 million).\n\nThe stage 2 ratio increased to 9.4% (31 December 2021: 8.2%), mainly as a result of increases in stage 2 exposure, while total loans and advances decreased. Stage 2 exposure increased for corporate loans, partly because of clients who returned from stage 3. Inflow as a result of a weakening macroeconomic outlook led to an increase in stage 2 exposures for residential mortgages. The stage 2 coverage ratio remained stable at 1.7%.\n\nThe stage 3 ratio decreased to 2.0% at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: 2.6%), attributable to an outflow of clients due to repayments and clients returning to stage 2. The stage 3 coverage ratio decreased from 28.3% to 25.6% due to the write-off or return to stage 2 of some highly provisioned loans.\n\n## Purchased or Originated Credit Impaired (POCI)\n\nOn 31 December 2022, loans classified as POCI amounted to EUR 9 million. Due to the immateriality of the amount, this is included in the amount shown for stage 3 throughout this report.\n\n## Exposure and impairment flows b\n\nThis section provides more details on the exposure and impairment flows underlying the change in coverage and stage ratios shown in the previous section.",

        "page_content": "An addition of EUR 39 million (EUR 67 million on-balance and EUR -28 million off-balance) in impairments was recorded for 2022 (2021: release of EUR 46 million), resulting in a cost of risk of 3bps in 2022, compared to -7bps in 2021. Charges were attributable to a deteriorating economic outlook during the year, partly offset by releases from management overlays and releases for existing stage 3 clients. The releases in stage 3 can be largely attributed to the improved credit quality of the existing defaulted portfolio, repayments of stage 3 loans, outflow to the performing portfolio and recoveries.\n\nFor residential mortgages, charges of EUR 56 million were recorded in 2022, compared to a release of EUR 46 million in 2021. This was caused by the deteriorated macroeconomic outlook.\n\nThe deteriorated economic outlook was also the main driver of the EUR 14 million impairment charges for consumer loans (2021: EUR 3 million). Impairments for consumer loans were also attributable to the deterioration of risk parameters in our consumer lending portfolios.\n\nA release of EUR 29 million (of which EUR 28 million was for off-balance exposures) was recorded for corporate loans in 2022 (2021: release of EUR 124 million). Impairment releases for corporate loans were recorded because of the improved credit quality of the existing defaulted portfolio, repayments of stage 3 loans, outflow to the performing portfolio and recoveries.\n\n## Individual and collective loan impairment allowances and management overlays b\n\n|                                                                                                          | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2022       | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2022          | 31 December 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|\n| (in millions)                                                                                            | Banks              | Residential  mortgages | Consumer  loans    | Corporate  loans   | Other   loans      | Total loans  and advances | Off-balance        |\n| Individual impairments                                                                                   |                    |                        |                    |                    |                    |                           |                    |\n| Stage 3 1                                                                                                |                    |                        | 58                 | 835                | 3                  | 896                       | 10                 |\n| Total individual impairments                                                                             |                    |                        | 58                 | 835                | 3                  | 896                       | 10                 |\n| Collective impairments                                                                                   |                    |                        |                    |                    |                    |                           |                    |\n| Stage 1                                                                                                  | 8                  | 21                     | 30                 | 256                |                    | 316                       | 25                 |\n| Stage 2                                                                                                  |                    | 57                     | 36                 | 301                | 2                  | 396                       | 16                 |\n| Stage 3 1                                                                                                |                    | 75                     | 153                | 198                |                    | 427                       |                    |\n| Total collective impairments                                                                             | 8                  | 153                    | 219                | 755                | 2                  | 1,138                     | 41                 |\n| -

As the ECL model outcomes do not always reflect the current economic environment and circumstances, additional management overlays are applied to incorporate potential risks not fully captured by the model outcomes.\n\nDuring 2022, management overlays decreased to a total of EUR 328 million (31 December 2021: EUR 424 million). Of this decrease, EUR -43 million was due to reclassification of overlays to input data and in-model adjustments and did not have P&L impact. The remaining management overlays were mainly recorded for risks in the corporate loans portfolios and comprised the following:\n\n- \u00c5 A new management overlay was applied for potential effects of the war in Ukraine that are not fully captured by the latest projections in our macroeconomic scenarios and existing IFRS 9 models. An initial overlay for secondorder impact on potentially vulnerable clients was cancelled after individual clients were reviewed and, where appropriate, reclassified. As the uncertainty in the macroeconomic outlook as a whole continues to be high, the initial overlay was replaced by an overlay on impairments for third-order effects, amounting to EUR 123 million at year-end 2022.\n- \u00c5 A new management overlay of EUR 34 million was formed for the potential impact that the government's measures to reduce nitrogen emissions may have on clients in livestock farming businesses in the Netherlands.\n- \u00c5 The existing overlays, which cover anticipated additional risk costs relating to the wind-down of portfolios, decreased in line with the reducing exposure to these portfolios.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nManagement overlays taken in previous years for the impact of Covid-19 decreased significantly:\n\n- \u00c5 The management overlay applied for clients in sectors vulnerable to the impact of Covid-19-related restrictions was released after the Covid-19 restrictions were lifted in the Netherlands and analysis revealed there to be no material differences between the coverage ratios of vulnerable and non-vulnerable sectors.\n- \u00c5 We also released a management overlay that captured expected credit risk deterioration due to Covid-19 in our Corporate Banking portfolio as we deem this effect to be largely incorporated into our credit risk parameters.\n- \u00c5 A new management overlay was formed for potential underestimation of the delayed risk of Covid-19-related government support - especially tax deferrals - for corporate loans that are not individually managed.\n\nCompared to 31 December 2021, management overlays for our mortgage portfolio were stable as:\n\n- \u00c5 The management overlay that covers the refinancing risk of interest-only mortgages was increased to take into account changes in the affordability tests as a result of rising interest rates.\n- \u00c5 The management overlay that addresses the impact of excessive increases in property prices on the outcome of the IFRS 9 models was reclassified as an in-model adjustment.\n\nThe management overlays within consumer lending portfolios decreased because the adjustment for modification losses was reclassified as an input data adjustment.\n\nAll management overlays represent best estimates of the risks involved. The underlying reasoning and calculations are documented and discussed and approved by the Impairments and Provisioning Committee (IPC). Relevant experience related to the impact of Covid-19 on the model outcomes will be used to improve the models over time and reduce the need for management overlays.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2",

In 2022, ABN AMRO economists lowered their macroeconomic forecasts, reflecting the negative impacts of the ongoing war in Ukraine. The lingering energy crisis is expected to tip the eurozone and the Netherlands into recession. Inflation leads to a fall in real incomes, which is weighing down on consumer spending, while high energy prices and supply shortages\n\nare hampering industry. On the monetary front, central banks are tightening their policies to counter inflation. The rises in mortgage rates that we saw in 2022 are driving house prices downwards. Against this background, ABN AMRO economists expect the decline in house prices to continue. Climate and environmental risks are considered and partially reflected in the various projected macroeconomic indicators. Further incorporation of CER in our macroeconomic scenarios is foreseen over time.\n\n## Macroeconomic scenarios in 2022 b\n\n| (in millions)   | Weight               | Macroeconomic variable   | 2023   | 2024        | 2025   | 2026   | Unweighted  ECL 4   | Weighted  ECL 4   |\n|-----------------|----------------------|--------------------------|--------|-------------|--------|--------|---------------------|-------------------|\n|                 | Real GDP Netherlands | 2.8%                     |        | 2.6%        | 2.3%   | 1.6%   |                     | 1                 |\n|                 | 5%  Unemployment     |                          | 3.9%   | 3.8% 3.7%   | 3.6%   |        | 1,035               | Positive 2        |\n|                 | House price index 3  | 1.0%                     | 0.0%   | 1.0%        | 2.0%   |        |                     |                   |\n|                 | Real GDP Netherlands | 0.5%                     |        | 1.2% 1.6%   |        | 1.4%   |                     |                   |\n| Baseline        | 60%  Unemployment    |                          | 4.3%   | 4.2%        | 4.0%   | 4.0%   | 1,087               | 1,138             |\n|                 | House price index    |                          | -2.5%  | -2.5% -2.0% |        | 1.0%   |                     |                   |\n|                 | Real GDP Netherlands |                          | -1.8%  | -0.4%       | 1.3%   | 1.8%   |                     |                   |\n| Negative        | 35%  Unemployment    |                          | 5.0%   | 4.9%        | 4.7%   | 4.7%   | 1,240               |                   |\n|                 | House price index    |                          | -8.0%  | -12.0%      | -11.0% | 0.0%   |                     |                   |\n\n- 1 Real GDP Netherlands, % change year-on-year.\n- 2 Unemployment Netherlands, % of labour force.\n- 3 House price index Netherlands - average % change year-on-year.\n- 4 Weighted and unweighted ECL are including all collective impairments.

in forborne exposures is mainly observed within Private Individuals-Non ICB and explained by residential mortgages ceasing to be forborne as a result of the terminating of collective payment deferrals (one of the Covid-19 support measures). Forborne exposures also declined significantly in the Industrial Goods & Services, Travel & Leisure, Retail and Food & Beverage sectors, which were hit by the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\n## Credit risk mitigation b\n\nCollateral reporting is based on the net collateral value (NCV). The NCV represents the amount expected to be recovered from the collateral pledged to the bank if the client defaults. Where necessary, certain discounts are applied. The NCV is approached by an average recovery rate observed for the specific type of collateral and, where applicable, by applying haircuts, for example in the event of currency mismatches. Surplus collateral is the amount of over-collateralisation, calculated on an individual basis. A surplus is not included for guarantees as the debtor cannot be held liable for more than the maximum debt.",

includes cash collateral as part of these agreements. Cash collateral not part of master netting agreements has been reported under the column Financial instruments.\n- 4 Surplus collateral is the amount of over-collateralisation, calculated on an individual basis.\n- 5 Net exposure represents the portfolio corrected for the surplus amount and gives a view on the potential shortfall in collateral on the total portfolio.\n\nTotal risk mitigation increased, driven by an increase in property and equipment and in residential mortgages, mainly due to rising house prices. As a result, surplus collateral also increased. In the case of consumer loans, total risk mitigation was relatively stable and net exposure declined slightly. The increase in total risk mitigation for corporate loans was evidenced by an increase in collateral for financial instruments. This was mainly driven by an increase in marketable securities collateral in the context of securities financing, mostly between financial institutions.\n\nThe total net exposure of loans and advances customers decreased to EUR 36.0 billion in 2022 (31 December 2021: EUR 53.2 billion). This was primarily driven by other loans and advances and related to Clearing activities (i.e. posting cash collateral and default fund contributions). The decrease in exposure driven by fair value accounting from hedge accounting was due to the increase in interest rates.",

impairment allowances where applicable.\n- 2 Collateral in the column Master netting agreement is mainly markets related and consists of master netting agreements which also includes cash collateral as part of these agreements. Cash collateral not part of master netting agreements has been reported under the column Financial instruments.\n- 3 Surplus collateral is the amount of over-collateralisation, calculated on an individual basis.\n- 4 Net exposure represents the portfolio corrected for the surplus amount and gives a view on the potential shortfall in collateral on the total portfolio.\n\nIn line with the decrease in the stage 3 carrying amount (including POCI) to EUR 3.9 billion (31 December 2021: EUR 4.8 billion), total risk mitigation decreased to EUR 4.6 billion in 2022 (31 December 2021: EUR 5.4 billion). This decrease was mainly observed in property and equipment and, to a lesser extent, other collateral and guarantees. The decline in property and equipment for corporate loans was partly offset by an increase for residential mortgages due to indexation. As the decrease in the stage 3 portfolio (including POCI) exceeded the decline in total risk mitigation, net exposure decreased by EUR 74 million to EUR 661 million at 31 December 2022.\n\nDuring 2022 ABN AMRO obtained property and equipment by taking possession of collateral held as security for loans and advances. The total amount of such assets held on 31 December 2022 amounted to EUR 4 million (2021: EUR 4 million). ABN AMRO does not intend to use these assets in its operations and will pursue timely and orderly realisation of the collateral.",

Clients' maximum borrowing capacity decreased due to higher interest rates; together with inflation and increased economic uncertainty, this\n\nresulted in the affordability of houses decreasing. House prices declined slightly in the second half of 2022. The number of properties available for sale increased to 3.2 houses for every potential buyer at the end of 2022 (2021: 1.3 houses).\n\nThe housing price index published by Statistics Netherlands (CBS) at the end of 2022 was 5.1% higher than at the end of 2021. According to the Dutch Land Registry (Kadaster), the number of transactions in the Dutch housing market in 2022 was 14.6% lower than in 2021, and 20.2% lower than the peak in 2017.\n\n## Residential mortgage indicators\n\n| (in millions)                                                                               | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Gross carrying amount excluding fair value adjustment from hedge accounting                 | 150,762            | 146,351            |\n| - of which Nationale Hypotheek Garantie (NHG)                                               | 29,474             | 31,557             |\n| Fair value adjustment from hedge accounting                                                 | -9,489             | 1,442              |\n| Carrying amount excluding fair value adjustment from hedge accounting                       | 150,609            | 146,269            |\n| Exposure at Default 1                                                                       | 155,608            | 163,737            |\n| Risk-weighted assets (Credit risk) 1, 2                                                     | 22,574             | 22,110             |\n| RWA/Exposure at Default                                                                     | 14.5%              | 13.5%              |\n| Forbearance ratio                                                                           | 0.7%               | 2.1%               |\n| Past due ratio                                                                              | 0.6%               | 0.6%               |\n| Stage 3 ratio                                                                               | 0.8%               | 0.9%               |\n| Stage 3 coverage ratio                                                                      | 6.6%               | 4.1%               |\n| Cost of risk (in bps) 3                                                                     | 4                  | -3                 |\n| Average LtMV (indexed)                                                                      | 54%                | 56%                |\n| Average LtMV - excluding NHG loans (indexed)                                                | 54%                | 56%                |\n| Total risk mitigation                                                                       | 291,303            | 265,768            |\n| Total risk mitigation/carrying amount excluding fair value adjustment from hedge accounting | 193.4%             | 181.7%             |\n\n- 1 The RWA (Credit risk) and Exposure at Default amounts are based on the exposure class Secured by immovable property. This scope is slightly broader than the residential mortgage portfolio.\n- 2 Previous report presented total RWA. In this report, the comparative figures for 31 December 2021 have been adjusted to show credit risk RWA only.\n- 3 Annualised impairment charges on loans and advances customers for the period divided by the average loans and advances customers on the basis of gross carrying amount and excluding fair value adjustment from hedge accounting.\n\nThe residential mortgage portfolio increased by 3% to EUR 150.8 billion in 2022 (31 December 2021: EUR 146.4 billion). ABN AMRO's market share of new mortgage production in 2022 was 17% (2021: 16%).\n\nThe proportion of amortising mortgages continued to increase, totalling 44% at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: 41%). Total redemptions were 10% lower than in 2021. Extra repayments in 2022 amounted to EUR 2.0 billion, a decrease of 16% compared to 2021. The share of mortgages covered by the National Mortgage Guarantee (NHG) scheme decreased slightly compared to 31 December 2021, from 22% to 20%.\n\n## Credit quality indicators\n\nIn general, the credit quality indicators for residential mortgages remained relatively stable. Despite media reports of consumers being impacted by higher energy prices, the mortgage arrears ratio remained stable at 0.6%. The coverage ratio for stage 3 increased to 6.6% (31 December 2021: 4.1%) mainly as a result of a deteriorated macroeconomic outlook.\n\n## Risk-weighted assets and EAD\n\nThe RWA for credit risk in the residential mortgage portfolio increased to EUR 22.6 billion (31 December 2021: EUR 22.1 billion). The increase in the RWA was mainly caused by portfolio growth. Exposure at default (EAD) decreased to EUR 155.6 billion (2021: EUR 163.7 billion), mainly caused by a large decrease in the fair value adjustment from hedge accounting, which amounted to EUR -9.5 billion at 31 December 2022.",

It should be noted that an LtMV in excess of 100% does not necessarily indicate a client in financial\n\ndifficulties. New inflow of mortgages with an LtMV in excess of 100% relates to sustainable home improvements. ABN AMRO actively approaches clients with an interest-only mortgage in combination with a high LtMV to discuss changing their mortgage product. The long-term LtMV of the bank's portfolio is expected to increase slightly as a result of declining housing prices.\n\n## Breakdown of residential mortgage portfolio by loan type\n\n|                                      | 31 December 2022        | 31 December 2022      | 31 December 2021        | 31 December 2021      |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|\n| (in millions)                        | Gross carrying   amount | Percentage   of total | Gross carrying   amount | Percentage   of total |\n| Interest only (partially)            | 42,677                  | 28%                   | 41,953                  | 29%                   |\n| Interest only (100%)                 | 22,025                  | 15%                   | 21,995                  | 15%                   |\n| Redeeming mortgages (annuity/linear) | 66,417                  | 44%                   | 60,183                  | 41%                   |\n| Savings                              | 9,474                   | 6%                    | 10,788                  | 7%                    |\n| Life (investment)                    | 6,153                   | 4%                    | 7,223                   | 5%                    |\n| Other 1                              | 4,017                   | 3%                    | 4,208                   | 3%                    |\n| Total                                | 150,762                 | 100%                  | 146,351                 | 100%                  |\n\n- 1 Other includes hybrid and unclassified mortgage types.

The most energy-efficient category is 'higher than A' and the least energy-efficient category is label G. The EPC labels in the table below are from the Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland (RVO) and consist of a combination of energy labels under the old methodology (NEN7120, prior to 1 January 2021) and the new methodology (NTA8800). If no official energy label is available, business rules are applied to determine an estimated energy label. This mainly entails the use of preliminary energy labels, as issued by RVO in 2015.\n\n|               |         |                       |                              | 31 December 2022     | 31 December 2021         | 31 December 2021     |\n|---------------|---------|-----------------------|------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|\n|               | amount  | Gross carrying  1     | Gross carrying  1            | Percentage of  total | Gross carrying  amount 1 | Percentage of  total |\n| (in millions) |         | - of which EPC  label | - of which esti- mated label |                      |                          |                      |\n| Higher than A | 6,546   | 1,866                 | 4,680                        | 4%                   | 3,313                    | 2%                   |\n| A             | 35,320  | 27,057                | 8,263                        | 23%                  | 32,940                   | 23%                  |\n| B             | 21,344  | 10,071                | 11,272                       | 14%                  | 21,274                   | 15%                  |\n| C             | 31,827  | 14,991                | 16,835                       | 21%                  | 31,716                   | 22%                  |\n| D             | 12,129  | 7,639                 | 4,489                        | 8%                   | 11,630                   | 8%                   |\n| E             | 8,928   | 5,263                 | 3,665                        | 6%                   | 8,795                    | 6%                   |\n| F             | 13,038  | 4,612                 | 8,426                        | 9%                   | 13,044                   | 9%                   |\n| G             | 15,285  | 4,397                 | 10,887                       | 10%                  | 15,327                   | 10%                  |\n| No label      | 1,753   |                       |                              | 1%                   | 3,166                    | 2%                   |\n| Unknown label | 4,593   |                       |                              | 3%                   | 5,145                    | 4%                   |\n| Total         | 150,762 | 75,898                | 68,518                       | 100%                 | 146,351                  | 100%                 |\n\n- 1 Including both energy labels based on the applicable regulation before and after 1 January 2021.",

        "page_content": "The proportion of residential mortgages with energy label A and higher increased compared to 2021. The increase in A and higher-than-A labels was mainly due to higher inflow and migration from lower energy labels to these categories. These movements are consistent with ABN AMRO's ambition, as expressed in our climate strategy, to reduce the carbon footprint of the residential mortgage portfolio. Potential house buyers also increasingly award value to energy efficient homes in a wider market, considering the increased energy prices. Over 2022 the percentage EPC labels versus estimated labels increased from 46% to 50%. This is mainly because new inflow usually has a final energy label, given that such a label is mandatory at the time of a sale or purchase transaction.\n\n## Commercial Real Estate (CRE)\n\n## Market developments\n\nThe sharp increase in interest rates in 2022 dramatically changed the market conditions for Dutch commercial real estate. Until the first half of 2022, investing was continuing on an upward trend. In the third quarter of 2022, however, the market reached a tipping point, and by the fourth quarter the amount involved in transactions dropped sharply. A total of EUR 16.4 billion was invested in 2022, a decrease of 5% compared to 2021, marking a decline for the third year in a row.\n\nDespite the observed decrease, valuations of office real estate benefited from the post-Covid economic recovery and low unemployment rates until the first half of 2022. By the third quarter, however, substantially increased interest rates caused office investors to become more cautious and to reduce investments. Office real estate valuations consequently decreased sharply in the fourth quarter of 2022. In addition, corporates continued to struggle to attract employees to the workplace, with low occupancy rates forcing them to reconsider their office space decisions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs well as higher interest rates, new regulations were introduced in the residential real estate market during the year. The aim of these regulations, and the new taxation rules, is to keep rental housing affordable for low- and middle-income households. Investing in this asset category will consequently be less attractive for investors as the new rules and regulations will reduce potential rental income flows. These supply side challenges led to a decline in residential real estate valuations in 2022.\n\nThe industrial and logistics retail market also benefited from the strong economy until the second half of 2022, when interest rates started rising sharply. As real estate prices had risen steadily over the years, a correction was needed to bring prices back to 'reasonable' levels again. Retail real estate had barely recovered from the Covid-related problems when a reduction in consumer spending after the summer reduced demand again. Despite the recent fall in retail real estate prices, increased interest rates and reduced consumer spending have for the time being brought the recovery in this real estate category to an end.\n\n## CRE portfolio\n\nThe exposure reported in the CRE portfolio relates to loans aimed at acquiring CRE property or secured by CRE property, whereby CRE means any income-producing real estate, either existing or under development or renovation. It excludes social housing, property owned by end-users, buy-to-let housing below a market value of EUR 2 million and unsecured general purpose lending. The credit exposure covered by the above definition is monitored on a quarterly basis and subject to an EAD and RWA limit.\n\nCompared to 2021, the gross carrying amount increased markedly by 11.9% in 2022 to EUR 15.3 billion (31 December 2021: EUR 13.6 billion), primarily as a result of new client lending. The CRE loan portfolio is largely collateralised by Dutch properties and consists primarily of investment loans that are well diversified across different asset types. The distribution changed slightly compared to 2021, especially for 'Retail' and 'Office', and markedly for 'Other', primarily due to international Wealth Management clients being included in 'Other'.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2",

ABN AMRO continues to work towards this goal by seeking to increase the A and higher-than-A labels in the CRE portfolio and lowering the exposure to E-G energy labels. In line with this strategy, the distribution of energy labels marginally improved compared to 2021, with an increase in higher-than-A labels and 66% of the CRE portfolio now having an energy label of D or higher (31 December 2021: 64%).\n\nMoreover, as of 1 January 2023 offices in the Netherlands with a lettable floor area (LFA) of at least 90% are obliged to have an energy label C or better. We are in contact with clients who do not yet comply, to urge them to formally\n\nregister a label if the property has an energy label C or better or to share a sustainability plan with ABN AMRO that would lead to energy label C or better within a reasonable time-frame.\n\nOn 31 December 2022 more than 93% of assets in the CRE portfolio had an energy label (31 December 2021: 90%). Assets that are out of scope (such as land and parking spaces) are assigned to 'No label'. Most labels reported are supplied by the Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland (RVO) via EP-Online and are the labels officially registered for the properties. Some of the labels are estimated labels, and approximately 7% is unknown owing to the property being under development or not yet registered.\n\n|                    | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2022          | 31 December 2022              | 31 December 2022     | 31 December 2021       | 31 December 2021       |\n|--------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n|                    |                    | Gross carrying  amount    | Gross carrying  amount        | Percentage of  total | Gross carrying  amount | Percentage    of total |\n| (in millions)      |                    | - of which    EPC label 4 | - of which    estimated label |                      |                        |                        |\n| Higher than A      | 886                | 885                       | 1                             | 6%                   | 641                    | 5%                     |\n| A                  | 4,901              | 3,662                     | 1,240                         | 32%                  | 4,110                  | 32%                    |\n| B                  | 1,124              | 883                       | 240                           | 7%                   | 962                    | 7%                     |\n| C                  | 2,028              | 1,410                     | 618                           | 13%                  | 1,658                  | 13%                    |\n| D                  | 1,139              | 858                       | 281                           | 7%                   | 910                    | 7%                     |\n| E                  | 899                | 574                       | 324                           | 6%                   | 720                    | 6%                     |\n| F                  | 646                | 299                       | 347                           | 4%                   | 493                    | 4%                     |\n| G                  | 2,001              | 423                       | 1,578                         | 13%                  | 1,973                  | 15%                    |\n| No label 1         | 590                |                           |                               | 4%                   | 201                    | 2%                     |\n| Unknown label 2, 3 | 1,044              |                           |                               | 7%                   | 1,257                  | 10%                    |\n| Total 3            | 15,258             | 8,994                     | 4,629                         | 100%                 | 12,924                 | 100%                   |\n\n- 1 No label relates to Parking and Land for which no energy labels are applicable.\n- 2 Unknown label relates to asset types which are expected to have an energy label.\n- 3 Including Wealth Management international clients for 31 December 2022 and excluding Wealth Management international clients for 31 December 2021.\n- 4 Including both energy labels based on the applicable regulation before and after 1 January 2021.",

must be included in the bank's trading book. The Central Trading Risk policy describes the positions included in the trading book and the criteria for transferring risk and positions between the trading and banking books. As part of its business strategy, ABN AMRO facilitates client orders, acts as a market maker in key markets and provides liquidity to clients, including institutional investors and private clients. Market risk in the trading book is the risk of losses in market value due to adverse market movements. The following market risks are inherent in the trading book:\n\n- \u00c5 Interest rate risk, arising from adverse changes in interest rate risk curves and/or interest rate volatilities;\n- \u00c5 Credit spread risk, arising from adverse changes in the term structure of credit spreads and/or from changes in the credit quality of debt securities or CDS reference entities, with an impact on default probabilities;\n- \u00c5 Foreign exchange risk, arising from adverse changes in FX spot and forward rates and/or FX volatility.\n\nABN AMRO has in place a detailed risk management framework to identify, measure and control market risk in the trading book. This risk management framework is in line with the 3LoD model and provides assurance\n\n## Total market risk exposure\n\n## Market risk exposure traded and non-traded risk\n\nABN AMRO is exposed to market risk in its trading book and banking book. The following table presents the market risk factors to which the assets and liabilities in the balance sheet are sensitive.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "that the bank's trading activities are consistent with its client-focused business strategy and moderate risk profile. In accordance with the strategy, the Business Risk Committee Trading annually approves trading mandates and limits, which define the nature and number of the permitted transactions and risks, as well as the associated constraints. The limit utilisation is monitored and discussed by the first and second LoD on a daily basis. The Business Risk Committee Trading is a subsidiary committee of the Group Risk Committee.\n\n## Market risk measurement for the trading book b\n\nABN AMRO measures and manages market risk in the trading book on a daily basis. The key metrics used are economic capital, regulatory capital, Value-at-Risk (VaR), Stressed VaR (SVaR) and Incremental Risk Charge (IRC), together with a wide array of stress and scenario tests, sensitivity measures, concentration limits and notional limits. These metrics are measured and monitored on a daily basis. Appropriate limits are set at bank level in the Risk Appetite Statement and at bank and business-line levels in the limit framework, in line with the general risk principles of the Central Trading Risk policy.\n\nMetrics and models are managed, reviewed, assessed and, if required, adjusted in a similar way as in the banking book. Other important tools to ensure the adequacy of the models, alongside the formal validation and review of models, are the daily explanation of risk reporting figures, periodic portfolio reviews and regular back-testing.\n\n## Validation procedure\n\nFor all models, including market risk models, we have a model risk policy in place. This policy requires that model assumptions and limitations are documented and independently validated by Model Validation. For material changes, the regulator performs an onsite investigation before such a model change is applied in production.\n\n## Economic capital\n\nThe calculation of economic capital for market risk in the trading book is based on the daily Value-at-Risk (VaR), Stressed VaR (SVaR) and Incremental Risk Charge (IRC) at a 99.95% confidence level. In comparison with previous years, Stressed VaR (SVaR) and Incremental Risk Charge (IRC) were added to the calculation of EC to align with the calculation of the regulatory capital.\n\n## Stress testing and scenario analysis\n\nStress testing and scenario analysis are designed to focus specifically on the impact of tail events occurring outside the VaR confidence interval. We perform daily stress tests for large movements in risk factors. Scenario analyses are also conducted frequently to evaluate the impacts of extreme market events that cover multiple risk factors, and the results of these tests are monitored. These scenarios can be based on historical or hypothetical events, or on a combination of the two.\n\nFor each risk type, sensitivities are monitored against limits. This includes all risk types mentioned above and the basic risks in the trading portfolio. In addition, the holding period is monitored as a measure of the liquidity of the positions.\n\n## Valuation adjustments\n\nFor the trading book, we take into account adjustments for counterparty credit risk on our clients (Credit Valuation Adjustment), ABN AMRO funding costs (Funding Valuation Adjustment) and ABN AMRO credit risk (Debt Valuation Adjustment).\n\nTrading book positions are subject to prudent valuation standards in accordance with regulatory requirements. The prudent value is derived from IFRS fair value accounting and includes additional value adjustments.\n\n## CER materiality assessment\n\nIn 2022, we assessed the materiality of climate-related and environmental risk in relation to traditional risk types. The initial assessment was qualitative. For some risk types this was further substantiated quantitatively whereby a distinction between materiality in the short term (within 1 year), medium term (within 5 years) and long term (within 30 year) horizon was made, where possible. To ensure consistency across risk types, we looked at a set of pre-defined CER events, including climate-related risk events such as floods and drought (physical risk) and policy and technology development (transition risk), as well as environmental risk events such as water stress and biodiversity loss (physical risk) and policy and technology development (transition risk).

Positions throughout the year were very small. The last transaction ended on 31 December 2022. As a result commodity trading will no longer be reported in future annual and interim financial statements.\n- 2 Equity trading was discontinued in February 2021 and will no longer be reported in future annual and interim financial statements.\n\nABN AMRO applies a diversified portfolio VaR approach that takes into account the fact that returns across risk factors may offset one another to a certain extent and consequently reduce risk. As long as these returns are not perfectly correlated to one another, VaR figures based on a diversified portfolio approach will be lower than if the figures are calculated using undiversified VaR. Undiversified VaR means that the VaR figures computed for the different risk factors are aggregated without taking into account any offset across risk factors, negating the potential for risk reduction. The following graph shows the total one-day VaR at a 99% confidence level ('VaR diversified') and aggregation of the stand-alone risk factors ('VaR undiversified').\n\n## VaR diversified and undiversified\n\n(in millions)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe average 1-day VaR at a 99% confidence level moved from EUR 1.8 million to EUR 2.6 million, comparing 2021 to 2022. In the same period, the average 1-day undiversified VaR at a 99% confidence level moved from EUR 2.3 million to EUR 3.0 million. Both increases were mainly due to increased market volatility in 2022. In 2022 and 2021, interest rates were the largest VaR component. Managing the hedging derivative position as a consequence of the changed TLTRO conditions, led to a one-day spike in the VaR on the day of unwinding the position. The interest rate\n\ncomponent includes both specific risk (i.e. credit spread risk) and generic risk.\n\n## Regulatory capital\n\nMarket risk regulatory capital increased to EUR 160 million (31 December 2021: EUR 133 million) as risk-weighted assets increased to EUR 2.0 billion (31 December 2021: EUR 1.7 billion). The increase was mostly due to an increase in the VaR with a minor impact from IRC, partly offset by a slight decrease in the SVaR. The 1-day VaR increased in 2022, which resulted in an increase in the VaR RWA from EUR 0.2 billion to EUR 0.5 billion.\n\n## IBOR reform\n\nIn 2014, at the request of the G20, the Financial Stability Board issued a report on 'Reforming Major Interest Rate Benchmarks'. This report set out several recommendations for strengthening existing benchmarks for key interbank offered rates (IBORs) in unsecured lending markets and for promoting the development and adoption of alternative nearly risk-free reference rates, where appropriate. These recommendations led to a fundamental review of the key interest rate benchmarks used in global financial markets.\n\nIn order to ensure a smooth transition, ABN AMRO introduced a bank-wide project, to prepare the bank for the forthcoming changes in IBORs. Whereas the switch in the discounting regime for centrally cleared swaps was already completed in 2020, work on the change in the discounting regime for bilateral counterparties continued. Centrally cleared swaps denominated in CHF, JPY and GBP were migrated in December 2021. In 2022, repapering of USD LIBOR-related contracts started. From 2022, new USD contracts reference the risk-free rate instead of LIBOR. In the case of other benchmark interest rates that have been reformed, such as EURIBOR, and can therefore continue, financial instruments referencing those rates will not need to transition.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Market risk in the banking book consists predominantly of interest rate risk and credit spread risk in the liquidity portfolio. Funding spread risk and foreign exchange risk are also recognised as market risks in the banking book. However, these are relatively immaterial.\n\n## Market risk management for the banking book b\n\nABN AMRO has a detailed risk management framework in place to identify, measure and control market risk in the banking book. This framework provides assurance that the banking book activities remain consistent with the bank's strategy to pursue a moderate risk profile. The day-to-day management is delegated from the Asset & Liability Committee (ALCO) to the Asset and Liability Management and Treasury department (ALM/Treasury). Their activities include the execution of hedge transactions. ALM/Treasury forms the first line of defence. Market & ALM/T Risk Management acts as the second line of defence.\n\nThe risk appetite is articulated in terms of net interest income, the economic value of equity and the economic capital for market risk in the banking book, and expresses the maximum loss the bank is willing to accept. The risk appetite is cascaded into a limit framework.\n\n## Interest rate risk in the banking book\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk of losses in the economic value of equity or the bank's net interest income (NII) due to yield curve developments. In order to measure interest rate risk, models are used and assumptions on client behaviour are made, most importantly with respect to the maturity of savings and the prepayment of mortgages. These assumptions influence the anticipated interest cash flow pattern. Interest rate risk is continuously managed in line with the risk appetite, as the profile of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet can change if client behaviour changes.\n\nThe main sources of interest rate risk are:\n\n- \u00c5 The maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities. ABN AMRO provides mortgages and commercial loans with fixed interest terms. These assets are funded by non-maturing deposits and wholesale funding with a shorter average interest maturity than the assets;\n- \u00c5 Client behaviour, which determines the maturity profile of some of our products. As we use models to predict this behaviour, we are exposed to model risk.\n\nABN AMRO uses a combination of portfolio (macro) hedges and specific asset or liability (micro) hedges to manage the interest rate sensitivity in the banking book and keep it in line with the bank's strategy and risk appetite. Micro hedges are used to swap fixed funding transactions and fixed investments in the liquidity buffer for floating interest rate positions. In addition, macro hedging is applied in order to align with the bank's strategy to contribute to a stable NII while protecting the economic value of equity.\n\n## Key assumptions for modelling client behaviour\n\nFrom an interest rate risk perspective, the following aspects of client behaviour are the most important:\n\n- H Client behaviour with respect to early redemption of residential mortgages. This has a significant impact on the average interest maturity of the mortgage portfolio. Clients have the option to fully or partially prepay mortgages before maturity. Prepayments may be triggered by, for example, relocation, redemption or curtailment. An important driver of prepayments is the interest rate incentive, i.e. the difference between a client's current mortgage rate and prevailing mortgage rates. Future mortgage rates are simulated using a Monte Carlo approach. In addition to the interest rate incentive, other drivers such as loan age, seasonality and house price developments are also taken into account;\n- H Client acceptance of the residential mortgage volume offered and the deviation between the offered rate and the actual coupon;\n- H Client behaviour with respect to non-maturing deposits that are callable on demand. Future client rates for savings and current accounts are modelled using a replicating portfolio model. Modelled client rates depend on current or lagged yield curves and funding costs. A maximum maturity of 10 years is assumed. The resulting duration depends on product type and client behaviour.",

        "page_content": "The metrics used for market risk in the banking book are dependent upon the assumptions made in the behavioural models. Models must therefore be based on extensive research, including historical data regarding observed client behaviour, and must be independently validated and approved by the mandated risk committees. Models are periodically assessed to determine whether they behave appropriately and are statistically sound; if required, they are adjusted.\n\n## Risk measurement for interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk is measured by NII at risk, the present value of one basis point (PV01), and the economic value of equity (EVE) at risk. To ensure a comprehensive approach to risk management and identify potential weaknesses, the metrics are complemented by stress testing and scenario analysis. Stress testing and scenario analyses go beyond determining the impact of alternative developments of interest rates and include testing assumptions with respect to modelling and client behaviour. A combination of market and product floors is applied. These floors are reviewed periodically.\n\nFor management purposes, the interest rate risk position is monitored by the Asset & Liability Committee (ALCO) on a monthly basis. The above metrics are also regularly reported to the Executive Board.\n\n## Credit spread risk in the banking book\n\nCredit spread risk is the risk of losses due to adverse movements in the credit spread of assets. The main source is from bonds held for liquidity purposes. It is measured as the impact on economic value of a 1bp change in spreads to a swap rate. The sensitivity is measured for individual term points, as well as for a parallel shift of the curve.\n\n## Funding spread risk\n\nFunding spread risk is the risk of losses due to adverse movements in the term structure of rates at which ABN AMRO can fund itself - expressed as a spread to a benchmark such as EURIBOR. Funding spread movements can arise due to changes in, for example, the perceived credit quality of ABN AMRO, changes in the competitive environment or changes in liquidity premiums. They may be entity-specific or systemic by nature. If funding spreads widen, it costs more to fund assets on the balance sheet. Unless this increased spread is passed on to clients by increasing client rates, the projected net interest income will decrease. The funding spread risk is measured using an NII-at-risk approach whereby the funding spread increases.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Foreign exchange risk b\n\nForeign exchange (FX) risk is the risk arising from adverse movements in FX spot and forward rates and/or FX volatility. It is managed within the bank by ALM and Treasury. As a general rule, foreign exchange risk is hedged by using cross-currency swaps to swap the exposure in foreign currency to EUR. If, for operational reasons, it is inefficient to hedge exposures in foreign currencies, an open currency position (OCP) remains. This is measured by the aggregated net position per currency, except for EUR.\n\n## Economic capital\n\nEconomic capital for market risk in the banking book is calculated using a parametric Monte Carlo simulation model that determines the economic capital needed to absorb losses resulting from adverse movements in interest rates, client behaviour for mortgages and non-maturing deposits, volatility, credit spreads and foreign exchange rates.\n\n## CER materiality assessment\n\nIn 2022, we assessed the materiality of climate-related and environmental risk in relation to traditional risk types. The initial assessment was qualitative. For some risk types this was further substantiated quantitatively whereby a distinction between materiality in the short term (within 1 year), medium term (within 5 years) and long term (within 30 year) horizon was made, where possible. To ensure consistency across risk types, we looked at a set of pre-defined CER events, including climate-related risk events such as floods and drought (physical risk) and policy and technology development (transition risk), as well as environmental risk events such as water stress and biodiversity loss (physical risk) and policy and technology development (transition risk). The results for market risk in the banking book are summarized below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Market risk in   | Climate Risk   |                 | Environmental Risk Transition risk   |\n|------------------|----------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|\n| the banking book | Physical risk  | Transition Risk | Physical risk                        |\n| the banking book |                |                 |                                      |\n\nClimate and environmental risk events can materialise in market risks within the banking book. More specifically CER events can have a (potential) negative effect on the net interest income (NII) of the bank through changing client behaviour and/or changes in regulation which have an effect on the Bank's interest rate risk position, changing interest rate curves and increase in funding spreads. Based on scenario analyses. the effect of a single physical or environmental event on the NII of ABN AMRO is currently assessed to be immaterial. This is due to the relatively low interest rate sensitivity of portfolios with a higher sensitivities to physical or transition risks.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2",

In addition to the regulatory prescribed scenarios, the internal metric is defined as the worst outcome of the following scenarios: a gradual increase or decrease in interest rates by 200bps, measured over a 1-year period, and an instantaneous increase or decrease of 100bps. NII-at-Risk includes all expected cash flows, including commercial margins and other spread components, from all interest rate-sensitive assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items in the banking book. The NII-at-Risk calculation contains assumptions about the future balance sheet, including the reinvestment of maturing positions.\n\nOn 31 December 2022, the NII-at-Risk was EUR 474 million in absolute terms (31 December 2021: EUR 251 million), reflecting a reduction of NII in the scenario of a gradual decrease of 200bps in interest rates. The most positive NII occurs in the scenario where interest rates rise gradually by 200bps, in which case the NII would be EUR 544 million higher than the base scenario. The increase in NII-at-Risk\n\nis mainly attributable to increases in the market rates. Due to interest rate floors applied to certain market and product rates, the effect of a downward rate scenario was previously dampened. With rising rates, the distance towards these floors has increased, resulting in a larger effective shock.\n\nThe PV01 measures the value change resulting from a 1bp parallel shift in the yield curve. The PV01 exposure in absolute terms decreased by EUR 1.1 million to EUR 4.7 million in 2022. This decrease was the aggregate result of various developments in markets and the balance sheet. These include an increase in interest rates, lower predicted mortgage prepayments and associated hedging transactions.\n\n## Open currency position\n\nThe OCP is monitored regularly, and limits apply at a local and aggregate level. USD is the largest non-EUR exposure for assets as well as liabilities.

For this purpose, ABN AMRO has in place a framework that enables non-financial risks to be managed within its moderate risk profile.

ABN AMRO's NFR Framework may be partly described as a toolkit of assessments, alarm bells and feedback. The bank itself may also be understood as a collection of processes. For that reason processes are at the heart of the NFR framework, but processes and tools are not enough. We rely on professionals to execute the NFR framework, especially in a continuous dialogue about risks. The activities performed in executing the NFR Framework are contextualised by boundaries established through a range of NFR policies and procedures, a taxonomy of material risks, roles and responsibilities for professionals working according to 3LoD model practices and behaviours as well as data management systems.\n\nAssessments are conducted to identify non-financial risks and assess risk exposures. They are performed either periodically or can be initiated when concerns arise, for example as a result of changes in internal processes or developments in the outside environment that pose risks to strategic priorities. We also rely on alarm bells from both internal and external sources such as the effectiveness of the internal control environment, the status of key risk indicators (KRIs) relative to established risk thresholds and complaints from our clients to understand what actions are necessary to further mature the efficacy of the NFR Framework. Despite preventive measures being in place, incidents and operational losses are inherent to our business. ABN AMRO systematically tracks and analyses these events as part of feedback mechanisms that enable us to learn from operational failures and use them as early warnings. We also scan external developments and identify emerging risks for further assessment.\n\nDuring our continuous risk dialogues, risk professionals from the first (1LoD) and second (2LoD) Lines of Defence evaluate the level of threat from NFRs and determine appropriate responses to keep control. Our risk professionals combine relevant internal data (e.g. scale of changes to processes), external data (e.g. climate science) and professional judgement to come to a holistic risk view. Once NFR exposures are agreed upon by 1LoD and 2LoD, and evaluated against risk thresholds, an appropriate risk\n\nresponse can be implemented. Common risk responses include enhancing controls by expanding coverage to capture new and evolving areas of risks as well as adjusting processes to reduce opportunities for errors.\n\nThe results of the executed risk dialogues as per the NFR framework are provided in risk reports at various levels within the bank, up to the Executive Board and Supervisory Board. This enables senior management to steer the bank's overall profile of NFRs.\n\n## Specific operational (non-financial) risk areas\n\nABN AMRO defines ten (10) non-financial sub-risk types (see below) as well as an overall NFR generic category, which provides a holistic profile of non-financial risks. The bank has in place dedicated functional areas with specific knowledge and expertise to deal with each material type of NFR. The NFR risk category and individual non-financial risk types are governed by the broader Enterprise Risk Management approach to ensure that structured, coherent, systematic and consistent risk management processes are applied throughout the 3LoD of the bank.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCompliance risk is defined as the risk of failure to comply with laws and regulations, self-regulatory organisational standards, company values and business principles, codes of conduct or generally accepted market standards applicable to ABN AMRO's services and activities. Non-compliance can result in legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss and/or harm to ABN AMRO's reputation.\n\nABN AMRO must continuously live up to regulatory expectations and obligations. The bank is expected to act as a gatekeeper in detecting financial and economic crime, to fulfil its obligations arising from its duty of care towards clients, and to address and incorporate key topics such as privacy and sustainability in the bank's strategy and compliance programmes.\n\nAn effective Compliance Function, culture and compliance programme are essential for ABN AMRO's license to operate and for protecting the banks' integrity and reputation.",

This included making investments to upgrade data management capabilities that support its ambition to become a data-driven bank and achieve its overall strategy. In the current age, data not only provides commercial competitiveness but is of growing importance from risk management and regulatory compliance perspectives. In particular, structured and systematic data risk oversight contributes to effective risk management for the bank by enabling faster and more informed decisionmaking at every level within the organisation. Enhancement of our data risk management function to support and mature the overall in-control objective for data risks will continue to be of high priority to ABN AMRO going forward.\n\n## Business continuity management\n\nBusiness continuity management (BCM) ensures organisational resilience at all levels within ABN AMRO. It focuses on setting up and maintaining ABN AMRO's crisis management capability (i.e. framework, process, tooling, people) to enable the organisation to remain well-prepared and sufficiently responsive in the face of severe threats. Our business continuity management capabilities proved effective in 2022, when we were faced with the RussianUkrainian war and the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nOur key tasks in continuity management include the following:\n\n- \u00c5 Scanning the operating environment for threats that could trigger a calamity and/or crisis;\n- \u00c5 Analysing threats and the business impact of a (potential) calamity and/or crisis;\n- \u00c5 Determining the strategies and solutions to be applied in the event of a calamity and/or crisis - such as emergency management, business recovery, crisis management and IT disaster recovery planning - to ensure the safety of our employees, clients and visitors, and to enable continuity of business operations;\n- \u00c5 Documenting, periodically assessing and testing these strategies and solutions.\n\nMitigations are in place to prepare for and deal with incidents and crises threatening the continuity of critical\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbusiness processes. These mitigations include business continuity plans, crisis management, business relocation plans and IT disaster recovery plans. We also perform evaluations and root cause analyses on incidents and implement lessons learned. Equally importantly, we carry out forward-looking analyses to prepare for evolving threats such as those related to climate change where data and methodologies from climate science are increasingly incorporated into our risk assessments on critical infrastructure, such as our data centers.\n\nPhysical security is an important pillar of continuity management. ABN AMRO's Physical Security Policy (PSP) enables a fit-for-purpose framework that safeguards people, information, buildings and company assets against damages and disruptions. We operate a multidisciplinary approach by combining insights from key areas such as Business Continuity Management, Security & Integrity Management, HR/Workplace Management, Corporate Information Security and client units.\n\nThe PSP includes governance procedures that distribute roles and responsibilities across various internal departments, branches, (critical) corporate buildings and foreign offices with the aim of coordinating (complex) physical security issues such as events associated with chronic or acute climate change. Evaluations such as physical security risk assessments are regularly executed on data centers, (critical) corporate buildings and sites in the Netherlands and abroad. ABN AMRO did not experience any material financial loss due to extreme weather linked to climate change in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nInformation is one of the bank's most valuable assets. Given that our clients rely increasingly on digitalisation and online banking, proper functioning of the bank's IT systems is crucial. These systems run in complex information infrastructures, connecting the bank's networks to public networks. Banking processes and their supporting information systems are therefore inherently vulnerable to threats to the security of client data and services. Examples of such threats include social engineering and phishing, computer-assisted fraud, unauthorised disclosure of confidential information, virus infections and ransomware, and distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS).\n\nIn recognition of the vital importance of protecting its information, systems and infrastructure at all times, ABN AMRO has established a structured IT risk management approach to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. This approach defines the organisational framework, management\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2",

These were accompanied by improvements to safeguard ABN AMRO's overall security position and to foster security by design. We also increased our efforts to keep pace with evolving cyber threats such as phishing and ransomware, while ensuring regulatory compliance. Our improved defences against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) proved to be effective throughout 2022, thus helping to mitigate attacks and limit disruption for our clients. We will continue to make investments geared toward ensuring overall stability of our digital payment services and strengthening the effectiveness of our risk and control framework.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChange is fundamental to ABN AMRO's strategy and a key factor in its desire to succeed as a personal bank in a digital age. It is crucial to be agile and adaptable to achieve our client-centric approach. Responding to change is what makes us commercial, progressive and entrepreneurial. During 2022 we continued to implement a wide range of change programmes as part of our strategy execution. Many of these change programmes are instrumental to resolving weaknesses (e.g., data management) identified within the bank. Still, our relatively large change portfolio plus their interdependencies tend to result in inherent (change) risks such as errors arising from failing to properly adjust corresponding controls when products, processes or internal structures are adjusted. We continue to further mature our change management framework by working towards reducing complexity in our change portfolio and emphasising stronger prioritisation and execution.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFraud is a complex phenomenon with increasing impact on society, ABN AMRO and its clients. It can arise from internal or external events and result in financial loss, reputational damage and/or regulatory fines. ABN AMRO has classified fraud risk as a formal risk type within its risk taxonomy. In collaboration with the business and other relevant stakeholders, the dedicated risk type owner implements the fraud risk framework to enable the bank to manage fraud risks. In 2022, the focus of the fraud risk framework was on defining the fraud risk appetite statement, formalising roles and responsibilities within\n\nthe risk governance, further developing the existing control framework, improving fraud management information and integrating fraud risk reporting within bank-level risk reporting. These efforts will continue in 2023.\n\nIt is important to note that ABN AMRO has a zero-tolerance policy for fraud. However, this is an ongoing challenge partly due to the increased sophistication of fraudsters coupled with digitalization of our banking services. In 2022, the number of victims of fraud increased. The most frequent modus operandi observed by ABN AMRO for external fraud were impersonation-, debit- and credit card- and invoicefraud. In some instances, ABN AMRO itself was the victim of credit fraud where fraudulent documents were used for the purpose of credit applications. With regards to internal fraud the bank continuously monitors and assesses fraud risks related to employee fraud and bribery and corruption risk. In 2022, given the developments in the Ukraine-Russia conflict insider threat has increased. In response to insider threat the bank started developing an insider threat framework that will also continue in 2023.\n\nABN AMRO continues its efforts in 2023 to strengthen the fraud resilience of its clients and its employees to manage financial, emotional and reputational impact. Key actions included the following:\n\n- \u00c5 Developing and executing the fraud risk management framework: The implementation of the fraud risk framework aims to put in place fraud risk management processes and controls wherein (emerging) fraud risks are continuously identified, assessed, measured, responded to, monitored and reported. Examples of the bank's fraud response measures taken in 2022 included the option that enables clients to (temporarily) lock savings accounts (to prevent fraudsters direct access to these accounts) and the introduction of in-app banners to warn customers for potential fraudulent situations.\n- \u00c5 Awareness: To increase fraud awareness and employee resilience, ABN AMRO has in place a continuous integrity and compliance programme, as well as a bankwide Code of Conduct. To encourage employees to report such things as corruption and suspicious or fraudulent behaviour, the bank maintains its Speak-Up programme, of which the whistle-blowing procedure is a part.\n- \u00c5 Expertise: In order to monitor and assess fraud and emerging fraud risks ABN AMRO employs dedicated resources for investigations, fraud risk analyses, mitigation, reporting and prevention.\n- \u00c5 Public private partnerships: ABN AMRO is cooperating with public and private institutions and authorities in order to counter online frauds and scams. Existing initiatives, such as the Electronic Crimes Taskforce (ECTF) and the Landelijk Meldpunt Internet Oplichting (LMIO), have proven their value in this respect.",

This is called the integrated approach and its priorities are data-sharing, designing and executing interventions, victim support and prevention.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nABN AMRO considers legal risk to be any risk of financial loss or reputational effects that is the result of:\n\n- \u00c5 uncertainty in the applicability, enforceability and interpretation of contracts, laws and regulations,\n- \u00c5 the failure (or assumed failure) by the bank and/or any third party to comply with statutory, contractual or regulatory obligations or 'best practices', or\n- \u00c5 uncertainty about the outcome of legal actions against or initiated by the bank (including judicial proceedings/ litigation).\n\nThe following considerations could be taken into account:\n\n- \u00c5 ABN AMRO acknowledges the fact that especially in a globalised business environment, there may not always be a clear set of legal rules and that ABN AMRO may be confronted with an abundance of legal requirements as well as a lack of legal clarity. Legal obligations may be unclear, opaque, conflicting, and can arise retroactively.\n- \u00c5 Furthermore, rules and regulations may be interpreted and applied outside the original intention of the legislator by regulators or under case law.\n- \u00c5 Rules and regulations which are not directly binding upon parties involved or third parties, such as resolutions, recommendations, best practice documents etc., issued by authorities and other governmental or nongovernmental bodies emerge and may have a de facto force which may go beyond formal laws and regulations.\n- \u00c5 Finally, extraterritorial reach of certain national laws increases the complexity of complying with all these many layers, types and forms of rules and regulations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHuman Resource (HR) risk is the risk that ABN AMRO is unable to develop, retain and attract the required critical skills/talents and diverse workforce to realise its strategic targets. Internally, we distinguish HR risks related to discrimination, employee relations, personal health & safety, remuneration and suitability. Adverse developments in these areas can potentially compromise the bank's viability. For this reason, management of HR risk is\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfundamental for the bank to achieve its strategic, business, operational, compliance and reputational objectives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTax risk is the risk of unexpected tax charges, including interest and penalties. It also is the risk of being engaged in tax-related events resulting in, for example, a damaged reputation with the tax authorities, investors, employees and the general public. This can occur both in relation to the bank's own behaviour, products or solutions as well as with regard to the tax integrity of our clients. See section on Responsible Tax in the Integrated Annual Report for more details on how ABN AMRO deals with this risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nModels are developed and applied to quantify the risk for most of the risk types listed in ABN AMRO's risk taxonomy. We define model risk as the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based substantially or partly on incorrect output of models, and due to errors in the development, implementation or use of such models. This definition is in line with the EU Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). To monitor and mitigate risks arising from the use of these models, the model risk management (MRM) department acts as the second line of defence. As an independent department, MRM sets the framework for the bank in line with regulatory requirements for model risk and independently validates models before they can be used. For this purpose, ABN AMRO has in place independent model validation standards and procedures as part of its model risk management framework. MRM also reports to Senior Management on the status of model risks in ABN AMRO and facilitates finding solutions to critical deficiencies.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nABN AMRO designated behavioural risk as a material risk type in 2021. Behavioural risk management aims to safeguard an enabling and supportive work environment. It does not hinder but rather empowers employees to execute our strategy, take sound risks and act in line with our purpose, core values and Code of Conduct.\n\nBehavioural risk is considered an internal causal factor of other ABN AMRO risk types. It is defined as the risk that actions, decisions and behaviours by ABN AMRO\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2",

The initial assessment was qualitative. For some risk types this was further substantiated quantitatively whereby a distinction between materiality in the short term (within 1 year), medium term (within 5 years) and long term (within 30 year) horizon was made, where possible. To ensure consistency across risk types, we looked at a set of pre-defined CER events, including climate-related risk\n\n(collectively), or by employees (as a group or individually) lead to detrimental or poor outcomes for clients, employees, society and/or ABN AMRO, and/or; ABN AMRO fails to maintain high standards of market behaviour and integrity, and/or; ABN AMRO fails to maintain the high expectations of clients, society and other stakeholders with regard to the integrity of our business.\n\nIn 2022, behavioural risk was implemented and embedded in ABN AMRO's enterprise risk management cycles. Tools and processes to identify, measure, report and monitor the level of behavioural risk were designed in the organisation. We mitigated identified risks by conducting analysis of (organisational) root causes for undesired behaviours and non-compliance and delivering effective interventions to behavioural change.\n\n## Operational (non-financial) risk measurement\n\nIn line with the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA), the bank has in place an internally developed model to define the own funds required in relation to non-financial risks (i.e. operational risk capital). The AMA model estimates potential losses for non-financial risks (annually aggregated) by combining forward-looking and backwardlooking views on risk events.\n\nSpecifically, risk assessments and scenario analyses provide a forward-looking view. Experts use these tools to build scenarios to evaluate future risks and estimate the severity of potential losses that could occur. The resulting estimates are used as data input for the model. In these scenarios, experts take into consideration the quality of the bank's control environment, its processes, systems and people, as well as external circumstances and changes that may have an influence. The ongoing relevance of the estimations (and hence of the capital) is safeguarded by reviewing the scenarios at regular intervals as well as when major changes occur in the bank's risk profile.\n\nevents such as floods and drought (physical risk) and policy and technology development (transition risk), as well as environmental risk events such as water stress and biodiversity loss (physical risk) and policy and technology development (transition risk). The results for operational (non-financial) risk are summarized below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlongside these expert-based estimations, the model also uses historical loss data of ABN AMRO and the banking industry. Historical loss data are included as these are assumed to provide some level of predictive information about future losses.\n\nReputational and liability effects arising from developments in climate and environmental risks were qualitatively assessed and found to be material. For example, industrywide concerns relating to the speed of executing climate strategies, compliance with specifics regulations, duty of care to clients impacted by transition risks and/or green washing in product propositions are material drivers of potential reputational and liability effects for ABN AMRO. Data and insights are therefore continuously being developed, with the aim of improving quantification in 2023.\n\nFor the impact of climate physical risk on business continuity management a further quantitative analysis was performed.\n\n## Climate physical risk\n\nWe investigated how climate-related hazards together with ABN AMRO's exposures and vulnerabilities interact to manifest in physical risks to our critical infrastructure.\n\nThe focus of the analysis was to establish financial impacts and enhance internal knowledge of the transmission mechanisms and potential effects of\n\nclimate risks in the Non-Financial Risk (NFR) domains.",

        "page_content": "As the assessment showed, ABN AMRO's critical physical infrastructure (e.g. data centers) face threats from natural hazards (e.g. floods) that could potentially impact bank-wide business continuity. This was unsurprising, given that water-related threats are characteristic of the Netherlands. However, the inherent flood-risk profiles of ABN AMRO's critical infrastructure varied because of differences in location, elevation, construction and internal layout. Based on available flooding estimates for the Netherlands for 2050, the assessment estimated that a flood of 50 cm or higher could be impactful to one critical physical infrastructure (i.e. a data center). Although the expected financial costs would be less than 1% of profits, this was significant in a context of historically negligible losses from CER-related events.\n\nRisk mitigations are planned, including a repeat of the extended analysis designed to overcome data integrity issues linked outdated data on flooding scenarios for the Netherlands. In the interim, ABN AMRO has upgraded the requirements to lengthen the time horizon of its business continuity risk assessments (BRCA) to climate-sensitive periods (e.g. looking ahead 30 years). In addition, the bank will investigate possibilities to reconfigure the internal layout for the most at-risk infrastructure.\n\n## Review of 2022 results\n\nABN AMRO uses a holistic approach to managing operational (non-financial) risks, considering capital, losses and the effectiveness of the control environment.\n\n## Capital for operational (non-financial) risk\n\nThe level of capital under the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) is derived from the results of the model calculations. For non-financial risks, ABN AMRO applies a 99.95% confidence level to the annually aggregated losses when calculating economic capital (EC), whereas a 99.9% confidence level is applied to calculate regulatory capital (RC/RWA). The adequacy of the capital levels is monitored on a quarterly basis; if issues occur - for example, regarding the reliability of data - add-ons can be applied.\n\nRisk Weighted Assets (RWA) for operational (non-financial) risk based on AMA calculations remained relatively stable at EUR 16 billion for 2022. ABN AMRO's current operational risk capital level (measured against the bank's gross income) also remained in line with that of peer banks with a moderate risk profile (based on ORX benchmark data).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Losses related to operational (non-financial) risks\n\nOperational losses related to non-financial risks include direct losses, as well as provisions for legal claims. Operational losses are reported according to event categories such as External Fraud; Internal Fraud; Clients, Products & Business Practices; Execution, Delivery & Process Management; Employee Practices & Workplace Safety; Disaster & Public Safety, and Technology & Infrastructure Failures.\n\nA net operational loss of EUR 162 million was recorded in 2022. This was mainly attributable to the event category of Clients, Products & Business Practices, and predominantly (almost 90%) to provisions formed for a compensation scheme for clients who previously paid too much interest on revolving consumer credits. The categories of Execution, Delivery & Process Management (e.g. processing errors) and External Fraud were the other notable contributors to overall losses.\n\n## Effectiveness of the control environment\n\nA robust risk control framework is a fundamental element of ABN AMRO's risk management system. This requires the bank to continuously adapt its risk control framework to changes in both the internal and external environment to ensure it has well-designed and operationally effective controls. Throughout 2022, ABN AMRO focused intensely on improving the control environment across the bank through initiatives such as the Risk Control Framework (RCF) improvement programme and Risk Fit professional training. It particularly targeted efforts to improve the control environment in high-priority processes in credit, compliance and information security. Although improvements were recorded, challenges remain in these high-priority areas. Nevertheless, the overall bank-level control effectiveness improved in 2022 relative to 2021, with most controls proving effective.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2",

There are two types of liquidity risk:\n\n- \u00c5 Funding liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to accommodate both expected and unexpected current and future cash outflows and collateral needs because insufficient cash is available. Eventually, this can affect the bank's daily operations or its financial condition;\n- \u00c5 Market liquidity risk is the risk that the bank cannot sell an asset in a timely manner at a reasonable market price due to insufficient market depth (insufficient supply and demand) or market disruption. Market liquidity risk includes the sensitivity in liquidity value of a portfolio due to changes in the applicable haircuts and market value. It also concerns uncertainty about the time that would be needed to liquidate assets in periods of stress.\n\n## Framework\n\n## Liquidity risk management\n\nWe have in place a liquidity risk management framework that helps us maintain a moderate risk profile and safeguards the bank's reputation from a liquidity perspective. This framework enables us to meet regulatory requirements and payment obligations at a reasonable cost, even under severely adverse conditions. A set of liquidity risk metrics and limits help manage the liquidity position. By maintaining a smooth long-term maturity profile, managing dependence on wholesale funding and holding a solid liquidity buffer in our main currencies, we maintain a prudent liquidity profile. The liquidity position is monitored on a daily basis.\n\n## Funding strategy\n\nOur main source of funding is our strong client deposit base. The remainder of our funding is raised largely through various types of long-term and short-term wholesale funding instruments. Our wholesale funding strategy targets a moderate risk profile with a stable and diversified funding mix that reflects the composition of our loan book.\n\nThis strategy aims to optimise the bank's funding sources in order to maintain market access and the targeted funding position with a diverse, stable and cost-efficient funding base. The maturity profile of wholesale funding is optimised to avoid a concentration of outflows and to control repricing risks. The funding strategy takes into account the following guidelines:\n\n- \u00c5 Maintain market access by diversifying funding sources in different funding markets (Europe, the US and the Asia-Pacific region);\n- \u00c5 Continually monitor attractive funding opportunities and maintain strong relationships with the investor base through active marketing;\n- \u00c5 Optimise the balance between public benchmark deals and private placements;\n- \u00c5 Optimise funding costs within the targets set for volumes and maturities and manage credit curves in different instruments and currencies;\n- \u00c5 Optimise the planning and execution of funding in different market windows and currencies.\n\n## Risk management approach b\n\nThe natural maturity mismatch between our loan book and funding portfolio requires liquidity risk management. We consider maturity transformation to be an integral part of the business model, which is why we closely monitor our liquidity position and the resulting risks. We hold a portfolio of highly liquid assets that can be converted into cash in the event of unforeseen market disruptions, allowing us to meet payment and collateral obligations at all times. Funding and liquidity risk are managed centrally. We incorporate liquidity costs into the pricing of our day-to-day business activities. In managing these risks, a clear distinction is made between going-concern and contingency risk management.\n\n## Going-concern management\n\nThe most important metrics for going-concern risk management and the management of the day-to-day liquidity position within specified limits are:\n\n- H Stress testing: in monthly and ad hoc stress tests we evaluate the impact of cash inflows and outflows under plausible stress scenarios. Market-wide as well as bankspecific stress scenarios are defined and analysed. The goal of stress testing is twofold. Firstly, it helps us to review our risk framework, i.e. the liquidity buffer size, risk appetite and risk limits. Secondly, it allows us to identify ways to reduce outflows in times of crisis;\n- H Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR): The objective of the LCR is to assess the short-term resilience of the liquidity position by ensuring sufficient high-quality liquid assets to survive a significant stress scenario lasting 30 calendar days;",

    },
    {
        "page_content": "- H Survival period: this is the period the liquidity position is expected to remain positive in an internal stress scenario in which wholesale funding markets deteriorate and clients withdraw a material proportion of their deposits;\n- H Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR): The objective of this ratio is to assess resilience over a longer time horizon. The NSFR requires banks to hold sufficient stable funding to cover the duration of their long-term assets on an ongoing basis;\n- H Loan-to-Deposit ratio (LtD): The LtD ratio measures the relationship between the loan book (loans and advances customers) and deposits from clients (due to customers), and includes all client-related loans and deposits. The ratio gives an indication of our dependence on wholesale funding for financing client loans.\n\n## Contingency  ris       k  management\n\nContingency risk management aims to ensure that, in the event of either a bank-specific or general market stress event, the bank is able to generate sufficient liquidity to withstand a short or long-term liquidity crisis. Contingency risk management entails:\n\n- H Contingency Funding Plan: this plan sets out the guidelines and responsibilities for addressing possible liquidity shortfalls in emergency situations. This only comes into effect if the liquidity position is threatened or if there are strong indications that liquidity stress is imminent. The Contingency Funding Plan is aligned with the Recovery Plan, as required by the regulators. It enables us to manage our liquidity without unnecessarily jeopardising commercial activities, while limiting excessive funding costs in severe market circumstances;\n- H Collateral posting in the event of a rating downgrade: if our credit rating is downgraded, collateral requirements may increase. We monitor these potential additional collateral postings in the liquidity risk management framework;\n- H Liquidity buffer: Group Treasury manages our liquidity buffer, of which the liquidity portfolio comprises a substantial part. At all times, this portfolio should be highly liquid to accommodate liquidity outflows during stress. The buffer consists of unencumbered, highquality liquid assets, including government bonds, retained securities (RMBS and covered bonds) and cash.\n\n## CER materiality assessment\n\nIn 2022, we assessed the materiality of climate-related and environmental risk (CER) in relation to traditional risk types. The initial assessment was qualitative. For some risk types this was further substantiated quantitatively whereby a distinction between materiality in the short term (within 1 year), medium term (within 5 years) and long term (within 30 year) horizon was made, where possible. To ensure consistency across risk types, we looked at a set of pre-defined CER events, including climate-related risk events such as floods and drought (physical risk) and policy and technology development (transition risk), as well as environmental risk events such as water stress and biodiversity loss (physical risk) and policy and technology development (transition risk). The results for liquidity risk are summarized below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                | Climate Risk   | Climate Risk    | Environmental Risk   | Environmental Risk   |\n|----------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Liquidity risk | Physical risk  | Transition Risk | Physical risk        | Transition risk      |\n| Liquidity risk |                |                 |                      |                      |\n\nWe assessed whether material CER could cause net cash outflows or depletion of liquidity buffers and, if so, incorporate these factors into their liquidity risk management and liquidity buffer calibration. As liquidity risk consists of funding liquidity risk and market liquidity risk, the impact of CER transition risk and physical risk is assessed in both these sub risk categories:\n\n## Climate physical risk\n\n- \u00c5 Physical risk on funding liquidity risk: asset value change driven by physical events may affect the bank's funding capacity, such as issuing secured funding. Physical events may lead to potential liquidity outflows, such as increased drawdown of credit lines or accelerated deposit withdrawals, as clients need additional money to finance damage repairs in times of CER events;\n- \u00c5 Physical risk on market liquidity risk: as physical risk events are embedded in the country risk ratings we use in our liquidity risk framework, the impact of physical risk on the liquidity buffer is materially limited.\n\n## Climate transition risk\n\n- \u00c5 Transition risk on funding liquidity risk: refinancing risk occurs if transition risk affects the bank's access to funding sources. Repricing risk occurs if transition risk negatively impacts the funding costs of non-green issuances in comparison with green issuances;\n- \u00c5 Transition risk on market liquidity risk: the overall liquidity value of the liquidity buffer may be affected by transition risk following from differences in the liquidity of green and non-green investments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2",

Separate CER liquidity stress scenarios and parameters were defined in order to monitor potential liquidity outflows. The stress test covers the entire balance sheet of ABN AMRO, including off-balance sheet positions. To calculate the impact of the CER stress events on the liquidity buffer a number of parameters are required. The following categories were defined:\n\n- \u00c5 Run-off parameters for client deposits;\n- \u00c5 Haircuts on the liquidity buffer;\n- \u00c5 Additional drawings on credit lines;\n- \u00c5 Wholesale funding access;\n- \u00c5 Extraordinary cash flows.\n\n## Liquidity risk management\n\nLiquidity risk indicators\n\n|                                            | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Available liquidity buffer (in billions) 1 | 103.6              | 101.5              |\n| Survival period (moderate stress)          | > 12 months        | > 12 months        |\n| LCR 2                                      | 143%               | 168%               |\n| NSFR 3                                     | 133%               | 138%               |\n| Loan-to-Deposit ratio                      | 96%                | 103%               |\n\n- 1 The mandatory cash reserve with the central bank has been deducted from the cash and central bank deposits in the liquidity buffer.\n- 2 Consolidated LCR based on a 12-month rolling average.\n- 3 The NSFR is based on the CRR2 regulation since June 2021 and reflects a fixed point in time.\n\nThe survival period reflects the period that the liquidity position is expected to remain positive in an internally developed (moderate) stress scenario. This scenario assumes wholesale funding markets deteriorate and clients withdraw part of their deposits. The survival period was consistently above 12 months in 2022. The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) both remained above 100% throughout 2022.\n\nThe effect of a CER event on each category is assessed, which results in parameters. The final result shows that the outflows based on the CER liquidity scenario parameters are considered minimal compared with the outflows of the regular internal stress test. Therefore, the overall CER impact on liquidity is considered to be immaterial.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nThe objective of our liquidity management is to manage the bank's liquidity position and to comply at all times with internal, regulatory and other relevant liquidity requirements. Various indicators are used to measure the liquidity objectives.\n\n## Loan-to-Deposit ratio b\n\nLoans and advances customers decreased to EUR 243.9 billion at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: EUR 258.3 billion). Underlying, the loan book increased in most segments. However, this was more than offset by a decrease in other clients loans within Clearing and fair value adjustments related to hedge accounting. Due to customers increased to EUR 255.0 billion at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: EUR 251.2 billion). The Loan-to-Deposit (LtD) ratio decreased to 96% at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: 103%) reflecting the continued increased trend in client savings over the years, outpacing the growth in the client loan book.",

Inclusion of such bonds in the liquidity portfolio is subject to availability of ESG Reporting, a thorough project selection process and sound management of proceeds. To preserve the portfolios high quality and liquidity, these bonds must also meet the high quality liquid assets (HQLA) criteria of the European Banking Authority (EBA). By actively investing in the euro-denominated ESG bond market, ABN AMRO aims to support the growth of this market. The amounts of ESG bonds held in the liquidity portfolio are reported semi-annually.

Total issued debt decreased to EUR 56.3 billion at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: EUR 59.7 billion). The decrease reflects a decline in covered bonds. This was driven by a decline in market value and senior preferred funding, driven primarily by redemptions. This was partly offset by an increase in senior non-preferred funding. Subordinated liabilities decreased to EUR 7.3 billion at 31 December 2022 due to fair value adjustments (31 December 2021: EUR 7.5 billion). Senior non-preferred funding was issued in order to meet increasing MREL requirements from RWA increases. Other long-term funding decreased to EUR 14.3 billion at 31 December 2022 due to a repayment of EUR 21.0 billion of TLTRO III (31 December 2021: EUR 35.2 billion). Total green bonds outstanding increased\n\nto EUR 5.6 billion at 31 December 2022, which is 10% of total issued debt (31 December 2021: EUR 3.8 billion). In order to keep investors updated, our Green Bonds Framework determines a set of criteria applicable to issues of green bonds, including how we allocate the issue proceeds from green bonds to eligible assets, the evaluation and selection of eligible assets, independent assurance on the allocation of proceeds to eligible green assets, and the external reporting requirements. Green bonds have been issued since 2015, with a focus on sustainable real estate and renewable energy. These bonds enable investors to invest in, for example, energy efficiency through residential mortgages, loans for solar panels on existing homes, sustainable commercial real estate and wind energy.

The average remaining maturity of outstanding long-term funding increased to 5.7 years at year-end 2022 (up from 4.2 years at year-end 2021). The maturity calendar assumes redemption on the earliest possible call date or the legal maturity date, which does not mean that the instruments will be called at the earliest possible call date. Early redemption of subordinated instruments is subject to approval by the regulator.",

        "page_content": "## Capital\n\n## Capital management strategy\n\nThe primary objective of the bank's capital management strategy is to ensure that capital adequacy requirements are met at all times and that sufficient capital is available to support the bank's strategy. Capital is a necessary resource for doing business and defines the bank's commercial possibilities. The balance between available and required capital is managed centrally to optimise the use of available capital. The basis of the capital management strategy is the bank's risk appetite and its business plans. Other important factors of managing the capital position are expectations and requirements of external stakeholders (such as regulators, investors, shareholders, equity analysts, rating agencies and clients), the bank's position in the market, market developments, contingent capital needs and the feasibility of capital management actions. Although ABN AMRO manages its capital centrally, the group companies are sufficiently capitalised to comply with all local regulatory solvency requirements and to meet any local business needs. ABN AMRO's banking activities are carried out by legal entities that are part of the bank's fiscal unity. Apart from prevailing statutory and regulatory legislation, there are no specific material impediments for prompt transfer of the bank's regulatory capital.\n\n## Dividend policy and Capital Framework\n\nThe bank's dividend policy takes into account matters including current and pending regulatory capital requirements, our risk profile, growth in commercial activities and market factors. The dividend payout is determined in light of the bank's moderate risk profile and regulatory changes and to ensure that dividend payments can be maintained in the future.\n\nFrom 2021 onwards, the dividend payout has been set at 50% of reported net profit, after deduction of AT1 coupon payments and minority interests. Interim dividends will be considered at 40% of the reported H1 net profit, provided profit is expected to be sustainable throughout the year, at the discretion of the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur CET1 capital target ratio is 13% under Basel IV. When our Basel IV CET1 ratio is above the threshold of 15%, we will consider share buybacks, subject to conditions and regulatory approval. Our threshold of 15% reflects current uncertainties, as well as a buffer for potential M&A.\n\nAny distribution of dividend remains discretionary, and ABN AMRO may propose deviations from the above policy.\n\n## Capital measurement and allocation\n\nCapital adequacy is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis against target capital ratios, which are derived from the bank's overall risk appetite and strategy. Capital projections and stress test scenarios, both market-wide and bank-specific, are used to ensure that actual and future capital levels remain above the targets. Capital is allocated to businesses in a way that optimises the long-term value of the bank while serving the bank's strategic objectives. In the capital allocation process, both risk-based and non-risk-based return parameters are considered, taking into account economic and regulatory capital requirements. This process ensures that the bank meets its return targets while maintaining a moderate risk profile in line with its risk appetite.\n\n## Contingency capital management\n\nContingency plans are in place to address any capital issues arising. The Contingency Capital Plan provides a framework for detecting capital adequacy stress by setting out various early warning indicators. The plan also sets out a range of actions that can be undertaken, based on the level of severity and urgency of the issues.\n\n## Recovery and resolution planning\n\nThe Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) requires a recovery plan and a resolution plan to be in place. ABN AMRO submitted a reviewed and updated version of its bank recovery plan to the ECB in December 2022. The Single Resolution Board (SRB) has prepared a resolution plan, in which it concluded a Single-Point-of-Entry as the preferred resolution strategy, with ABN AMRO Bank N.V. as the resolution entity and bail-in is the preferred resolution tool.",

The CET1 capital ratio decreased compared to 31 December 2021 due to an increase in RWA, partly offset by an increase in CET1 capital. The EUR 10.9 billion increase in RWA mainly reflects an increase in credit risk RWA. Credit risk RWA was up as a result of a new model risk add-on and migration of specific portfolios from Advanced IRB model to Foundation IRB and\n\n## Developments impacting capital ratios in 2022\n\n(in %)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe maximum distributable amount (MDA) trigger level increased slightly to 9.7% (excluding the AT1 shortfall), including a slightly increased Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB) and the reconfirmed Pillar 2 requirement as part of the SREP requirements for 2023. The AT1 shortfall was 0.3% on 31 December 2022. The Dutch central bank (DNB) will increase the CCyB for Dutch exposures to 1% by 25 May 2023. Full implementation of the 2% CCyB rate is expected by Q2 2024, which will cause the MDA trigger level to increase by around 1.5%. This is already reflected in our 13% CET1 target under Basel IV. The bank remains committed to maintaining a prudent buffer in excess of its regulatory requirements at all times.\n\nDespite Basel III being the applicable regulatory framework, our primary metric for capital management purposes is a Basel IV CET1 target of 13%. This includes a management buffer on top of the capital requirements for SREP and Pillar 2 guidance. The European Commission's draft Basel IV proposal published in October 2021 expects Basel IV implementation in the EU by January 2025, with temporary measures mainly aimed at gradually phasing in the impact of the output floor. Reflecting our latest views on this proposal, the fully-loaded Basel IV CET1 ratio was estimated at around 16% on 31 December 2022. This was comfortably above the 13% target and the 15% threshold for considering share buybacks (subject to conditions and regulatory\n\nStandardised Approach, partly offset by model updates and changes in asset quality. The CET1 capital position increased mainly due to the net profit for 2022 (after dividend and AT1 coupon payments), partly offset by the permission granted by the ECB to repurchase shares totalling EUR 500 million. All capital ratios were in line with the bank's risk appetite and were comfortably above regulatory requirements.\n\nThe following chart shows the primary drivers of the Basel III capital ratios in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The Basel IV CET1 ratio at implementation is still subject to some remaining uncertainties, including data limitations, finalisation of the Basel IV regulations, management actions and other portfolio developments.\n\n## MREL\n\nSince 1 January 2022, our intermediate MREL target has been set at 27.1% of Basel III RWA, of which 26.6% must be met by own funds, subordinated instruments and senior non-preferred (SNP) notes. Subject to further SRB guidance, the MREL target for 1 January 2024 is set at 27.4%, of which 27.0% must be met by own funds, subordinated instruments and SNP notes. This includes the combined buffer requirement (CBR) of 4.0%. ABN AMRO aims to continue operating with a prudent buffer above the fully-loaded MREL requirements.\n\nIf ABN AMRO fails to meet CBR as part of its MREL requirement, the Single Resolution Board (SRB) has the power to prohibit or limit distributions of more than the Maximum Distributable Amount related to the minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (M-MDA). Based on own funds, subordinated instruments and SNP notes, MREL was 30.1% at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: 27.9%). In comparison with 31 December 2021, MREL increased mainly due to issuances of senior non-preferred instruments and the increase in CET1 capital, partly offset by RWA increases.\n\nThe reported MREL ratio excludes EUR 5.4 billion of grandfathered senior preferred liabilities currently eligible for MREL.\n\n## Developments impacting capital ratios in 2022\n\n## Common Equity Tier 1 capital\n\nCET1 capital increased in 2022, mainly reflecting the net profit for 2022 (after dividend and AT1 coupon payments), partly offset by the permission granted by the ECB to repurchase shares totalling EUR 500 million. The reported CET1 ratio of 15.2% under Basel III is considerably above the MDA trigger level of 9.7%.\n\n## Additional Tier 1\n\nA total of EUR 2.0 billion of AT1 instruments is currently outstanding. The AT1 instruments have triggers at the bank consolidated level (7.0% CET1) and solo level (5.125% CET1). If the CET1 ratio breaks through the trigger level, the AT1 is temporarily written down. ABN AMRO is comfortably above the trigger levels, with the bank consolidated CET1 ratio at 15.2% and the bank solo CET1 ratio at 14.8%. Available distributable items at 31 December 2022 amounted to EUR 19.8 billion (December 2021: EUR 18.8 billion).\n\n## Tier 2 capital\n\nThe fully-loaded total capital ratio of 20.9% decreased by 1.5 percentage points compared to 31 December 2021 (22.4%). This was mainly due to the RWA increases, partly offset by the increases in CET1 capital and Tier 2 capital. A SGD 0.75 billion T2 instrument was issued in July 2022 and a EUR 1 billion T2 instrument in November 2022. Per disclosure date of the Annual Report one of the Tier 2 capital instruments outstanding at 31 December 2022 was called for early redemption (XS1346254573 which was already deducted from Tier 2 capital per YE22) and one was announced to be called for early redemption (XS1586330604).\n\n## Senior non-preferred instruments\n\nA total of EUR 10.9 billion of senior non-preferred instruments is currently outstanding. The bank issued a total of EUR 4.75 billion of senior non-preferred notes during the year under review, including EUR 1 billion in January 2022, EUR 1.5 billion in June 2022 and EUR 2.25 billion in November 2022.\n\n## Risk-weighted assets\n\nTotal RWA rose to EUR 128.6 billion (31 December 2021: EUR 117.7 billion), predominantly driven by credit risk RWA. Credit risk RWA was up as a result of a new model risk add-on and migration of specific portfolios from Advanced IRB model to Foundation IRB and Standardised Approach, partly offset by model updates and changes in asset quality. Market risk RWA also increased over the year as a whole, but decreased in the second half of the year. CVA risk RWA (counterparty credit risk) rose slightly over the year, while operational risk RWA remained relatively stable.\n\n## Further information on share capital, dividend and capital instruments\n\n## Share capital\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the authorised share capital amounted to EUR 2,400 million, distributed as 2,200 million class A ordinary shares and 200 million class B ordinary shares. Class A and B ordinary shares have a nominal value of EUR 1.00 each.\n\nAt 31 December 2022, issued and paid-up capital amounted to EUR 897,521,916 (31 December 2021: 940,000,001) and consisted entirely of class A ordinary shares. Further information is provided in Note 33 Equity attributable to owners of the parent company in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements.\n\n## Dividend and share buybacks\n\nFrom 2021 onwards, the dividend payout has been set at 50% of reported net profit, after deduction of AT1 coupon payments and minority interests. Interim dividends will be considered at 40% of the reported H1 net profit, provided profit is expected to be sustainable throughout the year, at the discretion of the Board.",

        "page_content": "Based on this dividend policy, a net profit for 2022 of EUR 1,777 million (after AT1 and minority interests) and after the interim dividend of EUR 0.32 per share in 2022 (2021: no interim dividend), ABN AMRO proposes a final cash dividend for 2022 of EUR 0.67 per share (2021: EUR 0.61). This is equivalent to EUR 601 million (2021: EUR 570 million), based on the number of outstanding shares at year-end 2022. This will bring the total dividend for 2022 to EUR 0.99 per share (2021: EUR 0.61). The ex-dividend date will be 21 April 2023, while the record date will be 24 April 2023 and the dividend will be paid on 17 May 2023.\n\nOn 9 February 2022, in line with our capital framework, we announced our inaugural share  buyback programme of EUR 500 million. The programme commenced on 10 February and was completed on 11 May. Under the programme, 42,478,085 depositary receipts and ordinary\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nshares of ABN AMRO Bank N.V. were repurchased. Upon completion of the share buyback programme, outstanding number of depositary receipts and ordinary shares of ABN AMRO Bank N.V. is 897,521,916. The NLFI, being a majority shareholder, participated in the share buyback programme pro-rata to its holding of 56.3% of shares and depository receipts via off-market transactions, thereby maintaining its relative stake in the company.\n\nOur capital position remained strong, with a fully loaded Basel III CET1 ratio of 15.2% and a Basel IV CET1 ratio of around 16%. In line with our capital framework we have announced a share buyback programme of EUR 500 million to further optimise our capital position. This programme has commenced on 9 February and is expected to end no later than June 2023.\n\n## Capital instruments b\n\n|                                             |                             |               |                           | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2021   | 31 December 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------|---------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| (in millions)                               | ISIN/CUSIP                  | Maturity date | First possible  call date | Nominal  amount    | Carrying  amount   | Nominal  amount    | Carrying  amount   |\n| Tier 1 1                                    |                             |               |                           |                    |                    |                    |                    |\n| EUR 1,000 million 4.375% per annum          | XS2131567138                | Perpetual     | September 2025            | 1,000              | 991                | 1,000              | 993                |\n| EUR 1,000 million 4.75% per annum           | XS1693822634                | Perpetual     | September 2027            | 1,000              | 994                | 1,000              | 994                |\n| Total Tier 1 capital instruments            |                             |               |                           | 2,000              | 1,985              | 2,000              | 1,987              |\n| Tier 2                                      |                             |               |                           |                    |                    |                    |                    |\n| USD 113 million 7.75% per annum             | US00080QAD79 / USN0028HAP03 | May 2023      |                           | 106                | 103                | 100                | 101                |\n| USD 1,500 million 4.75% per annum           | US00080QAF28 / XS1264600310 | July 2025     |                           | 1,405              | 1,360              | 1,324              | 1,402              |\n| USD 1,000 million 4.8% per annum            | US0008DAL47 / XS1392917784  | April 2026    |                           | 937                | 868                | 883                | 901                |\n| EUR 1,000 million 2.875% per annum          | XS1346254573                | January 2028  | January 2023              | 1,000              | 1,027              | 1,000              | 1,035              |\n| USD 1,500 million 4.4% per annum            | XS1586330604                | March 2028    | March 2023                | 1,405              | 1,392              | 1,324              | 1,358              |\n| USD 300 million 5.6% per annum              | XS1385037558                | April 2031    |                           | 281                | 249                | 265                | 279                |\n| SGD 750 million 5.5% per annum              | XS2498035455                | October 2032  | July 2027                 | 524                | 520                |                    |                    |\n| EUR 1,000 million 5.125% per annum          | XS2558022591                | February 2033 | November 2027             | 1,000              | 979                |                    |                    |\n| USD 1,000 million 3.324% per annum          | XS2415308761 / US00084DAV29 | March 2037    | December 2031             | 937                | 778                | 883                | 876                |\n| EUR various smaller instruments             |                             | 2023 -2025    |                           | 14                 | 14                 | 14                 | 15                 |\n| USD 595 million 6.250% per annum            | XS0619547838                | April 2022    |                           |                    |                    | 525                | 537                |\n| EUR 1,000 million 7.125% per annum          | XS0802995166                | July 2022     |                           |                    |                    | 1,000              | 1,045              |\n| Total Tier 2 capital instruments            |                             |               |                           | 7,609              | 7,290              | 7,317              | 7,549              |\n| -

The leverage ratio requirements were amended by CRR2, which introduced a binding leverage ratio requirement of at least 3% and amended the requirements for calculating the exposure measure. The amendment includes the application of SA-CCR to clearing guarantees on derivative exposures. The leverage ratio increased to 5.2% as at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: 5.0%), mainly due to a decrease in on-balance sheet exposures, including those due to TLTRO repayments, and an increase in CET1 capital. The temporary\n\ncapital relief measure that exempts central bank reserves from the exposure measure was terminated on 31 March 2022. The exposure measure is reported to the Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) at the business line level and monitored closely in order to ensure the leverage ratio remains within the bank's risk appetite. The leverage ratio outlook takes account of business-specific plans, as well as macroeconomic conditions, regulatory developments and capital-related uncertainties. In the event of risk appetite breaches for the leverage ratio, the bank-wide escalation paths for capital and funding are followed.",

        "page_content": "## Business risk\n\n## Volatility of earnings\n\nBusiness risk is the risk that business earnings and franchise value declines and/or deviates from expectations because of uncertainty in business income or in expenses incurred to generate business income. ABN AMRO strives to preserve its business earnings, independently of (internal or external) developments. Business risk therefore needs to be managed in order to limit actual and forecasted volatility in business earnings.\n\nABN AMRO manages business risk by seeking to minimise the effect of unexpected internal and/or external developments. The key criteria for classifying a risk as a business risk are:\n\n- \u00c5 An unexpected event that leads to uncertainty in present or future business earnings and/or franchise value;\n- \u00c5 Changes in the drivers of future business earnings such as uncertainty in volumes, margins, fee and commission rates and/or business expenses.\n\n## Drivers of earnings volatility\n\nEarnings are affected by various internal and external factors, such as changes in client preferences, competition and regulation. In addition, earnings are affected by technical, societal, geopolitical and economic developments, such as the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Our risk assessments are based on the long-term uncertainty in expected business earnings and take into account internal and external developments, scenarios and market movements. When assessing the pressure from external factors contributing to an increase or decrease in the business risk, at least the following elements are considered:\n\n- \u00c5 The key macroeconomic variables within which the bank operates or will operate based on its main geographies. Examples of key variables include gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rates, interest rates, inflation rates and house price indices;\n- \u00c5 The competitive landscape and how it is likely to evolve, considering the activities of the bank's peers;\n- \u00c5 Expected growth in target markets, and the activities and plans of key competitors and new players (FinTech) in these target markets;\n- \u00c5 Overall trends in the market that may have an impact on performance and profitability. This should include, as a minimum, regulatory trends, technological trends and societal/demographic trends;\n- \u00c5 The contamination effects that risks may have on other risk types, and risks downstream or upstream in client supply chains that may have knock-on effects (this includes the impact of Covid-19, the war in Ukraine and Climate Change).\n\nWe currently consider the following developments to be the primary risks for future earnings: changing relation with client due to service/operating model, high investments in digital & data infrastructure, disintermediation in banking sector, increased regulatory and gatekeeper cost, competition of big tech, etc.\n\n## Business risk appetite\n\nThe thresholds are set at the expected one-year profit horizon and form the basis for a quantitative Red, Amber or Green (RAG) status. The qualitative RAG status is based on expert judgements, taking into account elements such as pressure from external factors and strategic objectives.\n\n## Monitoring of earnings drivers\n\nABN AMRO continually monitors and responds to the key external and internal factors and elements within these factors. The disclosure and monitoring of the business risk drivers is based, among other things, on the ERM report. ABN AMRO's business risk management framework is supported by the 3LoD model. The bank mitigates sensitivity to business risk drivers through discussions at senior management and board level that address developments in these drivers in an effective and timely manner. Business risk is also included in the capital buffer that is meant to safeguard our position in the case of extreme events.\n\n## Strategic risk\n\nWe consider strategic risk to be a part of business risk. It concerns the risk of internal and external events that may have an effect on ABN AMRO achieving its objectives and strategic goals. The bank's strategy and business risk are related. The strategy incorporates mitigation of unexpected events and changes in business risk drivers. Regular review of the strategy ensures alignment with developments in business risk. To ensure that the bank's strategy is pursued and the long-term strategic goals (financial and nonfinancial) are met, our business plans and budgets take these strategic goals into account.\n\n## Strategic equity investment risk\n\nAs part of business risk, strategic equity investment risk is the risk of deviation in the value of strategic equity investments. These investments are not fully consolidated in the bank's financial accounts, but are represented as an equity investment on the balance sheet. Investments related to clients and involving unlisted private equity or held for trading purposes are not considered to be strategic equity investments.",

        "page_content": "## Economic capital as a buffer for business risk\n\nEconomic capital is used to mitigate the negative effects of unexpected business risk events. The economic capital for business risk reflects the maximum downward deviation of actual versus expected net operating profit in one year, excluding any impact already covered by other risk types (e.g. impairments for credit risk).\n\nThe economic capital (EC) for business risk combines an EC based on forward looking scenarios with an EC based on historical revenue data. EC for both approaches is calculated and the maximum of the two is used. These scenarios determine the sensitivity of the client units' income to macroeconomic variables or industry performance indicators. This sensitivity is used to determine the volatility of income\n\n## CER materiality risk assessment\n\nIn 2022, we assessed the materiality of climate-related and environmental risk in relation to traditional risk types. The initial assessment was qualitative. For some risk types this was further substantiated quantitatively whereby a distinction between materiality in the short term (within 1 year), medium term (within 5 years) and long term (within 30 year) horizon was made, where possible. To ensure consistency across risk types, we looked at a set of pre-defined CER events, including climate-related risk events such as floods and drought (physical risk) and policy and technology development (transition risk), as well as environmental risk events such as water stress and biodiversity loss (physical risk) and policy and technology development (transition risk). The results for business risk are summarized below.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBusiness risk of climate and environmental risk (CER) events concerns the effect or potential effect of events on the operating result of the bank. The impact of climate transition risk on business risk has been assessed via the impact of CO2 reduction targets on lending volumes and revenues in the medium term and with a likelihood of once in 1-10 years in the Mortgages, CRE, Shipping and Oil & Gas portfolios. Based on the calculated revenues at risk, the impact is considered material in the medium term.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nfor each client unit, as well as any correlation between client units. Based on the individual volatilities, we use simulation to calculate bank-wide volatility. The model offers a methodology through which our model inputs and assumptions can be updated and tested efficiently on an annual basis. The model is sensitive to the projections for the negative and adverse scenarios and their probabilities.\n\nFurthermore, economic capital is also considered a buffer for strategic equity investment risk. This is the maximum downward deviation of a strategic equity investment's economic value from the current book value.\n\nClient portfolios with higher sensitivities to physical or transition risks (e.g. oil & gas) have relatively low loan volumes in the bank's book and therefore do not entail material business risks.\n\n## Climate physical risk\n\nWith regard to physical climate risk, individual CER events have historically not materially increased operating expenses, and are also not expected to do so in the future. The effect of a single physical or environmental event on the bank's operating income is currently assumed to be marginal.\n\n## Climate transition risk\n\nIn the medium to long term, material business risks could result from adjustments made to ABN AMRO's commercial or risk policies in order to reduce other CER-related risks and/or to decrease emissions within client portfolios in accordance with climate-related regulations.\n\n## Environmental risk\n\nEnvironmental risk events with a high probability and a material impact relate to transition risk factors such as regulations or technology and to environmental physical risk factors such as water stress, resource scarcity or pollution.\n\nWe manage material CER in business risk through the medium or longer-term portfolio choices we make regarding company strategy. Our assessments in the areas of long-term value creation and impact thinking help to reinforce these decisions.",

Sustainability risk management is a fundamental part of safeguarding a moderate risk profile and supporting\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nABN AMRO's strategic objectives. ESG factors relate to, but are not limited to the following:\n\n- \u00c5 Environmental: climate change, biodiversity loss, natural resources depletion and pollution. Climate-related and environmental risks (CER) can refer to both transition and physical risk and to so-called inside-out risks or outside-in risks (see box).\n- \u00c5 Social: substandard working conditions, forced labor and child labour, human trafficking, indigenous peoples' rights, privacy, animal welfare and public health.\n- \u00c5 Governance: corporate governance (e.g. remuneration, diversity and balancing the interests of stakeholders), corporate behaviour (e.g. corruption and bribery) and ethical business conduct.\n\nInside-out risks refer to the financial and non-financial risks that may occur when clients of the bank have an impact on people or the planet. This can be a direct impact, for example if a client causes and has to clean up water pollution, limiting the client's ability to live up to its contractual obligations with the bank.\n\nOutside-in risks refer to the financial and non-financial risks that may occur when climate-related or environmental factors have an impact on the bank's clients or portfolios. Outside-in risks are divided into transition and physical risks.\n\n- Transition risks are the financial and non-financial risks that result, directly or indirectly, from the process of adjusting to a lower-carbon and more environmentally sustainable economy (e.g. changes in regulations, consumer preferences and technology).\n- Physical risk refers to the financial and non-financial risk of a changing climate or environmental degradation. Physical risk can be acute, for example when it relates to extreme weather events, or chronic, relating to progressive shifts such as rising temperatures and biodiversity loss.",

It ensures that sustainability risk is properly identified, measured, managed, mitigated, monitored and reported on in line with the bank's risk appetite and in support of the bank's strategic objectives. These processes are supported by exclusions, statements and standards that underpin the way the bank executes its\n\n## Sustainability risk policy framework\n\n## Sustainability Risk Policy\n\n## Statements\n\n- Human rights\n- Climate change\n- Animal welfare\n\n## Sustainability risk standard with sector requirements\n\n- Agri-commodities\n- Animal protein\n- Energy\n- Metals & minerals\n- Manufacturing\n- Chemicals & pharma\n\nOur Exclusion List specifies the activities we exclude from our financial services because of their adverse ESG impact. Our Controversial Weapons List (CWL), in turn, specifies the companies that we exclude because of their involvement in controversial weapons. The CWL is in line with the ban on investments in cluster munition, as specified in the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, supplemented by the exclusion of companies involved in other controversial weapons, including white phosphorus. By regularly reviewing and updating the Exclusion List and the CWL, ABN AMRO ensures that it operates in line with its purpose, values and risk appetite. New developments and scientific insights within and outside the bank are taken into consideration.\n\nOur statements set out ABN AMRO's commitment, responsibilities and expectations for ourselves and for our business associates, including our clients, investee companies and suppliers, on three important themes: climate, human rights and animal welfare. The statements also describe the key activities we undertake to meet our responsibilities. Parts of the climate change statement have been replaced by the bank's climate strategy. In 2023 the statement will be updated to reflect this.\n\n- Real estate\n- Transportation\n- Financial institutions\n\nOur standards include requirements for managing sustainability risk in different processes (including engagement and classifying sustainability acceleration finance). We also have standards specifying the minimum ESG requirements for our corporate lending clients. In 2022, we further specified the general principles on which this Sustainability Risk Standard (including sector requirements) and our client due diligence is built. We also strengthened this standard, especially with regard to climate and environment-related risks, transition and physical risks, and human rights risks. In addition, we have a standard applying specifically to corporate clients with links to defence activities.\n\n## Standards\n\n- Sustainability Risk Standard for Finance\n- Sustainability Risk Standard for Engagement\n- Sustainability Risk Standard for Defence\n- Sustainability Acceleration Standard\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsustainability risk management.

This means that the committee maintains oversight on sustainability risk through the enterprise risk management report (containing the status of adherence to the bank's Risk Appetite Statement) and is responsible for approval of sustainability risk issues. In 2022, the GRC discussed and approved the development of the climate plan, which was published in December 2022, in response to the increasing climate transition risk and in line with the sustainability pillar in the bank's strategy.\n\nA dedicated Sustainability Risk team within the Central Risk Management department is responsible for the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsustainability risk management framework and acts as the second line of defence. Central Risk Management also monitors the implementation of the sustainable finance regulations throughout the bank. Besides the Executive Board and the Group Risk Committee, various other committees are increasingly involved in the management of sustainability risk:\n\n- \u00c5 Business Risk Committees (BRC) for oversight on sustainability risk within the specific business lines and approval of business line-specific sustainability risk issues (e.g. scenario analysis);\n- \u00c5 Engagement Advisory Committee (EAC) for oversight on client engagement;\n- \u00c5 Group Sustainability Committee (GSC) for internal advice on sustainability matters affecting the bank and the business environment;\n- \u00c5 Scenario Analysis and Stress-test Committee (SSC) for oversight on climate-related and environmental risks scenario analyses and stress testing;\n- \u00c5 Central Credit Committee (CCC) for oversight on the application of the sustainability risk policy framework in credit decisions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability risk management framework\n\nSustainability risk, including climate-related and environmental risk, is managed in line with the bank's enterprise risk management cycle. Sustainability risks identified in our business environment are measured to inform risk management and strategic decision-making. Based on insights gained, we develop appropriate risk response measures, including limits and checkpoints in the risk appetite, for material risks. Sustainability risk is also included in risk monitoring and reporting tools such as the enterprise risk management (ERM) report.\n\n## Sustainability risk & business strategy\n\nSustainability risk management and the bank's strategy, in particular the sustainability pillar, go hand in hand. On the one hand, insights into sustainability risks inform strategic decision-making. For example, the bank's carbon reduction targets, which are at the core of our sustainability strategy, also mitigate the reputational risk and focus in the first wave on portfolios that were identified as having the highest level of transition risk. Similarly, decisions to engage with one or more clients to accelerate the sustainability shift are informed by client-level risk identification and measurement that is part of client acceptance and credit provisioning processes. Decisions to reduce, maintain or grow in certain portfolios are also informed by insights into sustainability risks.\n\nThe sustainability risk policy framework is updated regularly, for example to ensure that we do not onboard any clients that would prevent us from achieving our strategic commitments or that conflict with our commitment to standards such as the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights or OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. Below is an overview of key elements and the latest developments in each step of the enterprise risk management cycle. For the sustainability pillar in the bank's strategy, please refer to the Sustainability section in the Strategy, Value Creation and Performance chapter.\n\n## Sustainability risk identification\n\nThe risk identification process for sustainability risk takes place at multiple levels. The process includes but is not limited to sector and country sustainability risk classifications and sustainability risk heatmapping. These tools also feed into bank-wide risk identification processes such as the risk event register (see below), into which sustainability risk is integrated.\n\n## Sector and country classification\n\nThe sector and country risk classification categorises sectors and countries into low, medium or high risk from a sustainability perspective and includes climate-related,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nenvironmental (ecosystem dependencies), social and governance-related aspects. 'High risk' from a sustainability perspective means there is an inherent sustainability risk associated with the client's sector or country of operation. For example, social risks are considered higher in sectors such as mining and leisure. Similarly, governance risks are considered higher in countries with limited rule of law. While this implies that we need more robust due diligence procedures for that particular client, it does not mean that ABN AMRO wants to refrain from doing business with these clients. On the contrary, we use this as an opportunity to engage with a client in the transition towards sustainability.\n\nThe sector classification takes into account the results of the bank's climate risk heatmap and the environmental risk heatmap (see below), as well as expert opinion on human rights risks for sectors. The country ratings are based on data provided by Sustainalytics. Both ratings are updated periodically to reflect international and sector developments. After approval by the Group Risk Committee, the rating is incorporated into our Client Assessment on Sustainability tool (CASY NextGen, see Credit Risk section) and published in our Sustainability Risk Policy Framework.\n\n## Climate and environmental risk heatmaps\n\nHeatmaps are used to scan ABN AMRO's lending portfolio on sector sensitivity and vulnerability to climate and environmental risk. This results in tools that identify climate and environmental risk hotspots in our corporate lending portfolio. These tools are used to determine priority sectors for performing portfolio scenario analyses so as to assess the magnitude of the impact on selected risk types and to select portfolios for the first wave of sectors that we cover with our Climate Strategy (see the Strategy, Value Creation and Performance chapter). The heatmap methodology developed in 2021 was used, with adjustments, for the 2022 climate risk and environmental risk heatmaps.\n\nAs formal risk identification tools, the heatmaps also contribute to the risk identification process, such as the Risk Event Register (RER), which includes events such as the introduction of strict environmental or climate regulations, real estate value corrections due to physical climate risk and environmental degradation (e.g. biodiversity loss). The events in the RER were subsequently included in the scenarios for expected credit loss calculations, for example in the negative planning scenario, which included assumptions on a disruptive transition that would impact the entire economy, and both the baseline and the negative scenario included assumptions on the impact nitrogen regulations in the Netherlands would have on GDP.",

        "page_content": "## CER materiality assessment\n\nWithin our risk taxonomy, sustainability risk is both a stand-alone risk type and a driver of other risk types. In 2022, we assessed the materiality of climate-related and environmental risk in relation to the following traditional risk types: credit risk, market risk, operational (non-financial) risk (including reputational, legal and compliance risk), liquidity risk and business risk. The initial assessment was qualitative and was then further substantiated quantitatively, where possible.\n\nThe bank's risk materiality framework used in the annual update of the risk taxonomy has been adjusted to make it more suitable for performing this assessment. The adjustments related primarily to the indicators and thresholds for the materiality of non-financial impact, aligning the framework more directly with the bank's strategy of 'Banking for better, for generations to come' and with the corresponding key performance indicators. The concept of double materiality has also been incorporated to signal that both a negative and a positive impact on society and the environment can be material. Where\n\npossible, a distinction between materiality in the short term (within 1 year), medium term (within 5 years) and long term (within 30 years) has also been included.\n\nTo ensure consistency across risk types, each risk type owner looked at a set of pre-defined CER events, based on the events suggested in the ECB Guide on CER, and assessed the impact of one or more of the most relevant events for their risk type. These included climate-related risk events such as floods and drought (physical risk) and policy and technology development (transition risk), as well as environmental risk events such as water stress and biodiversity loss (physical risk) and policy and technology development (transition risk). For each risk type, a tailormade methodology was used to substantiate how and within what timeframe these events drive or have a material impact on their risk type. See the table below for the initial conclusions. More information on the methodologies is provided in the respective risk type sections. In 2023, the assessments will be updated and improved to make them more robust and comprehensive, and allow the bank to take risk mitigation action based on the outcomes.\n\n## Materiality Assessment Table\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                                  | Climate Risk   | Climate Risk    | Environmental Risk   | Environmental Risk   |\n|----------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Risk Type                        | Physical risk  | Transition Risk | Physical risk        | Transition risk      |\n| Credit Risk                      |                |                 |                      |                      |\n| Market risk in the trading book  |                |                 |                      |                      |\n| Market risk in the banking book  |                |                 |                      |                      |\n| Operational (Non-financial) risk |                |                 |                      |                      |\n| Liquidity risk                   |                |                 |                      |                      |\n| Business risk                    |                |                 |                      |                      |\n\nCheck indicates that risk is material. Where there is no check, the risk is assessed as not material.\n\n## Sustainability risk measurement\n\nVarious tools are used to measure sustainability risk at different levels:\n\n- \u00c5 At bank level: Sustainability risk elements are included in the internal stress testing scenarios and in the 2022 EBA Climate Stress Test, as mentioned in the Risk framework section. In addition, the bank-wide impact of climate-related and environmental risk on traditional risk types was measured in 2022 using a qualitative and quantitative CER materiality assessment, as explained below and in the risk type sections.\n- \u00c5 At portfolio level: CER scenario analysis is used to measure the impact of sustainability risk in specific\n\nportfolios. In this chapter, you can read more on the portfolio level analysis.\n\n- \u00c5 At client level: Sustainability risk is measured using the Client Assessment on Sustainability tool (CASY NextGen) as part of the credit decisioning process. Please refer to the Credit risk management section for more information on this process.\n\n## Portfolio scenario analysis\n\nABN AMRO uses portfolio scenario analysis as one of the tools for understanding the impact of sustainability risk, particularly climate-related and environmental risk, on traditional risk types (e.g. credit risk and business risk) in specific sectors, using various climate scenarios. In 2021 this",

        "page_content": "was done in four priority portfolios, which were selected based on the 2020 climate risk heatmap: energy, shipping, commercial real estate and residential real estate. In 2022 the commercial and residential real estate scenario analyses were updated and extended to include the risk events heat stress and wildfires, in addition to flooding and drought. In line with the ECB's expectations regarding the management of CER, and based on the lessons learned in 2021, the process of CER scenario analysis was further improved and formalised in the bank's Sustainability risk policy framework and enterprise risk management framework in 2022. Following this improved process, we selected four additional portfolios to start the CER scenario analysis: arable farming, livestock farming, manufacturing and freight transport by road. The selection of these sectors was based on considerations related to:\n\n- \u00c5 sensitivity of the portfolios to CER according to the 2021 climate risk heatmap, the insights of the 2022 environmental risk heatmap and/or the climate stress tests;\n- \u00c5 strategic importance of the portfolio demonstrated by the size of the exposure, declared strategic focus and/or development in the dynamic balance sheet that was used in the Climate Stress Test;\n- \u00c5 viability of an analysis in the portfolio, based on portfolio characteristics, data availability and alignment with other business-as-usual processes within the bank;\n- \u00c5 stakeholder expectations and/or other developments in the business environment of the portfolio.\n\nAnalysis frameworks were developed for the additional portfolios in 2022. These frameworks define the exact scope of the analysis and the scenarios to be applied, as well as the potential transmission channels to investigate. The frameworks also define which strategy or risk management processes could potentially be informed by the outcomes of the analysis; in other words, they define the purpose of the analyses. The results of these scenario analyses are expected in 2023.\n\n## Sustainability risk response\n\nTo ensure that sustainability risk is managed in line with the bank's risk appetite and strategy, mitigating actions are defined at bank, portfolio and client levels for risks identified as material.\n\nAt bank level, mitigating actions are as follows:\n\n- \u00c5 Exclusion of some specific sectors and subsectors from lending products, as stated in the bank's Exclusion List and Controversial Weapons List;\n- \u00c5 Strict requirements for corporate lending under the sustainability risk standard with sector requirements;\n- \u00c5 Sustainability risk considerations included in the bank's credit risk and business risk policies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt portfolio level, thematic engagement is used as a mitigating action for risks that affect entire portfolios or large numbers of clients within a portfolio in the same way. Overseen by the Engagement Advisory Committee, the first line develops and executes a thematic engagement plan with clear time-bound targets, supported and challenged by the second line where needed. In 2022, thematic engagement focused on improving energy efficiency of vessels in the shipping portfolio (as a follow up from the 2021 scenario analysis), on improving management practices of clients in various sectors to prevent exploitation of migrant workers, and on improving supply chain due diligence practices of clients with supply chains in the Xinjiang region in China.\n\nIndividual engagement is used as a mitigating action at client level. Individual engagement focuses primarily on remediation of breaches with the sustainability risk policy framework.\n\n## Sustainability risk appetite\n\nRisk response may also involve the development, review and/or implementation of risk appetite limits and checkpoints at bank and client unit/functions levels. Our strategic risk appetite statement (SRAS) references the alignment of our portfolio with the Paris Climate Agreement. The sustainability risk appetite is set using indicators that address all ESG aspects of sustainability and both the inside-out and outside-in perspectives of sustainability risk at bank and client unit/functions levels. The risk indicators have both quantitative and qualitative elements. The latter reflects the fact that the data currently available in this relatively new risk category is still insufficient.\n\nIn some cases, new KRIs are included in the risk appetite for monitoring purposes only. Limits and checkpoints are planned to be included after a period of monitoring, when more data is available or when the impact can be assessed more accurately. Monitoring allows us to gather relevant data that can inform the process of setting checkpoints and limits, and also to increase transparency on risk developments over time. For example, the key risk indicator on the carbon footprint in our lending and investment portfolios was still only being monitored in 2022, but checkpoints and limits will be set for this indicator in 2023, based on data gathered and informed by the climate strategy presented in December 2022.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2",

In time, limits and checkpoints will be developed for such KRIs as well.\n\n## Risk Appetite\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                     | Indicator                                                                | Checkpoint/limits   | Monitoring only   |\n|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| Sustainability risk | Percentage of clients requiring engagement on ESG                        |                     |                   |\n|                     | Sustainable and Acceleration  Standard volume change                     |                     |                   |\n| Climate risk        | Change in carbon footprint in lending and investment portfolio           |                     |                   |\n|                     | Data quality of financed emissions                                       |                     |                   |\n| Environmental risk  | Relative exposure in sectors sensitive to physical environmental risks   |                     |                   |\n|                     | Relative exposure in sectors sensitive to transition environmental risks |                     |                   |\n| Human rights risk   | Strength of human rights risk management                                 |                     |                   |\n\n## Sustainability risk monitoring and reporting\n\nTo ensure that an identified sustainability risk remains within the approved risk appetite limits and checkpoints, we monitor sustainability risk, including environmental and climate-related risks, at a bank-wide and client unit/ functions level. Sustainability risk at bank level is monitored and reported to the GRC and to the Executive Board in the enterprise risk management (ERM) report. At a client unit level, sustainability risk is monitored and reported through the business risk reports to the respective business risk committees.\n\nA dedicated risk register has been developed for human rights risks. This includes all kinds of human rights risks we can be connected to, in any capacity, and helps us record and aggregate our observations on these risks over time. The risk register feeds into our enterprise risk management process and results in more robust governance and more involvement from senior management. Human rights risks are managed across a range of departments within the bank.\n\n## Environmental and climate risk heatmaps\n\nHeatmaps are used to scan ABN AMRO's corporate lending portfolio on sector sensitivity and vulnerability to climate and environmental risk, with a further distinction between transition and physical risks.\n\nThe scope of both analyses is identical to the scope of the climate heatmap disclosed in 2021, i.e. carbon-intensive sectors (NACE A-H and L). Underlying sub-sectors are selected, based on significant exposure or relative high sensitivity, according to previous heatmaps. Given this condition of significant exposure, heatmaps are tailored to the ABN AMRO portfolio and assess some sectors in more detail than others. The figures below show the aggregated sensitivity score for each sector on NACE level 1. The next section shows the moderate to high sensitivity scores of the climate and environmental heatmaps on a more granular level.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

The climate heatmap uses data on scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emission intensity as input for transition risk sensitivity. For the environmental heatmap, transition risk sensitivity is partly determined by data on biodiversity loss resulting from the impact of sub-sectors and their supply chains on land use, air pollution and water pollution. This dataset is also the basis of our Impact Report. For physical risk, both heatmaps use ENCORE's scientific materiality assessment of the ecosystem service dependency of sub-sectors, refined by our internal experts to account for our context as a bank based in Northwest Europe.\n\n## Environmental risk heatmap\n\nThe environmental risk heatmap focusses on sector sensitivity and vulnerability to physical environmental risk (i.e. dependencies on nature, arising when natural systems are compromised due to the impact of climate events, geological events or changes in ecosystem equilibria) and transition environmental risks (i.e. resulting from\n\n## Environmental Risk Heatmap\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Sub-sector  (incl NACE sector letter)                              | EUR million   | Sensitivity to  transition risk   | Sensitivity to  physical risk   | Sub-sector  (incl.

Environmental risks are less concentrated in particular sectors, but there are risk drivers that score highly across our portfolio.\n\nFor environmental transition risk, we explored whether sensitivities in terms of current policies and scandals, future prospects for reducing biodiversity impacts and market availability of alternative products were concentrated in particular drivers of biodiversity loss. Policies, controversies and management actions and technologies linked to air pollution (18-23%), land use (7-13%) and overextraction (4-6%) were the most common bank-wide drivers for transition risk. For physical risk, the ecosystem services water (32%; 55%) and flood protection (27; 51%) were found most relevant for, respectively, the own operation and supply chains of the analysed sub-sectors.",

Given that sensitivities are based on multiple indicators, sub-sectors can have similar risk labels, but for different reasons. Transition risk is determined by GHG emission intensity, the feasibility of decarbonisation pathways and market conditions. Characteristics relevant for physical risk include assets, energy use, labour productivity, ecosystem service dependency in own operations and the supply chain, transportation routes and climate-sensitivity of demand.\n\n## Climate Risk Heatmap\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 Some sub-sectors deviate from NACE.

These are categorized as 'acute' if arising from extreme events, such as droughts, floods and storms, and 'chronic' if they are related to progressive shifts, such as increasing temperatures and water stress. While impact from environmental degradation, such as air, water and land pollution, biodiversity loss and deforestation also qualifies as physical risk, it is not in scope of this table.\n\nThe assessment whether an exposure is sensitive to the impact of climate events is solely based on the location of the collateral or, if the loan is not collateralised by immovable property, of the location of the counterparty. For flooding risk in the Netherlands, data were obtained from the Climate Impact Atlas of Climate Adaptation Services (CAS). But the evaluation was done per sub-sovereign region (EU NUTS3 or similar). All counterparties in a region where more than 10% of the locations are exposed to a potential flood of more than half meter are marked as exposed to acute- physical climate risk. This provides a conservative estimate of the exposure sensitive to flooding risk, which we seek to improve in the future. For all other risk hazards and for regions outside the Netherlands, we used scores for individual hazards per sub-sovereign region, provided Moody's ESG Solutions. If any of the individual hazard scores is high or red flag, all exposures in that region are reported as sensitive to chronic (water stress and heat stress) or acute (floods, hurricanes & typhoons, wildfires, sea level rise) physical risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNot specified\n\nThe agriculture sector has a medium high sensitivity to physical risk. Furthermore a relatively large share of our exposure to this sector is in the north and east of the country, regions sensitive to water stress, i.e. the balance between renewable water supply and total water withdrawals.\n\n## GHG monitoring\n\nIn line with the bank's climate objectives and strategic risk appetite on the alignment of our portfolio with the Paris Agreement and the Net Zero Banking Alliance, we measure the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of our activities. This includes the direct (scope 1 and 2 and partly scope 3) emissions of our own operations and the indirect emissions in our lending and client assets portfolios. In doing so, we focus on GHG/carbon-intensive sectors in particular, and assess the alignment of certain GHG-intensive portfolios with Paris and net zero emissions scenarios.",

Scoping is based on GHG Protocol.\n- 4 Based on PCAF methodology, using total assets as the denominator and gross carrying amount as attribution metric.\n- 5 ABN AMRO is continuously working on improving the methodology and data quality of the GHG emissions. The figures of 2021 have been updated correspondingly.\n- 6 Calculation based on PCAF methodology listed companies, using Enterprise value including cash as the denominator. The scope of the calculation includes equities and corporate bonds, both direct and indirect in funds.\n\nOur scope 3 emissions from own operations decreased due to lower emissions for IT (off-premises data centers and Software-as-a-Service). Financed emissions in our lending portfolio also decreased; further details are provided below.\n\nEmissions for assets under management decreased in line with the total volume of managed assets. Emissions per EUR 1 million invested were approximately the same as at 31 December 2021.\n\n## GHG Financed Emissions\n\n|                                           | 31 December 2022 31 December 2021

The lending portfolio's emissions are calculated in accordance with the principles set by the Partnership Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF). In line with the PCAF Financed Emissions Standard published in 2020, we extended our scope during the year by including corporate bonds, equity-accounted investments and motor vehicle loans. Based on the new version of the standard introduced in December 2022, which includes a method for government bonds, we will review and, if possible, extend the scope further.\n\nWe also improved the average data quality score, especially for residential mortgages and corporate loans . For corporate loans, we extended the use of company-level emissions data\n\nto our shipping and energy clients, thereby reducing the use of average carbon intensities per sector. For residential mortgages and commercial real estate, we used carbon intensities per square metre by energy label and type of object. To allow for comparison of figures with previous periods, the reported emissions at 31 December 2021 were updated and also reflect the current scope and data quality score.\n\nThe use of more granular data resulted in an upward revision of estimated emissions for residential mortgages. In comparison with 31 December 2021, emissions were lower, despite the growth of the loan book. This reflects the increased proportion of properties with energy label A or higher. More details on the financed emissions in our corporate loans portfolio are provided below.\n\n## Corporate loans in sectors contributing highly to climate change\n\n|                                                                       | 31 December 2022          | 31 December 2022             | 31 December 2022                 | 31 December 2022             | 31 December 2022             | 31 December 2021               | 31 December 2021                   | 31 December 2021             |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| (in millions)                                                         | Gross  carrying  amount 3 | - of which  carbon-  related | GHG   emissions   (in ktons CO2) | - of which  carbon-  related | Gross  carrying  amount 3, 4 | - of which  carbon-re- lated 4 | GHG   emissions   (in ktons CO2) 4 | - of which  carbon-  related |\n| Agriculture, forestry and fishing                                     | 7,222                     |                              | 5,665                            |                              | 7,301                        |                                | 5,823                              |                              |\n| Mining and quarrying                                                  | 2,536                     | 2,361                        | 2,076                            | 2,027                        | 2,704                        | 2,446                          | 2,627                              | 2,367                        |\n| Manufacturing                                                         | 7,667                     | 252                          | 776                              | 63                           | 7,609                        | 311                            | 724                                | 53                           |\n| Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply                   | 1,585                     | 262                          | 851                              | 490                          | 2,203                        | 138                            | 1,193                              | 449                          |\n| Water supply;

In the worst-case scenario, the collateral is not worth restoring. Another point of preliminary research is based on a group of potential clients who may not be (fully) able to cover the costs of climate-related risks if they occur.\n\nBased on the climate risk analysis performed in 2022, ABN AMRO gained more awareness and an updated overview of our mortgage portfolio with respect to climate risks. The data quality is expected to improve continuously over the coming years. ABN AMRO is working together with other banks on a market standard approach for climate risk in real estate.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2",

        "page_content": "## Scenario analysis - real estate\n\nIn 2022, the analysis of physical climate risk in real estate (both residential and commercial) was updated and improved. For example, the scope of the analysis was expanded so that, as well as flood and drought risk, it now also includes the risk of wildfires and heat stress. The scenario analysis methodology was also officially validated, thus allowing it to be used for portfolio credit analyses, stress testing and ICAAP purposes.\n\nAn additional study was also carried out, in collaboration with Group Economics, into the effects of flood risk and foundation risk on pricing in the residential real estate market. This study shows that these climate risks are generally not yet reflected in the market price. The results of this study are used in the scenario analyses, with a distinction being made between the direct effect (i.e. cost of damage) and the indirect effect (i.e. perception effect) of physical risks.\n\n## Scenario choice and data\n\nFoundation risk is an important driver of physical climate risk in the Dutch residential real estate market. Property-specific data on foundation risk is available from Kennis Centrum Aanpak Funderingsproblematiek (KCAF), a leading party in the Netherlands that generates granular data on this risk. This data is also included in property valuation reports.\n\nData on the other drivers of physical climate risk assessed (flooding, wildfires and heat stress) are obtained from Climate Adaptation Services (CAS), which provides data at a highly granular level for all of the Netherlands. The CAS data is partly based on the WH scenario until 2050 from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI). This scenario marks the worst-case outcome for climate change in the Netherlands and closely aligns with the NGFS current policies scenario.\n\nWildfires in the Netherlands are regularly caused by human actions. However, the number of wildfires is increasing due to drought associated with climate change. The damage can be enormous, as in the case of the fire in De Peel in 2020. The wildfire map has been developed by WENR and Deltares and takes account of various factors, including precipitation deficit, groundwater level, soil type and recreational pressure.\n\nAccording to Witteveen+Bos, an increasing part of the Netherlands will face heat stress, i.e. a perceived temperature higher than 41 degrees Celsius, in the future. Heat stress does not directly cause physical damage to homes, but it does have an impact on human health and productivity and thus on GDP. As this could lead to client preferences for type of homes and location changing, ABN AMRO has mapped out this risk as well.",

Almost all properties with foundation problems are built on peat soil and were built before 1970. As foundation risk is a slowly progressing risk, the deterioration caused by foundation problems could translate into a future lower market value and will thus impact LGD and consequently RWA. The repair costs for an average house could be EUR 80,000 - EUR 100,000.\n\n## Flooding - RRE\n\nThe map on the left shows all the properties in our RRE portfolio in the Netherlands and their risk of flooding for the next 28 years.\n\nIn the scenario analysis, the probabilities of flooding are grouped into 4 buckets: no risk, low risk, medium risk and high risk. Areas around rivers have the highest risk of flooding, with an estimated probability of 1/30 per year until 2050. The damage that can be caused by flood is estimated at EUR 1,250 per square meter in the scenario analysis. This amount depends on the height of the water.\n\n## Wildfires - RRE\n\nThe map on the left shows all the properties in our RRE portfolio in the Netherlands and the risk of wildfires in the next 28 years.\n\nAccording to Statistics Netherlands (CBS), there were twice as many wildfires caused by drought in the Netherlands in 2018 compared to the years before. As experienced in Southern and Eastern Europe in 2021, there are more uncontrollable fires due to drier soil and rising temperatures.\n\nIn the scenario analysis, the probabilities of wildfires are grouped into 4 buckets: no risk, low risk, medium risk and high risk. The possible estimated damage caused by wildfire in the scenario analysis is equal to the rebuild value.\n\n## Heat stress - RRE\n\nThe map on the left shows all the properties in our RRE portfolio in the Netherlands and the expected heat stress in 2050.\n\nIn the scenario analysis, the probabilities of heatstress are again grouped into 4 buckets: no risk, low risk, medium risk and high risk. High heat stress is experienced when the perceived temperature rises beyond 42\u00b0C. It is expected that especially the Southern part of the Netherlands will experience heat stress. Heat stress depends on the type of home and is reduced by preventing sunlight from shining directly into the home. Measures such as a sunblinds, shade provided by trees, floor cooling and water supplies mitigate this. For heat stress, no damage on the property is considered in the scenario analyses.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Insights into our Risk management governance processes and control systems for 2022.\n- B. Factors that potentially impact ABN AMRO's current business model.\n- C. Areas at risk of non-compliance with regulations and heightened regulatory scrutiny.\n- D. Areas of attention for ABN AMRO identified by senior management.\n\n## Section A: Risk Management Governance\n\nABN AMRO's internal risk management and control process is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives in the following categories:\n\n- \u00c5 Strategic and business objectives\n- \u00c5 Compliance with laws, regulations and internal policies\n- \u00c5 Reliability of financial and non-financial information\n- \u00c5 Effectiveness and efficiency of operations; and\n- \u00c5 Safeguarding of assets, and identification and management of liabilities\n\nABN AMRO's first and second lines of defence perform a variety of tests and controls - risk assessments, stress tests, and evaluations on effectiveness of controls on risk management and control systems. The results are reported in formal risk reports and discussed at senior management level.\n\nABN AMRO continuously upgrades the effectiveness of its risk control framework via the Risk Management Foundation Plan. More attention is also being paid to responding to the factors that affect the effectiveness of the risk control framework, such as clarity, achievability and engagement.\n\nGroup Audit, as the third line of defence, evaluates the design and effectiveness of ABN AMRO's governance, as well as its Risk Management and Control Systems. In 2022, the Audit reports were discussed with relevant Executive Committee members. Group Audit attended the Executive Board and/or Executive Committee meetings every quarter to discuss the Quarterly Audit Opinions.\n\nLast year, the evaluation of the adequacy of ABN AMRO's internal risk management and control systems was regularly discussed with the Audit Committee, the Risk & Capital Committee and the full Supervisory Board.\n\nOn an annual basis the Executive Board makes the following Statements and provides clear substantiation regarding the internal risk management and control systems. This is always done in accordance with ABN AMRO's moderate risk profile (in compliance with best practice provision 1.4.3 of the Corporate Governance Code and based on ABN AMRO's risk management processes):\n\n- \u00c5 An integral part of the Integrated Annual Report 2022 is the Executive Board's Report, which provides insight into any failings in the effectiveness of the Internal Risk Management and Control Systems (best practice 1.4.3.i);\n- \u00c5 The internal risk management and control systems provide reasonable assurance that the financial reporting for 2022 does not contain any material inaccuracies (best practice 1.4.3.ii);\n- \u00c5 Based on the current situation, preparation of the financial reporting for 2022 on a going-concern basis is justified (best practice 1.4.3.iii). For further information, please refer to Note 1 Accounting policies in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements;\n- \u00c5 The Executive Board's report states those material risks and uncertainties that may affect ABN AMRO's continuity for the 12-month period following the preparation of this report (best practice 1.4.3.iv);\n- \u00c5 The Executive Board's report outlines the bank's values, and how they are incorporated into the activities of the bank and its affiliated enterprises. It discusses the bank's compliance with the Code of Conduct (best practice 2.5.4).\n\nFor more information, please refer to the Risk framework section.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Section B: Factors that potentially impact ABN AMRO's current business model\n\nThe Executive Board has identified the following factors with potential impact on ABN AMRO's business model:\n\n- \u00c5 Ongoing Russian-Ukrainian war\n- \u00c5 Pressure on business volumes, margins and costs\n- \u00c5 General weaknesses in economies where we or our clients do business\n- \u00c5 Ongoing challenges to comply with a fast-changing regulatory landscape\n- \u00c5 Other significant corporate developments\n\n## Ongoing Russian-Ukrainian war\n\nThe global headline issue in 2022 was the RussianUkrainian war, which created challenges to ABN AMRO's business model and its clients. In particular, economic activity slowed in the Netherlands, as well as in countries where we and our clients do business. There is a risk of a future recession in these business-relevant economies such as those in Western countries, caused by high inflation linked to high energy prices. Separately, although ABN AMRO's business continuity measures proved effective in the face of the war, there is increased risk of cyber warfare, including the use of destructive malware. ABN AMRO, as all other banks, must also cope with the intensified sanctions regime as a result of the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian war.\n\n## Pressures on business volumes, margins and costs\n\nAlthough fee income grew in line with strategic targets for 2022, business risks for fees and commissions remain relevant. Competition in key markets, for instance pressure on the bank's market share in mortgages, increase the risk of underachieving income targets. Meanwhile cost discipline remains paramount for ABN AMRO to meet its cost targets but this also constrains expenditure and investments necessary for growth.\n\nABN AMRO faces a challenging regulatory environment, characterised by the following:\n\n- \u00c5 There is an ongoing strain to comply with the regulatory environment that is characterised by many new laws and regulations, especially in the area of sustainable financing, privacy and digital resilience as well as more detailed disclosure requirements for non-financial risks. The unintended effects of such a demanding environment are an accumulation of change and cost pressure on ABN AMRO.\n- \u00c5 ABN AMRO has defined sustainability as one of its strategic pillars. This means developments in the area of sustainability are expected to provide both opportunities and challenges for the bank. For example, ABN AMRO expects to benefit from the transition to the carbonneutral economy as it supports its clients with advice and financing solutions for the necessary investments.\n- \u00c5 However, sustainability creates exposure to a wide range of reputational, legal and litigation risks. In addition to claims around greenwashing (i.e. false or misleading\n\nstatements about the sustainability profile of products or services), there is a threat of legal action from environmental activists potentially dissatisfied with ABN AMRO's climate action plan. Future legal ramifications are also conceivable where clients underperform on sustainability criteria and the bank decides to terminate these relationships.\n\n- \u00c5 Sustainable Finance Regulations and the bank's Climate Plan also create the need for new and detailed information on the bank's clients with respect to climate and environmental risks. ABN AMRO is therefore confronted with increasing data needs, manual and/or external data collection, and moving definitions of standards and metrics when meeting Climate and Environmental disclosures. At the same time, sustainability experts are in short supply.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the Sustainability risk section.\n\n## Other significant corporate developments\n\nThe Executive Board took further steps to shape a futureproof bank by successfully implementing the New Service Model, winding down non-core activities, closing branches in the Netherlands and transitioning to a simplified operating model.\n\n## Section C: Areas with a risk of non-compliance with regulations and heightened regulatory scrutiny\n\nEnsuring demonstrable compliance requires robust risk governance, enhanced data management and a substantial share of the bank's resources. Despite efforts to be compliant with laws and regulations, ABN AMRO does not always live up to its own expectations as well as those set out by regulators, clients and society at large. Failing to meet these expectations may lead to reputational damage, fines, claims and changes in ABN AMRO's income, costs or capital basis, all of which could endanger its long-term goals. The main areas with a risk of non-compliance with regulations and heightened regulatory scrutiny are described below. Updates on the progress of remediation programmes are also provided.\n\n- H Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF), including Customer Due Diligence/ Know Your Client. ABN AMRO is executing remediation programmes in the areas in Personal & Business Banking, Commercial Banking and International Card Services (ICS). This is supported by a programme to improve the quality of client files. ABN AMRO also delivered on the major milestones for Personal & Business Banking and Commercial Banking at the end of 2022 and aims to complete its AML remediation programmes in 2023.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the Performance section in the Strategy, value creation & performance chapter.",

        "page_content": "- \u00c5 Duty of care towards the bank's clients. The goals of ABN AMRO and the expectations of external stakeholders - including clients, politicians and media - continue to be high regarding the bank's duty of care. In 2022, ABN AMRO successfully finalised its bank-wide Duty of Care Programme and worked on embedding the same in regular governance and processes.\n\nABN AMRO has also intensified efforts to adapt to the changing fraud landscape and protect its clients and itself against fraud. Key actions include continuously improving the internal fraud risk management framework with more vigorous controls. Furthermore, ABN AMRO continued its fraud awareness campaigns and collaborations with public and private partners. This should improve the digital resilience of our clients.\n\n- \u00c5 Variable interest rates. ABN AMRO is seeing an increased risk of claims and liability regarding loan products with variable interest rates. This has resulted in client compensation arrangements, including intereston-interest, for certain revolving consumer credits. Residual claim and liability risks remain, both in relation to revolving credits and other types of loan products with variable interest rates. The bank continues to monitor these risks and the use of variable interest rates going forward.\n\nFor more information, please refer to Customer experience in the Strategy, value creation & performance chapter.\n\n- \u00c5 Credit Risk Management. Regulatory attention remains high around credit risk management, which has been persistently challenging for ABN AMRO, particularly relating to credit risk monitoring, collateral management and credit (risk) modelling. To remediate these challenges, ABN AMRO has made investments in IT infrastructure, data management capabilities, resourcing and organisational redesign.\n\nMoreover, ABN AMRO is progressing on its Return to Compliance plan to bring all its credit risk models in line with regulations. Adequate add-ons have been taken to address shortcomings in the meantime.\n\nMore information on this is provided in the Credit risk management section.\n\nIn the past, ABN AMRO's legal predecessor, Fortis Bank (Nederland) N.V., ABN AMRO and several (former) subsidiaries were directly or indirectly involved in transactions relating to equity trading extending over dividend record dates, including several forms of tainted dividend arbitrage, i.e. tainted dividend stripping, including cum/ex and cum/cum. It cannot be excluded\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthat ABN AMRO or subsidiaries may face financial consequences as a result of their involvement in these transactions. This could include corporate administrative fines and other measures under both criminal and civil law claims. The bank has been implementing measures to prevent any future involvement in tainted dividend arbitrage.\n\nOverall, these remediation programmes require a substantial, ongoing effort, especially the regulatory areas mentioned above. In addition to its remediation programmes, the bank continues to improve compliance in all operational processes.\n\n## Section D: Areas of attention identified by senior management\n\nThe Executive Board has identified and agreed on the following areas of improvement, which are being actively managed by senior management:\n\n- \u00c5 Increased cyber risks: The availability, security and stability of core systems and data are important preconditions for ABN AMRO to fulfil its strategy to be 'a personal bank in the digital age'. These preconditions are at risk as criminals increasingly try to lock and/or destroy systems and data, mostly in attempt to get cash out by means of ransomware or extortion.\n\nTo reduce this risk, ABN AMRO puts in place robust controls to protect its systems, continuously improves capabilities to detect and respond to an attack and strengthens its abilities to recover quickly in case an attack would happen. It is equally important to note that cyber security has a strong behavioural component, meaning employees and users need to be aware of the threats and risks. Awareness programs are therefore being executed to enable employees to recognise and act on cyber security threats.\n\nAchieving these ambitions will make our systems much more robust. However, substantial efforts are still required to improve the IT infrastructure, which is complex due to the existence of legacy systems and multiple third-party applications.\n\n- \u00c5 Data management: Having fit-for-purpose data and data management processes are elementary to the bank's strategic ambitions. ABN AMRO recognises that failing to have these in place undermines sound risk taking, curtails client-driven innovation including further digitalisation, imposes higher costs through manual interventions and reduces competitiveness. Likewise, without proper data and related management frameworks ABN AMRO cannot fully meet regulatory requirements such as adhering to the Principles for Effective Risk Data Aggregation and Risk Reporting (PERDARR) and adequately execute tasks related to detecting financial crime. Proper data management also plays a vital role in safeguarding against privacy risks.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2",

        "page_content": "Throughout 2022, ABN AMRO further progressed in strengthening data management capabilities by upgrading controls, improving governance and closing data gaps. Still, the quality of (historical) data, data ownership, data knowledge and a complex IT infrastructure all need to be addressed.\n\n- \u00c5 Change accumulation: The large-sized change portfolio, many mutual interdependencies, high dependency on data quality, skill shortage and immature change execution processes are leading to an accumulation of change, which creates negative effects in terms of failing to achieve the set goals in the areas of growth, digitalisation, cost containment and regulatory compliance. Consequently, the overall level of risks around change accumulation in ABN AMRO increased in 2022 although the bank was improving regarding managing regulatory-driven changes.\n\nDuring 2022, Senior Management strongly increased its involvement to remedy recurring issues in change execution. Structures to strengthen program governance, provide performance measurement and improve risk reporting were put into place. These developments bode well for the future but navigating the complexities of the change portfolio is expected to require significant, ongoing attention.\n\n- \u00c5 People and culture: Difficulties persist in attracting, developing and retaining qualified and diverse staff due to the combined effects of general supply shortage and consequent high competition for specific talents, especially in areas of IT and data. Changing employee attitudes accelerated by Covid-19 pandemic (e.g. people demanding more flexible working arrangements) also impact both labour supply and conditions necessary to retain and attract staff.\n\nABN AMRO's Employee Engagement Survey score decreased in 2022. When people feel less engaged this may lead to several risks: higher levels of turnover, higher costs for attracting new colleagues, loss of productivity and efficiency (execution power) and increased costs of retention.\n\nEfforts are being made to mitigate these risks through carefully managed HR programmes, which focus on strategic workforce management, reskilling and well-being. HR also works closely with the business lines to:\n\n- \u00c5 Enhance performance management practices;\n- \u00c5 Ensure strategy execution also focuses on leadership and supporting people during change;\n- \u00c5 Strengthen client-centric ways of working;\n- \u00c5 Embedding our values-led culture through the bank's Culture Change Plan\n- \u00c5 Improve hybrid ways of working.\n\nIn the meantime, measures have been taken to minimise and mitigate the risks regarding all areas of improvement. However, it should be noted that ABN AMRO's internal risk management and control systems do not provide complete assurance on the realisation of business objectives, nor do they always prevent or detect inaccuracies, fraud and non-compliance with rules and regulations.",

|\n\nThe behavioural maturity profile is based on internally developed liquidity risk models. These models cover residential mortgages, consumer and corporate loans, non-maturing assets (mainly current accounts), credit cards, non-maturing liabilities (demand deposits and current accounts) and term deposits. The liquidity risk models predict the behavioural cash flows, which can differ from the contractual cash flows as a result of, for example, prepayments or because some products do not have a defined contractual maturity date. The models are based on historically observed client behaviour and use a combination of internal and external risk drivers. The models are used for monitoring the bank's liquidity mismatch position.\n\nThe liquidity risk models are included in the bank's model risk management framework. This means that the models have to follow a regular monitoring and validation schedule. Approval of the models is given by the Methodology Acceptance Group (MAG) ALM/T, based on independent advice from Model Validation.",

        "page_content": "## Taxonomy of eligible and non-eligible assets\n\nThe objective of the EU taxonomy is to determine taxonomy-aligned activities. These are activities that are considered sustainable on the basis of a set of criteria. The first step in determining whether an activity can potentially be aligned with the taxonomy is to determine eligibility. Eligibility under the EU taxonomy indicates which activities are in scope of the taxonomy, but does not take account of the different technical criteria required to qualify as environmentally sustainable (i.e. 'taxonomy-aligned').\n\nIn the case of corporate clients, ABN AMRO is only allowed to use actual information that has been disclosed by clients reporting under the Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD). Last year, such reported information was not yet available. However, NFRD companies have now published their eligibility percentages based on their revenues, capital expenditure and operational expenditure. As a financial institution, we are required to use our clients' actual eligibility information when disclosing our own eligibility ratio. The mandatory eligibility percentage in the table below includes the reported eligibility for exposures to NFRD companies based on their revenues, while the percentage based on their capital expenditure is included in a footnote.\n\nIn addition to a mandatory disclosure, ABN AMRO has opted to voluntarily disclose on the eligibility of its nonNFRD exposures. This percentage can be found under 'Voluntary eligibility disclosure' in the table. Because non-NFRD companies do not report on eligibility, the methodology for determining eligibility for non-NFRD companies uses the NACE code of the counterparty as a proxy for eligibility.\n\n## Looking ahead: Green Asset Ratio\n\nIn order to qualify as 'environmentally sustainable', and therefore to be included in the numerator of the Green Asset Ratio (GAR), economic activities must be aligned with the taxonomy criteria. This means that these activities significantly contribute to a taxonomy objective, meet the 'do no significant harm' (DNSH) criteria and meet the minimum safeguards criteria. When assessing whether activities that we finance are aligned, we are highly dependent on the information that our clients disclose in accordance with the NFRD and, in future, in accordance with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) when it comes into force.\n\nBased on the information that our clients disclose, and in line with current regulatory requirements, we need to disclose the GAR in our 2023 Annual Report. We are only allowed to include taxonomy-aligned exposures to NFRD corporates, certain household exposures and specific local government financing in the numerator. This means that a significant amount of our portfolio (such as lending to and ABN AMRO's investments in non-NFRD corporates and financial institutions, amounting to 29% of our total assets) cannot be considered for taxonomy alignment and will subsequently be excluded from the GAR numerator in the 2023 Annual Report. Non-NFRD corporates are not allowed to be included in the numerator until the 2024 Annual Report, subject to positive assessment of this by the European Commission.\n\nThe denominator of the GAR is based on the concept of covered assets, which comprises total on-balance sheet assets less exposures to central governments, central banks and supranational issuers and assets held for trading. These assets amounted to EUR 302.9 billion at 31 December 2022. In future, we will aim to align our definitions of sustainable acceleration loans as much as possible with the EU taxonomy definitions. However, we also see the need for additional sustainability-related metrics to cover the clients and exposures, such as our SME portfolio, that cannot be included in the GAR from a regulatory point of view.",

securities and equity instruments.\n- 2 In 2021 Financial corporations subject to the NFRD were classified as non-eligible.\n- 3 Voluntary eligibility based on principal NACE code of the immediate counterparty.\n\n- 5 Defined as overdrafts and current accounts with other credit institutions.\n- 6 Including loans and advances to households, local and state governments and other assets that are not eligible for the EU taxonomy.\n- 7 Defined as the total on-balance sheet assets minus exposures to central governments, central banks and supranational issuers and assets held for trading.\n- 8 If eligibility based on CapEx was used for NFRD companies, the eligibility % with the total assets in the denominator would have been 40% (51% with total covered assets in de denominator) as per 31 December 2022.\n- 9 Excluding fair value adjustments from hedge accounting, which amounted to EUR -12,454 million at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: EUR 3,587 million).\n\nThe EU taxonomy table contains a few changes compared to last year. As well as the proportions of total assets, the proportions of covered assets are included. The numerator\n\nin the proportions of total assets and covered assets is the gross carrying amount of the line items, instead of the eligible amount.\n\n## Client Asset Portfolio\n\n| (in millions)               | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2021   |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Potential eligible assets 1 | 71,047             | 90,828             |\n| - of which NFRD clients     | 31,971             | 36,702             |\n| - of which eligible 2       | 9,713              | 13,340             |\n| - of which non-eligible     | 22,259             | 23,362             |\n\n- 1 Scope consists of corporate debt and equity securities, including lookthrough of funds.\n- 2 The eligibility for the client assets is still voluntary.

        "page_content": "## Leadership & governance structure\n\n## Executive Board composition\n\n## Introduction to leadership & governance\n\nGood corporate governance is critical for us to realise our strategic ambition of being a trusted and professional partner for all our stakeholders: our clients, shareholders, investors, employees and society at large. In 2022, we addressed the question of how we can incorporate sustainability even more into our corporate governance. In doing so, we took into account our societal impact, environmental impact and organisational culture, all in equal measure.\n\nSocietal impact refers to how society is impacted by the bank and the ABN AMRO group as a whole, including our influence on all our stakeholders. Environmental impact refers to our geophysical environment and footprint. Organisational culture refers to our relationships within the ABN AMRO group, including our Board members, managers, internal stakeholders and all of our employees.\n\nABN AMRO has a two-tier governance model consisting of a Supervisory Board and an Executive Board. In this chapter we report on the set-up of our corporate governance, division of duties and responsibilities, and decision-making during the year 2022.\n\n## Role and responsibilities of the Executive Board\n\nThe Executive Board is the statutory managing board of ABN AMRO within the meaning of Section 2:129 of the Dutch Civil Code. It is responsible, among other things, for: (i) the general course of business of ABN AMRO, ensuring compliance with laws and regulations and the adequate financing of its activities, (ii) the continuity of ABN AMRO and its business, aimed at long-term value creation for ABN AMRO and taking into account interests of stakeholders, and (iii) setting ABN AMRO's mission, strategy, risk appetite, risk framework, budgets, financial and non-financial targets, and for the realisation thereof.\n\nThe Executive Board ensures close cooperation with the Supervisory Board in the discharge of its responsibilities and seeks the approval of the Supervisory Board for the bank-wide strategy in line with the pursued culture aimed at long-term value creation and targets. The Executive Board is accountable to the Supervisory Board and to the General Meeting for the performance of its duties. In performing its duties, the Executive Board develops a view on long-term value creation for ABN AMRO and its business and considers relevant stakeholder interests.\n\n## Composition and diversity\n\nThe Executive Board consisted of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), the Chief Innovation & Technology Officer (CI&TO), three Chief Commercial Officers (CCOs) (Personal & Business Banking, Corporate Banking and Wealth Management) and a Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO). On 1 February 2023, ABN AMRO announced that a Chief Operations Officer (COO) will be added to the Executive Board, with primary responsibility for the bank's operational performance. An executive search process for a new COO has started. ABN AMRO also announced that the CHRO role will fall directly under the CEO and will no longer be part of the Executive Board.\n\nThe Executive Board's composition is based on ABN AMRO's guiding principle that diversity of thought, expertise, background, competences and interpersonal styles is a prerequisite for effective management and, by extension, for long-term value creation. The vision set by ABN AMRO is to become a company that mirrors, at all levels, the diversity of the communities in which it operates. A diverse Executive Board fosters a variety of views and experiences and facilitates independent opinions and sound decisionmaking within the Executive Board.\n\nTo that effect, the following diversity aspects have been identified as relevant for the composition of the Executive Board: gender, age, educational and professional background, and geographical provenance. These aspects were taken into consideration for the appointments in 2022. In line with ABN AMRO's diversity policy, ABN AMRO strives to meet its gender target. According to ABN AMRO's gender diversity target, at least one-third (1/3rd) of ABN AMRO's Executive Board should consist of the underrepresented gender. The Executive Board currently consists of 4 male members and 3 female members. When vacancies arise and in succession planning, ABN AMRO gives due consideration to any applicable diversity requirements in its search for suitable new members who meet the fit and proper requirements stipulated in the Dutch Financial Markets Supervision Act.\n\nThe Rules of Procedure of the Executive Board are available on abnamro.com. These Rules of Procedure were last updated in 2022 to include reference to the newly established Group Sustainability Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->",

To ensure continuity of decision-making, interim arrangements were put in place for the period until the appointment and starting date of Annerie Vreugdenhil.\n\nIn addition, on 7 January 2022, ABN AMRO announced that Christian Bornfeld, CI&TO of ABN AMRO and Vice-Chair of the Executive Board, would leave ABN AMRO with effect from 1 May 2022. He had decided to pursue a new opportunity, which allows him to work closer to his family in Denmark. The Supervisory Board initiated the process of finding a new CI&TO, resulting in the Supervisory Board's nomination of Carsten Bittner to succeed Christian Bornfeld as ABN AMRO's CI&TO. Interim arrangements were put in place for the period until the appointment and starting date of Carsten Bittner as the new CI&TO from 1 January 2023 and member of the Executive Board to ensure continuity of decision-making. Lars Kramer was appointed Vice-Chair of the Executive Board with effect from 1 May 2022.\n\nOn 18 October 2022, ABN AMRO announced that Gerard Penning, Chief Human Resources Officer and member of the Executive Board, would leave the bank on 1 December 2022. This was decided by the bank and Gerard Penning in mutual agreement. Interim arrangements have been put in place.\n\nIn addition, on 11 January 2023, ABN AMRO announced that Lars Kramer, Chief Financial Officer of ABN AMRO and Vice-Chair of the Executive Board, has decided to step down from his position and will leave ABN AMRO on 30 April 2023 to pursue an opportunity outside ABN AMRO. The process of finding a new Chief Financial Officer has been initiated. Ferdinand Vaandrager will replace Lars Kramer as interim CFO, subject to regulatory approval.\n\n## Appointment, suspension and dismissal\n\nMembers of the Executive Board are appointed and reappointed by the Supervisory Board for a term of up to four years, provided that the term of office continues up to and including the first General Meeting to be held after expiry of the term. When preparing the appointment and reappointment of the members of the Executive Board, the Selection & Nomination Committee and the Supervisory Board consider the diversity objectives laid down in ABN AMRO's internal policies. Only candidates who meet the fit and proper test under the Dutch Financial Markets Supervision Act are eligible for appointment.\n\nThe Employee Council renders advice on the appointment of members of the Executive Board. The Supervisory Board notifies the General Meeting of the intended appointment or reappointment of a member of the Executive Board, accompanied by a short resume of the candidate including the candidate's age, gender, educational and professional background, and geographical provenance.\n\nThe Supervisory Board may appoint one of the members of the Executive Board as Chair (to be granted the title of Chief Executive Officer). Pursuant to the relationship agreement with NLFI, the Supervisory Board will give NLFI the opportunity to advise on the decision to appoint or reappoint any member of the Executive Board, as long as NLFI directly or indirectly holds at least 10% of the issued share capital of the bank. The Supervisory Board may at all times suspend or dismiss a member of the Executive Board.\n\nFurther information on the suspension and dismissal procedure of the Executive Board is provided in ABN AMRO's Articles of Association and the Rules of Procedure of the Executive Board as published on abnamro.com.",

Together with the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board is responsible for ABN AMRO's long-term value creation, requiring members to execute their duties in a sustainable manner with due observance of the long-term viability of the strategy being pursued. In discharging its task, the Supervisory Board takes into account the dynamics and the relationship between the Executive Board and its members. The Supervisory Board's early and close involvement with the Executive Board is required when formulating the bank-wide strategy and targets in line with the pursued culture aimed at long-term value creation.\n\nIn performing their duties, the members of the Supervisory Board are guided by the interests of ABN AMRO and its businesses, taking due consideration of the legitimate interests of all of ABN AMRO's stakeholders (such as its clients, savers and deposit holders, shareholders, holders of depositary receipts, employees and the society in which ABN AMRO operates). Certain decisions taken by the Executive Board are subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Changes in 2022\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting of 20 April 2022, Tom de Swaan was reappointed to the Supervisory Board for a period of four years. Upon the reappointment of Tom de Swaan as member by the General Meeting, the Supervisory Board also reappointed him as Chair of the Supervisory Board.\n\nAt the Annual General Meeting of 20 April 2022, Sarah Russell was appointed as a new Supervisory Board member for a period of four years, replacing Tjalling Tiemstra. Since Tjalling Tiemstra was not available for a new term, there was a vacancy within the Supervisory Board for a financial expert.\n\n## Appointment, suspension and dismissal\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board are appointed by the General Meeting, following nomination by the Supervisory Board itself. Only candidates who have passed the fit and proper test under the Dutch Financial Markets Supervision Act are eligible for appointment. The General Meeting and the Employee Council may recommend candidates to the Supervisory Board to be nominated as members of the Supervisory Board. The diversity objectives laid down in ABN AMRO's internal policies are taken into consideration when preparing the appointment and reappointment of the members of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board notifies the General Meeting of the intended appointment or reappointment of a member of the Supervisory Board, accompanied by a short resume of the candidate including the candidate's age, gender, educational and professional background, and geographical provenance.\n\nIn accordance with the best practice provisions of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, Supervisory Board members are appointed for a period ending at the close of the first Annual General Meeting held after four years have passed since their last appointment, unless a shorter period was set at the time of the appointment. The Supervisory Board is required to nominate a candidate recommended by the Employee Council in respect of one-third of the members of the Supervisory Board (the 'enhanced recommendation right'). The Supervisory Board must accept the recommendation of the Employee Council unless it believes that the recommended candidate is unsuitable to fulfil the duties of a member of the Supervisory Board or if the Supervisory Board would not be properly composed if the appointment was made as recommended.\n\nThe Supervisory Board may suspend any of its members at any time. The General Meeting may dismiss the Supervisory Board in its entirety due to a lack of confidence in the Supervisory Board. This requires an absolute majority of the votes cast, representing a quorum of at least one-third of the issued share capital. If this quorum is not met, there is no possibility to hold a second General Meeting at which no quorum applies. Further information on the suspension and dismissal procedure is provided in ABN AMRO's Articles of Association and the Supervisory Board Rules of Procedure as published on the ABN AMRO website.",

How would you say the bank performed in 2022?\n\n'I think we did well. Obviously, the bank benefited from the positive interest rate environment, which pushed up net interest income. But what I very much laud is the increase in fee income, which is clearly something ABN AMRO generated itself as it aims to become less dependent on NII. Also, the bank is doing extremely well on the capital front. Our capital position is one of the strongest in Western Europe, which is increasingly important given current volatility.'\n\n## What needs to be done to navigate this challenging environment?\n\n'Going forward, the macroeconomic situation could lead to a deterioration in the quality of the loan portfolio. In this environment, it's even more important for the bank to further develop its capabilities to measure, monitor and proactively manage risk. In that light, the Supervisory Board is pleased with the arrival of Carsten Bittner as the new Chief Innovation & Technology Officer. In addition to his strong track record in IT and innovation strategy, Carsten brings a wealth of expertise that can help link financial data with risk management data, which is particularly important in these uncertain times.'",

        "page_content": "## In 2020, ABN AMRO presented its strategy to become a personal bank in the digital age. How is the execution of the strategy progressing?\n\n'I'm pleased with the level of focus that the leadership team has created. If you have so many projects going on, it's inevitable that some will be behind schedule and some will be ahead of schedule. But all in all, I believe we are gradually leaving behind the notion that ABN AMRO is excellent at making plans, but poor at executing them. If you look at the wind-down of most of the activities in Southeast Asia and the Americas, we can see that it was meticulously executed. Another example are the efforts related to AML. The bank is right on track to meet the deadlines agreed with the Dutch central bank. It's an enormous effort, and I laud the people who are making this happen.'\n\n## What do you think about the strength of the Executive Board and its relationship with the Supervisory Board?\n\n'What I consider an enormous accomplishment in the last few years is that we have created two excellent teams who work together very closely. We have the right attitude towards each other and this is benefiting the bank: open, transparent, and friendly without being friends.\n\nIf we look at the Executive Board, I am sorry we lost a few talented people last year. At the same time, I'm confident that the team is strong enough to absorb these changes. What matters is whether you have talent in-house to replace them and whether you are attractive enough to the outside world to find new people. The bank has made good progress on both fronts.'\n\n## At the same time, employee engagement in the bank took a hit in 2022. How do you explain that?\n\n- 'Indeed, the results of the Employee Engagement Survey were disappointing. This clearly requires our attention. It was another challenging year for the people in the bank, with yet more reorganisations and difficult CLA negotiations. As a result, employee satisfaction has suffered. Given the macroeconomic challenges and the competitive landscape for banks, it's inevitable that ABN AMRO will be in a more or less permanent state of transition. But as you change the bank, it's crucial to keep your people engaged. In 2023, we will therefore continue our transparent dialogue with the Executive Board on how to improve this.'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Focusing on the Supervisory Board, what's something you changed last year to improve your supervision?\n\n'Early last year, we selected a number of important themes that in our opinion need special attention from the entire Supervisory Board. These themes are sustainability, IT, data management and cybersecurity, and compliance. If you set up a special committee, only part of the Board will be involved. That's why we decided to assign these themes to individual members who regularly report back their findings to the Board. In 2023, we will evaluate this approach and whether these are still the right issues to focus on. So far, this setup has worked well as it helps to enhance the quality of our discussions and ensures that the whole Board is up to speed.'\n\n## In 2022, you were reappointed as Supervisory Board Chair. If you look at the focus areas, how will your second term be different from your first?\n\n- 'In the first couple of years, we mainly focused on internal issues. We had a strong agenda on governance, which was partially driven by the AML settlement. Now we are looking much more at where we want to go. How do we view the environment in which ABN AMRO operates, and what will that mean for the future of the bank in the next five to ten years?\n\nA great example are the intense and good discussions we had on the bank's climate strategy. If anything is forwardlooking, it's the climate strategy. Leading up to its publication, we had quite a few sessions with the people involved and with members of the Executive Board. Going forward, the Supervisory Board will shift its focus further to the execution of the strategy. It's based on a vision for the future, but what do you have to do to get there?\n\nThe bank also has to take a fundamental look at where growth is coming from. That will be an increasingly important topic for the Supervisory Board. Where are the best opportunities for growth and what are ways to get there? For that kind of discussion, you need a stable base, and we have that now.'\n\n## In conclusion, what would you like to say to the people in the bank?\n\n- 'I think they should celebrate success more. Whether it's the finalisation of the wind-down of the CIB non-core portfolio, progress in AML remediation, the inaugural share buyback programme, or the growth in fee income, there are successes to celebrate across the bank. I encourage people to do that, because it gives enormous satisfaction and reinforces the idea that they work for a fantastic bank with an incredible brand name and a great purpose.'\n\n## Tom de Swaan\n\nSupervisory Board Chair of ABN AMRO Bank N.V.",

        "page_content": "## Report of the Supervisory Board\n\n## Meetings of the Supervisory Board\n\nDuring 2022, the Supervisory Board held six regular meetings according to the pre-set schedule and fourteen additional meetings. The regular meetings were held physically, whereas most of the additional meetings were held online.\n\nRegular Supervisory Board meetings take place following the meetings of the Remuneration Committee, Selection & Nomination Committee, Risk & Capital Committee and Audit Committee. These committees report to the Supervisory Board on their deliberations and findings after their meeting, and the Supervisory Board takes into account their outcomes and recommendations. The Company Secretary (or deputy Company Secretary) attends all meetings and is the secretary to the Supervisory Board and its committees. The quarterly meetings of the Supervisory Board start with a check-in for the Supervisory Members only. Each quarter, after the check-in, the CEO provided an update to the Supervisory Board. Following the CEO update the other Executive Board members attended the quarterly meetings of the Supervisory Board. In March the Supervisory Board held a meeting to discuss and approve the Annual Report and in December the Supervisory Board held a meeting to discuss and approve the Financial Plan. These meetings were attended by the Executive Board as well. Depending on the topics discussed in the additional meetings of the Supervisory Board, the responsible Executive Board members also attend these meetings. The quarterly meetings take six hours on average. Other bank staff and the internal and external auditor are frequently invited to give presentations on specific topics such as Detecting Financial Crime (DFC), the Risk Management Foundation Plan, Future Credit Domain, Future Payments Domain, information security, performance highlights, the capital & funding plan, strategy execution, investor relations updates, the culture change plan, risk appetite, quarterly audit reports and the quarterly report of the interaction with the supervisors ECB, DNB and AFM. The CCOs provided the Supervisory Board with quarterly business updates and deep-dives on their respective client units, with a focus on the dilemmas and challenges facing these units. Client satisfaction (NPS) and duty of care were important items for the Supervisory Board during the business updates. In the beginning of the year the Supervisory Board discussed and decided to adjust the ABN AMRO compensation scheme for clients with a revolving consumer credit facility.\n\nIn addition to the regular meetings of the Supervisory Board, additional meetings were held to discuss the desired composition of the Supervisory Board and its committees, as well as the division of tasks in the areas of IT, data and\n\ndigitalisation, ESG, conduct and compliance. Due to the resignations of Jurgen Stegmann and Tjalling Tiemstra, the agenda included the selection of a new Chair of the Risk & Capital Committee and the Audit Committee. In its meeting in March the Supervisory Board concluded that there was no immediate need for an additional member and that seven members was at that time sufficient. The Supervisory Board noted that it might be difficult to write a specific position profile for an eight member at that time, but in case the bank would come across a person that might be of added value to the Supervisory Board, this could be considered at that time. It was also agreed that each Supervisory Board committee should consist of four members. Arjen Dorland was consequently appointed as a member of the Audit Committee and Tom de Swaan as a member of the Risk & Capital Committee. The Supervisory Board also agreed on the allocation of expertise areas among the Supervisory Board members.\n\nCulture and behaviour were key topics for the Supervisory Board during the year as these play a fundamental role in executing the bank's strategy. With the Culture Change Plan an integrated approach was designed, with the aim to strengthen the organisation's execution power and capability for sound risk-taking, both of which are crucial enablers for successfully achieving the bank's purpose and realising its strategy to grow the business. Progress on the implementation of the Culture Change plan was discussed and challenged by the Supervisory Board each quarter.\n\nThe Supervisory Board had an in-depth discussion on the non-performing exposure (NPE) strategy for Personal & Business Banking and Corporate Banking, together with Risk and the business, with a particular focus on the governance and design of the NPE strategy. The Supervisory Board challenged whether the NPE targets were ambitious enough and in line with ABN AMRO's moderate risk profile. The Supervisory Board also requested a more detailed strategy for the subsectors. Taking into account the  bank's moderate risk profile, the NPE strategy sets the main objectives with regard to NPE management and describes bank-wide standards and key elements for achieving these objectives.\n\nIn addition, the meetings discussed certain specific subjects, including the appointing of a successor for the CI&TO and Head of Group Audit. Other topics on the agenda included the financial plan for 2023-2027, performance management, innovation and technology, cybersecurity and ancillary positions of Supervisory Board members and members of the Executive Board. Anna Stor\u00e5kers and Sarah Russell were mandated by the Supervisory Board to discuss the Recovery Plan with Risk, and this plan was subsequently approved.",

Regarding the regulatory environment, ABN AMRO continued to work on retaining trust and making only proper use of client data. The remediation programmes within DFC were closely monitored by the Supervisory Board. DFC is now in the final stages of remediation and can transition towards BAU. The Supervisory Board extensively discussed the McKinsey Financial Crime benchmark and its report, which includes recommendations for achieving a sustainable cost level for financial crime operations in BAU.\n\nThe Supervisory Board was regularly updated on ABN AMRO's key financial and non-financial risks and the design of the internal risk management and control systems. During these updates the Executive Board's assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management and control systems was monitored and discussed. The Enterprise Risk Management report was discussed quarterly and showed the developments in ABN AMRO's risk profile in the past quarter. The report includes an integrated analysis of the risk profile of ABN AMRO, based on the Strategic Risk Appetite Statement. Based on this, the Supervisory Board is able to assess whether ABN AMRO operates within the moderate risk profile that has been set. The Risk Management Foundation Plan continued to be an important topic and the Supervisory Board receives a quarterly progress update on the execution of this plan. An important part of the Risk Management Foundation Plan is the Future Credit Domain, where alignment on the end-to-end value chain and\n\nIT landscape are important elements for execution. The Supervisory Board assessed that progress was being made on the Future Credit Domain roadmap. The bank's risk appetite and ICAAP/ILAAP were also discussed and approved. In addition, the Supervisory Board had in-depth discussions on material legal, credit, tax and compliance files.\n\nFollowing the updated strategy communicated in November 2020, the Supervisory Board receives a quarterly update on strategy execution. The priorities for execution in 2021 were the Regulatory Core and Building Foundation themes. These continued to be priorities in 2022, with a specific focus on deliverables evidencing significant progress on the four priorities in the Risk Management Foundation Plan. As part of the 2020 strategy review, specific checkpoints were formulated within themes that have been given high priority and are conditional for other themes. Checkpoints have currently been set for (1) Regulatory Core, (2) Data Joint Master Plan, (3) Data & Digital Capabilities, (4) Future Product & Service Portfolio, and (5) IT Transformation. The key highlights and challenges regarding these five checkpoint themes were discussed each quarter with the Supervisory Board. The key items discussed and challenged by the Supervisory Board in this respect were the available change capacity, attrition, and the reskilling and outsourcing model as the Supervisory Board regards employees as key for successfully executing the strategy.\n\nThe Execution Office that supports the Executive Board in executing the strategy is actively working to further strengthen the strategy execution and steering capabilities.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2",

        "page_content": "Showing improvement in this area is also a qualitative requirement arising from the Supervisory Review & Evaluation Process (SREP) 2021 letter, which was also a key topic for the Supervisory Board. The Acceleration Programme was initiated and driven by the Execution Office in January 2022 to enhance execution of the strategy transition plan. The main objective is to recalibrate the underlying business cases of initiatives and develop a more effective process to manage the change portfolio by linking value cases to required (IT) deliverables and thereby provide insight in the critical path.\n\nEach quarter the Supervisory Board receives an update from the Chief Innovation & Technology Officer. After the resignation of the Chief Innovation & Technology Officer, this update was provided by the Chief Information Security Officer. Information security and fraud management are important topics for the Supervisory Board. The Security & Platform Committee was set up in consultation with the Supervisory Board in order to strengthen bank-wide cybersecurity and IT-health governance. Specific attention was also devoted to initiatives in scope of the Future Payments Domain programme, on which the Supervisory Board receives a quarterly status and progress update.\n\nThe Climate Strategy announced in December 2022 was a key topic for the Supervisory Board during the year. In various formal and informal meetings the Supervisory Board devoted time to considering and challenging the various elements in the Climate Strategy; in particular, the climate targets and commercial plans for Commercial Real Estate, (New) Energy, Wealth Products, Shipping and Mortgages. Other key items discussed included the carbon intensity of ABN AMRO's portfolio, clients' energy transition and the acceleration of the Renewables portfolio. The Supervisory Board stressed the importance of new legislation for meeting the targets in the Climate Strategy.\n\nThe annual joint study trip of the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board took place in Paris from 31 May to 2 June 2022. Two topics - the Entrepreneur & Enterprise model (E&E model) and fintech - had a prominent place on the agenda. The E&E model of Neuflize OBC was discussed, while several clients also talked about their experience with the E&E model, gave presentations on their businesses and explained how the E&E model helps them or where improvements can be made. In the case of fintech, a client provided more insight into the pace of developments and what the client is currently working on.\n\nThe Supervisory Board continued to actively engage with its key stakeholders in 2022, both in digital and physical meetings. The two members appointed pursuant to the enhanced recommendation right of the Employee Council, Laetitia Griffith and Arjen Dorland, met regularly with the Employee Council throughout the year so as to maintain\n\nan active dialogue and obtain the Employee Council's thoughts and input on various matters, including diversity, work satisfaction, strategy execution, hybrid working and the CLA negotiations. The Chair and other members of the Supervisory Board also met the Employee Council on several formal and informal occasions during the year. The Supervisory Board appreciates the constructive relationship it has with the Employee Council, and highly values the input, engagement, suggestions and considerations provided by the Employee Council in the interests of the bank. Active engagement was also maintained throughout the year with the Dutch Central Bank (DNB), the European Central Bank (ECB), the AFM, STAK AAB and NLFI. The Supervisory Board's aim continued to be to ensure that the bank is well positioned to create long-term value for its shareholders and for society, while focusing firmly on clients' interests and balancing the interests of all stakeholders.\n\nA description of the duties, responsibilities and current composition of the Supervisory Board, including its committees and other positions held by members of the Supervisory Board, is provided in the Supervisory Board section of this chapter. More information on remuneration is provided in the Remuneration report section of this chapter. These subjects are considered to be incorporated, by reference, in this Report of the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Supervisory Board Committees\n\n## Audit Committee\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe Audit Committee is tasked with the direct supervision of all subjects relating to financial reporting and control. In doing so, it is responsible for supervising and advising the complete Supervisory Board on matters such as (i) the assessment of the principles of valuation and determination of results for the financial statements, (ii) internal control and financial reporting functions, (iii) internal and external audit, (iv) risk assessment of issues that could impact the financial reporting, (v) regulatory compliance in relation to financial reporting, (vi) mediation between internal or external auditors and/or management where needed, and (vii) reporting to the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Members of the Audit Committee\n\nOn 1 January 2022, the Audit Committee consisted of Tjalling Tiemstra (Chair), Michiel Lap and Anna Stor\u00e5kers. Because Tjalling Tiemstra was not available for a new term as Supervisory Board member, his appointment ended on the date of the Annual General Meeting, being 20 April 2022. On that same date, Sarah Russell was appointed as his replacement. On 6 July 2022, Arjen Dorland was appointed as a member of the Audit Committee. The incoming Chair of the Audit Committee undertook an extensive induction programme, which continued throughout the year, to enable her to perform her task as Chair effectively.",

        "page_content": "## Meetings held in 2022 and attendance\n\nThe Audit Committee held six regular plenary meetings and three additional meetings in 2022. Tom de Swaan and Laetitia Griffith, in their capacity as Supervisory Board members, attended all regular plenary meetings of the Audit Committee in 2022. Arjen Dorland attended four regular plenary meetings in 2022 in his capacity as a Supervisory Board member before being appointed as a member of the Audit Committee. Mariken Tannemaat joined five regular plenary meetings in 2022 in order to keep abreast of the most important developments relating to the Committee's tasks. All regular plenary meetings of the Audit Committee were also attended by the CEO, the CFO and the CRO. The Head of Group Audit, the Head of Financial Accounting, the Head of Controlling, the external auditor and the deputy Company Secretary were also present during the plenary meetings. As for the additional meetings, Tom de Swaan attended all three, while Mariken Tannemaat and Laetitia Griffith both joined one, in their capacity as Supervisory Board members.\n\nIn March 2022 the Audit Committee took a decision, without holding a meeting, on evaluating the external auditor's performance for the purpose of the Annual General Meeting.\n\nIn addition to the meetings mentioned above, the Chair and other members of the Audit Committee regularly held separate meetings in 2022 with, for example, the Head of Group Audit, the CFO, the CRO, the Head of Accounting & Consolidation, the Head of Controlling and the Head of Investor Relations. The current Chair of the Audit Committee also met with the external auditor bilaterally on several occasions in 2022, focusing on subjects such as the progress of the external audit, ABN AMRO's climate plan, the internal lessons learned within Ernst & Young Accountants LLP (EY), the EY audit team and other subjects relevant to the Committee's responsibilities. The current Chair also met with the European Central Bank and the Dutch Central Bank on one occasion during the year. Furthermore, the Committee's members met with managers of various departments in order to remain well informed on topics subject to the Committee's supervision. Directly after the first meeting in March 2022, at which the draft annual accounts were discussed, the Audit Committee met bilaterally with the external auditor to seek confirmation that all relevant matters emerging from the audit had been brought to the Committee's attention. In addition, the level of cooperation between EY and management, the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board and Group Audit was discussed.\n\n## General discussion items\n\nThe Audit Committee's discussions in the plenary meetings covered topics including the quarterly reports, the 2021 Integrated Annual Report of ABN AMRO and key audit matters reported by internal and external audit. In relation to the latter, the Audit Committee discussed all control observations and key audit matters of the internal and external auditors, including progress on improvements, by means of the Group Internal Audit reports and the EY management letter. Please refer to the Management Control Statement in the Risk, funding & capital chapter and the Audit Opinion of EY (see Other) for further details. The Audit Committee also decided to discuss the report on whistle-blowing twice a year instead of annually, considering the discussions in society.\n\nIn 2022 the Audit Committee increasingly focused on governance regarding financial reporting controls within the bank, especially involving the second line, with the aim of improving the independent oversight of financial reporting risk. Additionally, the Committee paid attention to the adherence to laws and regulations governing financial and regulatory reporting, with an emphasis on sustainability reporting. Going forward, the biggest challenge for the Audit Committee is preparing for the regulatory and societal expectations regarding the actions, and their monitoring and reporting, regarding the climate plan and sustainability more generally. These preparations will include strengthening the role of the Audit Committee and ensuring seamless engagement with the Risk & Capital Committee and the Supervisory Board in relation to their respective roles.\n\nThe Audit Committee extensively discussed the financial performance, with an increased focus on the impairments taken as a result, for example, of the war in Ukraine. The Committee also focused on cost control and the cost development trajectory for the coming years. In addition, the amount of management overlays and the related governance were discussed on several occasions. The Audit Committee continually paid attention to current and future operational results, also in view of the rising interest rate environment and economic developments in general. In addition, the Committee held quarterly discussions on the audit ratings of the bank's first-line and second-line departments, as well as advising on two share buyback transactions, one of which was conditional. The Committee also took note of financial reports issued to supervisory authorities, such as the COREP and FINREP reports, as well as considering the role and performance of and reports from Group Audit, reports from the external auditor, management letters and the auditor's independence and fees. The Committee was also informed of and, if necessary, discussed all relevant letters from the European Central Bank and the Dutch Central Bank.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The external assessment of the internal audit function, required every five years, was undertaken, during 2022, with the findings to be presented to the Audit Committee at the first meeting in 2023. This assessment included reviewing files and work processes and interviewing the former and current chairs of the Audit Committee, as well as executives and other representatives of internal audit.\n\n## Discussion items per meeting\n\nIn February 2022, in addition to the regular topics noted above, the Audit Committee recommended the Supervisory Board to approve the annually updated Auditor Independence Policy and Group Audit Charter. The Committee also advised the Supervisory Board to approve the final cash dividend for 2021, as well as the share buyback programme in the amount of EUR 500 million. In addition, the Committee exchanged views on the letter from the VEB to audit firms discussing, for instance, the need to explain the impact of Covid-19 in the annual report.\n\nIn the same month, an additional meeting was held in combination with the Risk & Capital Committee meeting and focusing on ABN AMRO Clearing Bank. The topics discussed were financial and commercial performance, risk governance and ABN AMRO's oversight of this, risk management, operating effectiveness, and information risk and cybersecurity.\n\nIn March 2022, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the Integrated Annual Report 2021, including the Impact Report and Human Rights report, the related press release, the external auditor's report on the 2021 consolidated financial statements and the Management Control Statement. The Committee challenged management on various disclosures that were covered in the Integrated Annual Report. Management was also requested to revise the wording regarding AML remediation and the associated deadlines. Another issue was the new requirement to approve and submit the report in ESEF format to the regulator, resulting in a tight review deadline for the Audit Committee.\n\nIn May 2022, in addition to the regular agenda items, the Audit Committee discussed the 2022 Audit Plan of the external auditor, as well as the EY Engagement Letter, where a change of staff in the audit team was stipulated. In addition, special attention was paid to the revision of the Finance & Risk Architecture Alignment Initiative (FRAAI). The Audit Committee strongly recommended drafting an alternative plan and adopting the lessons learned, including those relating to the involvement of the Supervisory Board going forward and the budget spent.\n\nIn August 2022, the Audit Committee discussed and subsequently advised the Supervisory Board to approve the interim dividend for the first half of the financial year 2022. The Committee also took note of the proposal for the Integrated Annual Report 2022. The Committee stressed the importance of gaining oversight of disclosures on non-financial reporting information such as ESG and climate data reporting. The branchification of Bethmann Bank and its related audit issues and regulatory topics were discussed at a meeting that also considered the conditional share buyback. Communication on this latter topic in the quarterly report was specifically touched upon. Lastly, the Audit Committee provided advice to the Supervisory Board on the appointment of the Head of Group Audit ad interim.\n\nIn the last regular meeting of 2022, apart from the recurrent agenda items, the Audit Committee recommended the Supervisory Board to approve the annual review of the Group Audit Charter and the Group Audit Plan 2023. Regarding the latter, the challenge of ensuring sufficient resources and budget to ensure continuous delivery of a solid audit advice was highlighted and acknowledged by the Audit Committee members. The Committee was also informed of the most important developments in tax matters and related risks for ABN AMRO, as well as being updated on the status of the European Central Bank's amendment to the TLTRO conditions. Lastly, EY provided the Audit Committee with its new teaming proposal for 2024 and 2025. In the process of appointing the new audit team, the Audit Committee was involved in meeting and recommending the future signing partner, who will first become the coordinating partner. The Chairs of the Supervisory Board and Audit Committee were involved in the interview process. EY subsequently presented its new team.\n\nIn November 2022, an additional meeting was convened to make recommendations to the Executive Board on the appointment of the preferred candidate for the role of Head of Group Audit, based on the outcome of the interviews.\n\nAnother additional meeting was held in December 2022, when the Audit Committee extensively discussed the control framework for the climate strategy and the Committee's role with respect to measurement, steering and monitoring, as well as reporting of commitments. The Audit Committee deemed it important to build a robust framework for publications containing sustainable/ESG targets and disclosures, and for the publication's relationship to the integrated reporting to be clearly established. This will be closely monitored by the Audit Committee going forward.",

        "page_content": "## Risk & Capital Committee\n\nThe Risk & Capital Committee (R&CC) is responsible for supervising and advising the Supervisory Board on topics such as: (i) risk management and risk control, (ii) the strategies for capital and liquidity management, (iii) the bank's risk appetite and risk strategy and reviewing the business activities in relation to these matters, (iv) compliance with applicable laws and regulations (including codes of conduct and internal procedures), (v) risk and compliance awareness within the bank, (vi) sound remuneration policies and practices in the light of risk, capital, liquidity and expected earnings, (vii) proposing corrective and/or disciplinary measures against members of the Executive Board in the event of a breach of applicable laws and regulations, and (viii) periodic review of the bank's actual risk profile.\n\nWith effect from 20 April 2022, Sarah Russell was appointed as a member of the R&CC. The term of appointment of Tjalling Tiemstra expired at the close of the annual general meeting on 20 April 2022 and he indicated that he was not available for reappointment. On 6 July 2022 Tom de Swaan was appointed as a member of the R&CC, and on 17 August 2022 Anna Stor\u00e5kers was appointed as the permanent Chair of the R&CC. In their capacity as Supervisory Board members, Tom de Swaan (until 6 July 2022), Arjen Dorland, Laetitia Griffith and Michiel Lap attended most of the meetings of the R&CC in 2022 in order to keep abreast of the most important developments relating to the Committee's tasks. All regular plenary meetings of the R&CC were also attended by the CEO, CFO and CRO of ABN AMRO. The Head of Group Audit and the Head of Compliance, the external auditor and the Company Secretary or deputy Company Secretary also attended the full plenary meetings. In addition, when deemed relevant and useful, individual staff members and responsible management were invited to present their case, respond to questions and participate in discussions.\n\nThe R&CC held eleven plenary meetings in 2022, consisting of four regular meetings and seven additional meetings. All matters discussed in the R&CC's plenary meeting that were relevant for the Supervisory Board were reported on orally at the subsequent meetings of the full Supervisory Board. The full Supervisory Board also received minutes of the R&CC meetings.\n\nRecurring items on the R&CC's agenda in 2022 were the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Report; the Capital & Funding Plan; the Credit Risk Report; Compliance; DFC; Legal updates; a progress report on the Risk Management Foundation Plan; a report on the interaction with the ECB, DNB and AFM; and the Risk Policy Approval Report, which\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nincludes a quarterly overview of changes to relevant risk policies. Additionally, the CRO provided quarterly updates at the regular R&CC meetings on relevant developments in her area of control.\n\nThe ERM Report provides a concise overview of ABN AMRO's position on all risk types identified in the risk taxonomy. It also aims to identify cross-risk type issues and effects and to provide a single integrated view on the bank's risk profile, benchmarked against the bank's strategy and risk appetite. The ERM Report and all other regular and one-off reports were used by the R&CC to maintain oversight and advise the Supervisory Board on the functioning and efficiency of the bank's operations versus its risk appetite, including the functioning of its internal risk management function. Based, among other things, on the ERM Report, the R&CC extensively discussed the interest rate risk, change risks, credit risks, operational risks, compliance risks, and IT and security risks, with increased attention for sustainability and climate risk.\n\nEvery quarter the R&CC assessed the updated Capital & Funding Plan and was informed about the bank's current capital and funding positions. The R&CC discussed the bank's management of its capital and liquidity ratios, including the issuance plans for capital and funding and options for RWA steering. In all instances, the R&CC advised the Supervisory Board to approve the proposed Capital & Funding Plan. The R&CC held an extra meeting to discuss the Capital Adequacy Statement and the Liquidity Adequacy Statement.\n\nBased on the quarterly Compliance and Legal Reports, the R&CC discussed individual Legal, Tax and Compliance files, the performance of the Compliance function, Compliance policies and procedures, and the impact of national and international laws and regulations. The R&CC had a continued focus on compliance-related matters, and particularly on the duty of care, client due diligence, anti-money laundering and the countering of terrorism financing. The R&CC was updated quarterly on the activities of the Detecting Financial Crime unit, while also zooming in on the progress and deliverables of the ongoing remediation programmes.\n\nThe R&CC was informed of the bank's correspondence and development of the relationship with the Dutch Central Bank, the European Central Bank, the AFM and other relevant supervisory authorities in quarterly oversight reports.",

        "page_content": "The R&CC extensively discussed various topics and dilemmas relating to the rapidly changing macroeconomic environment and the risk profile of ABN AMRO, including Covid-related matters and the impact of government measures (and the reduction in these measures) on clients' risk profile. Its discussions also included the impact on clients of second and third-order effects of the RussianUkrainian war, including inflation, higher energy prices and rising interest rates.\n\nAttention was also devoted in 2022 to the need to meet increasing regulatory demands within fairly short timeframes, while also investing in future-proof IT platforms. Extra meetings were held to deep-dive on DFC deliverables, remuneration incentives, information risk, the NPE strategy and the climate plan. The R&CC was also updated on the progress of the CIB non-core wind down and discussed the risk review of the pricing methodology.\n\nMore information on the risk, capital, liquidity and fundingrelated topics discussed in the R&CC is provided in the Risk, funding & capital chapter.\n\n## Remuneration Committee\n\nThe Remuneration Committee is responsible for supervising and advising the Supervisory Board with regard to such things as: (i) remuneration policies and their execution for members of the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board and selected members of senior management, and (ii) reporting on the execution of the bank's remuneration policies in a remuneration report.\n\nDuring 2022 the Remuneration Committee retained the same composition as last year and was chaired by Arjen Dorland.\n\nIn 2022, the Remuneration Committee held six regular meetings and four additional meetings (including one meeting jointly with the Risk & Capital Committee). Two decisions were made without a meeting being held. The Company Secretary (or deputy Company Secretary) attended the meetings. In accordance with legislation, the Supervisory Board continued in 2022 to ratify all decisions made by the Remuneration Committee either at a meeting or in writing without a meeting being held.\n\nThe main topics discussed by the Remuneration Committee in February were the regular end-of-year process topics related to 2021, such as the performance of the Executive Board members and CLA+ employees, as well as the allocation of variable remuneration to eligible CLA+ employees. The performance management process was improved by increasing the weighting assigned to the individual part of the targets compared to the previous year, thus leading to more individual accountability.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee carefully reviewed the proposed allocation of the variable remuneration pool for 2021 and considered it to be prudent. The allocated budget was underspent by EUR 1 million compared to the previous year. The underspending was mainly due to high staff turnover within ABN AMRO Clearing Bank N.V. and to an additional correction relating to the final performance of ABF UK. The 2022 targets for the Executive Board members were reallocated within the applicable KPI framework, while the KPIs and targets for CLA+ employees were adjusted to put more emphasis on financial growth, with targets for sustainability assets also being added.\n\nIn April 2022 the Remuneration Committee discussed the remuneration package of the new Chief Innovation & Technology Officer and recommended that the Supervisory Board should approve the proposal. The remuneration is published on the bank's corporate website. The regulatory approval process subsequently started. Upon receipt of the regulatory declaration of no objection, the Chief Innovation & Technology Officer assumed office effective 1 January 2023.\n\nThe boundaries of applicable remuneration legislation, including the prohibition on bonuses for Executive Board members and the freezing of their fixed remuneration, sometimes make it challenging to retain expert leaders, as well as senior staff and other highly qualified employees.\n\nA joint meeting with the Risk & Capital Committee was held in May 2022 to discuss the risk assessment of remuneration incentives. The main risks related to remuneration policies and practices linked to the various areas of the strategic risk appetite. The joint meeting assessed that the bank generally complies with applicable remuneration legislation and internal rules. Proposed enhancements focused on being able to attract and retain staff with the right skills and talent by offering a competitive remuneration package and having a performance management system that awards and recognises staff performance on the basis of impact and individual contribution.\n\nIn the meetings held between June and October 2022 the Remuneration Committee closely followed and discussed the negotiations with the trade unions concerning the collective labour agreement (CLA) that reached the end of its term on 1 January 2022 and was subsequently extended to 1 July 2022. The tension between offering appropriate remuneration and rewarding staff in times of high inflation versus the cost targets of the bank was a dilemma duly considered by the Remuneration Committee. On 25 October 2022 the bank announced that agreement had been reached on the CLA for the period from 1 July 2022 to 1 July 2024. In 2021, the Social Plan was extended from 1 January 2022 to 1 January 2025.",

The Remuneration Committee was satisfied with the thorough analysis performed by HR, which demonstrated that the policy being deployed works. Action to achieve further improvements will focus on the international context, especially in the countries where ABN AMRO is growing.\n\nIn October 2022, it was announced that the Chief Human Resources Officer would step down, by mutual consent, with effect from 1 December 2022. The Remuneration Committee discussed the relevant termination agreement and recommended that the Supervisory Board should approve the decision to enter into this agreement.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee was further updated about employer branding, attracting talent and attrition, with good efforts being undertaken to improve this branding. The Remuneration Committee also discussed the important issue of staff reskilling, given that this contributes to sustainable development of people and to closing critical skills gaps both now and in future, thus enabling the bank to retain staff and avoid unnecessary redundancies and people voluntarily choosing to leave.\n\nIn November 2022, the Remuneration Committee reviewed a preliminary draft of the remuneration report, the final version of which is included in this annual report. The report explains how the remuneration policy contributes to longterm value creation and takes into account ESG objectives and how these contribute to creating long-term value.\n\nLastly, the Remuneration Committee discussed the preliminary variable remuneration pool for 2022 and setting of KPIs for 2023 and provided positive advice on these aspects to the Supervisory Board. The pool for the 2022 performance year increased slightly compared to 2021. This was considered justified, given the competitive market, tight labour market conditions and the absence of a major event in 2022.\n\n## Selection & Nomination Committee\n\nThe Selection & Nomination Committee's responsibilities include supervising and advising the Supervisory Board on (i) selection, appointments and reappointments regarding the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board, (ii) succession plans of the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board, (iii) the knowledge, skills, experience, performance, size, composition and profile of these boards, and (iv) the performance of the members of these boards.\n\nDuring 2022 the Selection & Nomination Committee retained the same composition as last year and was chaired by Tom de Swaan.\n\nIn 2022, the Selection & Nomination Committee held six regular meetings and eleven additional meetings, all of which were attended by the Company Secretary or deputy Company Secretary. Two decisions were made in writing without a meeting being held. In accordance with legislation, the Supervisory Board continued in 2022 to ratify all decisions made by the Selection & Nomination Committee either at a meeting or in writing without a meeting being held.\n\nOne of the main topics that the Selection & Nomination Committee discussed and provided advice on to the Supervisory Board related to the recruitment, selection and appointment process for a new member of the Executive Board, with the title of Chief Innovation & Technology Officer, to succeed Christian Bornfeld, who decided to leave ABN AMRO on 1 May 2022. The Selection & Nomination Committee discussed and provided advice to the Supervisory Board on temporarily dividing the duties and responsibilities of the Chief Innovation & Technology Officer between the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.\n\nOther important topics discussed were the temporary replacement for Gerard Penning, who left the bank on 1 December 2022 by mutual consent, the related reallocation of his duties and responsibilities within the Executive Board, determination of the profile for the Chief Human Resources Officer position with a good fit for the future, and the options for related organisational changes. The Selection & Nomination Committee also discussed and advised the Supervisory Board on filling the vacancy for a new member of the Supervisory Board and Chair of the Risk & Capital Committee to succeed Anna Stor\u00e5kers, who is leaving the bank at the end of the 2023 Annual General Meeting.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2",

This will help the bank to achieve its strategic ambitions and to bring the bank's purpose to life.\n\nThe bank's talent visibility programme was also discussed, with the objective to increase the Selection & Nomination Committee's insight into the bank's talent population. During this meeting, the outcome of interviews that members of the Selection & Nomination Committee held with senior talents with Executive Board potential were discussed. Other topics on the agenda included the outcome of the resourcing process for the bank's leadership group and management development programme, and the search process for an external advisor for the external selfassessment of the Supervisory Board conducted every three years.\n\nLastly, the Selection & Nomination Committee periodically discussed cases qualifying as antecedents to decide whether the suitability of the relevant members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board should be reassessed. This was not found to be the case in 2022.\n\n## Performance evaluation\n\nThe annual assessment of the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board and the Supervisory Board Committees regarding performance year 2021 was carried out in H1 2022. The functioning of the Executive Board and its members and committees was assessed, based on results assembled from questionnaires completed by all members of the Executive Board and discussions during their meetings, which were evaluated by the Supervisory Board. The assessment of the Supervisory Board and its individual members and committees was based on results assembled from questionnaires completed by all members of the Supervisory Board and discussions within the Supervisory Board. These assessments and evaluations were then used to identify areas of improvement. Actions from previous year included an enhanced focus on various topics in the Lifelong Learning Programme and Permanent Education Programme (such as client centricity, digital capabilities, ESG and the rapidly changing landscape of legal, compliance and regulatory frameworks), the composition of the Executive Committee and the quality of meeting documents, all of which were addressed during 2022.\n\nRecommendations from the assessment finalised in H1 2022 included:\n\n- H setting up the Group Sustainability Committee;\n- H improving the information exchange from the Executive Board to the Supervisory Board;\n- H making recommendations on the desired experience, knowledge and skills of Supervisory Board members, specifically regarding ESG and IT;\n- H conducting 'post mortems' on the Supervisory Board's role in executing specific large programmes;\n- \u00c5 spending physical time on teambuilding after the Covid-19 restrictions and the new set-up of the Executive Board at the 2021 year-end.\n\nThese recommendations were followed up during 2022. The assessments of the Supervisory Board and Executive Board for the 2022 performance year will be carried out in H1 2023 under the supervision of an independent external expert.",

The agenda for the Annual General Meeting contains subjects specified in ABN AMRO's Articles of Association and under Dutch law. Extraordinary General Meetings are convened if deemed necessary, for instance to resolve important decisions, such as major acquisitions and divestments or appointments of Executive Board or Supervisory Board members that cannot be deferred until the next Annual General Meeting.\n\nShareholders or holders of depositary receipts who alone or jointly represent at least 3% of the issued share capital of ABN AMRO are allowed to add items to the agenda of the General Meeting, provided they submit a request for this (including reasons) to ABN AMRO at least 60 days prior to the General Meeting. The Supervisory Board and the Executive Board are both entitled to convene a General Meeting. Shareholders or holders of depositary receipts issued with the cooperation of ABN AMRO may also convene a General Meeting, provided they represent at least 10% of the issued share capital. NLFI may also request the Executive Board or Supervisory Board to convene a General Meeting, as stated in the Relationship Agreement.\n\n## General Meetings in 2022\n\nABN AMRO held four General Meetings in 2022: the Annual General Meeting on 20 April and three Extraordinary General Meetings on 17 February, 29 September and 15 November. The Annual General Meeting was held in a hybrid manner: shareholders and depositary receipt holders could participate by being present at ABN AMRO's head office in Amsterdam or virtually through their own device. The Extraordinary General Meetings were held fully virtual in accordance with the temporary law regarding Covid-19. Shareholders and depositary receipt holders were able to ask questions about items on the agenda prior to and during each meeting.\n\n## Annual General Meeting\n\nThe agenda of the Annual General Meeting on 20 April 2022 included:\n\n- \u00c5 the adoption of the 2021 annual financial statements;\n- \u00c5 the remuneration report;\n- \u00c5 the reservation and dividend policy;\n- \u00c5 the dividend proposal;\n- \u00c5 the discharge of each member of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board;\n- \u00c5 the report on functioning of the external auditor;\n- \u00c5 the re-appointment of Tom de Swaan as a member of the Supervisory Board;\n- \u00c5 the appointment of Sarah Russell as a member of the Supervisory Board;\n- \u00c5 the authorisation for the Executive Board to:\n- \u00c5 issue shares and/or grant rights to subscribe for shares,\n- \u00c5 limit or exclude pre-emptive rights, and\n- \u00c5 acquire shares or depositary receipts for shares in ABN AMRO's own capital, for a period of 18 months as from the date of the General Meeting, subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board and provided the total number of shares or depositary receipts held by ABN AMRO is limited to 10% of the issued share capital of ABN AMRO, and\n- \u00c5 the cancellation of shares or depositary receipts for shares in the issued share capital of ABN AMRO held by ABN AMRO, and the related reduction of the authorised capital (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, ordinary shares B).\n\n## Extraordinary General Meetings\n\nThe agenda of the Extraordinary General Meeting on 17 February 2022 included the introduction of Annerie Vreugdenhil as a proposed member of the Executive Board, with the title Chief Commercial Officer Personal & Business Banking (CCO Personal & Business Banking).\n\nThe agenda of the Extraordinary General Meeting on 29 September 2022 included the cross-border merger of ABN AMRO and Bethmann Bank AG.\n\nThe agenda of the Extraordinary General Meeting on 15 November 2022 included the introduction of Carsten Bittner as the proposed member of the Executive Board, with the title Chief Innovation & Technology Officer (CI&TO).\n\n## Shareholder structure\n\nAt 31 December 2022, all shares in the capital of ABN AMRO were held by two foundations: STAK AAB (Stichting Administratiekantoor Continu\u00efteit ABN AMRO Bank), holding 50.1% of the shares in the issued capital of ABN AMRO; and NLFI (Stichting Administratiekantoor beheer financiele instellingen), holding 49.9% of the shares. In addition, NLFI also held 6.4% of the depositary receipts for shares in the capital of ABN AMRO, bringing its stake in ABN AMRO to 56.3% on 31 December 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## STAK AAB\n\n## History and objectives\n\nSTAK AAB is a trust office independent of ABN AMRO and was set up by ABN AMRO with the approval of the Dutch Minister of Finance and NLFI at the time of the initial public offering of ABN AMRO in 2015. NLFI is planning to gradually reduce its stake in ABN AMRO over the coming years, with its ultimate aim being to dispose of all of its ABN AMRO shares. In the event of a sale, the shares to be sold will be transferred by NLFI to STAK AAB. STAK AAB holds these shares for the purpose of administration ( ten titel van beheer ), and in exchange issues depositary receipts that will be traded on Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange. Only STAK AAB's depositary receipts have been issued with the cooperation of ABN AMRO.\n\nThe issuing of depositary receipts is primarily used as a protective measure (see section below on Anti-takeover measures). In addition, STAK AAB aims to promote the exchange of information between ABN AMRO and the holders of depositary receipts.\n\n## Meeting of depositary receipt holders\n\nBy virtue of its trust conditions, STAK AAB must ensure that, no later than two weeks before a General Meeting of ABN AMRO is held, a meeting of depositary receipt holders is held at which the agenda items of that General Meeting are discussed. STAK AAB promotes the acquisition of voting instructions from depositary receipt holders during those meetings. In 2022, STAK AAB held meetings of depositary receipt holders before the Annual General Meeting of ABN AMRO on 5 April 2022 and before the Extraordinary General Meetings on 2 February 2022, 14 September 2022 and 31 October 2022.\n\n## Bilateral meetings with ABN AMRO\n\nABN AMRO and STAK AAB held four periodic meetings in 2022. The items discussed included the published financial results, the long-term strategy of ABN AMRO, the state of affairs between ABN AMRO and STAK AAB, stakeholder updates, macroeconomic developments and their impact on ABN AMRO, and the intended governance in the event of hostile bids and shareholder activism.\n\n## Further information on STAK AAB\n\nSTAK AAB reports on its activities at least once a year in its own annual report. The STAK AAB website (stakaab.org) provides more information on the activities of STAK AAB, its objectives, as well as its annual report, articles of association, trust conditions and any information relating to meetings of depositary receipt holders.\n\n## NLFI\n\nThe Dutch State holds an interest in ABN AMRO through NLFI. NLFI was set up to avoid potential conflicting responsibilities that the Dutch Minister of Finance might otherwise face and to avoid undesired political influence being exerted.\n\n## Objective of NLFI / Approval right of Dutch Minister of Finance\n\nNLFI is responsible for managing the shares and depositary receipts in ABN AMRO and for exercising all rights associated with these shares under Dutch law, including voting rights. NLFI acts as a stand-alone shareholder that is independent of the Dutch State, including the Dutch Ministry of Finance. However, important decisions taken by NLFI require prior approval by the Dutch Minister of Finance, who can also give binding voting instructions to NLFI with respect to such decisions. NLFI is not permitted to dispose of or encumber the ordinary shares in the capital of ABN AMRO without the prior authorisation of the Dutch Minister of Finance.\n\n## Relationship Agreement\n\nNLFI and ABN AMRO entered into a Relationship Agreement governing their relationship after the initial public offering of ABN AMRO in 2015. The full text of the Relationship Agreement is available on abnamro.com. The Relationship Agreement will terminate if and when NLFI (directly or indirectly) holds less than 10% of ABN AMRO's issued share capital. A limited number of clauses will not terminate under any circumstances. The Relationship Agreement includes the following provisions, subject to certain conditions stated in the agreement:\n\n- \u00c5 Consultation right - NLFI's right to be consulted by (a) the Supervisory Board on the appointment or reappointment of (i) members of the Executive Board and (ii) the Chair of the Executive Board or the Supervisory Board, and (b) the Executive Board on a proposal for the appointment of the external auditor;\n- \u00c5 Approval right share issuance - NLFI has right of prior approval of any issuance of (or granting of rights to acquire) shares in ABN AMRO for as long as NLFI holds, directly or indirectly, at least 33 1/3% of the shares in ABN AMRO;\n- \u00c5 Approval right investments or divestments - NLFI has right of prior approval of: (a) any investments or divestments by ABN AMRO or any of its subsidiaries with a value of more than 5% of the equity of ABN AMRO for as long as NLFI holds, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the shares in ABN AMRO and (b) any investment or divestments by ABN AMRO or any of its subsidiaries with a value of more than 10% of the equity of ABN AMRO for as long as NLFI holds, directly or indirectly, 50% or less but 33 1/3% or more of the shares in ABN AMRO;",

In large part, these measures involve the use of a Dutch foundation (stichting) that is granted special rights intended to prevent an unsolicited takeover or other hostile activity. This also applies to ABN AMRO. ABN AMRO has implemented a structure whereby the Dutch foundation (stichting) STAK AAB is the holder of shares in ABN AMRO's issued share capital and has issued depositary receipts representing such shares with the cooperation of ABN AMRO. The purpose of having a structure under which depositary receipts are created and STAK AAB is the legal owner of the underlying shares is to create a defence measure and ensure long-term value creation for stakeholders.\n\nSTAK AAB will do everything in its power to deter any action that could affect the independence, continuity or identity of ABN AMRO. In a non-hostile situation, STAK AAB will act primarily in the interests of depositary receipt holders. In a hostile situation, STAK AAB will act primarily in the interests of ABN AMRO and its business enterprises. Under all circumstances, STAK AAB will also take into account the legitimate interests of all other stakeholders: clients, debt investors, shareholders, depositary receipt holders, employees, and the society in which ABN AMRO operates.\n\nIn a non-hostile situation, STAK AAB will grant a power of attorney to the depositary receipt holders to exercise the voting rights attached to the underlying shares. STAK AAB will not exercise voting rights on the shares, unless holders of depositary receipts have requested it to do so. This may be different under hostile circumstances as described in Section 2:118a of the Dutch Civil Code. In this case, STAK AAB may refuse or revoke powers of attorney for up to two years (whereby NLFI must pre-approve this decision by STAK AAB as long as NLFI holds at least 33 1/3% of the shares in ABN AMRO) and STAK AAB itself will exercise the voting rights. In doing so, it should, pursuant to the trust conditions and the articles of association of STAK AAB, focus primarily on ABN AMRO's interests, taking into account the legitimate interests of the stakeholders mentioned above.\n\n## Employee Council\n\nABN AMRO's employees are represented by works councils ( ondernemingsraden ) at all levels of its group in which specifically appointed delegates are centralised in the overarching Employee Council ( Raad van Medewerkers ). Under Dutch law, the managing board of any company running an enterprise in which a works council has been established must seek the non-binding advice of the works council before taking certain decisions with respect to the enterprise. Examples are decisions related to a major restructuring, a change of control, or the appointment or dismissal of a member of the managing board. Certain other decisions directly involving employment matters that apply either to all employees or certain groups of employees may only be taken with the works council's consent.\n\nThe Employee Council deals primarily with topics that affect all parts of the group's organisation and meets regularly with members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board on various other occasions throughout the year, including an annual joint meeting of the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board and the Employee Council. The Employee Council and ABN AMRO have entered into an agreement under which the Employee Council has been granted certain additional rights (the Works Council Covenant). Under the Works Council Covenant, the Employee Council has the right of inquiry ( enqu\u00eaterecht ) within the meaning of Section 2:346 of the Dutch Civil Code in the event of a hostile situation. The Works Council Covenant defines the following situations as hostile: (i) a public offer has been announced or is made in respect of shares in the capital of ABN AMRO (or in respect of depositary receipts representing such shares) or there is a justified expectation that this will take place, without agreement first having been reached between the bidder and ABN AMRO, (ii) the exercise of the voting rights by a depositary receipt holder or shareholder would effectively be in conflict with the interests of ABN AMRO and its business, or (iii) any other situation in which the independence, continuity or identity of ABN AMRO and the enterprises associated with ABN AMRO could be harmed. The Employee Council and ABN AMRO can also agree that other situations qualify as hostile. Furthermore, if NLFI requests the consent or cooperation of or a position statement from ABN AMRO in the event of a subsequent placement or a private sale of shares or depositary receipts, ABN AMRO will also request advice from the Employee Council within the meaning of Articles 25 and 26 of the Works Councils Act ( Wet op de ondernemingsraden) .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2",

In this letter, I would like to reflect briefly on some key topics and considerations for the Remuneration Committee in the past year.\n\n## Annual end of year process\n\nOne of the key topics for the Remuneration Committee is the annual performance management process. The weighting assigned to the individual objectives increased in comparison to the previous year, leading to more individual accountability. In addition, the 2022 targets for the Executive Board members were redistributed within the applicable Executive Board KPI framework, in accordance with the Executive Board Remuneration Policy. The KPIs and targets for CLA+ employees (i.e. employees appointed at a job level that exceeds the CLA job level) were also adjusted to put more emphasis on financial growth and targets for sustainability assets were included.\n\n## Composition of Executive Board and Supervisory Board\n\nTom de Swaan was reappointed Chair of the Supervisory Board for another four years at the Annual General Meeting in April 2022. Sarah Russell was appointed to the Supervisory Board at the same meeting.\n\nThe Executive Board underwent various changes in 2022. Christian Bornfeld stepped down as Chief Information & Technology Officer (CITO) effective 1 May 2022, while Gerard Penning stepped down as Chief Human Resources Officer (CHRO) effective 1 December 2022. Annerie Vreugdenhil was appointed CCO Personal & Business Banking effective 1 March 2022, and Carsten Bittner was appointed CI&TO effective 1 January 2023. On 11 January 2023, Lars Kramer announced that he would step down as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) effective 30 April 2023. On behalf of the Remuneration Committee, I would like to express my appreciation for the contributions of Christian Bornfeld, Gerard Penning and Lars Kramer and am pleased to welcome Annerie Vreugdenhil and Carsten Bittner to the Executive Board.\n\nIt was announced on 1 February 2023 that ABN AMRO also planned to change the composition of the Executive Board to further strengthen strategy execution. A Chief Operations Officer (COO) position has consequently been added to the Executive Board. The COO will have primary responsibility for bank-wide operational performance and for accelerating\n\nchange management in close consultation with the other Executive Board members. The COO will head the central management of operations, including the Detecting Financial Crime unit. In addition, the CHRO will no longer sit on the Executive Board and will report directly to the CEO.\n\n## Negotiations on Collective Labour Agreement ('CLA')\n\nOur Collective Labour Agreements (comprising of the Employment Conditions CLA and the Social Plan) are applicable to the vast majority of the bank's employees in the Netherlands.\n\nIn the meetings held between June and October 2022, the Remuneration Committee closely followed and discussed the negotiations with the trade unions on the Employment Conditions CLA that reached the end of its term on 1 July 2022. The tension between offering appropriate remuneration and rewarding staff in times of high inflation versus the cost targets of the bank was a dilemma duly considered by the Remuneration Committee.\n\nCLAs were also agreed in France, Germany and Belgium in 2022, as further described in detail in this report.\n\n## Diversity & equal pay\n\nWe aim to provide a working environment where everyone can be themselves and feel safe, regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression. In 2022, we received the first ever IT Vitae Diamond Award for employers who have successful and sustainable policies for recruitment, communication and guidance of highly gifted employees and employees with autism.\n\nEqual pay for equal work and work of equal value is an important principle at ABN AMRO and our progress in this area is continuously monitored. The results and our progress on this topic were published on 11 November 2022. In the past few years, ABN AMRO has achieved good results on equal pay for the CLA population in the Netherlands. With effect from 1 January 2022, a new remuneration methodology was introduced for Dutch CLA+ employees (i.e. employees in jobs above the CLA job levels)\n\n<!-- image -->",

The gender diversity of the Extended Leadership Team decreased from 47% female employees on 1 January 2022 to 44% female employees on 31 December 2022.\n\nIn 2022, 3 of the 8 board positions (per year end) of the Executive Board and 4 of the 7 board positions of the Supervisory Board were female. The current composition of the Supervisory Board complies with the Act on Gender Balance in Management and Supervisory Boards (Wet Evenwichtiger verhouding tussen mannen en vrouwen in bestuur en raden van commissarissen), which entered into force on 1 January 2022.\n\n## Employee Engagement\n\nAn annual Employee Engagement Survey is performed throughout the bank. The Supervisory Board considers employee engagement and employee satisfaction key topics and monitors the results of the periodic engagement.\n\nIn 2023, one of the key focus areas of the Remuneration Committee will be the update of the Executive Board Remuneration Policy and the Supervisory Board Remuneration Policy, on which we will report in the 2024 annual report.\n\nOn behalf of the Remuneration Committee of the Supervisory Board,\n\n## Arjen Dorland\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee",

        "page_content": "Key in achieving a future-proof workforce is a remuneration framework that enables ABN AMRO to attract, motivate, develop and retain the right talent to realise our strategy. Our remuneration policy and principles are set out in the Global Reward Policy, providing a framework for effectively managing reward and performance to support the strategy (including the risk strategy), KPIs, values and long-term interests of the bank. The Global Reward Policy applies to all employees within ABN AMRO and at all group companies, subsidiaries, branches, representative offices and legal entities under its control.\n\nThe Executive Board and Supervisory Board approve the Global Reward Policy and are responsible for its maintenance and implementation. The policy is reviewed regularly, taking into consideration the company's strategy and desired culture, as well as factors such as risk awareness, targets, corporate values and any updates due to laws and regulations.\n\n## Composition of remuneration packages\n\nA typical remuneration package for ABN AMRO employees consists of an annual base salary, annual variable remuneration (if the relevant market practice so requires, mainly outside the Netherlands) and fringe benefits. Different ranges apply to the various salary scales in each country, but in principle we position our remuneration levels around the median of the relevant labour market, based on benchmarking, while keeping labour costs under control.\n\nABN AMRO's Employment Conditions CLA governs the remuneration packages for CLA employees based in the Netherlands (including Identified Staff).\n\n## Employment conditions supporting environmental and social awareness\n\nSustainability is an important aspect of our strategy and purpose. Therefore, our employment conditions and practices aim to promote environmental and social awareness.\n\n## Gender pay gap\n\nThe gender pay gap is the difference in average gross salaries between men and women. ABN AMRO calculates the overall gender pay gap, as well as the gender pay gap corrected per job level (whereby each job level is linked to a salary scale), for its employees in the Netherlands. For ABN AMRO employees working in the Netherlands, the gender pay gap corrected per job level amounts to 0.65% in favour of men (compared to 0.27% in 2021). The overall gender pay gap (i.e. uncorrected per salary scale) in 2022 amounted to 15% in favour of men (compared to 14.7% in 2021). The overall gender pay gap is mainly caused by more men than women holding positions at higher job levels. We will continue to focus on increasing gender diversity in higher job levels to reduce the overall gender pay gap. Our ambition is illustrated by the D&I targets which are set to this extent.\n\n## Equal pay\n\nWe are committed to the principle of equal pay for equal work or work of equal value. The New Job Model (NJM) is our generic job profile methodology, in which all Dutch CLA jobs are plotted and which is also implemented in other countries where ABN AMRO is operating. Each NJM job profile has a job grade that is determined in line with the Hay methodology, which is recognised as a gender-neutral, objective and verifiable job-grading methodology. In the Netherlands, each Hay level at CLA and CLA+ level has its own salary scale. Our remuneration policy contains guidelines for various moments of remuneration, i.e. salary setting for new hires, annual salary increases, incidental salary increases, promotion and variable remuneration.\n\nPeriodic research is conducted on the development of equal pay in our remuneration policies and practices, whereby salaries of men and women are compared (at CLA and CLA+ level), as well as salaries of western and non-western employees. Our research shows a consistent practice of equal pay. Where the research reveals differences in salaries, further research is conducted. Our research results in the Netherlands for 2022 were published on the ABN AMRO website on 11 November 2022 (Equal Pay Day).\n\n## Employment conditions\n\nThe CLA contains the following employment conditions aiming to promote environmental and social awareness:\n\n- \u00c5 hybrid working is an explicit employment condition\n- \u00c5 the transportation budget (which could be used for lease cars) will be phased out, partly because hybrid working significantly reduces home-to-work travel compared with the pre-Covid-19 situation\n- \u00c5 allowances for working from home (reimbursement for home office equipment, a monetary allowance for working from home and an internet allowance)\n- \u00c5 reskilling (e.g. through the 'Bank in the classroom' programme that facilitates moves from jobs at the bank to jobs in teaching)\n- \u00c5 ABN AMRO assigns 0.25% of its total salary expenses to improving the position of minority groups\n- \u00c5 our Reboot programme, which sets targets for hiring refugees and employees with a disability\n\nThe Diversity & Inclusion section of this Integrated Annual Report describes our various other initiatives relating to sustainable employment conditions.\n\n## Sustainable KPI-setting\n\nVariable remuneration is awarded based on pre-defined KPIs. For our Identified Staff, sustainability is included in the KPIs for sustainability assets and gender diversity in the sub-top, while for the Executive Board it is included in the KPIs for sustainability (Dow Jones Sustainability Index, or DJSI) and diversity. Sustainability is part of the strategy. Non-Identified Staff are requested to set objectives in line with the strategy.",

        "page_content": "The applicable sustainability KPIs are included when calculating the pool for variable remuneration.\n\n## Bonus prohibition\n\nAs long as the Dutch State holds an interest in ABN AMRO, the bonus prohibition is applicable to a specific group of senior staff, as defined in the Wbfo legislation; in other words, the Executive Board (also of subsidiaries in our group with a Dutch banking licence) and a specific group of senior staff. Due to the bonus prohibition, the Executive Board and a specific group of senior staff are also not entitled to variable remuneration or individual salary increases. The salary increases applying to this group are those provided for in the CLA for the banking sector.\n\n## Performance management and KPI-setting General\n\nPerformance management is a crucial process in pursuing ABN AMRO's purpose and strategy. Our performance management process gives guidance on objectives in line with the bank's strategy, purpose and values. It strengthens our culture by stimulating accountability, development and collaboration, and it is the basis for remuneration (where applicable). ABN AMRO's performance management process is called Together & Better and it applies to all employees globally, with an adjusted version for Identified Staff. Besides being a tool for steering performance, Together & Better focuses on motivating, developing and showing appreciation to employees in order to create a working environment where employees can make a difference. Employees are encouraged to take control of their performance, development and careers in a mature employment relationship. As part of Together & Better, employees take the initiative to set objectives. It is the joint responsibility of the manager and the employee to agree on the applicable objectives.\n\nWithin Together & Better, objectives are set around the themes of Results ('What are the results of your work?'), Behaviour ('How do you perform your work?') and Development ('What talents do you want to develop?'). Employees are requested to align at least one objective with ABN AMRO's strategic pillars and to align objectives with our core values (care, courage and collaboration).\n\nOur performance management aims to create a clear link between performance (realistic, sustainable results) and reward in a way that ensures that any award of fixed and variable remuneration is aligned with both the employee's and the bank's performance. The KPIs used are financial and non-financial, as well as qualitative and quantitative.\n\n## Identified Staff\n\nThe Together & Better process is slightly adjusted for Identified Staff (at CLA and CLA+ level) to meet specific legal requirements for this group. A specific KPI framework\n\n<!-- image -->\n\napplies to Identified Staff (CLA and CLA+); this is linked to ABN AMRO's bank-wide strategic KPIs and is approved by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board. For 2022, the group non-financial KPIs consisted of sustainability assets and the group financial KPI was the C/I ratio. The nonfinancial KPIs for the client units and functions were gender diversity in the sub-top and NPS, and the financial KPIs were cost level, net growth in strategic segments and Segment ROE. At the individual level, objectives were set for results, behaviour and development. Identified Staff members receive a final performance score after each performance year, conveying the desired compliance and risk culture, which is taken into account at client unit/ function and individual level.\n\n## Executive Board\n\nThe annual KPI framework for the Executive Board is approved by the Supervisory Board. The performance criteria for Executive Board members are based on financial and non-financial measures at organisational, client unit/ function and individual level, as set out in the Executive Board Remuneration Policy. The performance criteria and targets reflect and contribute to key elements of ABN AMRO's strategy and long-term value creation, especially Sustainability and House in Order. Annual targets are set for all KPIs.\n\nIn consultation with all relevant departments at ABN AMRO, the Supervisory Board continually monitors and assesses the Executive Board members' performance on these KPIs and the targets set.\n\n## Developments and business events in 2022\n\n## Collective Labour Agreements\n\nIn the Netherlands, ABN AMRO has two CLAs: the Employment Conditions CLA and the Social Plan. In 2022, an Employment Conditions CLA applied from 1 January 2022 until 1 July 2022. Following a series of negotiations, agreement was reached in 21 October 2022 on the Employment Conditions CLA applying from 1 July 2022 to 1 July 2024. The main elements of this are a salary increase of 4% from 1 October 2022, a salary increase of 2.5% from 1 July 2023 and a one-time gross payment of EUR 2,000 for each CLA employee (pro rated for parttime employees). In 2021, the Social Plan was extended from 1 January 2022 to 1 January 2025.\n\nCLAs were also agreed in France, Germany and Belgium in 2022. In France, CLA salary increases of 3% - 5% were negotiated for annual base salaries up to EUR 100,000 (i.e. 5% for annual base salaries below EUR 40,000, 4% for annual base salaries of EUR 40,000 - EUR 85,000 and 3% for annual base salaries of  EUR 85,000 - EUR 100,000), in addition to a temporary increase in healthcare arrangements. In Germany, the CLA for the banking industry provides for a 3% salary increase from August 2022 and 2%\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2",

        "page_content": "from August 2023 (not applicable to Corporate Banking and Clearing, who have discretionary salary increase arrangements). In Belgium, base salaries were automatically increased in 2022 by 10.15%. The average increase in the health price index, which is used for indexation of wages, is expected to be 5.2% in 2023 and 3.2% in 2024 (forecasts: Belgian Federal Planning Bureau).\n\n## Relevant regulatory developments\n\nThe rules applying to remuneration in the Dutch financial sector are the European rules that apply in all EU Member States. The Netherlands has opted for a wider scope of the remuneration rules and a variable remuneration cap of 20% (instead of the European cap of 100%). The Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wet financieel toezicht or 'Wft') sets additional requirements for variable remuneration, including the cap on variable remuneration, rules relating to retention payments, welcome and severance packages and publication obligations.\n\nIn addition, with effect from 1 January 2022, the revised EBA Guidelines on Sound Remuneration Policies, which had been published on 2 July 2021. came into force. The revised guidelines require institutions, inter alia, to apply sound and gender-neutral remuneration policies to all staff and to incorporate changes introduced by CRD V (which entered into force on 28 December 2020).\n\nOn 21 January 2022, the EBA launched two consultations for updating its Guidelines on the remuneration benchmarking exercise and its Guidelines for collecting data on high earners. On 30 June 2022, the final versions of these guidelines have been published.\n\nWhere necessary, ABN AMRO adjusts its remuneration policies to ensure compliance with applicable legislation and regulations, and requests shareholders' approval where required.\n\n## Forecast for 2023\n\n## Legislation expected in 2023\n\nEnvironmental, social and governance (ESG) issues are highly important for credit institutions. ESG-related regulations, guidelines and other publications (such as the Taxonomy Regulation, SFDR, NFRD, CSRD, CRD V, CRR II, EBA guidelines and reports, ECB guidance and reports, and the European Commission's proposals and delegated acts) include ESG disclosure requirements applying, among other things, to remuneration policies. Some of those requirements entered into force in 2020 and 2021, while others apply from 2022 or a later date.\n\nThe Dutch act on further remuneration measures for financial undertakings (Wet nadere beloningsmaatregelen financi\u00eble ondernemingen) entered into force on 1 January 2023. This introduced the following changes: (1) a five-year\n\nstatutory retention period for fixed remuneration in shares or instruments; (2) the obligation for financial undertakings to explain in their remuneration policy how they take into account the pay ratio between the remuneration of their managing directors, supervisory directors and employees and their function in society, and the way in which such ratio has been established; and (3) a limitation of the possibility to derogate from the cap on variable remuneration for non-CLA staff. The new legislation includes a transitional regime.\n\nThe above list of legislation and regulations is a nonexhaustive summary. Reference is also made to the Regulatory developments section in the Introduction chapter of the Integrated Annual Report 2022. If necessary, ABN AMRO will adjust its remuneration policies to ensure compliance with applicable legislation and regulations. When required, shareholders' approval will be requested.\n\n## Executive Board Remuneration Policy\n\nIn 2023, we will initiate internal and external stakeholder engagements on updating our Executive Board Remuneration Policy, more specifically the performance KPIs for Executive Board members, in order to align these more closely with our strategy, also taking into account expected sustainability legislation. The updated Executive Board Remuneration Policy will be submitted to the Annual General Meeting in 2024, in line with the regular timelines for approval of the Executive Board Remuneration Policy.\n\n## Remuneration for all staff and Identified Staff\n\n## Remuneration for all staff\n\nIn general, the remuneration packages for all staff are structured in accordance with the applicable remuneration regulations and restrictions applying to the financial sector. A remuneration package for all staff may consist of the following components (depending on local market practice):\n\n- \u00c5 Fixed remuneration;\n- \u00c5 Variable remuneration;\n- \u00c5 Pension contribution;\n- \u00c5 Benefits and other entitlements.\n\nABN AMRO takes into account relevant business dynamics (e.g. market conditions, local labour legislation and tax legislation) when deciding on the composition of remuneration packages. Globally, any and all variable remuneration is capped at 100% of the fixed remuneration. In the Netherlands, only a small group of employees receive variable remuneration, which is capped at 20% of the fixed remuneration, unless the average 20% exception is applicable.\n\nThe award of performance-related variable remuneration is linked to the performance of the bank and the underlying client units and functions. As ABN AMRO's financial results in 2022 improved in comparison to 2021, the performance",

The total retention payments, mainly in relation to the wind-down of certain nonEuropean CIB activities, amounted to EUR 27 million in 2022. In addition, sign-on payments in 2022 amounted to EUR 1 million. As described above, the total variable remuneration awarded to all staff globally (consisting of various types of variable remuneration) amounted to EUR 81 million in 2022.\n\n## Remuneration details of Identified Staff\n\nVariable remuneration is awarded to Identified Staff in line with the terms and conditions of ABN AMRO's Variable Compensation Plan, which implements the applicable remuneration restrictions on variable remuneration. The variable remuneration is split into an upfront award of 60% and a deferred award of 40%. Deferred variable remuneration in the current Variable Compensation Plan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(current version applicable since 29 December 2020) vests in equal instalments in the four years after the first payment. Both the upfront award and the deferred award consist of a 50% cash award and a 50% non-cash award. The instrument underlying the non-cash award consists of performance certificates. The value of the performance certificates depends on the share price of ABN AMRO and hence fluctuates in line with the market. The value of the performance certificates will be paid out in cash. A one-year retention period applies to the non-cash award.\n\nThe remuneration details of Identified Staff are specified in the various tables below.\n\nThe following tables contain remuneration details of Identified Staff.

From performance year 2020, the non-cash instrument has changed from depositary receipts to performance certificates. The table below reflects the number of all\n\nnon-cash awards that were in place on 31 December 2022 for performance years 2016 to 2021 (inclusive).

As part of our end-ofyear process, an ex-ante and ex-post risk assessment are conducted. A malus (downward adjustment of variable remuneration that has not yet been paid out) and/or clawback (clawing back variable remuneration that has already been paid out) may be applied. To this extent, the following criteria are used:\n\n- \u00c5 evidence of misconduct or serious error by the staff member (e.g. breach of a code of conduct or other internal rules, especially concerning risks);\n- \u00c5 a significant downturn in the financial performance of the institution or business unit (based on specific indicators);\n- \u00c5 a significant failure of risk management in the institution or business unit in which the Identified Staff member works;\n- \u00c5 significant changes in the institution's economic or regulatory capital base.\n\nThe Executive Board and Supervisory Board decide on the application of a malus based on the advice of Risk, Compliance and Audit, with input from other ABN AMRO departments (e.g. HR and Finance).\n\nThe malus assessment 2022 relates to the vesting of:\n\n- \u00c5 The first tranche of deferred variable compensation for the 2021 performance period;\n- \u00c5 The second tranche of deferred variable compensation for the 2020 performance period;\n- \u00c5 The third tranche of deferred variable compensation for the 2019 performance period.",

The policy provides for a collective indexation of salaries for the Executive Board members in line with the CLA for the banking sector. In 2022, the members of the Executive Board all decided to waive their right to the salary increase of 2.5% per 1 March 2022 of the CLA Banken.\n\n## Executive Board Remuneration Policy - scenario analyses\n\nScenario analyses are the analyses conducted by the Supervisory Board at the time the remuneration policy was formulated and before determining the remuneration of individual Executive Board members. They show the possible outcomes of the variable remuneration components and the way in which these affect the remuneration of the Executive Board members. The Supervisory Board establishes whether the scenario analyses result in appropriate levels of remuneration, and whether measures are required to limit the remuneration.\n\nAs a matter of principle, the total target remuneration of the Executive Board members is below the median in the relevant benchmarking population. It was decided to continue the previous remuneration policy with only some refinements to safeguard alignment with the new Shareholders Rights Directive. Considering that no variable remuneration is awarded and the remuneration restrictions that apply to ABN AMRO, the Supervisory Board was of the opinion that scenario analyses had resulted in the appropriate levels of remuneration and that further scenario analyses were less relevant at the time.\n\nHowever, in light of the ongoing applicability of the salary freeze due to the bonus prohibition, it's sometimes difficult to retain expert leaders (as well as other senior staff and other highly qualified employees). During the last period, there seems to be an increasing discrepancy between the current remuneration levels of the Executive Board in comparison to the relevant benchmarking populations, which has the attention of the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Contractual elements\n\nAll members of the Executive Board have a services agreement (overeenkomst van opdracht) with ABN AMRO for an unlimited period of time, which constitutes the contractual relationship between ABN AMRO and the Executive Board member. The Executive Board member may terminate the agreement subject to a notice period of three months, whereas ABN AMRO must observe a notice period of six months.\n\n## Fixed remuneration\n\nAs the Executive Board members all waived their right to the salary increase provided for in the CLA for the banking sector in 2022, there was no income adjustment to Executive Board salaries in 2022.\n\nFrom 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022:\n\n- \u00c5 Membership of the Executive Board: EUR 654,195 (EUR 770,618 for the CEO)\n\n## Variable remuneration\n\nAs long as the Dutch State holds shares in ABN AMRO, the Executive Board members are not entitled to variable remuneration due to the applicable bonus prohibition, as described above. As the bonus prohibition continued to apply in the 2022 performance year, the Executive Board\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2",

        "page_content": "did not receive any variable remuneration. The Executive Board members therefore only received fixed remuneration.\n\n## Benefits\n\nThe Executive Board participates in ABN AMRO's pension schemes applicable to all employees in the Netherlands. For pensionable salary up to the applicable threshold, which for 2022 amounted to EUR 114,866, a collective defined contribution (CDC) pension scheme applies. The total pension contribution is 37%, of which 5.5% is an employee contribution. In the event of death or when the Executive Board member reaches the state pension age (AOW), the services agreement automatically ends by operation of law. The intended pension accrual is 1.875%, based on a pension age of 68. In 2022, the pension accrual was 1.875%. For pensionable salary in excess of EUR 114,866, Executive Board members (just like employees of ABN AMRO) receive an allowance that can be used to build up a net pension in a group defined contribution (DC) plan.\n\nThe allowance amounted to 30% in 2022. In addition to pension benefits, Executive Board members are eligible for benefits such as a company car and a chauffeur.\n\n## Severance\n\nThe remuneration policy for Executive Board members provides for a severance payment up to a maximum of one year's gross salary if their contract is terminated at ABN AMRO's initiative. The current Executive Board members all have the same contractual right to a severance payment equal to three months' gross fixed salary. No severance was paid to Executive Board members in 2022. As they resigned, Christian Bornfeld and Lars Kramer are not entitled to a severance payment. In good mutual understanding, ABN AMRO and Gerard Penning agreed on the termination of his services agreement. Gerard Penning is therefore entitled to a severance payment of three months' gross fixed salary, which will be paid out in 2023.\n\n## 2022 Remuneration for the individual Executive Board members\n\n|                             | 2022         | 2022                      | 2022                          | 2022                         | 2022                | 2022                                    | 2022                                    | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------|--------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------|\n|                             | Base  salary | Variable   remuneration 4 | Other  short-term  benefits 5 | Total   short-term  benefits | Severance  payments | Total pension-related   contributions 6 | Total pension-related   contributions 6 | Total  |\n| (In thousands)              |              |                           |                               |                              |                     | Post-employment  pension (a) 6          | Short-term  allowances (b) 6            |        |\n| R.A.J.

The collective salary increase in the CLA for the banking sector has not been applied to the fixed remuneration in 2022, resulting in an almost straight line from 2021 to 2022, as depicted below.\n\n## 5-year annualised average base salary - Executive Board\n\n(in thousands)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCEO\n\nOther board members\n\n## Pay ratio\n\nThe pay ratio is the comparison between the total annual remuneration of the CEO and the average salary of all ABN AMRO employees. In line with our overall remuneration philosophy, we strive for a moderate pay ratio. The salary of our CEO does not fluctuate as it has been set in line with the Executive Board Remuneration Policy and does not contain any variable elements.\n\nThe ratio of the mean annual employee remuneration and the total annual remuneration of the CEO has been calculated in line with the guidance from the Corporate Governance Code Monitoring Committee, whereby temporary agency workers and external contractors have been excluded. The ratio was 8.5 in 2022. The ratio represents the CEO's total remuneration, including pension costs and social security charges, divided by the mean employee remuneration including pension costs and social security charges during 2022. This ratio is considered to be a fair reflection of ABN AMRO's current position. The ratio decreased in light of the fact that employees' salaries increased based on the Employment Conditions CLA, but the CEO salary was not increased as the Executive Board waived the salary increase of the CAO Banken.\n\nSince 2021, in line with the Guidance from the Corporate Governance Code Monitoring Committee, the social security charges have been taken into consideration, whereas these charges were not taken into consideration in previous years. The pay ratio at ABN AMRO is substantially lower than in other AEX and AMX companies.\n\nThe ratios published in 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 were 11.4, 10, 9.6, 9.6, 10.2 and 8.78 respectively.\n\n## CEO pay ratio\n\n(in thousands)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCEO pay ratio\n\n## 2022 Performance of the Executive Board\n\nThe 2022 performance targets for Executive Board members were set in line with the Executive Board Remuneration Policy, which was adopted by the Annual General Meeting in 2020. All financial KPIs are focused on long-term profitable growth, a healthy balance of capital and the need to control our costs in order to be sustainable. The scores are given within a 1-5 bandwidth, with a score of 1 is the lowest score, a score of 3 is defined as 'meets requirements' and an almost score of 5 is the highest score.\n\nAt an organisational level, the targets for the financial KPIs (ROE and Cost/Income ratio) were exceeded, mainly due to a further increase in income in 2022. The non-financial KPIs Sustainability and House in Order focus specifically on ABN AMRO's long-term strategy. The KPI Sustainability and its targets and measures are linked to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI). Our top-10 position in the DJSI results in a score of 2. The KPI Employee Engagement, and its targets and measures are linked to the results obtained in the relevant annual employee engagement survey and focused on both short- and long-term achievements. The bank-wide Employee Engagement score of 78% resulted in a score of 1, compared with a score of 3 in 2021 (82% score). The KPI House in Order means actively conveying the desired compliance and risk culture, effective risk management and solution management.\n\nAt a client unit/function level, strict targets have been set to reduce costs. Exceeding the target cost ceiling by more than 1% led to a score of 1. On average, targets were met with regard to the net growth in strategic segments. Employee Engagement is also measured at a function level, resulting in an average score of 2 (based on a score of 79-80%). With respect to the NPS score, customers are starting to appreciate the digital experience we offer, but do not yet see us as a personal bank. At an individual level, KPIs are set with regard to House in Order, Permanent Education, Diversity and Behaviour. All Executive Board members met or exceeded their targets in this respect, leading to an average score of 4.",

Consequently, a 1.5% indexation of the annual fees was applied with effect from 1 January 2022, as well as an increase of 2.5% with effect from 1 March 2022, in accordance with the CLA for the banking sector.\n\n## Fixed remuneration\n\nThe annual fees for 2022 were as follows:\n\nFrom 1 January 2022 until 1 March 2022:\n\n- \u00c5 Membership of the Supervisory Board: EUR 54,322 (EUR 70,619 for the Chair)\n- \u00c5 Membership of a Committee: EUR 13,581 (EUR 16,297 for the Chair)\n\nFrom 1 March 2022 until 31 December 2022:\n\n- \u00c5 Membership of the Supervisory Board: EUR 55,680 (EUR 72,384 for the Chair)\n- \u00c5 Membership of a Committee: EUR 13,920 (EUR 16,704 for the Chair)\n\nThe remuneration for Supervisory Board committee membership is limited to two committee memberships. ABN AMRO does not grant any variable remuneration or equity to Supervisory Board members. Supervisory Board members are appointed by the General Meeting upon nomination by the Supervisory Board. The initial appointment period is four years unless a shorter period is set at the time of appointment. Supervisory Board members can be reappointed.

ABN AMRO was pleased to note the positive advisory vote.\n\nDuring the Annual General Meeting in 2022, shareholders raised questions about the CEO's remuneration, how ABN AMRO benchmarks such remuneration against its peers and if ABN AMRO can include the results of the benchmark in the remuneration report. The Chair of the Remuneration Committee responded by referring to the Executive Board Remuneration Policy and the fact that such policy is also based on a benchmark. The benchmark itself, however, is not part of the remuneration report, as such information is publicly available in the remuneration reports of peers.\n\nIn general, the primary objective of ABN AMRO's remuneration policies is to enable ABN AMRO to attract, motivate and retain qualified and expert leaders, as well as senior staff and other highly qualified employees. In the preparations for the updated version of our Executive Board Remuneration Policy in 2024, we will invite stakeholders to consultation meetings to enable the Chair of our Remuneration Committee to hear feedback and explore ways of implementing our new remuneration policies to address areas of concern. We also took note of the feedback following the 2021 remuneration report and will, of course, take such views into consideration when reviewing the policy.",

        "page_content": "## Works Council meetings in 2022\n\nABN AMRO has a general Employee Council (Raad van Medewerkers), the European Staff Council (at a European level) and four separate Works Councils.\n\nIn 2022, the Works Councils received a total of 65 requests for advice, 15 requests for consent and 51 information memoranda. These requests and memoranda were to a large extent related to ABN AMRO's further implementation of its strategy throughout the various layers of the organisation.\n\nWith regard to remuneration policies and practices, the relevant Works Council is updated annually on ABN AMRO's remuneration policies and practices. In the event of changes to the remuneration policies that are subject to the right of consent, the relevant Works Council is involved accordingly. In 2022, no changes were made to remuneration policies that were subject to a right of consent. Instead, the Employee Council was updated with regard to developments in remuneration practices, mainly in relation to equal pay.\n\nNormally the Employee Council, Executive Board and the Supervisory Board meet each other three times a year. In 2022, two meetings were held: the first to discuss the climate plan and the second to discuss the gap between management and other employees and how to bridge it.\n\nAs employee participation is shaped around the organisational structure of ABN AMRO, the organisational changes also led to a reassessment of the way the various Works Councils are structured. On 9 January 2023, the Employee Council announced that, in 2023, the current four Works Councils would be reduced to two Works Councils. Elections will be held in spring 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Other governance information\n\n## Codes and regulations\n\nABN AMRO is required to comply with a wide variety of governance codes and regulations, including the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the Banking Code and CRD V. This section explains how ABN AMRO complies with these codes and regulations. More comprehensive overviews of ABN AMRO's compliance with such codes and regulations are published under the Governance Codes and regulations section on abnamro.com.\n\n## Dutch Corporate Governance Code\n\nWe believe that when corporate governance meets high international standards, it significantly boosts the confidence of a company's stakeholders. Since depositary receipts for shares in ABN AMRO are listed on Euronext Amsterdam, ABN AMRO adheres to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.\n\n## General compliance and explanations\n\nABN AMRO complies with all principles and best practices of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, except for the deviations and nuances described below. Under the Dutch Corporate Governance section on its website, ABN AMRO also publishes a detailed comply or explain list with regard to its adherence to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.\n\n## Best practice provision 1.3.6\n\n## (Absence of an internal audit department)\n\nThis best practice provision does not apply since there is a separate department for the internal audit function within ABN AMRO.\n\n## Best practice provision 2.1.3 (Executive Committee)\n\nThis best practice provision is not applicable to ABN AMRO as, since 24 November 2021, ABN AMRO has no longer had an Executive Committee.\n\n## Best practice provision 2.1.9\n\n## (Independence of the Chair of the Supervisory Board)\n\nABN AMRO applies this best practice provision, which states that the Chair of the Supervisory Board should not be a former member of the management board of the company. Although Tom de Swaan was a member of the management board of the former ABN AMRO, the current ABN AMRO is the result of various legal and operational separations and combinations, a merger and a legal demerger that took place after the acquisition of the former ABN AMRO Holding N.V. (the former ABN AMRO Group) by a consortium of banks in October 2007. The consortium consisted of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, Fortis and\n\nBanco Santander S.A (the Consortium). In October 2008, when the Fortis group experienced financial difficulties, the Dutch State acquired certain operations of the Fortis group, as well as Fortis' interest in the vehicle that had acquired the former ABN AMRO group. ABN AMRO Group N.V. (ABN AMRO Group) was newly incorporated on 18 December 2009 to hold the operations, assets and liabilities of parts of the former ABN AMRO group and the part of the Fortis group acquired by the Dutch State. On 6 February 2010, the new and current ABN AMRO demerged from the former ABN AMRO Bank N.V. into a newly incorporated entity. The former ABN AMRO Bank N.V. was subsequently renamed Royal Bank of Scotland N.V. On 1 July 2010, the new ABN AMRO Bank and Fortis Bank (Nederland) N.V. merged pursuant to a legal merger, following which the current ABN AMRO was the surviving entity and Fortis Bank (Nederland) N.V. was the disappearing entity. ABN AMRO Group was merged into ABN AMRO on 29 June 2019. The former ABN AMRO Group and ABN AMRO are different entities than the former ABN AMRO Holding N.V. or former ABN AMRO Bank N.V.\n\n## Best practice provision 3.1.3 (Remuneration - Executive Committee)\n\nThis best practice provision is not applicable to ABN AMRO as, since 24 November 2021, ABN AMRO has no longer had an Executive Committee.\n\n## Principle 3.2. and best practice provisions 3.2.1 - 3.2.2 (Management Board remuneration)\n\nABN AMRO complies with this principle. The Bonus Prohibition Act (Wet aansprakelijkheidsbeperking DNB en AFM en bonusverbod staatsgesteunde ondernemingen), which became effective in 2011, does not allow such compensation for board members of financial institutions that fall under the scope of this act during the period of state support through shareholding by the Dutch State. The members of the Executive Board are therefore not entitled to receive variable remuneration during the period of government ownership.\n\n## Best practice provision 4.1.3 (Agenda)\n\nABN AMRO applies this principle, which states, among other things, that (a) each substantial change in the corporate governance structure of ABN AMRO and in the compliance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and (b) material changes in the Articles of Association should be presented to the General Meeting as a separate discussion item or voting item, as applicable.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The only exception to this best practice provision is that the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board may decide to place certain topics on the agenda under one agenda item if these topics are justifiably related. ABN AMRO considers this to be a further substantiation of this best practice provision, which may be necessary when proposals to amend the Articles of Association or the corporate governance structure of ABN AMRO are interrelated in such a way that separate votes on each of these proposals could result in an imbalanced voting result and, in turn, an imbalance in the corporate governance structure.\n\n## Best practice provision 4.3.3\n\n## (Cancelling the binding nature of a nomination or dismissal)\n\nThis provision is not applicable to ABN AMRO since it applies the rules applicable to a large company regime (structuurregime).\n\n## Best practice provision 4.3.4\n\n## (Voting right on financing preference shares)\n\nThis best practice is not applicable to ABN AMRO since ABN AMRO has not issued financing preference shares.\n\n## Principle 4.4. (Issuing depositary receipts for shares)\n\nABN AMRO does not apply this principle. In contradiction to this principle and provision, the issuing of depositary receipts by STAK AAB is primarily used as a defence measure and not to prevent shareholder absenteeism from enabling a minority of shareholders to control the decisionmaking process at a General Meeting. Regulatory considerations have been decisive in choosing a structure with depositary receipts as a protective measure. Declarations of no objection are required in the event of the direct or indirect acquisition of a qualified holding in regulated entities in which ABN AMRO holds an interest. Therefore, this structure provides ABN AMRO with the greatest possible certainty of adequate protection against a hostile takeover. Although the issuing of depositary receipts has been set up primarily as a defence measure and not to prevent absenteeism, STAK AAB aims to promote the exchange of information between ABN AMRO on the one hand and holders of depositary receipts and shareholders on the other by, for example, organising a meeting of depositary receipt holders before every General Meeting. More information on the purpose and functioning of the depositary receipts and STAK AAB, including information on situations in which STAK AAB may decide to limit, refuse or revoke powers of attorney (and to not observe any voting instructions received) can be found on the STAK AAB website (stakaab.org).\n\n## Best practice provisions 4.4.1 - 4.4.5 and 4.4.7 - 4.4.8\n\nCompliance with these best practices is a responsibility of the board of STAK AAB. With respect to best practice provisions 4.4.5 and 4.4.8, the following applies. In a non-hostile situation, STAK AAB will act primarily in the\n\ninterests of depositary receipt holders. In a hostile situation, STAK AAB will act primarily in the interests of ABN AMRO and its business enterprises. Under all circumstances, STAK AAB will also take into account the legitimate interests of all other stakeholders: clients, savers and deposit holders, shareholders, depositary receipt holders, employees, and the society in which ABN AMRO operates. Furthermore, STAK AAB in principle has the obligation to grant a power of attorney to depositary receipt holders to exercise the voting rights attached to the underlying shares and will not exercise voting rights on the shares in ABN AMRO (unless depositary receipt holders have requested STAK AAB to do so). The foregoing could be different in the hostile situations described in Article 2:118a of the Dutch Civil Code. STAK AAB may then decide to (a) limit, exclude or revoke powers of attorney, and (b) not observe voting instructions received for a period of up to two years. Furthermore, under the depositary receipt terms, when exercising the voting rights in a hostile situation, STAK AAB should focus primarily on the interests of ABN AMRO and its business enterprises as set out above.\n\n## Principle 5.1 and best practice provisions 5.1.1 - 5.1.5 (One-tier governance structure)\n\nThis principle and these best practice provisions are not applicable since ABN AMRO has a two-tier board instead of the one-tier board to which these best practice provisions relate.\n\n## How ABN AMRO complies with the best practice provisions for long-term value creation, culture and diversity\n\n## Long-term value creation\n\n## Strategy to achieve short- and long-term value creation\n\nPlease refer to the Strategy, value creation & performance chapter in this report for a detailed explanation of the Executive Board's view on long-term value creation and the strategy for achieving it, as well as for a description of the contributions made to long-term value creation during 2022. Reference is also made to the appendix in this report for a detailed overview of the value-creating topics.\n\nIn line with best practice provision 1.1.3 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, ABN AMRO's Supervisory Board (i) supervises the manner in which the Executive Board implements the long-term value creation strategy, and (ii) regularly discusses the strategy, its implementation and the principles associated with it. This role of the Supervisory Board is incorporated in the Supervisory Board Rules of Procedure:\n\n- \u00c5 The Supervisory Board discusses, monitors and constructively challenges the Executive Board with respect to the group's strategy, including the long-term",

The current collective profile is set out in Annex 3 of the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board, which are published on ABN AMRO's website. For more information we refer to the Supervisory Board composition chapter in this report.\n\nIn line with best practice provision 2.1.5 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, ABN AMRO has drawn up a diversity policy for the composition of the Supervisory Board and Executive Board. This is part of the ABN AMRO Suitability Policy.\n\nPlease refer to the Leadership and governance structure chapter in this report for details on gender diversity within ABN AMRO's management bodies.\n\n## Diversity & Inclusion Policy\n\nABN AMRO is committed to diversity and inclusion, including promoting equal treatment of and equal opportunities for employees, preventing harassment, ensuring non-discrimination and ensuring compliance with national and local labour and employment laws. A summary of ABN AMRO's Diversity & Inclusion Policy is published on our website.\n\nThe objective of ABN AMRO's Diversity & Inclusion Policy is to create a diverse and inclusive workforce and to recognise the human rights and equal opportunities of all the bank's\n\nemployees. To achieve this objective, all ABN AMRO employees, regardless of their position, must adhere to the following principles:\n\n- \u00c5 displaying respect for every individual;\n- \u00c5 drawing strength from equal opportunities and a diverse and inclusive workforce, while supporting personal growth and development;\n- \u00c5 recognising the value and benefiting from the uniqueness of every individual;\n- \u00c5 displaying respect for the human rights of ABN AMRO's employees.\n\n## Diversity targets, initiatives and achievements\n\nPlease refer to the Strategy, value creation & performance chapter in this report for detailed information on diversity targets, initiatives and achievements.\n\nABN AMRO's results are also monitored externally by, for example, the SER (Talent to the Top) and Equileap.\n\n## Culture\n\n## Our culture and core values\n\nPlease refer to the Introduction - Our bank chapter for a description of our culture and core values.\n\n## Bringing our values to life\n\nPlease refer to the Strategy, value creation & performance chapter for details on how ABN AMRO brings our values to life.\n\n## Culture and long-term value creation\n\nWe place great value on fostering a culture of execution power, sound risk taking and entrepreneurship within the organisation. And a culture in which we feel empowered and valued. This is key to strategy execution and our licence to operate. To this end, we promote engagement across the organisation by organising 'Engagement Circles'. We have implemented structured dialogues focused on reflecting on our behaviour and culture. These dialogues are held within teams and across the organisation. Through structural reflection and on-going sharing of insights, we aim to further strengthen a mindset of continuous learning from lessons from the past, and also to further enhance engagement.\n\nLeadership and culture are inextricably connected. Our Executive Board - the most senior leadership body - and our Extended Leadership Team set the tone, the example and the standards that we expect of everyone. Our executive leadership programme focuses, among other things, on building competency and properly weighing the interests of all stakeholders, in both the short and the long term. Where norms, rules or standards are insufficiently clear or pose a dilemma, we invest in moral learning and moral decision-making. Our Ethics Committee, chaired by our CEO, discusses ethical dilemmas on a strategic level\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2",

Throughout the organisation, moral position sessions, dilemma dialogues and speak-up cafes are being used to help improve ethical decision-making skills and help determine what is right, taking into account the interests of all stakeholders. We have strengthened the approachability and awareness of the various speak-up channels, ranging from speak-up ambassadors in the workplace to trusted persons and the whistle-blowing hotline, in order to lower the threshold for speaking up, giving voice to values and signalling risks or possible issues.\n\n## Tax Governance Code\n\n## General compliance and explanations\n\nABN AMRO complies with all principles and transparency requirements of the VNO-NCW Dutch Tax Governance Code, as further described below. Under the Dutch Tax Governance section on its website, ABN AMRO also publishes a detailed 'comply or explain' list with regard to its adherence to the Dutch Tax Governance Code.\n\nThe Dutch Tax Governance Code establishes a clear and transparent system in which accountability and supervision of tax policies are intrinsic elements. Like the Corporate Governance Code, the Tax Governance Code is based on the principle of 'comply or explain': companies must render account for any principles in the Code where they are not, or not yet, compliant.\n\nAs stated in the Dutch Tax Governance Code, ABN AMRO has both a clear tax strategy as well as clear tax principles. ABN AMRO's tax principles, which apply to all entities in the corporate group, are published on abnamro.com.\n\nABN AMRO has a tax governance structure in place. The Board plays the principal role in that governance structure. ABN AMRO's tax principles state that it acts in accordance with both the letter and the spirit of tax law, both domestic and foreign. ABN AMRO only uses structures that are driven by commercial considerations and that are appropriate for its\n\nbusiness operations (including a realistic presence). It does not use tax havens to avoid taxation: a presence in a tax haven is permitted only if it has real economic significance.\n\n## Dutch Banking Code\n\nThe Dutch Banking Code sets out principles that banks with a corporate seat in the Netherlands (i.e. with a Dutch banking licence) should observe in terms of corporate governance, risk management, audit and remuneration. The Dutch Banking Code applies to ABN AMRO as the main entity within a group that holds a Dutch banking licence. ABN AMRO is therefore committed to complying with the Dutch Banking Code and devotes a great deal of effort to ensure that the spirit of the code is reflected in the behaviour of the employees and the culture of the bank. As such, we are pleased to confirm that ABN AMRO complies with the principles of the Dutch Banking Code. A principle-byprinciple overview of the manner in which ABN AMRO Bank complied with the Dutch Banking Code during 2022 is published on abnamro.com.\n\nThroughout 2022, we continued to improve the manner in which we apply the principles of the Dutch Banking Code, taking into account the focus areas indicated by the Dutch Banking Code Monitoring Committee. In particular, the bank devoted a great deal of attention to leadership, integrity and its societal role, including increased efforts regarding sustainability and providing services to clients in their best interests, as also reflected in our strategy.\n\nAll members of the Supervisory Board and Executive Board have taken the Banker's Oath, as required by Dutch law. The oath is a confirmation of ABN AMRO's existing policies, which are fully in line with the bank's cultural principles and core values. Along with the introduction of a Social Charter and the Banking Code, the Dutch banking industry has taken the initiative to have all employees take the Banker's Oath. Employees take the oath to affirm their commitment to upholding high standards of ethical behaviour. They are personally responsible for complying with these rules of conduct and may be held accountable for non-compliance.",

ABN AMRO applies the principles of the Dutch Banking Code to all of these Dutch subsidiaries on a consolidated basis by developing group-wide policies and standards that promote compliance with internal and external rules and best-practice provisions. However, in view of the differences between the activities, organisation and risk management of the subsidiaries, the application of groupwide policy and standards may vary from one subsidiary to another. An explanation of the manner in which these subsidiaries complied with the Dutch Banking Code during 2022 is published on abnamro.com.\n\n## CRD V\n\nArticle 96 of CRD V requires financial institutions to explain on their website how they comply with the requirements of articles 88 - 95 of CRD V. These articles set out governance, disclosure, remuneration, nomination and management body requirements for financial institutions. The obligation to publish such an overview was implemented in Dutch law by article 134b of the Decree on prudential measures FMSA ( Besluit prudenti\u00eble regels Wft ).\n\nABN AMRO has published an overview of how the bank complies with article 134b of the Prudential Measures Decree FMSA and article 96 of CRD V on abnamro.com.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability governance\n\n## Introduction - Board oversight of sustainabilityrelated matters\n\nWe define sustainability in its broadest sense, including ESG matters. To govern ESG matters effectively, the Executive Board and Supervisory Board need to be equipped with the right tools to make the best possible decisions for the long, medium and short-term resilience of ABN AMRO and society.\n\nThe Executive Board is responsible for ABN AMRO's overall strategy, which includes setting out the strategy and oversight of the implementation and execution of matters relating to environmental, social and governance matters within ABN AMRO, including climate-related topics.\n\nThe Supervisory Board in turn supervises the policies set by the Executive Board, ABN AMRO's general affairs and the business connected with it, and assists the Executive Board by providing advice on ESG matters, including the climate strategy.\n\nOur sustainability governance is continuously monitored so as to further embed ESG matters within our existing governance structure. ABN AMRO thus aims to address ESG matters more effectively where possible and keep up with regulatory expectations and legislation. In doing so, ABN AMRO also takes note of the quickly evolving market practice in this area.\n\nABN AMRO has set up a Sustainability Centre of Excellence in the core of the bank, led by our Chief Sustainability Officer, who reports directly to the CEO.\n\nThe establishment of the Group Sustainability Committee, chaired by the CEO, is another step forward in terms of integrating sustainability into our governance. Various parts of the bank are represented in the Group Sustainability Committee. This committee has been mandated by the Executive Board to assist and support the Executive Board in the performance of its duties with respect to matters relating to ESG oversight and strategy for the entire group and its functions and client units. This includes (but is not limited to) ESG opportunities, long, medium-term and short-term strategy, value creation, targets, KPIs, commitments, stakeholder dialogue on ESG, and due diligence obligations with respect to the group's own operations and value chains. The Group Sustainability Committee effectively replaces the former Sustainability Advisory Committee (SAC) and has more extended duties and responsibilities than the SAC.\n\n<!-- image -->",

ABN AMRO has also set up a Sustainable Finance Programme for the implementation of the sustainable finance regulations (SFR Programme, sponsored by the CRO). The Group Sustainability Committee uses its expertise to provide advice to the Group Risk Committee and the SFR Programme.\n\nOur long-term success in this area depends on a collaborative relationship between ABN AMRO's Supervisory Board, Executive Board and all employees. The Executive Board identifies and prioritises risks and opportunities in order to manage and disclose them as appropriate. At the same time, training programmes on these risks and opportunities are integrated into policies and processes in order to provide the bank with insight into ESG risks and the related data, strategy and targets.\n\nThe Group Disclosure Committee is responsible for disclosures relating to changes in ratings and disclosures required by Dutch and European legislation on ESG performance, social and employee matters, human rights performance, and anticorruption and antibribery matters. The Group Sustainability Committee advises the Group Disclosure Committee, based on its expertise. The Group Disclosure Committee serves as a central point for providing information on matters regarding materiality, consistency and the need for disclosure.\n\nClimate change is obviously an important area within ABN AMRO's sustainability focus. ABN AMRO published its climate strategy in December 2022. The Executive Board and Supervisory Board were actively involved in establishing this strategy. ABN AMRO's climate strategy is an action plan that presents the bank's principles, priorities and key levers. It provides insight into how ABN AMRO will bring",

ABN AMRO monitors and steers on the successful execution of its climate strategy in line with the sustainability governance set-up. It has defined the roles and responsibilities for organisational domains and individual key employees, with checks and balances ensured by the full involvement of all three lines of defence.\n\nFurther details on ABN AMRO's climate strategy and targets can be found in the separate 2022 Climate Strategy & Targets.\n\n## Sustainability-related risks and opportunities\n\nWe see sustainability as a business opportunity and a way of supporting the broader transition to a low-carbon economy. To support this transition, we are expanding financing for sustainability, and increasingly incorporating sustainability risk - including climate risk - into our approach to lending and investment services. ABN AMRO has three main sustainability focus areas: climate change, circular economy and social impact.\n\nThe Group Sustainability Committee is mandated to decide on the direction and priorities of the client units with respect to ESG opportunities so as to ensure a clear direction for the bank as a whole within the risk appetite set by the Group Risk Committee and the Executive Board.\n\nIn addition, the Chief Sustainability Officer focuses on exploring business opportunities that contribute to sustainable top-line growth and on designing an integrated sustainability model to create impact for the bank and for our stakeholders.\n\nFurther information on sustainability-related risks, including our sustainability risk governance framework, can be found in the Risk, funding & capital chapter in this Report.\n\nFurther details on sustainability-related opportunities can be found in the Strategy, value creation & performance chapter in this Report.\n\n## Expertise\n\nAcquiring knowledge on ESG matters is of critical importance to ABN AMRO. ABN AMRO's commitment to sustainability has led the bank to develop expertise among its employees and board members. ABN AMRO is determined to share and leverage this on behalf of its clients and continuously improve its climate-related knowledge and capabilities. ABN AMRO also supports its clients' transition to net zero through partnership initiatives. For further details, see the seperate 2022 Climate Strategy & Targets published on our website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Sustainability Centre of Excellence scrutinises trends and developments and translates them into applicable knowledge for the benefit of our clients, colleagues and other stakeholders. Based on external developments, best practices and expertise, the Sustainability Centre of Excellence defines the sustainability policies for the bank as a whole and for the client units/functions, and submits them for endorsement to the Group Risk Committee or, if necessary, the Executive Board. The Sustainability Centre of Excellence also provides input on the sustainability policies drawn up by Risk, which are endorsed via the Group Sustainability Committee in the Group Risk Committee and, if necessary, by the Executive Board.\n\nUsing its in-depth knowledge and expertise, the Sustainability Centre of Excellence advises and challenges the Executive Board on its sustainability ambitions to ensure that ABN AMRO not only complies with laws and regulations, but also successfully pursues commercial opportunities.\n\nBoth ABN AMRO and our regulators focus on climate-related and environmental risks in particular as part of the collective suitability of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board. All Executive Board and Supervisory Board members should have a sufficient level of knowledge and understanding of ESG and ESG risk-related matters. When appointing or reappointing members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board, ABN AMRO also assesses the candidate's knowledge and experience of ESG matters to ensure the individual and collective suitability of the respective board. Following their appointment, all new members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board follow an extensive induction programme, which includes knowledge sessions on ESG-related matters. As part of the Lifelong Learning Programme, members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board also keep their knowledge on ESG matters up to date by attending training sessions. In addition, several Supervisory Board members are dedicated ESG experts. They continually develop and update knowledge on ESG matters through in-depth tailor-made training sessions in addition to the regular Lifelong Learning Programme. These members participate in the four Supervisory Board committees, thus embedding expertise in these committees and ensuring a balanced distribution of members with specific expertise.\n\nThe Group Sustainability Committee may receive assistance from internal or external subject experts, and preparatory sessions may be organised with a broader group of stakeholders (including external experts) before matters are discussed in the Group Sustainability Committee.\n\nFurther details on sustainability-related expertise can be found in the separate 2022 Climate Strategy & Targets.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2",

They also comply with the financial reporting requirements set out in Title 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, where applicable.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe Consolidated Annual Financial Statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, financial assets and liabilities held for trading or designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss, financial instruments not held in a 'hold to collect' business model, debt instruments that do not meet the solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) test, and equity investments in associates or joint ventures for which the venture capital exemption is applied, all of which are measured at fair value through profit or loss. The carrying values of recognised assets and liabilities that are hedged items in fair value hedges, and otherwise carried at amortised cost, are adjusted to record changes in fair value attributable to the risks that are being hedged. Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.\n\nThe Annual Financial Statements are presented in euros, which is the presentation currency of ABN AMRO, rounded to the nearest million (unless otherwise stated).\n\nThe financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.",

        "page_content": "## Changes in accounting policies and presentation\n\n## Changes in accounting policies\n\nThe International Accounting Standards Board issued several amendments to existing standards (and endorsed by the EU), which become effective for the reporting period beginning 1 January 2023. The standards amended are:\n\n- \u00c5 IAS 1 Disclosure of accounting policies;\n- \u00c5 IAS 8 Definition of accounting estimate;\n- \u00c5 IAS 12 Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction.\n\nThe impact of these amendments on the consolidated financial statements are insignificant.\n\n## IFRS 17 - Insurance Contracts\n\nIn May 2017, the IASB issued IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (IFRS 17), a comprehensive new accounting standard for insurance contracts covering recognition and measurement, presentation and disclosure. IFRS 17 will replace IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts (IFRS 4) that was issued in 2005. IFRS 17 applies to all types of insurance contracts (i.e., life, non-life, direct insurance and re-insurance), regardless of the type of entities that issue them, as well as to certain guarantees and financial instruments with discretionary participation features. A few scope exceptions will apply. IFRS 17 introduces new accounting requirements for banking products with insurance features that may affect the determination of which instruments or which components thereof will be in the scope of IFRS 9 or IFRS 17.\n\nIFRS 17 is effective for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023, with comparative figures required. ABN AMRO does not apply for an early application of IFRS 17.\n\nABN AMRO has completed the assessment of the impacts of adopting IFRS 17.\n\nABN AMRO offers limited banking products with significant insurance risk embedded, such as equity release mortgages and loans with a death waiver, and has assessed that the impact of IFRS 17 on these insurance contracts is not material, except for the equity release mortgage.\n\nCurrently, ABN AMRO applies unbundling of the loan component from the insurance contract for equity release mortgage, which was permitted in accordance with IFRS 4. The loan component was measured at amortised cost in accordance with IFRS 9 and the insurance component, the No Negative Equity Guarantee (NNEG), as an insurance contract in accordance with IFRS 4, which meant the measurement was based on IAS 37.\n\nIn accordance with the currently issued IFRS 17, unbundling of the loan component from the insurance contract is not permitted anymore. For loan contracts (such as equity release mortgages and loans with a death waiver) that meet the definition of insurance but limit the compensation for insured events to the amount otherwise required to settle the policyholder's obligation created by the contract, the issuers of such loans, have an option to apply IFRS 9 or IFRS 17. The election would be made at a portfolio level and would be irrevocable. ABN AMRO's policy is to apply IFRS 9 to such loans. Since ABN AMRO has chosen to apply IFRS 9 to the equity release mortgage, these loans in their entirety, i.e. including the NNEG feature, do not meet the SPPI criterion. Therefore they should be measured in their entirety at fair value through profit or loss as of 1 January 2023. ABN AMRO applies the change in classification and measurement retrospectively.\n\nFurthermore, ABN AMRO has a captive insurance entity (ABN AMRO Captive N.V.) and two equity accounted insurance entities (Neuflize Vie S.A. and Nationale Nederlanden - ABN AMRO Verzekeringen Holding B.V.). IFRS 17 has an impact on the shareholders' equity, net result, presentation and disclosures of these entities.\n\nThe total IFRS 17 impact on the opening equity balance (retained earnings) of 2023 is approximately EUR 200 million, mainly because the fair value of the equity release mortgages as of 1 January 2023 is significantly below the carrying amount at amortised cost due to the increased mortgage rates.\n\n## Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract - Amendments to IAS 37\n\nIn May 2020, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 37 to specify which costs an entity needs to include when assessing whether a contract is onerous or loss-making. The amendments apply a 'directly related cost approach'. The costs that relate directly to a contract to provide goods or services include both incremental costs and an allocation of costs directly related to contract activities. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\n2",

        "page_content": "Based on the amendments, certain other directly related costs have been included by ABN AMRO in the measurement of provisions in scope of IAS 37.\n\n## Changes in presentation\n\nPrior to 1 January 2022, the reconciliation between the carrying amounts at the beginning and the end of the period for each component of equity changes resulting from other comprehensive income were disclosed in a separate table as part of the statement of changes in equity. In 2022, the movement schedule explaining the equity components of other comprehensive income including the comparatives was moved to Note 33 Equity attributable to owners of the parent company.\n\nFurthermore, in 2022, ABN AMRO changed the presentation of 'Items that may be reclassified to the income statement' in the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income including comparatives to provide more relevant information about the effect of the reclassification adjustments.\n\n## New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet endorsed\n\nThe International Accounting Standards Board issued the following amendments to existing standards that are not yet endorsed by the EU. It is expected that these amendments will become effective for the reporting period beginning 1 January 2024. Since the amendments are not yet endorsed these changes are not open for early adoption. The standards amended are:\n\n- \u00c5 IAS 1 Classification of liabilities as current or non-current;\n- \u00c5 IFRS 16 Lease liability in a sale and lease back.\n\nThe expected impact of these changes on the consolidated financial statements is insignificant.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, management needs to exercise its judgement in the process of applying ABN AMRO's accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions. Accounting policies for the most significant areas that require management to make judgements and estimates affecting reported amounts and disclosures are made in the following sections:\n\n- \u00c5 Impairment losses on financial assets measured at AC - Risk, funding & capital management section\n- \u00c5 Income tax expense, tax assets and tax liabilities - Note 11\n- \u00c5 Impairment of instruments measured at FVOCI - Note 17\n- \u00c5 Fair value of financial instruments - Note 19\n- \u00c5 Impairment of ROU assets and goodwill - Note 24\n- \u00c5 Provisions - Note 30\n\nThe year 2022 saw the outbreak of the war in Ukraine, while the impact of Covid-19 became less pronounced. Additionally, energy prices have risen significantly in ABN AMRO's major markets. These developments could impact the estimated expected credit losses of the financial instruments in scope of IFRS 9. The impact on the estimates and assumptions is disclosed in more detail in the Risk, funding & capital management section.\n\n## Assessment of risks, rewards and control\n\nWhenever ABN AMRO is required to assess risks, rewards and control, as well as when considering the recognition and derecognition of assets or liabilities and the consolidation or deconsolidation of subsidiaries, it may sometimes be required to use judgement. Although management uses its best knowledge of current events and actions in making such assessments, the actual risks, rewards and control may ultimately differ.\n\n## Significant accounting policies\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated Annual Financial Statements of ABN AMRO Bank N.V. include the financial statements of the parent company and its controlled entities, thus incorporating the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of ABN AMRO Bank N.V. and its subsidiaries. Non-controlling interests (held by third parties) in the equity and results of group companies are presented separately in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements.\n\nSubsidiaries are included using the same reporting period and consistent accounting policies. Intercompany balances and transactions, as well as any related unrealised gains and losses, are eliminated in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements.",

Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of impairment in the asset transferred.\n\n## Foreign currency\n\nABN AMRO applies IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into euros at the rate prevailing on the transaction date. Foreign currency balances of monetary items are translated into euros at period-end exchange rates. Exchange gains and losses on such balances are recognised in the income statement.\n\nThe Consolidated Annual Financial Statements are stated in euros, which is the presentation and functional currency of ABN AMRO. The bank's foreign operations may have different functional currencies. The functional currency is the currency that best reflects the economic substance of the underlying event and circumstances relevant to that entity. Prior to consolidation (or equity accounting), the assets and liabilities of non-euro operations are translated into euros at the closing rate, and items in the income statement and other comprehensive income are translated at the rate prevailing on the transaction dates. Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign operations are included in the currency translation reserve within equity. These are transferred to the income statement when the bank loses control, joint control or significant influence over the foreign operation.\n\n## Financial assets and liabilities\n\n## Classification and measurement of financial assets\n\nABN AMRO classifies financial assets based on the business model in which they are held in accordance with IFRS 9. The business model is determined at portfolio level. Portfolios are based on how ABN AMRO manages financial assets in order to achieve a particular business objective. The business model assessment is based on the level of sales, risk management, performance evaluation and management compensation. Derecognition is used as a condition to determine whether a transaction results in a sale.\n\n## Three business models are distinguished:\n\n- \u00c5 'Hold to collect' business model, in which cash flows are primarily generated by collecting contractual cash flows until maturity of the financial instrument. Sales can occur, as long as they are incidental, infrequent and insignificant. The assessment of the frequency and significance of sales is determined for each underlying portfolio. Sales that result from increases in the credit risk of the counterparty or take place close to maturity do not contradict the 'hold to collect' business model;\n- \u00c5 'Hold to collect and sell' business model, in which the selling of financial assets is integral to achieving the business objective. In this business model, sales take place more frequently and have a greater value than in a hold-to-collect business model;\n- \u00c5 Other business models not meeting the criteria of the business models mentioned above, for example business models in which financial assets are managed with the objective of generating cash flows from sales (trading book), are measured at FVTPL.\n\nAfter the business model has been determined, the contractual cash flows of financial assets are assessed. Debt instruments can be classified at amortised cost or FVOCI only when the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). Contractual cash flows that are SPPI are consistent with a basic lending arrangement in which consideration for the time value of money and credit risk are typically the most significant interest elements. Debt instruments that do not meet the SPPI requirements are mandatorily measured at FVTPL. Financial assets are assessed in their entirety, including any embedded derivatives that are not separated from the host contract.\n\nBased on the business model determined and the SPPI assessment, the following measurement categories are identified under IFRS 9:\n\n- \u00c5 Amortised cost - Financial instruments measured at amortised cost are debt instruments within a 'hold to collect' business model with fixed or determinable payments which meet the SPPI criteria. These instruments are initially measured at fair value (including transaction costs) and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Financial instruments measured at amortised cost are presented net of credit loss allowances in the statement of financial position;\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "- \u00c5 FVTPL - Financial instruments measured at FVTPL include instruments held for trading, derivatives, equity instruments for which the FVOCI option has not been elected and instruments whose cash flows do not meet the SPPI requirements. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are directly recognised in the income statement;\n- \u00c5 FVOCI - Financial instruments measured at FVOCI are debt instruments which are held in a 'hold to collect and sell' business model and which meet the SPPI criteria. They are initially measured at fair value, with subsequent unrealised changes recognised in other comprehensive income. Equity instruments for which the fair value option is elected are also measured at FVOCI.\n\nReclassifications of financial assets are expected to be very infrequent and occur only when ABN AMRO changes its business model for a certain portfolio of financial assets.\n\nPlease refer to the Risk, funding & capital management section for our accounting policies on the measurement of expected credit losses on financial instruments measured at amortised cost and FVOCI.\n\n## Classification of assets and liabilities held for trading\n\nA financial asset or financial liability is classified as held for trading if it is:\n\n- \u00c5 Acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing it in the near term;\n- \u00c5 Part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of a recent actual pattern of short-term profit taking; or\n- \u00c5 A trading derivative (except for a derivative that is a designated and effective hedging instrument).\n\n## Classification and measurement of financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liability is initially recognised at its fair value minus, in the case of a financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial liability. Under IFRS 9, financial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost, except for the following instruments:\n\n- \u00c5 Financial liabilities held for trading are measured at fair value through profit or loss;\n- \u00c5 Financial liabilities that ABN AMRO has irrevocably designated at initial recognition as held at fair value through profit or loss when the instruments are held to reduce an accounting mismatch are managed on the basis of their fair value or include terms that have derivative characteristicsby nature.\n\nUnder IFRS 9, the changes in fair value attributable to changes in the credit risk of financial liabilities designated at FVTPL are presented in other comprehensive income. The cumulative amount of changes in fair value attributable to credit risk of such liabilities is presented as liability own credit risk reserve in equity.\n\nFinancial liabilities are never reclassified after initial recognition.\n\n## Recognition and derecognition\n\nTraded instruments are recognised on the trade date, which is defined as the date on which ABN AMRO commits to purchase or sell the underlying instrument. If the settlement terms are non-standard, the commitment is accounted for as a derivative between the trade and settlement dates. Loans and advances are recognised when they are acquired or funded by ABN AMRO and derecognised when settled. Issued debt is recognised when issued, and deposits are recognised when the cash is deposited with ABN AMRO. Other financial assets and liabilities, including derivatives, are recognised when ABN AMRO becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the asset or liability.\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when ABN AMRO loses control and the ability to obtain benefits from the contractual rights that comprise that asset. This occurs when the rights are realised or expire, or when substantially all risks and rewards are transferred. Financial assets are also derecognised if the bank has neither transferred nor retained substantially all risks and rewards of ownership, but control has passed to the transferee. Financial assets continue to be recognised in the balance sheet, and a liability recognised for the proceeds of any related funding transaction, unless a fully proportional share of all or specifically identified cash flows are transferred to the lender without material delay and the lender's claim is limited to those cash flows, and substantially all the risks, rewards and control associated with the financial instruments, that have been transferred, in which case that proportion of the asset is derecognised.\n\nWhen the terms and conditions of a financial asset have been renegotiated or otherwise modified to the extent that, substantially, it becomes a new financial asset, ABN AMRO derecognises the financial asset, with the difference recognised in the income statement, to the extent that an impairment loss has not already been recorded. The newly recognised",

ABN AMRO assesses, in both qualitative and quantitative terms, whether such modifications are substantial. Generally, a 10% change in the net present value of the cash flows between the initial and new contract results in a derecognition. With regard to substantial modifications, e.g. due to forbearance measures, the derecognition gains or losses are recognised in net gains/(losses) on derecognition of financial assets measured at amortised cost and disclosed separately, if material.\n\nIf the modification of the financial asset does not result in derecognition, the gross carrying amount of the financial asset is recalculated, based on the net present value of the new contractual cash flows, and discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate. The effect is recognised and disclosed as a modification loss in the income statement. Credit related modification gains or losses (i.e. due to forbearance measures) are recognised in the income statement and presented under impairment charges on financial instruments. Non-credit related modification gains or losses are recognised in the income statement and presented under interest income calculated using the effective interest method.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when the liability has been settled, has expired or has been extinguished. An exchange of an existing financial liability for a new liability with the same lender on substantially different terms, qualitatively and quantitatively (a 10% difference in the present value of the cash flows), is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and recognition of a new financial liability. The difference between the former amortised cost and the consideration paid is recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Client clearing\n\nAs a general clearing member, ABN AMRO provides clearing and settlement services to its clients for, among other things, exchange-traded derivatives.\n\nIn its capacity as a clearing member, ABN AMRO guarantees the fulfilment of obligations towards central counterparty clearing houses (CCPs) of clients' transactions. ABN AMRO is not liable to clients for the non-performance of the CCP. In the event of a client defaulting, ABN AMRO has the legal obligation to settle all the client's positions with the relevant CCPs, possibly at a loss. Possible losses arising from this guarantee might relate not only to a client's current positions, but also to the client's future trades. ABN AMRO receives and collects (cash) margins from clients, and remits these margins to the relevant CCP in whole or in part. Given the stringent margin requirements set by the CCPs, possible future outflows of resources for new clearing transactions are considered close to zero.\n\nABN AMRO does not reflect the exchange-traded derivatives cleared on behalf of clients in its financial statements. Under normal circumstances, the guarantee has no fair value and is not recognised in the financial statements. Any loss recognised in the event of non-performance of a client is in line with our contingent liabilities policy.\n\n## Offsetting\n\nThe bank offsets financial assets and liabilities and the net amount reported in the statement of financial position if it is legally entitled to set off the recognised amounts and intends to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n## Statement of cash flows\n\nFor the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, freely available balances with central banks and other banks, and net balances on current accounts with other banks with a maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition. The statement of cash flows, based on the indirect method of calculating operating cash flows, gives details of the source of cash and cash equivalents which became available during the year and the application of these cash and cash equivalents over the course of the year. The cash flows are analysed into cash flows from operations, including banking activities, investment activities and financing activities. Movements in loans and advances and interbank deposits are included in the cash flow from operating activities. Investment activities are comprised of acquisitions, sales and redemptions in respect of financial investments, as well as investments in, and sales of, subsidiaries and associates, property and equipment. The issuing of shares and the borrowing and repayment of long-term funds are treated as financing activities. Cash flows arising from foreign currency transactions are translated into euros using the exchange rates at the date of the cash flows.",

In the case of an income-related grant, the grant is deducted from the related expense.\n\n## Levies and other regulatory charges\n\nABN AMRO recognises a liability arising from levies and similar charges when it becomes legally enforceable (i.e. when the obligating event arises).\n\n## 2 Segment reporting\n\n## Accounting policy for segment reporting\n\nThe segment reporting is in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments. The segments are reported in a manner consistent with internal reporting provided to the Executive Board, which is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance and has been identified as the chief operating decision-maker. All transactions between segments are eliminated as intersegment revenues and expenses in Group Functions. Geographical data are presented according to the management view.\n\nSegment assets, liabilities, income and results are measured based on our accounting policies and include items directly attributable to a segment, as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Transactions between segments are conducted on an arm's length basis. Interest income is reported as net interest income because management primarily relies on net interest income as a performance measure, not gross income and expense.\n\n## Change in reportable segments\n\nEffective from the start of 2022, ABN AMRO has simplified and centralised its operating model. The organisational structure has also been strengthened and simplified by replacing the four business lines with three units structured around client segments (the 'client units'). ABN AMRO has realigned the new organisational structure with internal reporting to the Executive Board (CODM):\n\n- \u00c5 Retail Banking and part of Commercial Banking have been combined to form Personal & Business Banking;\n- \u00c5 Private Banking has been replaced by Wealth Management;\n- \u00c5 Corporate & Institutional Banking and part of Commercial Banking have been combined to form Corporate Banking.\n\nThe prior-period figures in the financial information for these segments, as included in the Performance (and Segment Reporting Note) section of this report, have been restated accordingly.\n\n## Personal & Business Banking\n\nThis client unit serves consumer and business clients with banking and partner offerings, providing the convenience of digital interactions and access to expertise when it matters most.\n\n## Wealth Management\n\nThe Wealth Management client unit delivers outstanding expertise with tailored value propositions for wealthy clients, focusing on investment advice, financial planning and real estate financing.\n\n## Corporate Banking\n\nThis expertise-driven client unit delivers tailored financing, capital structuring and transaction banking solutions for mediumsized and large corporate clients and financial institutions. Corporate Banking also offers Entrepreneur & Enterprise as a bank-wide service concept for business and wealthy clients, in close collaboration with Wealth Management.\n\n## Group Functions\n\nGroup Functions consists of the following support function departments: Finance, Risk Management, Innovation & Technology, Human Resources, Group Audit, Legal & Corporate Office, Brand Marketing & Communications, Strategy & Innovation and a Sustainability Centre of Excellence. Group Functions is not a client unit, but part of the reconciliation. The majority of Group Functions' costs are allocated to the client units.",

Total bank\n\nNet interest income increased by EUR 213 million to EUR 5,422 million in 2022, compared with EUR 5,210 million in 2021. Excluding large incidentals, net interest income decreased by EUR 70 million, mainly due to a significant decrease in mortgage prepayment penalties, lower Treasury results and asset margin pressure (in residential mortgages and consumer loans), partly offset by higher interest margins on deposits in the final quarter of 2022, recorded in all client units.\n\nNet fee and commission income increased by EUR 114 million to EUR 1,778 million in 2022. This increase related mainly to higher transaction volumes and pricing from personal clients, improved credit card usage in ICS and higher transaction volumes at Clearing due to increased market volatility throughout 2022.\n\nNet income from other operating activities amounted to EUR 249 million in 2022 (2021: EUR 663 million), mainly due to large incidentals in 2022 (loss due to the change in the TLTRO III terms and conditions) and 2021 (gain on the sale and leaseback of the Amsterdam head office).\n\nNet trading income increased by EUR 137 million to EUR 282 million, mainly due to positive trading results at Global Markets (impacted by the significant increase in interest rates and FX developments throughout 2022) and higher CVA/DVA/FVA results (EUR 60 million in 2022 versus EUR 46 million in 2021).\n\nShare of result in equity-accounted investments increased by EUR 84 million in 2022, mainly due to the transaction gain on the divestment of the MP Solar stake in Q3.\n\nDerecognition of financial assets was nil for the year. Last year there was a significant discount to book value on a loan disposal as part of the wind-down of the CIB non-core portfolio, booked in Q2 2021.\n\nPersonnel expenses increased by EUR 134 million to EUR 2,458 million in 2022 (2021: EUR 2,324 million). Excluding large incidentals, these expenses increased by EUR 100 million, mainly due to the 4% salary increase agreed under the new CLA and higher FTE for AML-related activities, IT and strategy execution throughout 2022.",

Excluding large incidentals, general and administrative expenses decreased by EUR 57 million, mainly due to lower regulatory levies and lower expenses from external staffing, partly related to our AML activities.\n\nDepreciation and amortisation decreased by EUR 22 million in 2022, mainly due to a decrease in building and equipment depreciation.\n\nImpairment charges recorded an addition of EUR 39 million for 2022 (2021: release of EUR 46 million), resulting in a cost of risk of 3bps in 2022, compared to -7bps in 2021. Charges were attributable to a more unfavourable economic scenario during the year, partly offset by releases from management overlays and releases in the existing stage 3 portfolio. The releases in stage 3 can be largely attributed to better performance of the existing defaulted portfolio, repayments of stage 3 loans, outflow to the performing portfolio and recoveries.\n\nThere was no revenue from transactions with a single external client or counterparty exceeding 10% of the bank's total revenue in 2022 or 2021.\n\n## Personal & Business Banking\n\nNet interest income increased to EUR 2,707 million (2021: EUR 2,502 million). Excluding large incidentals, net interest income increased mainly due to improved deposit interest margins.\n\nNet fee and commission income rose to EUR 526 million (2021: EUR 438 million), reflecting recovery in credit card usage (ICS) and higher payment service income (due to higher pricing and transaction volume).\n\nNet income from other operating activities was EUR 78 million in 2022 (2021: EUR 23 million), mainly reflecting results from divestments.\n\nPersonnel expenses amounted to EUR 463 million in 2022 (2021: EUR 462 million). The impact of the new CLA was fully mitigated by a decrease in employee FTEs.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by EUR 109 million, totalling EUR 660 million, in 2022. Excluding incidentals, the decrease was mainly due to lower regulatory levies and lower expenses for external staff.\n\nImpairment charges recorded a charge of EUR 73 million in 2022 (2021: release of EUR 23 million), mainly due to modelbased additions because macroeconomic variables deteriorated throughout the year.\n\n## Wealth Management\n\nNet interest income increased by EUR 130 million and amounted to EUR 764 million in 2022. This increase was mainly attributable to improved margins on deposits due to rising interest rates.\n\nNet fee and commission income remained nearly flat, amounting to EUR 595 million (2021: EUR 601 million) as stock markets opened to a strong start in 2022 but then declined throughout the year.\n\nNet income from other operating activities totalled EUR 99 million in 2022, an increase of EUR 66 million. This was mainly due to the results from the sale of ABN AMRO Pensioeninstelling.\n\nPersonnel expenses remained nearly flat at EUR 390 million in 2022 (2021: EUR 387 million).The impact of the new CLA in the last quarter of 2022 was partly mitigated by staff-related provision releases.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses slightly increased by EUR 10 million to EUR 208 million in 2022, mainly due to higher IT expenses and provision amounts, which were offset by lower regulatory levies and lower expenses for external staff.\n\nImpairment charges recorded a charge of EUR 29 million in 2022 (2021: a release of EUR 6 million), reflecting both modelbased increases and stage 3 additions.\n\n2\n\n2",

The effective interest rate method allocates interest, amortisation of any discount or premium or other differences, including transaction costs and qualifying fees and commissions, over the expected lives of the assets and liabilities. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows to the net carrying amount of the asset. As a result, this method requires ABN AMRO to estimate future cash flows, in some cases based on its experience of client behaviour, considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, as well as the expected lives of the assets and liabilities. Interest on loans and advances measured at fair value through profit or loss is also included in net interest income and recognised using the contractual interest rate. Interest income and expense on trading balances is included in net trading income. Interest paid on assets with a negative interest yield is classified as interest expense. Interest received from liabilities with a negative interest yield is classified as interest income.\n\n| (in millions)                                                   | 2022   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Interest income calculated using the effective interest method  | 7,698  | 6,760  |        |\n| Other interest and similar income                               | 236    | 258    |        |\n| Interest income                                                 | 7,934  |        | 7,017  |\n| Interest expense calculated using the effective interest method | 2,455  | 1,397  |        |\n| Other interest and similar expense                              | 57     | 411    |        |\n| Interest expense                                                | 2,512  |        | 1,808  |\n| Net interest income                                             | 5,422  |        | 5,210  |\n\n## Interest income\n\n| (in millions)                                                          | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Interest income from:                                                  |        |        |\n| Financial investments at fair value through other comprehensive income | 525    | 515    |\n| Securities financing                                                   | 454    | 145    |\n| Loans and advances banks                                               | 388    | 58     |\n| Loans and advances customers                                           | 6,308  | 6,238  |\n| Non-trading derivatives - hedge accounting - Cash flow hedges          | 322    | 375    |\n| Non-trading derivatives - hedge accounting - Fair value hedges         | -897   | -1,291 |\n| Other                                                                  | 598    | 720    |\n| Interest income calculated using the effective interest method         | 7,698  | 6,760  |\n| Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss                  | 2      | 4      |\n| Non-trading derivatives - no hedge accounting                          | 78     | 53     |\n| Other                                                                  | 156    | 201    |\n| Other interest and similar income                                      | 236    | 258    |\n| Total interest income                                                  | 7,934  | 7,017  |",

After identifying contracts and their performance obligations, revenue is recognised as an amount that reflects the consideration to which the bank expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised services to clients. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, taking into account discounts and rebates. The amount of revenue recognised is discounted to the present value of consideration due, if payment extends beyond normal credit terms.\n\nRevenue is recognised when a promised service is transferred to the client. Fees and commissions are recognised either:\n\n- \u00c5 At a point in time: the fee is a reward for a service provided at a moment in time; or\n- \u00c5 Over time (amortised): the fee relates to services on an ongoing basis.\n\nABN AMRO engages in transactions where more than one party is involved in providing services to a client. In the case of these transactions, ABN AMRO assesses whether it is a principal or an agent in the transaction by evaluating the nature of its promise to the client.\n\nThe bank is a principal if it controls the promised goods or services before they are transferred to a client. The bank is acting as an agent, of another party, if it provides a service of arranging for another party to transfer goods or services to a client and, as a result, does not control the specified goods or services. Control of goods and services refers to the ability to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all the remaining benefits from, the goods and services.\n\nIf the bank is assessed to be a principal in the transaction, it recognises revenue in the gross amount of the consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the specified goods or services transferred. If, however, the bank acts as an agent, it recognises revenue in the amount of the fee or commission to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for arranging for the specified goods or services to be provided by the other party. The fee or commission may be the net amount of consideration that the bank retains after paying the other party the consideration received in exchange for the goods or services to be provided by that party.\n\n| (in millions)                 | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Fee and commission income     | 2,271  | 2,213  |\n| Fee and commission expense    | 493    | 550    |\n| Net fee and commission income | 1,778  | 1,664  |",

of assets. It also includes the change in fair value of derivatives used for risk management purposes that do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting, ineffectiveness of hedging programmes, fair value changes relating to assets and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss, and changes in the value of derivatives related to such instruments. Dividend income from non-trading equity investments is recognised when entitlement is established. Income from operating lease activities is presented separately from the depreciation expense of the related assets.",

Since 24 June 2022, the interest rate sensitivity of the TLTRO III funding was designated in a hedge relationship. As a result of the change in conditions, the hedge relationship was no longer effective and therefore had to be terminated. The negative mark-to-market of the hedging instrument at the date of termination was EUR 300 million and is recognised in Results from Financial Transactions.\n\n## 7 Net trading income\n\n## Accounting policy for net trading income\n\nIn accordance with IFRS 9, trading positions are held at fair value, and net trading income includes gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of such financial assets and liabilities. The latter comprises gains and losses from trading financial assets and liabilities, interest income and expenses related to trading financial assets and liabilities, and dividends received from trading instruments. Dividend income and dividends from trading instruments are recognised at the dividend announcement date. Net trading income also includes changes in fair value arising from changes in counterparty credit spreads (CVA) and changes in own credit spreads (DVA) where these impact on the value of our trading assets and liabilities. The funding valuation adjustment (FVA) incorporates the incremental cost of funding into the valuation of uncollateralised and partly collateralised derivatives.\n\n| (in millions)                        | 2022   |   2021 |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Interest instruments trading         | 155    |     28 |\n| Equity and commodity trading         |        |      7 |\n| Foreign exchange transaction results | 127    |    110 |\n| Total net trading income             | 282    |    145 |\n\n## 8 Net gains/(losses) on derecognition of financial assets measured at amortised cost\n\n## Accounting policy derecognition of financial assets\n\nThe net gains/(losses) on derecognition of financial assets measured at amortised cost includes gains and losses recognised on the sale or derecognition of these financial assets, calculated as the difference between the carrying amount (which is the amortised cost adjusted for the loss allowance) and the proceeds received.\n\nThe net gains on derecognition of financial assets measured at amortised cost comprise EUR 33 million gains and EUR 32 million losses due to haircuts on loan disposals as part of the non-core wind-down.\n\n## 9 Personnel expenses\n\n## Accounting policy for personnel expenses\n\nSalaries and wages, social security charges and other salary-related costs are recognised over the period in which the employees provide the services to which the payments relate. The accounting policies for pensions and other post-employment benefits are included in Note 31 Pension and other employee benefits.\n\n2\n\n2",

Income tax is recognised in the income statement and in the statement of other comprehensive income in the period in which profits arise. Withholding taxes are included in income tax when these taxes become payable by a subsidiary, associate or joint arrangement on distributions to ABN AMRO. Income tax recoverable on tax-allowable losses is recognised as a current tax asset only to the extent that it is regarded as recoverable by offsetting against taxable profits arising in the current or prior period. Current tax is measured using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised for qualifying temporary differences. Temporary differences represent the difference between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is both a legal right to offset and an intention to settle on a net basis.\n\n| (in millions)                                                                                           | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Recognised in income statement:                                                                         |        |        |\n| Current tax expenses for the current period                                                             | 530    | 675    |\n| Adjustments recognised in the period for current tax of prior periods                                   | -7     | 1      |\n| Total current tax expense                                                                               | 522    | 676    |\n| Deferred tax arising from the current period                                                            | 2      | -41    |\n| Impact of changes in tax rates on deferred taxes                                                        | 1      | -1     |\n| Deferred tax arising from the write-down or reversal of a write-down of a deferred tax asset            | -13    | -24    |\n| Deferred tax prior period                                                                               | -2     | -9     |\n| Previously unrecognised tax losses, tax credits and temporary differences reducing deferred tax expense | -1     | 3      |\n| Total deferred tax expense                                                                              | -13    | -72    |\n| Total income tax expense                                                                                | 509    | 604    |\n\n## Reconciliation of the total tax charge\n\nThe effective tax rate based on the consolidated income statement differs from the theoretical tax rate that would arise using the statutory tax rate of the Netherlands.

This decrease was mainly driven by the AML settlement recorded in 2021, which was not tax deductible. The effective tax rate of 21.4%, compared to the standard Dutch rate of 25.8%, was mainly driven by proceeds and revaluations exempted under the Dutch participation exemption, offset by the non-deductible Dutch bank tax.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\n2",

Recognition is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which ABN AMRO operates and the period over which deferred tax assets are recoverable. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates in future periods, changes to the recognition of deferred tax assets could be required and these could impact our financial position and net profit. No deferred income taxes have been recognised on undistributed earnings of ABN AMRO's subsidiaries, branches and interests in joint ventures.\n\n## Tax losses\n\nThe total accumulated losses available for carry-forward at 31 December 2022 amounted to EUR 1,428 million (31 December 2021: EUR 2,550 million), of which EUR 194 million (31 December 2021: EUR 202 million) was recognised for future tax benefits. The recorded deferred tax asset for tax losses carried forward amounted to EUR 40 million (31 December 2021: EUR 51 million).\n\n## Unrecognised tax assets\n\nCertain amounts of deferred tax assets are not recognised because future taxable profits are not considered probable. Deferred tax assets for an amount of EUR 58 million (31 December 2021: EUR 83 million) have not been recognised in respect of deductible temporary differences of EUR 242 million (31 December 2021: EUR 342 million). In addition, deferred tax assets for an amount of EUR 239 million (31 December 2021: EUR 429 million) have not been recognised in respect of tax losses of EUR 1,234 million (31 December 2021: EUR 2,348 million).\n\nIn 2022, an amount of EUR 1,190 million of unrecognised tax losses was finally written off, due to liquidation of the company and branch holding these losses. No use for these losses could be identified.\n\n## Tax credits and unrecognised tax credits\n\nABN AMRO did not have any carry-forward tax credits at 31 December 2022.\n\n## Loss carry-forward by year of expiration\n\n| (in millions)                          | 2022   | 2023   | 2024   | 2025   | 2026   | 2027   | After    5 years   | No    expiration   | Total   |\n|----------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------------------|--------------------|---------|\n| 2022                                   |        |        |        |        |        |        |                    |                    |         |\n| Loss carry-forward recognised          |        |        |        |        |        |        | 60                 | 135                | 194     |\n| Loss carry-forward not recognised      |        |        |        |        |        |        |                    | 1,234              | 1,234   |\n| Total tax losses carry-forward (gross) |        |        |        |        |        |        | 60                 | 1,369              | 1,428   |\n| 2021                                   |        |        |        |        |        |        |                    |                    |         |\n| Loss carry-forward recognised          |        |        |        |        |        |        | 24                 | 177                | 202     |\n| Loss carry-forward not recognised      | 11     | 2      | 3      | 39     | 3      |        |                    | 2,290              | 2,348   |\n| Total tax losses carry-forward (gross) | 11     | 2      | 3      | 39     | 3      |        | 24                 | 2,468              | 2,550   |\n\nOf the total amount of recognised net deferred tax assets, EUR 20 million (31 December 2021: EUR 57 million) was related to entities that suffered a loss in either the current or preceding year. The recognition of these deferred tax assets is based on a projection of future taxable income.\n\n## Tax related to equity\n\nTax related to components of other comprehensive income and tax related to equity and movements in equity can be found in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income and the Consolidated statement of changes in equity.\n\n## Income tax consequences of dividend\n\nDividends are, in principle, subject to a 15% withholding tax in the Netherlands. In 2022, ABN AMRO Bank N.V. withheld EUR 128 million of dividend withholding tax on dividends paid to its shareholders.\n\n2\n\n2",

Therefore only basic earnings per ordinary share is disclosed. Basic earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the owners of the parent company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. During 2022, a final dividend was distributed for 2021 of EUR 0.61 per share for a total of EUR 553 million and an interim dividend was distributed for 2022 of EUR 0.32 per share for a total of EUR 287 million. For the year 2022, a final dividend has been proposed of EUR 0.67 per share.\n\nDuring the first half of 2022, ABN AMRO Bank N.V. conducted a EUR 500 million buyback programme. The buyback programme resulted in the purchase of 42 million ordinary shares throughout the first half year.

Derivatives held for trading are closely related to facilitating the needs of our clients. A significant part of the derivatives in the trading portfolio is related to serving clients in their risk management to hedge, for example, currency or interest rate exposures. ABN AMRO also offers products that are traded on the financial markets to institutional and individual clients and governments.\n\nDerivatives held for risk management purposes include derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting and those used for economic hedges. A hedging instrument, for hedge accounting purposes, is a designated derivative whose fair value or cash flows are expected to offset changes in the fair value or cash flows of a designated hedged item.\n\nDerivative assets and liabilities subject to master netting arrangements are presented net only when they satisfy the eligibility requirements for netting under IAS 32. ABN AMRO did not have any netted derivative positions in the statement of financial position in either 2022 or 2021.\n\nAs derivative transactions and the related cash collateral held at a CCP are settled on a daily basis, the carrying amount of these positions in the statement of financial position is nil.\n\nFrom a risk perspective, the gross amount of trading assets must be associated with the gross amount of trading liabilities, which are presented separately in the statement of financial position.\n\n|                        | Derivatives held for trading   | Derivatives held for trading   | Derivatives held for trading   |                |          | Economic hedges   | Hedge    accounting   | Total    derivatives   |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------|----------|-------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|\n| (in millions)          | Interest  rate                 | Currency                       | Other                          | Interest  rate | Currency | Other             | Interest  rate        |                        |\n| Exchange traded        |                                |                                |                                |                |          |                   |                       |                        |\n| Fair value assets      | 51                             |                                |                                |                |          |                   |                       | 51                     |\n| Fair value liabilities | 10                             |                                |                                |                |          |                   |                       | 10                     |\n| Notionals              | 15,853                         | 5                              |                                |                |          |                   |                       | 15,858                 |\n| Over-the-counter       |                                |                                |                                |                |          |                   |                       |                        |\n| Central counterparties |                                |                                |                                |                |          |                   |                       |                        |\n| Fair value assets      |                                |                                |                                |                |          |                   |                       |                        |\n| Fair value liabilities |                                |                                |                                |                |          |                   |                       |                        |\n| Notionals              | 1,331,761                      |                                |                                | 886            |          |                   | 101,439               | 1,434,086              |\n| Other bilateral        |                                |                                |                                |                |          |                   |                       |                        |\n| Fair value assets      | 4,035                          | 742                            | 3                              | 46             | 312      |                   | 23                    | 5,161                  |\n| Fair value liabilities | 2,841                          | 817                            | 3                              | 95             | 48       |                   | 334                   | 4,138                  |\n| Notionals              | 206,343                        | 54,289                         | 241                            | 661            | 17,468   |                   | 89,813                | 368,814                |\n| Total                  |                                |                                |                                |                |          |                   |                       |                        |\n| Fair value assets      | 4,086                          | 742                            | 3                              | 46             | 312      |                   | 23                    | 5,212                  |\n| Fair value liabilities | 2,851                          | 817                            | 3                              | 95             | 48       |                   | 334                   | 4,148                  |\n| Notionals              | 1,553,957                      | 54,294                         | 241                            | 1,547          | 17,468   |                   | 191,252               | 1,818,758              |",

The accounting treatment of the hedged item and the hedging instrument depends on whether the hedge relationship qualifies for hedge accounting.\n\nQualifying hedges may be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments. A non-derivative financial asset or liability may be designated as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting purposes only if it hedges the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The hedged item can be an asset, liability, or net investment in a foreign operation that (a) exposes the entity to the risk of changes in fair value or future cash flows, and (b) is designated as being hedged.\n\nThe hedged risks are typically changes in interest rates or foreign currency rates. ABN AMRO's market risk management strategy, which includes interest rate risk and foreign currency risk in the banking book, is described in more detail in the Risk, funding & capital management section.\n\nBoth at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, ABN AMRO assesses whether the derivatives designated in each hedging relationship are expected to be and have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. These prospective and retrospective effectiveness tests are performed by using a regression analysis. ABN AMRO applies the following criteria to assess whether the hedging relationship is effective:\n\n- \u00c5 A regression co-efficient (R squared), which measures the correlation between the variables in the regression; and\n- \u00c5 A slope of the regression line is within a range of 0.80-1.25.\n\nHedge ineffectiveness and gains and losses on components of a derivative that are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recorded directly in the result from financial transactions as part of other operating income. ABN AMRO discontinues hedge accounting when the hedge relationship has ceased to be effective or is no longer expected to be effective, or when the derivative or hedged item is sold or otherwise terminated.\n\n2\n\n2",

        "page_content": "## Application of IAS 39 as endorsed by the European Union\n\nAs permitted by IFRS 9 paragraph 7.2.21, ABN AMRO has elected to continue applying the requirements of IAS 39 as endorsed by the European Union instead of applying the hedge accounting requirements of IFRS 9. The EU-endorsed version of IAS 39 provides relief from certain hedge accounting requirements when compared to the full hedge accounting text of IAS 39. One of these reliefs is that negative credit spreads can be excluded from hedge relationships. ABN AMRO applies this to several micro fair value hedge relationships. Another relief is that the impact of changes in the estimates of the repricing dates is considered ineffective only if it leads to over-hedging. This relief is applied in the macro fair value hedge.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nABN AMRO applies fair value hedge accounting on individual hedged items (micro fair value hedging), as well as on a portfolio of hedged items (macro fair value hedging). Where a derivative financial instrument hedges the exposure to changes in the fair value of the hedged item, the hedged item is adjusted in relation to the risk being hedged. Gains or losses on remeasurement of both the hedging instrument and the hedged item are recognised in the income statement as result from financial transactions, which is part of the line item Other operating income.\n\nHedge effectiveness for fair value hedges is measured as the amount by which the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are different from the changes in the fair value of the hedged item. When a fair value hedge of interest rate risk is terminated, any value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to profit or loss over the original designated hedging period, or taken directly to income if the hedged item is derecognised.\n\n## Micro fair value hedge accounting\n\nHedging instruments designated in individual fair value hedge relationships principally consist of interest rate swaps, interest rate options and cross-currency interest rate swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair value of fixed-rate assets and fixed-rate liabilities due to changes in market interest rates.\n\nThe main sources of hedge ineffectiveness in micro fair value hedges are:\n\n- \u00c5 The effect of the counterparty and the bank's own credit risk on the fair value of the interest rate swap that is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item, which is only attributable to the change in the interest rate;\n- \u00c5 The difference in discounting between the hedged item and the hedging instrument; and\n- \u00c5 Potential differences in maturities of the interest rate swap and the loans or notes.\n\n## Macro fair value hedge accounting\n\nABN AMRO manages the interest rate risk arising from fixed-rate mortgages by entering into interest rate swaps. The exposure from this portfolio frequently changes due to new loans originated, contractual repayments and prepayments made by clients in each period. More than one group (or portfolio) of mortgages can be identified as the hedged item within the fixed-rate mortgage portfolio. To ensure an effective matching of hedged items and hedging instruments, ABN AMRO applies a dynamic strategy in which hedged items are de-designated and re-designated on a monthly basis. The hedge accounting relationship is reviewed and re-designated on a monthly basis.\n\nHedged mortgages are fixed-rate mortgages with the following features:\n\n- \u00c5 denominated in local currency (euros);\n- \u00c5 fixed term to maturity or repricing;\n- \u00c5 pre-payable amortising or fixed principal amounts;\n- \u00c5 fixed interest payment dates;\n- \u00c5 no interest rate options;\n- \u00c5 accounted for on an amortised cost basis.\n\nAt each designation, the mortgage cash flows are allocated to monthly time buckets, based on the expected maturity dates. ABN AMRO models the maturity dates of mortgages, taking into account the modelled prepayments applied to the contractual cash flows and the maturity dates of the mortgage portfolio. If the interest rate swap notional exceeds the expected mortgage notional in any given month, taking into account the uncertainty of the expected mortgage notional by applying a haircut, mortgages that mature in adjacent buckets are designated to the interest rate swaps.\n\nChanges in the fair value of the mortgages that are attributable to the hedged interest rate risk are recognised as fair value adjustments from hedge accounting in the income statement and adjust the carrying amount of the mortgages. The recognised fair value changes in the mortgages partially offset the changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps and therefore reduce the profit or loss volatility that would otherwise arise from changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps alone.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nAt the start of the hedge relationships and at each monthly de-designation, the difference between the fair value attributable to the hedged interest rate risk and the carrying amount of the hedged mortgages is amortised over the remaining life of the hedged item.\n\nIn addition to the sources of ineffectiveness described for micro fair value hedges, the sources of ineffectiveness specifically for macro hedges are:\n\n- \u00c5 The difference between the expected and actual volume of prepayments for the mortgage portfolio to the extent the difference would lead to over-hedging; and\n- \u00c5 The difference in payment frequency between the fixed leg of the hedging instrument and the payment frequency of the hedged item (mortgages).\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nABN AMRO applies cash flow hedge accounting to a portfolio of future cash flows on banking book assets and liabilities the hedged items - and a portfolio of interest rate swaps - the hedging instruments. The hedge relationship is reviewed on a monthly basis and the hedging instruments and hedged items are de-designated or re-designated, if necessary, to maintain an effective hedge accounting relationship.\n\nWhen a derivative financial instrument hedges the exposure to variability in the cash flows from a hedged item, the effective part of any gain or loss on remeasurement of the hedging instrument is recognised directly in other comprehensive income. Hedge effectiveness for the macro cash flow hedge is measured as the amount by which the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are in excess of changes in the fair value of the expected cash flows in the hedge relationship. Any ineffective part of the cash flow hedge is recognised in other operating income immediately. When a cash flow hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the accumulated gains or losses continue to be recognised in other comprehensive income and are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.\n\nThe gains or losses are included in the same line item as the hedged transaction. In the exceptional case that the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the accumulated gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income are recognised in the income statement immediately.\n\nThe main sources of hedge ineffectiveness for cash flow hedges are:\n\n- \u00c5 The effect of the counterparty and the bank's own credit risk on the fair value of the interest rate swap that is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item, which is only attributable to the change in the interest rate; and\n- \u00c5 Potential differences in maturities of the interest rate swap and the loans or notes.\n\nThe hedged items in the macro cash flow hedge are future cash flows, which are derived from the projected balance sheet. This projected balance sheet takes the contractual terms and conditions of financial assets and liabilities and combines these with estimated prepayments, volume growth rates and interest scenarios.\n\nWithin the projected balance sheet, assets and liabilities are grouped on the basis of the specific interest rate index on which they reprice (e.g. one month, three months, six months, twelve months). For each repricing index, all assets and liabilities are allocated on a gross basis to monthly buckets in which they reprice up until their maturity.\n\nThe notional amounts of the interest rate swaps, which can be either pay or receive floating interest, are also grouped per interest rate index and allocated to monthly repricing buckets until their maturity. The hedge relationship is established by designating the interest rate swap cash flows per bucket to the corresponding bucket of projected cash flows of the hedged items. The hedged risk identified is the benchmark rate that applies to the buckets. If there are no projected cash flows available in the corresponding bucket for the applicable benchmark rate, the interest rate swap cash flows are designated to projected cash flows in a bucket with a different benchmark. The availability of projected cash flows in the buckets is not constant over time and is therefore evaluated on a monthly basis. Changes in cash flow projections may lead to a revision of the designation. Back-testing is performed on the interest rate risk models. Historical data are used to review the assumptions applied.",

        "page_content": "## Hedges of net investments in foreign operations\n\nABN AMRO may enter into foreign currency derivatives and currency borrowings to hedge various net investments in foreign operations. For such hedges, currency translation differences arising on translation of the currency of these instruments to euros are recognised directly in the currency translation reserve in other comprehensive income, insofar as they are effective. The accumulated gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement on the disposal of the foreign operation.\n\nIn previous years, ABN AMRO hedged its currency exposure to certain investments in foreign operations by hedging its net investment in these foreign operations with forward contracts. ABN AMRO currently still holds some currency translation reserve for these respective positions, but no longer applies net investment hedge accounting.\n\n## Hedges not qualifying for hedge accounting\n\nThe fair value changes of derivative transactions used to hedge against economic risk exposures that do not qualify for hedge accounting, or for which it is not cost-beneficial to apply hedge accounting, are recognised directly in profit or loss.\n\n## Effect on financial position and performance -

Starting Q2 2022 a hedge relationship was in place for the TLTRO programme. After the change in conditions by ECB in Q4 2022 the hedge relationship had to be terminated. All hedge adjustments have been reverted and the result on the hedges are reported under other income. Please refer to Note 6, Net income from other operating activities, for further details.",

Most of ABN AMRO's financial instruments are linked to euro area benchmarks and, as a result, so are its hedging relationships. Of the non-euro area benchmarks relevant for ABN AMRO, all benchmarks other than USD LIBOR already reformed before 2022. As a consequence, ABN AMRO's hedging relationships affected by the IBOR reform comprise only a small percentage of its total hedging relationships.\n\nA total of EUR 191.3 billion of notional derivatives were part of hedging relationships at 31 December 2022, of which EUR 175.5 billion was linked to EURIBOR and EUR 15.7 billion to other benchmarks. Of the derivative contracts linked to a non-EURIBOR benchmark, a notional amount of EUR 9.9 billion will mature before cessation of the reference benchmark. These contracts are therefore not affected by the IBOR reform. A remaining total of EUR 5.8 billion notional is exposed to benchmarks under reform. The contracts exposed to benchmarks under reform have an average maturity of 2.6 years and are all referencing 3-months USD LIBOR.\n\nAt the year-end, an exposure remained to IBOR rates subject to reform that still have to transition. Trades that refer to an IBOR rate, but mature before a transition is required are excluded from the overview.\n\nFor non-derivative asset contracts, contracts referring to USD LIBOR amounted to EUR 3.7 billion. For non-derivative liability contracts, there were no contracts referring to a USD LIBOR at year-end 2022.\n\nFor derivative contracts, contracts referring to USD LIBOR amounted to EUR 53.9 billion notional (gross value, hence no offsetting effects shown), of which EUR 19.9 billion has no exposure to USD LIBOR after cessation date. The exposure after cessation date is EUR 34.0 billion, of which EUR 8.4 billion relates to bilateral contracts.\n\n## 17  Financial investments\n\n## Accounting policy for financial investments\n\nFinancial investments include financial instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) and financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).\n\n## Accounting policy for financial instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nUnrealised gains and losses on FVOCI assets are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Interest earned, premiums, discounts and qualifying transaction costs of interest-earning FVOCI assets are amortised to income on an effective interest rate basis. When FVOCI debt instruments are sold, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to other operating income in the income statement. The impairment loss resulting from the ECL on FVOCI debt instruments is recognised in the impairment charges on financial instruments in the income statement. The related loss allowance is recognised in other comprehensive income and does not reduce the carrying amount of the FVOCI debt instruments. ABN AMRO's impairment assessment and measurement approach for FVOCI debt instruments is set out in Credit risk management in the Risk, funding & capital management chapter. Fair value changes in equity instruments that are irrevocably designated as FVOCI upon initial recognition are recognised in other comprehensive income and not subsequently reclassified to the income statement.\n\n## Accounting policy for financial instruments measured at fair value through profit and loss\n\nFinancial investments can be designated at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency (an accounting mismatch). ABN AMRO also has financial instruments that are mandatorily measured at fair value because they do not meet the SPPI test.\n\n| (in millions)                                                         | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Financial investments                                                 |                    |                    |\n| Debt securities held at fair value through other comprehensive income | 38,408             | 42,585             |\n| Held at fair value through profit or loss                             | 626                | 580                |\n| Total financial investments                                           | 39,034             | 43,165             |\n\n2\n\n2",

Securities financing consists of securities borrowing and lending and sale and repurchase transactions. Securities borrowing and securities lending transactions are generally entered into on a collateralised basis, with securities usually advanced or received as collateral. The transfer of the securities themselves is not reflected in the statement of financial position unless the risks and rewards of ownership are also transferred. If cash is advanced or received, securities borrowing and lending activities are recorded at the amount of cash advanced (included in loans and advances) or received (due to banks or customers). The market value of the securities borrowed or lent is monitored on a daily basis, and the collateral levels are adjusted in accordance with the underlying transactions. Fees and interest received or paid are recognised on an effective interest rate basis and recorded as interest income or interest expense.\n\nSale and repurchase transactions involve purchases (or sales) of investments with agreements to resell (or repurchase) substantially identical investments at a certain date in the future at a fixed price. Investments purchased subject to commitments to resell them at future dates are not recognised. The amounts paid are recognised in loans and advances to either banks or customers and are shown as collateralised by the underlying security.\n\nInvestments sold under repurchase agreements continue to be recognised in the statement of financial position. Proceeds from the sale of the investments are reported as liabilities to either banks or customers. The difference between the sale and repurchase price is recognised over the period of the transaction and recorded as interest income or interest expense, using the effective interest rate method. If borrowed securities are sold to third parties, the proceeds from the sale and a liability for the obligation to return the collateral are recorded at fair value.\n\n|                                   | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2021   | 31 December 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| (in millions)                     | Banks              | Customers          | Total              | Banks              | Customers          | Total              |\n| Assets                            |                    |                    |                    |                    |                    |                    |\n| Reverse repurchase agreements     | 2,649              | 11,591             | 14,239             | 3,181              | 6,733              | 9,914              |\n| Securities borrowing transactions | 2,900              | 2,893              | 5,793              | 2,973              | 3,251              | 6,225              |\n| Total                             | 5,548              | 14,484             | 20,032             | 6,154              | 9,984              | 16,138             |\n| Liabilities                       |                    |                    |                    |                    |                    |                    |\n| Repurchase agreements             | 219                | 8,359              | 8,578              | 115                | 8,372              | 8,488              |\n| Securities lending transactions   | 474                | 600                | 1,074              | 4                  | 1,003              | 1,007              |\n| Total                             | 692                | 8,960              | 9,652              | 119                | 9,375              | 9,494              |\n\nSecurities financing transactions include balances relating to reverse repurchase activities and cash collateral on securities borrowed.

However, when observable market prices and parameters do not exist, management judgement is necessary to estimate fair value.\n\nFor financial instruments where no active liquid market exists, or quoted prices are unobtainable, recent market transactions are used or the fair value is estimated using a variety of valuation techniques - including reference to similar instruments for which market prices do exist, or to valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow models or option pricing models (e.g. Black Scholes).\n\nWhen portfolios of financial assets and liabilities are measured on the basis of the net exposure to the credit risk of a particular counterparty, any existing arrangements that mitigate the credit risk exposure (e.g. master netting agreements with the counterparty) are taken into account.\n\nUnobservable inputs are estimated using a combination of management judgement, historical data, market practice and benchmarking to other relevant observable market data. The difference between the transaction price and the internal valuation at inception, calculated using a model, is reserved and amortised to profit or loss at appropriate points over the life of the instrument, typically taking account of the ability to obtain reliable external data, the passage of time and the use of offsetting transactions. Where inputs to the valuation of a new transaction cannot be reliably determined, the transaction is initially recognised at its transaction price. Subsequent changes in fair value as calculated by the valuation model are reported as profit or loss or in equity.\n\n- \u00c5 In order to determine a reliable fair value, where appropriate, management applies valuation adjustments to the pricing information derived from the above sources. These adjustments reflect management's assessment of factors that market participants would consider in setting a price, to the extent that these factors have not already been included in the information from the above sources. The main valuation adjustments required to arrive at a fair value are as follows:\n- \u00c5 Credit and debit valuation adjustments. In addition to credit valuation for loans measured at fair value through profit or loss, credit valuation adjustments and debit valuation adjustments are incorporated into derivative valuations to reflect the impact on fair value of counterparty credit risk and how counterparties consider ABN AMRO's creditworthiness respectively;\n- \u00c5 Funding valuation adjustment. The funding valuation adjustment incorporates the incremental cost of funding into the valuation of uncollateralised and partially collateralised derivatives;\n- \u00c5 Own credit adjustment. An own credit risk adjustment is applied to financial liabilities where it is believed that counterparties will consider ABN AMRO's creditworthiness when pricing such instruments;\n- \u00c5 Model valuation adjustments for any known limitations. Management assesses the appropriateness of any model used on an ongoing basis. To the extent that the price provided by internal models does not represent the fair value of the instrument, for instance in highly stressed market conditions, management makes adjustments to the model valuation to calibrate to other available pricing sources.\n\nWe believe our estimates of the fair value are adequate. However, the use of different models or assumptions could result in changes to our reported results.\n\n## Valuation control framework\n\nABN AMRO has designated controls and processes in place for determining the fair value of financial instruments. A process has been designed to ensure there are formalised review protocols for independent review and validation of fair values separate from those businesses entering into the transactions. This includes specific controls to ensure consistent pricing policies and procedures, incorporating disciplined price verification for both market and counterparty risk trades.\n\nThe business entering into the transaction is responsible for the initial determination and recording of the fair value of the transaction. There are daily controls of the profit or loss recorded by trading and treasury front-office staff. A key element of the control environment, segregated from the recording of the transaction's valuation, is the independent price-verification",

Such valuations may be current bid or offer prices in an active market, or may be derived using a model and variable model inputs. These valuations are reviewed and, if necessary, amended by the independent price-verification process. This process involves a team, independent of those trading the financial instruments, performing a review of valuations in the light of available pricing evidence. Independent price verification is frequently performed by matching the business valuations with independent data sources. The minimum frequency of review is monthly, both for trading positions and non-trading positions. The independent price-verification control includes formalised reporting and escalation to management of any valuation differences in breach of defined thresholds. When models are used to value products, those models are subject to a model review process. This process requires different levels of model documentation, testing and review, depending on the complexity of the model and the size of our exposure to the model.\n\n## Valuation techniques\n\nA number of methodologies are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments for which observable prices in active markets for identical instruments are not available. Values between and beyond available data points are obtained by interpolation and/or extrapolation. When valuation techniques are used, the fair value can be significantly impacted by the choice of valuation model and underlying assumptions made concerning factors such as the amount and timing of cash flows, discount rates and credit risk.\n\n## Interest rate derivatives\n\nThis category includes interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, options and forward rate agreements. These products are valued by estimating future cash flows and discounting those cash flows, using appropriate interest rate curves. The exception is interest option contracts, which are valued using market standard option pricing models. The inputs for the discounting cash flow models are principally observable benchmark interest rates in active markets such as the interbank rates and quoted interest rates in the swap, bond and futures markets. The inputs for credit spreads - where available - are derived from prices of credit default swaps or other credit-based instruments, such as debt securities. In other cases, credit spreads are obtained from pricing services. The additional inputs for the option pricing models are price volatilities and correlations, which are obtained from broker quotations or pricing services or derived from option prices. Because of the observability of the inputs used in the valuation models, the majority of the interest rate derivative contracts are classified as level 2. If adjustments to interest rate curves, credit spreads, correlations or volatilities are based on significant unobservable inputs, the contracts are classified as level 3. Exchange traded options and futures are valued using quoted market prices and are hence classified as level 1.\n\n## Foreign exchange contracts\n\nForeign exchange contracts include foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange options and foreign exchange swaps. The majority of the foreign exchange contracts at ABN AMRO are traded as over-the-counter derivatives. These instruments are valued using foreign currency exchange rates. There are observable markets both for spot and forward contracts and for futures in the world's major currencies. The over-the-counter foreign exchange contracts are therefore classified as level 2.\n\n## Government debt securities\n\nGovernment debt securities consist of government bonds and bills with fixed or floating rate interest payments issued by sovereign governments. These instruments are generally traded in active markets and prices can be derived directly from those markets. Therefore the instruments are classified as level 1. Highly liquid bonds are valued using exchange traded prices. Less liquid bonds are valued using observable market prices, which are sourced from broker quotes, interdealer prices or other reliable pricing services. For a minority of the government debt securities, active market prices are not available. In these cases ABN AMRO uses discounted cash flow valuation techniques that incorporate observable market data for similar government instruments. The main inputs are interest rate curves, liquidity spreads and credit spreads. The instruments for which this method applies are classified as level 2. If adjustments to any of the main inputs are made based on significant unobservable inputs, the instrument is classified as level 3.\n\n## Corporate debt securities\n\nCorporate debt securities primarily consist of corporate bonds and other debt securities issued by corporate entities. Most of these instruments are standard fixed or floating rate securities. Corporate debt securities are generally valued using observable market prices, which are sourced from broker quotes, inter-dealer prices or other reliable pricing services. These instruments are classified as level 1. If observable market prices are not available, ABN AMRO uses discounted cash flow",

These instruments are classified as level 2. If adjustments to any of the main inputs are made based on significant unobservable inputs, the instrument is classified as level 3\n\n## Equity instruments\n\nEquity instruments that are actively traded on public stock exchanges are valued using the readily available quoted prices and are therefore classified as level 1. Investments in private equity funds are initially recognised at their transaction price and remeasured to the extent reliable information is available on a case-by-case basis and are classified as level 3.\n\n## Loans and advances at fair value through profit or loss\n\nLoans and advances at fair value through profit or loss primarily consist of contracts with corporate clients where the contractual cash flows do not meet the SPPI requirements or are held in a business model with the objective to generate cash flows from sales. The return on the contracts with embedded derivatives is based on the price of underlying commodity contracts or loans with a floating interest rate. Discounted cash flow models are used to value these contracts. The main inputs are interest rate curves, quoted commodity prices, liquidity spreads and credit spreads. The instruments are classified as level 2. If adjustments to interest rate curves, liquidity spreads and credit spreads are based on significant unobservable inputs, the instruments are classified as level 3.\n\n## Issued debt\n\nIssued debt securities are valued using discounted cash flow models, based on current interest rate curves that incorporate observable inputs. These instruments are classified as level 2. When there are no, or only limited, publicly quoted prices available for these instruments and unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the fair value calculation, these instruments are classified as level 3.\n\nABN AMRO refines and modifies its valuation techniques as markets and products develop and as the pricing for individual products becomes more or less readily available. While ABN AMRO believes its valuation techniques are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions could result in different estimates of the fair value at the reporting date.\n\n## Fair value hierarchy\n\nABN AMRO analyses financial instruments held at fair value in the three categories described below.\n\nLevel 1 financial instruments are those that are valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments.\n\nLevel 2 financial instruments are those valued using techniques based primarily on observable market data. Instruments in this category are valued using quoted prices for similar instruments or identical instruments in markets that are not considered to be active, or using valuation techniques where all the inputs that have a significant effect on the valuation are directly or indirectly based on observable market data.\n\nLevel 3 financial instruments are those valued using a valuation technique where at least one input with a significant effect on the instrument's valuation is not based on observable market data. The effect of fair value adjustments on the instrument's valuation is included in the assessment.\n\nABN AMRO recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change occurred.",

position in a Polish bond, denominated in euros (in Note 17 Financial investments, and part of Other OECD governments), for which the market is relatively illiquid. This bond is valued using a discounted cash flow model. The main inputs are the interest rate curve, liquidity spread and credit spread. The valuation spread is determined using an internal model. The sensitivity analysis is performed using a range of reasonable valuation spreads.\n\n## Interest-earning securities - other\n\nPreference shares are shares for which the dividend is fixed for a period of ten years, after which the dividend is redetermined and the shares can be redeemed. The position is valued using a discounted cash flow model for which the relevant inputs are the interest curve, liquidity spread and credit spread. The liquidity spread and credit spread are unobservable inputs and are derived from similar securities. The sensitivity of the preference shares is determined by using a range of reasonable spreads and by considering the call option that is held by the issuer.\n\n## Equity shares - preferred shares\n\nEquities measured at fair value through profit and loss and classified as level 3 mainly comprise private equity investments. Private equity shares are measured at fair value, applying two calculation techniques:\n\n- \u00c5 Using comparable pricing in accordance with the European Private Equity and Venture Capitalist Association (EVCA) guidelines. This valuation technique is based on earnings multiples of comparable listed and unlisted companies. The fair value calculation of an investment is strongly linked with movements on public equity markets;\n- \u00c5 Net Asset Value (NAV) for fund investments and asset-backed investments. This is determined by using audited and unaudited company financial statements and any other information available, publicly or otherwise. As a consequence, the NAV calculation of an investment is strongly linked to movements in the quarterly performance of the company and can be used as an indicator of fair value.\n\nNew investments are initially valued at fair value. Subsequently, the fair value technique - either the EVCA technique or NAV calculation - is applied for direct investments.\n\nThe sensitivity for using comparable pricing is determined by stressing the earnings multiples in a positive and negative market scenario, whereas sensitivity testing for the NAV calculation based on the quarterly performance cannot be applied.",

For counterparties that do not have an observable credit spread, ABN AMRO applies a proxied credit spread extracted from counterparties of comparable credit quality that do have an observable credit spread. ABN AMRO performs a probability of default assessment for each counterparty and allocates an appropriate internal credit risk measure known as a Uniform Counterparty Rating (UCR).This UCR, which is significant to the entire fair value measurement of the derivative contracts included in the following table of level 3 sensitivity information, is generated internally and is therefore an unobservable input.\n\n|                                                 | Valuation    technique                     | Unobservable  data                             | Carrying  value   | Possible alternative  assumptions   | Possible alternative  assumptions   | Unobservable    data range   | Unobservable    data range   | Unobservable  data base   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| (in millions)                                   |                                            |                                                |                   | Applying  minimum                   | Applying  maximum                   | Applying  minimum            | Applying  maximum            |                           |\n| 31 December 2022                                |                                            |                                                |                   |                                     |                                     |                              |                              |                           |\n| Equity shares                                   | Private equity  valuation   Private equity | EBITDA  multiples                              | 140               | -14                                 | 14                                  |                              |                              |                           |\n| Equity shares                                   | valuation                                  | Net asset value                                | 342               | -34                                 | 34                                  |                              |                              |                           |\n| Interest-earning securities -

Loans and advances for which the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) are measured at amortised cost, i.e. fair value at initial recognition, adjusted for repayment and amortisation of coupon, fees and expenses to represent the effective interest rate of the asset. Loans and advances that do not pass the SPPI test are measured at fair value through profit or loss.

These fair values were calculated for disclosure purposes only. Note that the fair value can be significantly impacted by the choice of valuation model and underlying assumptions concerning factors such as the amount and timing of cash flows, discount rates, credit risk and liquidity risk.\n\n## Short-term financial instruments\n\nThe carrying amounts (net of impairment allowances) of financial instruments maturing within a period of less than three months or that have no contractual maturity are assumed to be a reasonable approximation of their fair value. For certain instruments, behavioural maturities are applied.",

        "page_content": "Short-term financial instruments are classified as level 2 as unobservable inputs (such as inputs to determine credit risk, prepayment risk and liquidity risk) do not have a significant influence in determining the fair value.\n\n## Cash and balances at central banks\n\nCash and balances at central banks are classified as level 1 as these instruments have a short-term nature, prices from an active market are available and no fair value adjustments are made to the carrying amounts.\n\n## Securities financing\n\nSecurities financing includes repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending transactions. Due to the short-term characteristics of these instruments and the value and liquidity of available collateral, the carrying amounts (net of impairment allowances) are considered to approximate the fair value. Securities financing amounts are classified as level 2.\n\n## Loans and advances banks and customers\n\nThe fair value of loans and advances banks and customers is estimated by a discounted cash flow model based on contractual cash flows, using actual yields and discounting by risk-free interest rates. Adjustments to reflect changes in liquidity spreads are applied and prepayment options are included in the estimated fair value. The calculations are adjusted for credit risk by incorporating the expected credit losses over the estimated lifetime of the loan, based on parameters including probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. The loans and advances are classified as level 3 on the basis that unobservable inputs significantly influence the approximated fair values. The loans and advances for which unobservable inputs do not significantly influence the approximated fair values are classified as level 2. Behavioural maturities instead of contractual maturities are used to determine the level classification of a small part of the portfolio.\n\nCash collateral paid to counterparties in relation to Credit Support Annexes (CSA) is included in loans and advances banks and customers. Due to the short-term characteristics of these instruments, fair value is considered to approximate the carrying amounts. The related amounts are classified as level 2.\n\n## Due to banks and customers\n\nThe fair value of instruments such as deposits and borrowings included in due to banks and customers is estimated by a discounted cash flow model based on risk-free interest rates. Adjustments to reflect changes in liquidity spreads are applied. Amounts due to banks and customers are classified as level 3 on the basis that unobservable inputs significantly influence the approximated fair values. The financial instruments for which unobservable inputs do not significantly influence the approximated fair values are classified as level 2. For the majority of the portfolio, behavioural maturities are used to determine the level classification.\n\nCash collateral liabilities in relation to Credit Support Annexes (CSA) are included in due to banks and customers. Due to the short-term characteristics of these instruments, fair value is considered to approximate the carrying amounts. The related amounts are classified as level 2.\n\n## Issued debt and subordinated liabilities\n\nThe fair value of issued debt securities and subordinated liabilities is based on quoted prices. If these are not available, the fair value is based on a market approach in which independent quotes from market participants are used for the debt issuance spreads above the average interbank offered rates (over a range of tenors) that the market would demand when purchasing new senior or subordinated debt from ABN AMRO. Where necessary, these quotes are interpolated, using a curve shape derived from CDS prices.\n\n<!-- image -->",

|\n\n## 23  Group structure\n\n## Accounting policy for business combinations\n\nABN AMRO accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the bank. All items of consideration, including contingent consideration, transferred by ABN AMRO are measured and recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Transaction costs incurred by ABN AMRO in connection with the business combination, other than those associated with the issuance of debt and equity securities, do not form part of the cost of the business combination transaction but are expensed as incurred. The excess of the purchase consideration over ABN AMRO's share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired (including certain contingent liabilities) is recorded as goodwill.\n\nABN AMRO measures the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the fair value at the acquisition date. In a step acquisition, where a business combination occurs in stages and control of the business is obtained in stages, the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree are recognised at fair value when control is obtained. A gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss as the difference between the fair value of the previously held equity interest in the acquiree and its carrying amount. Changes in interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a change of control are treated as transactions between equity holders and are reported in equity.",

Control over an entity is evidenced by ABN AMRO's ability to exercise its power in order to affect the variable returns that it is exposed to through its involvement in the entity. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are taken into account when assessing whether control exists.\n\nThe assessment of control is based on consideration of all facts and circumstances. The bank reassesses whether it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control (power, exposure to variability in returns, and a link between the two).\n\nABN AMRO sponsors entities, including certain special purpose entities, which may or may not be directly owned, for the purpose of asset securitisation transactions and other specific and well-defined objectives. Particularly in the case of securitisations, these entities may acquire assets from ABN AMRO companies. Some of these entities hold assets that are not available to meet the claims of creditors of ABN AMRO or its subsidiaries. These entities are consolidated in ABN AMRO's financial statements when the substance of the relationship between ABN AMRO and the entity indicates that control is held by ABN AMRO.\n\nABN AMRO is mainly involved in securitisations of own originated assets, such as various consumer and commercial financial assets. This process generally necessitates a sale of these assets to a special purpose entity (SPE), which in turn issues securities to investors. ABN AMRO's interests in securitised assets may be retained in the form of senior or subordinated tranches, issued guarantees, interest-only strips or other residual interests, together referred to as retained interests. In many cases, these retained interests convey control, such that the SPE is consolidated and the securitised assets continue to be recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries and special purpose entities are included in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.\n\n## Accounting policy for associates and joint ventures\n\nAssociates are those entities in which ABN AMRO has significant influence on, but no control or joint control over, the operating and financial policies. Significant influence is generally presumed when ABN AMRO holds between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are considered in assessing whether ABN AMRO has significant influence. Among other factors, representation on the board of directors, participation in the policy-making process and material transactions between the entity and the investee are considered to determine significant influence.\n\nA joint venture is an investment in which two or more parties have contractually agreed to share control over the investment. Joint control exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The activities conducted through joint ventures include cash transfers, insurance, finance and leasing.\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures, including strategic investments, are accounted for using the equity method. Under this method, the investment is initially recorded at cost and subsequently increased (or decreased) for post-acquisition net income (or loss), other movements impacting on the equity of the investee and any adjustments required for impairment. ABN AMRO's share of the profit or loss of the investee is recognised in Share of result in equity accounted investements. If ABN AMRO's share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of the investment, the carrying amount is reduced to zero, including any other unsecured receivables, and recognition of further losses is discontinued except if ABN AMRO has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the investee.\n\n2\n\n2",

Retained notes are used for repo transactions and TLTRO, for example.\n\nThe securitisation transactions were primarily used for funding and liquidity purposes. There was no RWA (REA) relief at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: no relief).\n\nDuring 2022, ABN AMRO terminated its last traditional securitisation programme. In such transactions, a foundation (stichting) incorporates a bankruptcy-remote, structured entity, to which the legal title of a portfolio of receivables is sold. As ABN AMRO continued, in this case, to recognise the assets after the legal title had been sold, no derecognition took place. The structured entity had issued notes to fund the purchase. ABN AMRO performed key ancillary roles in all its securitisation transactions, including as swap counterparty.\n\nAfter termination of the securitisation programme, a small position of securitised assets remained.\n\n## Risks associated with the roles in the securitisation process\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk relates to the risk of credit losses on securitised assets. ABN AMRO retains part of the credit risk by retaining notes and other securitisation positions such as liquidity facilities, swaps and first loss tranches. Regulatory capital is held for all retained securitisation positions in accordance with the applicable regulation.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk relates to the risk that ABN AMRO may incur additional cash outflows. Any potential future cash outflows relating to these positions, including collateral requirements, are taken into account within stress tests and are integrated into the liquidity ratios, where required. This includes the potential impact of the liquidity facilities or swap agreements that form part of certain securitisation transactions, most of which relate to transactions where ABN AMRO is the originator of the underlying assets.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\n## Approaches to calculating risk exposure amount\n\nABN AMRO does not achieve significant risk transfers for any of the mortgage securitisations. Therefore, the look-through approach is used and RWA (REA) reduction is not applied.\n\n## Monitoring process\n\nABN AMRO periodically monitors changes in credit risk relating to securitisation exposures. The significance of the amount of credit risk transferred to third parties by securitisation of own originated assets is assessed on a monthly basis in accordance with the regulatory significant risk transfer test. For investments in third-party securitisations, the risk is monitored by reviewing the investor reports of these transactions. Additionally, third-party securitisation positions are included in the firm-wide comprehensive stress tests in which the downgrade and default risks under stressed market conditions are assessed.\n\n## Overview of securitisation positions and securitised assets\n\nThe total amount of assets securitised in securitisations decreased to EUR 2.0 billion at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: EUR 10.5 billion) due to the termination of Dolphin Master Issuer B.V. No securitisation transactions for the purpose of capital relief were originated in 2022.\n\n## Details of total notes outstanding per structured entity\n\nThe following table provides details of the outstanding notes issued by consolidated structured entities established by ABN AMRO for securitisation purposes and which were terminated during 2022.\n\n|                            | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2021   | 31 December 2021   |\n|----------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| (in millions)              | Total notes issued | % of total assets  | Total notes issued | % of total assets  |\n| Category                   |                    |                    |                    |                    |\n| Dolphin Master Issuer B.V. |                    |                    | 9,533              | 2.4%               |\n| Total                      |                    |                    | 9,533              |                    |\n\n## Support to consolidated structured entities\n\nABN AMRO did not provide support, financial or otherwise, to a consolidated structured entity, including when ABN AMRO was not contractually obliged to do so, and nor does ABN AMRO intend to do so in the future.\n\n## Unconsolidated structured entities\n\nUnconsolidated structured entities are entities over which ABN AMRO has no control or significant influence. ABN AMRO is involved with structured entities through securitisation of financial assets and investments in structured entities. Structured entities generally finance the purchase of assets by issuing debt and equity securities that are collateralised by the assets held by the structured entities. The debt and equity securities issued by the structured entities may include tranches with varying levels of subordination. The interest in unconsolidated structured entities increased by EUR 1.1 billion to EUR 5.3 billion at year-end 2022 (2021: EUR 4.2 billion). The interests consist mainly of debt securities in corporate loans of EUR 681 million (2021: EUR 677 million) and mortgage and other asset-backed securities recognised under financial investments of EUR 3.3 billion (2021: EUR 3.2 billion). The maximum exposure to losses from these interests is equal to the total carrying amount.\n\n## Sponsoring of unconsolidated structured entities\n\nAn entity is considered a sponsor of an unconsolidated structured entity if it had a key role in establishing that entity so that the transaction that is the purpose of the entity could occur. No sponsoring occurred during 2022.\n\n2\n\n2",

At each balance sheet date, an assessment is performed to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. Subsequent costs are capitalised if these result in an enhancement to the asset. Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property and equipment, and of major components that are accounted for separately. ABN AMRO generally uses the following useful lives in calculating depreciation:\n\n- \u00c5 Land: not depreciated;\n- \u00c5 Buildings: 30 years;\n- \u00c5 Leasehold improvements: 5 years;\n- \u00c5 Equipment: 5 years;\n- \u00c5 Installations (durable): 10 years;\n- \u00c5 Computer installations: 2 to 5 years.\n\nAt each reporting date, ABN AMRO reviews the carrying amounts of its non-financial assets (i.e. ROU assets, equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets) to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.\n\nFor impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that is largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or cash-generating units. Goodwill arising from a business combination is allocated to cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Value in use is based on the estimated future cash flows, discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or cash-generating unit.\n\nAn impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. In general, ABN AMRO's corporate assets do not generate separate cash inflows and are used by more than one cashgenerating unit. Corporate assets are allocated to cash-generating units on a reasonable and consistent basis and tested for impairment as part of the testing of the cash-generating unit to which the corporate assets are allocated.\n\nImpairment losses are recognised in profit or loss under depreciation and amortisation expenses. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the cash-generating unit on a pro rata basis.\n\nAn impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. For other assets, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.\n\nImpairment losses are recognised in the income statement as a component of depreciation and amortisation expense. Impairment losses are reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined if no impairment loss had previously been recognised.\n\nDepreciation rates and residual values are reviewed at least periodically to take into account any change in circumstances. Capitalised leasehold improvements are depreciated in a manner that takes into account the term and renewal conditions of the related lease.\n\nAssets for which the bank acts as a lessor in an operational lease contract are included in property and equipment. The asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis, over its useful life, to its estimated residual value.\n\n## Accounting policy for leases\n\n## Lessor accounting\n\nWhere ABN AMRO acts as lessor, a distinction is made between operating and finance leases. Leases where the bank transfers substantially all risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the asset to the lessee are classified as finance leases. Leases that do not transfer these risks and rewards are classified as operating leases. Finance leases are recognised as a",

Assets subject to operating leases are recognised at cost in property and equipment. Operating income from finance leases is recognised in a pattern reflecting a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment in the lease.\n\n## Lessee accounting\n\nAll leases, except for low-value leases and leases with a duration of less than one year, are recognised on the balance sheet as a right of use (ROU) asset and lease liability. As a lessee, ABN AMRO enters into various lease contracts, mainly for office buildings and cars that the bank leases for its own use. When accounting for the contracts as a lessee, ABN AMRO separates non-lease components from lease components. Payments such as variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate and non-lease components are not included in the lease liability. The ROU asset is initially measured at cost, which reflects the initial lease liability, adjusted for upfront lease payments, received incentives and initial direct costs. The initial lease liability is equal to the sum of the fixed lease payments, discounted by the incremental borrowing rate.\n\nThe ROU asset is depreciated over the period of the lease, using the straight-line method.\n\nAdjustments to the ROU asset and corresponding lease liability result from remeasurement and/or modification. Remeasurement occurs when there is a change in the lease term or discount rate, or when ABN AMRO changes its assessment regarding purchase, extension or termination options. A lease modification is a change in the scope of the lease, or the consideration of a part of a lease that was not in the original terms and conditions of the lease. A lease modification results in either a separate additional lease or a change in the accounting for the existing lease. In the case of a lease modification not resulting in an additional lease, the lease liability is remeasured by adjusting the carrying amount of the ROU asset and, to reflect the partial or full termination of the lease, recognising any gain or loss in the statement of profit and loss.\n\nExpenses related to short-term leases with a term of less than 12 months and leases of low-value are recognised in the income statement. ROU assets are included in the line item Property and equipment, while the lease liabilities are included in Other liabilities. Depreciation of the ROU assets is included in the line item for depreciation and amortisation of tangible and intangible assets in the income statement, and interest expense on lease liabilities is included in the line item Other interest and similar expense.\n\n## Sale and leaseback transactions\n\nIn a sale and leaseback transaction, the seller-lessee transfers an underlying asset to the buyer-lessor and leases that asset back from the buyer-lessor.\n\n## Seller-lessee accounting\n\nIf the bank is involved in a sale and leaseback transaction as a seller-lessee, the accounting policy described below is from the perspective of a seller-lessee. To determine how to account for a sale and leaseback transaction, the bank first considers whether the initial transfer of the underlying asset from the seller-lessee to the buyer-lessor is a sale in accordance with IFRS 15.\n\nIf a sale and leaseback transaction results in a sale in accordance with IFRS 15, the underlying asset is derecognised and the lessee accounting model is applied to the leaseback. The ROU asset arising from the leaseback is measured based on the proportion of the previous carrying amount of the asset that relates to the rights of use retained by the seller-lessee. Accordingly, any gain or loss that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor is recognised.\n\nThe proportion of the rights of use retained is the ratio between the present value of lease payments at market rates (excluding any future index changes) and the fair value of the consideration for the sale proceeds. The residual proportion is the proportion of the rights transferred.\n\nThe fair value of the consideration for the sale proceeds is equal to the fair value of the underlying asset in the sale-andleaseback transaction. If this does not equal the fair value of the underlying asset, or if the payments for the lease are not at market rates, the bank makes adjustments to recognise the sale proceeds at the fair value. Any below-market terms are recognised as a prepayment of lease payments and any above-market terms are recognised as additional financing provided by the buyer-lessor to the seller-lessee.",

For the purpose of calculating goodwill, the fair values of acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are determined by reference to market values or by discounting expected future cash flows to present value. Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that impairment may have occurred. In the test, the carrying amount of goodwill is compared with the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use, being the present value of the cash flows discounted at a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the risk of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement as depreciation and amortisation expense and are irreversible.\n\n## Software and other intangible assets\n\nThe accounting policy for software and other intangible assets is determined by IAS 38 Intangible assets. Software is amortised over a period of three years, unless it is classified as core application software, which is depreciated over its estimated useful life, set at a maximum of seven years. Only the development phase is capitalised for own-developed software.\n\nOther intangible assets include separately identifiable items arising from acquisitions of subsidiaries, such as customer relationships, and certain purchased trademarks and similar items. In general, the estimated useful life does not exceed ten years. Amortisation rates and residual values are reviewed at least annually to take into account any change in circumstances.\n\n| (in millions)                           |   31 December 2022 | 31 December 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Land and buildings held for own use     |                191 | 211                |\n| Leasehold improvements                  |                 39 | 43                 |\n| Plant & equipment under operating lease |                427 | 533                |\n| Equipment                               |                 81 | 84                 |\n| Right of use assets                     |                241 | 299                |\n| Other                                   |                 10 |                    |\n| Total property and equipment            |                988 | 1,172              |\n\nThe right of use assets consist primarily of real estate.\n\n| (in millions)                              |   31 December 2022 |   31 December 2021 |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Goodwill                                   |                 79 |                 79 |\n| Purchased software                         |                 12 |                 20 |\n| Internally developed software              |                  6 |                  9 |\n| Other                                      |                 12 |                 19 |\n| Total goodwill and other intangible assets |                108 |                127 |",

land and buildings held for own use is estimated at EUR 234 million at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: EUR 283 million). Of this fair value, 100% is based on external valuations performed in 2017 to 2022. Some properties have a lower fair value than the recorded carrying value. No impairment is recorded because these properties are considered corporate assets. The value in use for the cash-generating units within ABN AMRO Group is sufficient to cover the total value of these assets.\n\n2\n\n2",

lessee. In its capacity as lessee, ABN AMRO leases various assets, mainly office properties, cars and equipment that serve to support the bank's operations. The leases have various terms and termination and renewal options. The majority of termination and renewal options are exercisable only by the bank and not by the respective lessor. There are no variable lease payments in lease contracts where ABN AMRO acts as lessee. No covenants are present in the lease agreements and ABN AMRO is not allowed to use leased assets as security for financing purposes. The total cash outflow relating to leases in 2022 amounted to EUR 110 million (2021: EUR 91 million).\n\n## Sale and leaseback of head office at Gustav Mahlerlaan\n\nIn 2021, ABN AMRO completed the sale and leaseback of its head office at Gustav Mahlerlaan in Amsterdam. ABN AMRO is the seller-lessee in this transaction. The buyer-lessor of the office paid a total consideration of EUR 765 million. As part of the sale, ABN AMRO recognised a pre-tax gain of EUR 327 million (EUR 245 million net of tax) in other operating income (Note 6 Net income from other operating activities). As part of the lease, ABN AMRO recognised a ROU asset of EUR 78 million and a corresponding lease liability of EUR 203 million (Note 32 Other liabilities). ABN AMRO will lease back the Gustav Mahlerlaan office for a period of four years before moving to the redeveloped office building at Foppingadreef in Amsterdam Zuidoost. ABN AMRO has an option, which is only exercisable by ABN AMRO, to extend the lease by a further period of one year. As at 31 December 2022, ABN AMRO had not exercised the option to extend the lease.",

The closure is the result of progress being made both on the new owners' redevelopment plans for the site as well as continued progress on the circular repurposing of the materials at another location. As a result of exercising this early exit option, an additional gain of EUR 15.6 million has been recognised in in other operating income (Note 6 Net income from other operating activities).\n\nIn the first four years of the lease contract, the lease is based on 'triple net' conditions, which means that the share of the owner's maintenance costs normally incurred by the lessor will be paid by the lessee. The contractual lease amounts are paid quarterly in advance. The office building at Foppingadreef is currently being redeveloped and work is expected to be completed by the end of 2025. After 2025, ABN AMRO will continue to lease a small part of the Gustav Mahlerlaan office, which will remain the bank's head office for an additional fifteen years, with the option to extend this period by five years. ABN AMRO is also financing part of the sale and leaseback transaction for the first four years of the lease contract.\n\nThe following table shows the maturity of lease liabilities for leases in which the bank acts as lessee, as well as the future undiscounted minimum lease receipts under operating and financial leases where the bank acts as lessor. It also reconciles the total future minimum lease receipts under financial leases and the net investment in the leases.\n\n|                                                       | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2022                          | 31 December 2022                         | 31 December 2022      | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2022            | 31 December 2022                  |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n| (in millions)                                         | Within    3 months | More  than    3 months but  within 1 year | More  than    1 year but  within 5 years | More  than    5 years | Total              | Unearned    finance  income | Net    investment    in the lease |\n| Lease liabilities                                     | 22                 | 66                                        | 224                                      | 52                    | 364                | n/a                         | n/a                               |\n| Future minimum lease receipts under  financial leases | 689                | 1,055                                     | 2,531                                    | 402                   | 4,678              | -281                        | 4,396                             |\n| Future minimum lease receipts under  operating leases | 36                 | 126                                       | 272                                      | 36                    | 469                | n/a                         | n/a                               |\n|                                                       |                    |                                           |                                          |                       |                    | 31 December 2021            | 31 December 2021                  |\n| Lease liabilities                                     | 15                 | 44                                        | 174                                      | 88                    | 320                | n/a                         | n/a                               |\n| Future minimum lease receipts under  financial leases | 771                | 1,124                                     | 2,882                                    | 446                   | 5,222              | -250                        | 4,972                             |\n| Future minimum lease receipts under  operating leases | 42                 | 135                                       | 369                                      | 37                    | 583                | n/a                         | n/a                               |\n\nThe net investment in the leases amounted to EUR 4,396 million (31 December 2021: EUR 4,972 million). The decrease was mainly due to interest rate developments as this leads to less demand for new leasing contracts and more opportunities for early termination and prepayment by clients. ABN AMRO retains risk with respect to its declining portfolio. However, it has been actively de-risking the lease portfolio, mainly in the UK. Furthermore, Asset Based Finance decreased its exposure to certain lease products and client segments by selling these exposures to other market participants, requesting clients to search for alternative funding or demanding prepayments on lease facilities.\n\nIn its capacity as lessor, ABN AMRO leases out various assets. Operating leases in which the bank acts as lessor are included in Property and equipment - equipment. Financial leases in which the bank acts as lessor are included in corporate loans under loans and advances customers. Income from leases in which ABN AMRO acts as lessor is presented in the following table.\n\n| (in millions)                |   2022 |   2021 |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Income from financial leases |    133 |    147 |\n| Income from operating leases |    152 |    163 |\n| Total income from leases     |    285 |    309 |\n\nIncome related to variable lease payments on financial leases amounted to EUR 3 million in 2022.

        "page_content": "## 29  Issued debt and subordinated liabilities\n\n## Accounting policy for issued debt and subordinated liabilities\n\nIssued debt securities and subordinated liabilities are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Hybrid or structured financial liabilities are irrevocably designated upon initial recognition to be measured at fair value through profit or loss. The latter is applied when the instruments are held to reduce an accounting mismatch, are managed on the basis of their fair value or include terms that qualify as an embedded derivative that cannot be separated.\n\nABN AMRO applies IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation to determine whether funding is a financial liability or equity. Issued financial instruments or their components are classified as financial liabilities where the substance of the contractual arrangement results in ABN AMRO having a present obligation to deliver either cash or another financial asset or to satisfy the obligation other than by the exchange of a fixed number of equity shares.\n\nIssued liabilities qualify as subordinated debt if claims by the holders are subordinated to all other current and future liabilities of ABN AMRO and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe valuation of liabilities measured at fair value includes the effect of changes in the bank's own credit spreads. The change in fair value applies to those financial liabilities designated at fair value where own value credit risk would be considered by market participants. The cumulative amount of changes in fair value attributable to credit risk of issued debt is presented as liability own credit risk reserve in equity. Exchange-traded own debt measured at fair value through profit or loss is valued at market prices.\n\nFair value changes are calculated based on a yield curve generated from observed external pricing for funding and quoted CDS spreads\n\nThe following table shows the types of debt certificates issued by ABN AMRO and the amounts outstanding at 31 December 2022. Movements in these debt instruments involve a continual process of redemption and issuance of long-term and short-term funding.\n\n## Issued debt\n\n| (in millions)                                   | 31 December 2022   | 31 December 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Bonds and notes issued                          | 41,313             | 49,619             |\n| Certificates of deposit and commercial paper    | 14,723             | 9,177              |\n| Total at amortised cost                         | 56,036             | 58,796             |\n| Designated at fair value through profit or loss | 223                | 892                |\n| Total issued debt                               | 56,259             | 59,688             |\n| - of which matures within one year              | 19,053             | 16,734             |\n\n| (in millions)                      | 2022  Carrying amount   | 2021  Carrying amount   |\n|------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| Balance as at 1 January            | 59,688                  | 66,949                  |\n| Cash flows                         |                         |                         |\n| Issuance                           | 35,231                  | 30,226                  |\n| Redemption                         | -30,668                 | -36,180                 |\n| Non-cash changes                   |                         |                         |\n| Foreign exchange differences       | 118                     | 1,130                   |\n| Fair value changes own credit risk | -8                      | -20                     |\n| Unrealised gains/(losses)          | -8,451                  | -2,335                  |\n| Other                              | 350                     | -83                     |\n| Balance as at 31 December          | 56,259                  | 59,688                  |\n\nThe amounts of debt issued and redeemed during the period are shown in the Consolidated statement of cash flows.

The issued and outstanding loans qualifying as subordinated liabilities are subordinated to all other current and future liabilities.\n\n## 30 Provisions\n\n## Accounting policy for provisions\n\nA provision is recognised in the balance sheet when ABN AMRO has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is more likely than not that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. If the effect of time value is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market rates and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.\n\nA provision for restructuring is recognised when an obligation exists. An obligation exists when ABN AMRO has approved a detailed plan and has raised a valid expectation in those affected by the plan by starting to implement the plan or by announcing its main features. Future operating costs are not provided for. Provisions for insurance risks are determined by actuarial methods, which include the use of statistics, interest rate data and settlement cost expectations.\n\nProvisions are established for certain guarantee contracts for which ABN AMRO is liable to pay upon default of payment. Expected credit loss allowances of loan commitments and financial guarantees are recognised as provisions under IFRS 9.",

In the second quarter of 2015, ABN AMRO first recognised a provision for compensating clients who had been disadvantaged in this respect and suffered loss or damage.\n\nABN AMRO has set up its own client reassessment process and the related checks and balances with respect to the Uniform Recovery Framework devised by a committee of independent experts ('the Committee') appointed by the Dutch Minister of Finance. Except for a limited number of proceedings relating to the Uniform Recovery Framework before the Dutch courts, ABN AMRO has completed the execution of the Uniform Recovery Framework. The total provision for SME derivatives-related issues consisted of client compensation (EUR 0.6 billion) and project costs (EUR 0.3 billion). The remaining provision amounted to EUR 3 million at 31 December 2022.\n\n## EURIBOR-based mortgages\n\nABN AMRO has sold mortgage loans with floating, often Euribor-based, interest rates to consumers. These rates include a margin charge. Under the applicable terms and conditions, ABN AMRO has the right to unilaterally adjust the margin charge. ABN AMRO's decision to increase the margin charge in 2012 resulted in two class actions, on top of multiple individual cases, being instigated. The central question in these cases was whether ABN AMRO's right in the terms and conditions to unilaterally adjust the margin charge was an unfair contractual clause. On 22 November 2019, the Supreme Court quashed the ruling of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal in the Euribor collective cases. The case was referred to another Court of Appeal (The Hague) in order to be dealt with further.\n\nIn the meantime ABN AMRO and the foundation Stichting Euribar reached agreement on a settlement for clients with Euribor-Woninghypotheek mortgages. All clients who were eligible for the settlement received a personal offer from ABN AMRO and 81% of this group accepted the proposed settlement. Meanwhile, the other foundation, Stichting Stop de Banken, broke off the negotiations aimed at reaching agreement and proceeded with the class action. The hearing at the Court of Appeal in The Hague took place on 9 November 2021.\n\nOn 11 October 2022, the Court of Appeal in The Hague ruled that the amendment clauses were valid and that ABN AMRO was entitled to exercise its power of amendment. The Court of Appeal also deemed the manner in which ABN AMRO exercised its power of amendment to be within the law. This means that ABN AMRO was within its rights to amend the charge and that the increase in the charge was not excessive. The Court of Appeal also rejected all the other complaints made by Stichting Stop de Banken. The ruling applies to clients who did not accept the personal settlement offer made to them by the bank in 2020 or 2021.\n\nStichting Stop de Banken subsequently announced that it would appeal against the ruling and, on 22 December 2022, filed the documents for the Supreme Court appeal. ABN AMRO is currently studying the arguments raised and will respond to this action by the end of Q2 2023.\n\n## Variable interest rates for consumer loans\n\nOn 3 March 2021, the Kifid Appeals Committee confirmed a ruling of the Kifid Disputes Committee about recalculating the variable interest charged to a specific client on a revolving credit. In short, Kifid ruled that ABN AMRO should have followed the market rate when establishing the variable interest rate for certain revolving consumer credits.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nIn light of the Kifid ruling, ABN AMRO reached agreement with the Dutch Consumers' Association (Consumentenbond Claimservice) on 5 September 2021 regarding a compensation scheme for affected clients. In Q3 2022, following a ruling in August 2022 by the Kifid Appeals Committee, ABN AMRO amended the compensation scheme to include interest on interest. ABN AMRO has provisioned around EUR 481 million for the interest to be compensated and the costs incurred in carrying out the scheme. To date, EUR 70 million of this provision has been used, with a remaining provision as at 31 December 2022 of EUR 411 million.\n\nIt is unclear what the exact scope and application of the Kifid ruling is and whether it will have any knock-on effect on other products with variable interest rates, beyond the range of products covered by the compensation scheme. ABN AMRO cannot give a reliable estimate of the (potentially substantial) financial risk of these contingent liabilities not provided for.\n\n## Other provisions\n\n## AML remediation programme\n\nTo address shortcomings, as well as increasingly strict regulations and continuously evolving forms of financial crime, ABN AMRO had already started an extensive, bank-wide AML remediation programme. In 2022, remediation of client files progressed at full speed. The AML remediation programme is expected to be finalised in 2023. The total provision for the AML programme amounted to EUR 50 million at 31 December 2022.\n\n| (in millions)                 | Legal    provisions   |   Credit    commitments | Restructuring  provision   | Other staff  provision   | Provision for  pension    commitments   | Insurance  fund    liabilities   | Other   | Total   |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| At 1 January 2021             | 98                    |                      92 | 226                        | 136                      | 106                                     | 11                               | 258     | 926     |\n| Increase of provisions        | 340                   |                     173 | 35                         |                          |                                         |                                  | 49      | 597     |\n| Reversal of unused provisions | -23                   |                     -51 | -22                        |                          |                                         |                                  | -61     | -157    |\n| Utilised during the year      | -16                   |                      -3 | -67                        |                          |                                         |                                  | -66     | -152    |\n| Transfer between stages       |                       |                       6 |                            |                          |                                         |                                  |         | 6       |\n| Foreign exchange differences  |                       |                       6 | 6                          |                          |                                         |                                  | 1       | 12      |\n| Other                         |                       |                      -1 | -1                         | 2                        | -27                                     | -6                               | 1       | -32     |\n| At 31 December 2021           | 398                   |                     222 | 178                        | 137                      | 79                                      | 5                                | 181     | 1,201   |\n| Increase of provisions        | 156                   |                     151 | 26                         |                          |                                         |                                  | 107     | 440     |\n| Reversal of unused provisions | -37                   |                    -189 | -35                        |                          |                                         |                                  | -13     | -274    |\n| Utilised during the year      | -70                   |                     -49 | -70                        |                          |                                         |                                  | -149    | -338    |\n| Transfer between stages       |                       |                       2 |                            |                          |                                         |                                  |         | 2       |\n| Foreign exchange differences  |                       |                       8 | 5                          |                          |                                         |                                  |         | 14      |\n| Other                         |                       |                       9 |                            | -10                      | -4                                      | 3                                | 2       | -1      |\n| At 31 December 2022           | 447                   |                     154 | 105                        | 128                      | 75                                      | 8                                | 128     | 1,044   |\n\n## 31  Pension and other employee benefits\n\n## Accounting policy for pension and other employee benefits\n\nABN AMRO sponsors a number of pension schemes in the Netherlands and abroad. These schemes are mainly defined contribution plans. The majority of the beneficiaries of the plans are located in the Netherlands.\n\n## Defined contribution plans\n\nFor defined contribution plans, ABN AMRO pays annual contributions determined by a fixed method and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay any further contributions. Contributions are recognised directly in the income statement in the year to which they relate. Actuarial and investment risk are for the account of the participants in the plan.\n\n## Defined benefit plans\n\nFor defined benefit plans, the net obligation of each plan is the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligations and the fair value of the plan's assets.\n\nThe actuarial assumptions used for calculating the present value of the defined benefit obligations include discount rates based on high-quality corporate bonds, the inflation rate, future salary increases, employee contributions, mortality assumptions and rates of employee turnover. The assumptions are based on available market data and management expectations at the end of the reporting period.",

        "page_content": "Plan assets are measured at fair value at balance sheet date and are netted against the defined benefit obligations. Pension costs recognised in the income statement for defined benefit plans consist of:\n\n- \u00c5 service costs;\n- \u00c5 net interest costs determined by multiplying the net defined benefit liability (asset) by the discount rate, both as at the start of the annual reporting period, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments; and\n- \u00c5 curtailments or plan amendments.\n\nDifferences between pension costs and pension contributions payable are accounted for as provisions or prepayments.\n\n## Remeasurement\n\nRemeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset) are actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments (i.e. unexpectedly high or low rates of employee turnover). They are recognised in other comprehensive income and are not recycled to profit or loss in later periods. The actual return on the pension plan's assets is determined after deduction of the costs of managing the assets and any tax payable by the pension plan itself.\n\n## Other employee benefits\n\nSome group companies provide post-retirement benefits to their retirees, such as long-term service benefits and discounts on banking products. Entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period.\n\nThe expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment, using the same accounting methodology as used for defined benefit pension plans. These obligations are calculated annually.\n\nPlans in all countries comply with applicable local regulations concerning investments and minimum funding levels.\n\n## Pension and other employee benefits\n\nAmounts recognised in the income statement for pensions and other employee benefits\n\n|                                                                     | 2022  2021                        | 2022  2021                  | 2022  2021   | 2022  2021                        | 2022  2021                  | 2022  2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------|\n| (in millions)                                                       | Defined post  employment  benefit | Other    employee  benefits | Total        | Defined post  employment  benefit | Other    employee  benefits | Total        |\n| Current service cost                                                | 5                                 | 3                           | 8            | 7                                 | 11                          | 18           |\n| Interest cost                                                       | 2                                 |                             | 2            | 1                                 |                             | 2            |\n| Interest income                                                     | -1                                |                             | -1           | -1                                |                             | -1           |\n| Other                                                               | 12                                | -4                          | 8            |                                   | -3                          | -3           |\n| Total defined benefit expenses in actuarial report                  | 18                                | -1                          | 17           | 7                                 | 8                           | 15           |\n| Other expenses                                                      | -4                                |                             | -4           | -4                                |                             | -4           |\n| Total defined benefit expenses                                      | 14                                | -1                          | 12           | 3                                 | 8                           | 11           |\n| Defined contribution plans                                          | 321                               |                             | 321          | 291                               |                             | 291          |\n| Total pension expenses and other post retirement  employee benefits | 334                               | -1                          | 333          | 294                               | 8                           | 302          |\n\nPension expenses for defined contribution plans consist mainly of the cash contributions to the Dutch collective defined contribution plan.\n\n## Dutch defined contribution plan\n\nThe Dutch defined contribution plan is a collective defined contribution plan, based on an average salary plan.

The decrease of the fair value reserve was attributable to the increased credit spread on financial investments.\n\n## 34  Transferred, pledged, encumbered and restricted assets\n\n## Accounting policy for transferred, pledged, encumbered and restricted assets\n\nTransferred financial assets are arrangements/transactions for which ABN AMRO has:\n\n- \u00c5 Transferred the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset to a third party, or;\n- \u00c5 Retained the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of that financial asset, but has assumed a contractual obligation to pay the cash flows to a third party; or\n- \u00c5 Transferred a financial asset when the counterparty has the right to repledge or to resell the asset.\n\nDepending on the circumstances, these transfers may result in financial assets that either are or are not derecognised in their entirety. Please refer to Note 1 Accounting policies.\n\nPledged assets are assets pledged as collateral for liabilities or contingent liabilities and the terms and conditions relating to the pledge. Encumbered assets are those that are pledged or other assets that we believe to be restricted in order to secure, credit-enhance or collateralise a transaction.\n\nIn principle, pledged assets are encumbered assets. The following differences apply to ABN AMRO:\n\n- \u00c5 Encumbered assets include mandatory reserve requirements with central banks;\n- \u00c5 Encumbered assets exclude assets pledged for unused credit facilities with central banks at the statement of financial position date, i.e. mainly retained mortgage-backed securities.\n\nSignificant restrictions on assets may arise from statutory, contractual or regulatory requirements such as:\n\n- \u00c5 Those that restrict the ability of the parent or its subsidiaries to transfer cash or other financial assets to or from other entities within the group;\n- \u00c5 Guarantees or other requirements that may restrict dividends and other capital distributions being paid, or loans and advances being made or repaid to other entities within the group;\n- \u00c5 Protective rights of other non-controlling interests that may restrict the ability of the bank to access and transfer assets freely to or from other entities within the group and to settle liabilities of the bank.",

In a securitisation transaction utilising true sale mechanics, the bank transfers the title of the assets to SPEs. When the cash flows are transferred to investors in the notes issued by consolidated securitisation vehicles, the assets (mainly residential mortgage loans) are considered to be transferred. The bank had no transferred and associated securitisations at 31 December 2022.\n\n## Securities financing\n\nSecurities financing transactions are entered into on a collateralised basis for mitigating the bank's credit risk exposure. In repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions, ABN AMRO gets the securities returned at maturity. The counterparty in the transactions holds the securities as collateral, but has no recourse to other assets of ABN AMRO.\n\n## Continuing involvement in transferred financial assets derecognised in their entirety\n\nThe bank does not have any material transferred assets that are derecognised in their entirety, but where ABN AMRO has continuing involvement.\n\n## Pledged and encumbered assets\n\nPledged and encumbered assets are no longer readily available to the group to secure funding or satisfy collateral needs or to be sold to reduce the funding requirement. The following activities conducted by ABN AMRO give rise to pledged assets:\n\n- \u00c5 cash and securities provided as collateral to secure trading and other liabilities, mainly derivatives;\n- \u00c5 mortgages and SME loans pledged to secure funding transactions such as covered bonds and securitisations;\n- \u00c5 securities lent as part of repurchase and securities lending transactions.\n\n2\n\n2",

Other restrictions impacting on the bank's ability to use assets include:\n\n- \u00c5 Assets as a result of collateralising repurchase and borrowing agreements (31 December 2022: EUR 20.0 billion; 31 December 2021: EUR 16.1 billion);\n- \u00c5 Assets held in certain jurisdictions to comply with local liquidity requirements and that are subject to restrictions in terms of their transferability within the group (31 December 2022: EUR 0.8 billion; 31 December 2021: EUR 0.8 billion);\n- \u00c5 ABN AMRO Bank N.V. is in general not subject to any significant restrictions that would prevent the transfer of dividends and capital within the group, except for regulated subsidiaries that are required to maintain capital in order to comply with local regulations (31 December 2022: EUR 0.5 billion; 31 December 2021: EUR 0.6 billion).",

        "page_content": "## 35  Commitments and contingent liabilities\n\n## Accounting policy for off-balance sheet items\n\n## Commitments\n\nLoan commitments that allow for draw-down of a loan within the timeframe generally established by regulation or convention in the marketplace are not recognised as derivative financial instruments. Acceptances comprise undertakings by ABN AMRO to pay bills of exchange drawn on clients. ABN AMRO expects most acceptances to be settled simultaneously with the reimbursement from clients. Acceptances are not recognised in the balance sheet and are disclosed as commitments.\n\n## Financial guarantee contracts\n\nA financial guarantee contract requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it incurs if a specified debtor fails to make payment when due under the original or modified terms of a debt instrument. Initial recognition of financial guarantee contracts is at their fair value. Subsequent measurement is at the higher of the amount of the expected credit loss and the amount initially recognised, less - when appropriate - the cumulative amount of income recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events, and present obligations where the transfer of economic resources is uncertain or cannot be reliably measured. Contingent liabilities are not recognised in the balance sheet, but disclosed if the likelihood of an outflow of economic resources is not more likely than not or if the likelihood of an outflow of economic resources is more likely than not, however cannot be reliably estimated.\n\n## Committed credit facilities\n\nCommitments to provide credit take the form of approved but undrawn loans, revolving and underwriting facilities. New loan offers have a commitment period that does not extend beyond the normal underwriting and settlement period.\n\n## Guarantees and other commitments\n\nABN AMRO provides financial guarantees and letters of credit to guarantee the performance of customers to third parties. These transactions have fixed limits and generally extend for periods of up to 5 years. Expirations are not concentrated in any particular period. ABN AMRO also provides guarantees by acting as a settlement agent in securities borrowing and lending transactions.\n\nMany of the contingent liabilities and commitments are expected to expire without being paid out in whole or in part. This means that the amounts stated do not represent expected future cash flows. Additionally, guarantees and letters of credit are supported by varying levels of collateral.\n\nFurthermore, statements of liability within the meaning of Article 403, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code have been issued for a number of ABN AMRO's affiliated companies (see also the chapter on Other information).\n\nThe committed credit facilities, guarantees and other commitments are summarised in the following table. The amounts stated in the table for commitments assume that amounts are fully paid out. The amounts shown in the table for guarantees and letters of credit represent the maximum amount ABN AMRO is exposed to if the contract parties completely fail to perform as contracted.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2\n\n2",

At this time, the outcome of these discussions are still uncertain.\n\nThe annual SRF contribution is a levy introduced by the European Union in 2016. The SRB calculates the SRF contribution based on the information annually provided by the credit institutions within the European Banking Union in scope of SRF. The SRB is of the opinion that ABN AMRO has reported variables to calculate the annual SRF contribution incorrectly over the 2016-2022 period. ABN AMRO disagrees with the SRB's point of view and, as from 2016, has repeatedly and extensively communicated its position with regard to the adjusted amount to the SRB.\n\nThe different points of view held by the SRB and ABN AMRO are due to a differing interpretation of the regulation with regard to the annual SRF contribution. If the SRB continues to disagree with ABN AMRO's position, this could result in an additional contribution of approximately EUR 110 million (before tax) being declared payable in the first half of 2023. In that event, ABN AMRO will challenge the SRB's decision. The outcome of any such challenge is uncertain because the SRF regulation is relatively new and there is little to no case law on the subject. ABN AMRO nevertheless considers it more likely than not that such challenge will be successful. Therefore no provision has been recognised.\n\n## Equity trading\n\nGerman authorities are conducting investigations into the involvement of individuals from various banks and other parties in equity trading extending over dividend record dates in Germany, including several forms of tainted dividend arbitrage (i.e. tainted dividend stripping, including cum/ex and cum/cum) for the purpose of obtaining German tax credits or refunds in relation to withholding tax levied on dividend payments, including, in particular, transaction structures that resulted in more than one market participant claiming such credit or refund with respect to the same dividend payment. ABN AMRO's legal predecessor, Fortis Bank (Nederland) N.V., ABN AMRO and several former subsidiaries were directly or indirectly involved in these transactions in the past in various capacities. Criminal investigation proceedings relating to the activities of these entities and individuals involved at the time were instigated. These proceedings also resulted in search warrants being issued against ABN AMRO. ABN AMRO is cooperating with these investigations, but has no knowledge of the results of any such investigations.\n\nABN AMRO also frequently receives information requests from German authorities in relation to criminal and other investigations of individuals from other banks and other parties relating to equity trading extending over dividend record dates in Germany. ABN AMRO cooperates and provides the requested information to the extent possible. Although a number of subsidiaries associated with these transactions have been sold by means of a management buy-out, legal risks remain for ABN AMRO, in particular relating to administrative offences and criminal and civil law. All material tax issues with respect to ABN AMRO's tax reclaims relating to cum/ex transactions have been settled with the German tax authorities. With",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nrespect to cum/cum transactions, the German Federal Ministry of Finance released two circular rulings dated 9 July 2021 (published 15 July 2021); these contain a change in interpretation of tax legislation compared to previous circular rulings. While these circular rulings, in ABN AMRO's view, contradict case law of the German Federal Tax Court after the circulars were published, the German Federal Ministry of Finance has not withdrawn or amended the rulings, and the German local tax authorities are therefore expected to re-collect dividend withholding tax credited to taxpayers where such credits related to cum/cum strategies. ABN AMRO has received dividend withholding tax refunds that relate to transactions that could be considered to be cum/cum transactions under the new circular rulings. In anticipation of a decision by the German tax authorities, ABN AMRO has, as a precaution, repaid the relevant dividend withholding tax amounts, while retaining its rights to contest any such future decision. Some counterparties of ABN AMRO have initiated civil law claims against ABN AMRO with respect to cum/cum securities lending transactions (some of which are pending before German courts), arguing that ABN AMRO failed to deliver beneficial ownership of the loaned securities to these counterparties and that this resulted in a denial of tax credit entitlement by the relevant German tax authorities. Although ABN AMRO considers it not probable that any such claims will be successful, the possibility that they will succeed cannot be ruled out.\n\nIt cannot be excluded that ABN AMRO or subsidiaries will face financial consequences as a result of their involvement in tainted dividend stripping transactions, in particular corporate administrative fines, forfeiture orders and civil law claims. It is currently unclear, however, as to how and when the German prosecution authorities' investigations will impact on ABN AMRO and its subsidiaries and if, and to what extent, corporate administrative fines or forfeiture orders will be imposed. It is also uncertain whether tax authorities or third parties will successfully claim amounts from ABN AMRO in secondary tax liability or civil law cases. Therefore, the financial impact cannot currently be reliably estimated and no provision has been recorded in this respect.\n\n## Netherlands Public Prosecution Service investigation into Dutch tax matter\n\nThe Netherlands Public Prosecution Service (NPPS) is conducting an investigation regarding transactions that ultimately led to a set-off by a third party of dividend withholding tax credits against its corporate tax liabilities in the Netherlands during the period 2009-2013. The NPPS investigation relates to ongoing tax proceedings in the Dutch courts between the third party and the Dutch tax authority regarding the third party's set-off of dividend withholding tax credits against its corporate tax liabilities. The District Court ruled in favour of this third party in 2018. In 2020, the Court of Appeal overturned the ruling of the District Court and ruled in favour of the Netherlands tax authority. An appeal with the Supreme Court has been filed against the ruling of the Court of Appeal and is currently pending. The NPPS has informed ABN AMRO that it is a suspect in the investigation, due to its involvement in some of these transactions. The NPPS is gathering information for its investigation and ABN AMRO is cooperating with the investigation.\n\nThe timing of the completion of the investigation and the outcome are uncertain. The possibility cannot be excluded that ABN AMRO will face financial consequences as a result of the investigation. However, the potential financial impact of the investigation cannot currently be reliably estimated and no provision has been made.\n\n## Duty of care matters\n\nA number of proceedings have been initiated against ABN AMRO for alleged breach of its duty of care in transparencyrelated standards. Where applicable, provisions for these matters have been made.\n\nThere can be no assurance that additional proceedings will not be instigated or that amounts demanded in claims brought to date will not rise. Current proceedings are pending and their outcome, as well as the outcome of any threatened proceedings, is uncertain, as is the timing of reaching any finality on these legal claims and proceedings. Although the consequences could be substantial for ABN AMRO and potentially affect its reputation, results of operations, financial condition and prospects, it is not possible to reliably estimate or quantify ABN AMRO's exposure at this time. These uncertainties are likely to continue for some time.\n\n## Cross-liability\n\nOn 6 February 2010, the former ABN AMRO Bank N.V. demerged into two entities: NatWest Markets N.V. (formerly known as RBS N.V.) and ABN AMRO Bank N.V. On the division of an entity by demerger, Dutch law establishes a cross-liability between surviving entities for the benefit of the creditors at the time of the demerger. ABN AMRO's cross-liability amounts to EUR 298 million 1 (31 December 2021: EUR 1.2 billion), for which NatWest Markets N.V. has posted collateral of EUR 150 million (31 December 2021: EUR 0.4 billion).",

        "page_content": "## Other contingent liabilities\n\nABN AMRO is involved in a number of legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business in various jurisdictions. In presenting the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements, management estimates the outcome of legal, regulatory and arbitration matters, and takes provisions to the income statement when losses with respect to such matters are more likely than not. Provisions are not recognised for matters for which an expected cash outflow cannot be reasonably estimated or that are not more likely than not to lead to a cash outflow. Some of these matters may be regarded as a contingency. In particular, the following matters are regarded as contingent liabilities:\n\n- \u00c5 ABN AMRO, some of its subsidiaries and some of their client funds had exposure to funds that suffered losses (in some cases, significant losses) as a result of the Madoff fraud. The provision of custodial services resulted in several legal claims, including by the Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities trustee in bankruptcy (Irving Picard) and the liquidators of certain funds, who are pursuing legal action in an attempt to recover payments made as a result of the fraud and/or to compensate their alleged losses. ABN AMRO and certain ABN AMRO subsidiaries are defendants in these proceedings. Even though these proceedings have been ongoing for several years, they are still in a preliminary stage. Hence, it is not possible to estimate the total amount of ABN AMRO's potential liability, if any.\n- \u00c5 The Imtech Group was declared bankrupt in August 2015. ABN AMRO was one of the banks that extended financing to this group and participated in the second rights offering of October 2014. By letter of 20 January 2018, Stichting Imtechclaim and Imtech Shareholders Action Group B.V. held ING, Rabobank, Commerzbank and ABN AMRO liable for alleged misstatements in the prospectuses and for alleged actio pauliana (fraudulent preference). By letter of 28 March 2018, the VEB held parties, including ABN AMRO, liable for damage allegedly suffered by the Imtech investors. On 10 August 2018, ABN AMRO received formal notification from Imtech's trustees that they were seeking to nullify a large number of transactions and claim various damages. The letter aimed to interrupt limitation periods in view of the possible claims against Imtech's lenders, bondholders and underwriting banks. It appears likely that litigation will be started by the trustees in view of this letter and subsequent communications, although the exact timing of this litigation, the amount of the claim and the parties to be summoned are unclear.\n- \u00c5 On 18 October 2018, Eurostar Diamond Traders N.V. (EDT) filed a civil law complaint against ABN AMRO in the Antwerp Court, claiming a provisional amount of EUR 673 million. The amount claimed included an unsubstantiated claim for damages of EUR 600 million on the ground that ABN AMRO and Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) allegedly deliberately caused EDT's demise. Damages of USD 73 million were also claimed for the alleged sale of unsuitable derivatives. EDT and Eurostar Diamond Traders International N.V., EDT's parent company, were both declared bankrupt in a final decision in 2020. EDT's trustees have continued the proceedings against ABN AMRO but have dropped material parts of the original claims and have lowered the claim amount to a provisional amount of EUR 1. The former directors of Eurostar are attempting to become formally involved in these proceedings.\n- \u00c5 First Data Holding (FDH) and some of its group companies have indicated that they believe that one of FDH's subsidiaries, European Merchant Services B.V (EMS), has a claim against International Card Services B.V. (ICS). In spring 2016, FDH claimed for the first time that EMS was entitled to 51% of the proceeds of the sale of Visa Europe in 2015. The alleged claim amounted to approximately EUR 37 million plus interest. In August 2016, ICS refuted this claim. In September 2020, FDH repeated its alleged claim. In October 2020, EMS and FDH (now Fiserv) interrupted the limitation periods relating to EMS's alleged claim. In December 2020, ICS responded by rejecting this alleged claim again. As yet, however, EMS itself has not filed any claim against ICS. As a result, it has to be awaited whether and, if so, when EMS will file such claim.\n- \u00c5 In February 2018, ABN AMRO sold its Luxembourg subsidiary to BGL BNP Paribas (BGL). BGL is now being sued by a Luxembourg fund, LFP I SICAV SIF (LFP), which alleges that the Luxembourg subsidiary, in its capacity as custodian of a sub-fund of LFP (Columna), should have prevented an investment of USD 10 million from being made. LFP is claiming restitution of this amount from BGL in proceedings before the District Court of Luxembourg. BGL notified ABN AMRO of this claim in January 2020 and, in June 2020, summoned it to appear in these proceedings in an intervention procedure. In July 2020, LFP and its Hong Kong subsidiary issued an additional claim against BGL. This claim amounts to USD 38 million and also seems to be in respect of investments relating to Columna. Since August 2020, this additional claim has also been part of the intervention procedure between BGL and ABN AMRO. In August 2020, BGL reserved its (alleged) rights to file possible further claims against ABN AMRO, also in relation to LFP. As a result, it has to be awaited whether BGL will institute any further additional claims in this matter.\n- H In addition, on 2 April 2021, BGL, as the legal successor of the Luxembourg subsidiary, was sued by a fund (SIF A) and the liquidator of SIF A. In brief, it is alleged that a sub-fund of SIF A invested for a period of time in allegedly fictitious loan instruments. ABN AMRO Bank (Luxembourg) S.A. acted as the custodian bank for SIF A for a while within this time period. SIF A alleges that it did not perform its duties properly and therefore considers that BGL, as the legal successor of the Luxembourg subsidiary, should be held liable, together with three other defendants, for EUR 4 million in damages. BGL notified ABN AMRO of this claim in May 2021. In brief, BGL is claiming that any sentence that could be pronounced",

Finally, on 31 May 2021, BGL, as the legal successor of the Luxembourg subsidiary, was sued by an alternative investment fund (AIF SIF). AIF SIF was originally a client of the subsidiary. AIF SIF accuses BGL, in its capacity as the former depositary bank of AIF SIF, of having caused AIF SIF's removal from the list of specialised investment funds by the Luxembourg financial regulator (CSSF). The fund claims damages from BGL in the amount of EUR 126 million. BGL notified ABN AMRO of this claim in October 2019 and July 2021. In brief, BGL is claiming that any sentence that could be pronounced against it in the proceedings against the fund should be borne by ABN AMRO. ABN AMRO rejects the alleged claim by BGL.\n\n## 36  Remuneration of Executive Board and Supervisory Board Remuneration of Executive Board\n\n|                             | 2022         | 2022                     | 2022                          | 2022                        | 2022                | 2022                                   | 2022                                   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------|--------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------|\n|                             | Base  salary | Variable  remuneration 4 | Other  short-term  benefits 5 | Total  short term  benefits | Severance  payments | Total pension-related  contributions 6 | Total pension-related  contributions 6 | Total  |\n| (In thousands)              |              |                          |                               |                             |                     | Post- employment  pension (a) 6        | Short-term  allowances    (b) 6        |        |\n| R.A.J.

The variable compensation consists of a cash element and a share-based element settled in cash. The cash element in the variable compensation plan is recognised in accordance with IAS 19 and the other element qualifies as a cash-settled share-based payment in accordance with IFRS 2.\n\nThe compensation is granted for a certain performance year for 50% in cash and for 50% in share-based compensation settled in cash. The vesting conditions include bad leaver conditions and consist of a deferral period and a retention period until the share-based compensation is settled in cash.\n\nUp to and including the performance year 2019, the share-based compensation settled in cash (depositary receipt) vests for 30% two years after the performance year. The remaining 20% vests in three equal tranches in the third, fourth and fifth year following the performance year. At the end of the vesting period, participants receive the cash value of the five-day average of an ABN AMRO listed depositary receipt (DR).",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nThe share-based compensation settled in cash granted for 2019 and the years before gives the option to request DRs rather than cash. This choice can be made during the quarter in which settlement takes place and is subject to Supervisory Board approval. This equity component in the plan is valued at nil until the request is approved. Participants receive the same amount of fair value, regardless of whether they choose cash or DRs. If participants choose DRs, the value of the DRs is transferred in its entirety from the liability to an equity account. The actual delivery to the participant is expected to take place in the same quarter as the choice is made. ABN AMRO will not issue additional shares for the compensation granted for 2019 and before, but will buy shares in the market when needed. As the purchase of shares is expected to take place in the quarter during which the DRs are delivered, there is no impact on (diluted) earnings per share.\n\nAs from performance year 2020, the DRs were replaced by performance certificates (PCs) as share-based compensation settled in cash. The share-based compensation settled in cash vests for 30% in the first year. The remaining 20% vests in four equal tranches in the second, third, fourth and fifth year following the performance year. At the end of the vesting period, participants receive the cash value of the five-day average of ABN AMRO's share price. Share-based compensation settled in cash granted from performance year 2020 onwards does not include the option to request DRs.\n\nA liability is recognised for the fair value of cash-settled transactions. The fair value is measured initially and at each reporting date up to and including the settlement date, with changes in fair value recognised in employee benefits expense. The fair value is determined using an internally developed model based on the share price and market expectations of future dividends.\n\nThe carrying amount of the liability relating to share-based compensation settled in cash at 31 December 2022 was EUR 7 million (31 December 2021: EUR 9 million). The expense recognised for the DRs and PCs awards during 2022 was EUR 1 million, including retention bonus (2021: EUR 6 million).\n\nThe following table shows the total number of DRs and PCs awarded, forfeited and paid out.\n\n| (In thousands of DRs)          |     | 2022   |   2021 |\n|--------------------------------|-----|--------|--------|\n| Outstanding at 1 January       |     | 854    |    859 |\n| Granted during the year        |     | 385    |    313 |\n| Forfeited during the year      | 11  |        |     12 |\n| Paid out during the year cash  | 444 |        |    279 |\n| Paid out during the year DRs   | 38  |        |     27 |\n| Less: total paid out/forfeited |     | -493   |   -318 |\n| Outstanding at 31 December     |     | 746    |    854 |\n\nThe following table shows the total number of DRs and PCs granted, segmented by the respective vesting period after which the award will be paid out.\n\n| (In thousands of DRs)                   | Up  to    one year   | Between one  and two years   | Between two  and three years   | Between three  and four years   | Between four  and five years   | Total   |\n|-----------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|---------|\n| 31 December 2022                        |                      |                              |                                |                                 |                                |         |\n| Number of granted DRs by vesting period | 379                  | 151                          | 117                            | 58                              | 42                             | 746     |\n| 31 December 2021                        |                      |                              |                                |                                 |                                |         |\n| Number of granted DRs by vesting period | 382                  | 231                          | 116                            | 79                              | 47                             | 854     |\n\n## 38  Related parties\n\nParties related to ABN AMRO Bank include NLFI with control, the Dutch State with significant influence, associates, pension funds, joint ventures, the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board, close family members of any person referred to above, entities controlled or significantly influenced by any person referred to above and any other related entities.

In 2019, Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) acquired all shares in RFS Holdings. However, NLFI has given certain warranties related to its previously owned shares in RFS Holdings and the indemnity agreement continues to exist. RFS Holdings is sufficiently capitalised. Consequently, ABN AMRO has assessed the risk of any shortfall as remote.\n\nTransactions conducted with the Dutch State are limited to normal banking transactions, taxation and other administrative relationships. Normal banking transactions relate to loans and deposits, financial assets held for trading and financial investments, and are entered into on the same commercial and market terms that apply to non-related parties.\n\nTransactions and balances related to taxation, levies and fines in the Netherlands are excluded from the table above.\n\nThe EUR 1.6 billion decrease in financial investments was mainly due to lower Dutch government bonds held. This is part of the liquidity buffer and is held for liquidity contingency purposes.\n\nThe EUR 0.1 billion increase in financial liabilities held for trading is mainly related to higher amounts of Dutch government bonds as a result of primary dealership in the Netherlands and client facilitation. Most of these contracts are hedged with short positions in government bonds.\n\nThe EUR 0.1 billion decrease in derivatives related to liabilities was mainly due to lower lending positions with the Dutch State. Derivatives transactions with the Dutch State relate to the normal course of business.",

ABN AMRO Bank N.V. applies the option as included in Section 2:362 paragraph 8. ABN AMRO Bank N.V. prepares its Consolidated Annual Financial Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU IFRS). Reference is made to the accounting policies section in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements and the respective notes.\n\n## Corporate information\n\nABN AMRO Bank N.V. is registered at Gustav Mahlerlaan 10, 1082 PP Amsterdam, the Netherlands (Chamber of Commerce number 34334259).\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe impairment requirements of IFRS 9 are applicable to financial instruments measured at amortised cost and FVOCI. These requirements also apply to intercompany transactions, which are eliminated upon consolidation. In ABN AMRO Bank's Company Annual Financial Statements, the elimination of expected credit losses on intercompany transactions with subsidiaries is recognised in the carrying amount of the loans and advances and participating interests in group companies.\n\nParticipating interests in group companies are measured at net asset value, determined on the basis of EU IFRS. The share in the results of participating interests in group companies is reported in accordance with the principles of valuation and profit determination that apply to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements.\n\nThe financial statements are presented in euros, which is the functional and presentation currency of the company, rounded to the nearest million (unless otherwise stated).\n\nThe financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.\n\n## 2 Net interest income\n\nNet interest income for 2022 amounted to EUR 3,141 million, an increase of EUR 54 million compared to EUR 3,087 million in 2021.\n\nNet interest income is comprised of interest income from loans, investments and other lending, interest expense on borrowings by ABN AMRO and client accounts, as well as the results from interest rate and foreign exchange contracts entered into for hedging purposes. Interest income from loans and advances customers amounted to EUR 2,116 million (2021: EUR 1,794 million).\n\n## 3 Results from financial transactions\n\n| (in millions)                                   |   2022 |   2021 |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Securities trading and derivatives transactions |    344 |     82 |\n| Foreign exchange transaction results            |    -33 |    -29 |\n| Other                                           |     49 |     59 |\n| Total results from financial transactions       |    360 |    112 |\n\nResults from financial transactions increased by EUR 249 million in 2022 due to an increase in results from net trading income.",

This was partly offset by the increase in the disposal of operating activities and equityaccounted investments related to the sale of ABN AMRO Pensioeninstelling N.V. and ABN AMRO Levensverzekering N.V.\n\n## 6 Personnel expenses\n\n| (in millions)                                      | 2022   | 2021   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Salaries and wages                                 | 1,439  | 1,303  |\n| Social security charges                            | 169    | 151    |\n| Pension expenses relating to defined benefit plans | 13     |        |\n| Defined contribution plan expenses                 | 270    | 244    |\n| Other                                              | 48     | 65     |\n| Total personnel expenses                           | 1,939  | 1,764  |\n\nTotal personnel expenses increased by EUR 175 million in 2022 compared to 2021.\n\nThe increase in salaries and wages of EUR 136 million was mainly due to the 4% salary increase under the new Collective Labour Agreement in combination with higher numbers of FTEs for AML-related activities, IT and strategy execution throughout 2022.\n\nSocial security charges increased by EUR 18 million, mainly due to the increase in FTEs and the effect of the new Collective Labour Agreement.\n\nPensions expenses relating to defined benefit plans increased by EUR 12 million, mainly due to the provision for early retirement scheme.\n\nDefined contribution plan expenses increased by EUR 26 million, mainly due to the increase in FTEs.\n\nOther personnel expenses decreased by EUR 17 million. This was mainly attributable to releases of restructuring provisions.\n\n## 7 Cash and balances at central banks\n\nCash and balances at central banks decreased by EUR 3.9 billion to EUR 56.6 billion at 31 December 2022, mainly due to changes in steering, liquidity and funding needs.",

The decrease relates to the use of the provision.\n\n## Legal provisions\n\nLegal provisions are based on best estimates available at the year-end and taking into account the opinion of legal specialists. The timing of the outflow of cash related to these provisions is by nature uncertain, given the unpredictability of the outcome and the time required to conclude litigation. Any provision recognised does not constitute an admission of wrongdoing or legal liability. Legal provisions increased mainly because of the increase in the provision for variable interest.\n\n## Variable interest rates for consumer loans\n\nOn 3 March 2021, the Kifid Appeals Committee confirmed a ruling by the Kifid Disputes Committee on recalculating the variable interest charged to a specific client on a revolving credit. In short, Kifid ruled that ABN AMRO should have followed the market rate when establishing the variable interest rate for certain revolving consumer credits.\n\nIn light of the Kifid ruling, ABN AMRO reached agreement with the Dutch Consumers' Association (Consumentenbond Claimservice) on 5 September 2021 regarding a compensation scheme for affected clients. In Q3 2022, following an August 2022 ruling by the Kifid Appeals Committee, ABN AMRO adjusted the compensation scheme to include interest on interest. ABN AMRO has provisioned around EUR 481 million for the interest to be compensated and the costs incurred in carrying out the scheme. To date, EUR 70 million of this provision has been used, while the remaining provision at 31 December 2022 totalled EUR 411 million.\n\nIt is unclear what the exact scope and application of the Kifid ruling is and whether the ruling will have a knock-on effect on other products with variable interest rates, beyond the range of products covered by the compensation scheme. ABN AMRO cannot give a reliable estimate of the (potentially substantial) financial risk of these contingent liabilities not provided for.\n\n## Other provisions\n\nOther provisions decreased, mainly due to use of the 'Know Your Client' provision.\n\n## AML remediation programme\n\nTo address shortcomings, as well as increasingly strict regulations and continuously evolving forms of financial crime, ABN AMRO had already started an extensive, bank-wide AML remediation programme. In 2022, remediation of client files progressed at full speed. The AML remediation programme is expected to be finalised in 2023. The total provision for the AML programme at 31 December 2022 amounted to EUR 50 million.",

In prior years, the hedged risk was reported as part of the participating interest, however due to market movements in interest rates, the hedged risk became a negative amount and is therefore reported under other liabilities.\n\n## 23 Equity\n\n## Issued capital and reserves\n\nAt 31 December 2022, the authorised share capital of ABN AMRO Bank N.V. amounted to 2,400,000,000 shares.

The report is written for all stakeholders, including providers of financial capital.\n- \u00c5 Content is based on extensive internal reporting. Where external sources are used, this is clearly indicated in the text.\n- \u00c5 To decide on content, we apply a materiality test: only content that is sufficiently material to the bank's strategy, performance, reputation or value creation is included.\n- \u00c5 Content is reviewed by ABN AMRO's Group Disclosure Committee and approved by the bank's Executive and Supervisory Boards prior to publication. Ultimately, the Executive Board is responsible for the content, accuracy and integrity of the report.\n- \u00c5 In addition to adherence to all regulatory requirements, the Executive Board also confirms that this report has been prepared in accordance with the <IR> Framework.\n- \u00c5 Production of the report is overseen by ABN AMRO's Finance department.\n\n## Scope, boundaries and general reporting guidance\n\n- \u00c5 Unless stated otherwise, this report covers ABN AMRO Bank N.V. (including all business and consolidated entities).\n- \u00c5 Where applicable, the scope and boundaries for metrics and other key performance indicators are included in the main text of the report.\n- \u00c5 Annual data relates to the bank's financial year (1 January - 31 December).\n- \u00c5 Financial information has been prepared in accordance with the IFRS, as adopted by the EU (EU IFRS). Certain sections of the Risk, funding and capital section contain audited information and are considered part of the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements. Audited information in this section is labelled as 'audited'. Unless stated otherwise, all capital metrics and risk exposures are reported under the Basel III (CRD IV/CRR) framework, and all capital figures and ratios, including comparatives, are shown on a fully loaded basis.\n- \u00c5 Company Annual Financial Statements comply with Title 9, Book 2, of the Dutch Civil Code and apply the EU IFRS valuation principles, as also applied in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements. See Note 1 on page 242 for more general reporting guidance on the Company Annual Financial Statements.\n- \u00c5 This report is presented in euros (EUR), ABN AMRO's functional and presentation currency. Figures are rounded to the nearest million and relate to results for the entire ABN AMRO organisation, unless stated otherwise.\n- \u00c5 All financial year-end averages are based on month-end figures. Management does not believe that using daily instead of month-end figures would make a material difference to the annual averages.\n- \u00c5 Due to rounding, certain figures in this report may not tally exactly. In addition, certain percentages have been calculated using rounded figures.\n- \u00c5 Non-financial data is collected centrally; this includes data relating to environmental performance, customer loyalty and employee engagement.\n\nPlease be aware that information provided in this report does not constitute an offer, investment advice or a financial service. Its purpose is not to encourage any person to buy or sell any ABN AMRO product or service. Nor should it be used as a basis for any investment decision. Any such decision can and should be based on the contents of this report, a definite prospectus and other key investor information (if, and to the extent, required).\n\nTo download this report or obtain more information, please visit abnamro.com/annual report or contact us at investorrelations@nl.abnamro.com. Definitions and abbreviations used in this report can be found on pages 343-346 and in the Abbreviations and definitions of important terms 2022.\n\n## Forward-looking statements\n\nCertain sections of this report contain statements that may be construed as forward-looking. These statements are not historical facts, and represent ABN AMRO's beliefs regarding future events, many of which are inherently uncertain and outside the bank's control. These statements apply only at publication date. ABN AMRO does not intend to update or revise statements after publication and assumes no responsibility to do so. Readers should also take into account disclosures made in future interim reports issued by the bank.\n\n## External assurance\n\nExternal assurance for this report was provided by EY (see the Independent Auditors Report and Assurance Report on pages 351-361). ABN AMRO believes that external assurance strengthens the credibility of its reporting, and helps improve internal information gathering, systems and processes. For this report, EY audited the Financial Statements (comprising the Consolidated and Company Annual Financial Statements on pages 236-337). EY also provided limited assurance on the non-financial information included in the front end of this report (pages 6-54) and reasonable assurance on the information\n\n<!-- image -->",

Given our rapidly changing operating environment, we have decided not to publish any interim targets other than operational sustainability KPIs, which play an important role in our climate strategy. Our aim is always to be clear and consistent in our communications with stakeholders.\n\nTargets are supported by operational KPIs at a product level. We have not set targets beyond 2024; all targets are assessed periodically and will be updated for the period after 2024 at the appropriate time.\n\n## Note on value creation\n\n## Our materiality assessment\n\nEvery two years, we conduct an extensive assessment of our operating environment, allowing us to identify our value creating topics, where we believe ABN AMRO has potential to create the most value for its stakeholders. Our 2022 Integrated Annual Report is based on results from the assessment carried out in 2020 (these results were used to steer the bank in 2022). Our 2020 assessment identified nine strategic differentiators, linked to our three strategic pillars.\n\nIn addition to these strategic differentiators, we also identified 27 fundamental value creators, which we consider important for protecting our licence to operate. These fundamental value creators are not directly linked to our strategic KPIs. 1 In 2021 a pulse check was conducted to identify emerging topics and validate the 2020 results. This has not led to an adjusted materiality matrix.\n\nOur 2020 assessment comprised of four distinct steps:\n\n- 1.   We define an initial long list of topics, based on a comprehensive review of media and trend reports, peer disclosures, current reporting requirements and the bank's Risk Event register.\n- 2.  The long list is reduced to a short list, which is then submitted to stakeholders, the bank's Extended Leadership Team and other senior management for prioritisation. Topics are rated according to their 'magnitude' (i.e., potential impact on value creation) and 'likelihood' (i.e. how likely a topic is to bring about this impact) - see materiality matrix.\n- 3.  From the results, we identify our strategic differentiators and fundamental value creators.\n- 4.  Based on the materiality matrix results, an assessment was conducted by Group Strategy & Sustainability and our Strategy Execution Team to define which topics were strategically differentiating to ABN AMRO based on our corporate strategy, strategic pillars and KPIs. The materiality matrix including the classification of strategic differentiators and the KPIs were subsequently validated by the Executive Board.\n\n## Our 2022 assessment for future steering as from 2023\n\nWe conducted our latest assessment in 2022 in order to align the bank's steering on these topics in 2023 with our strategy. This assessment used a double materiality approach (applying both impact materiality & financial materiality) based on the Integrated Reporting Framework approach in combination with own criteria. The own criteria were based on the draft European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) in preparation of the EU's planned Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). 1\n\nOur 2022 assessment comprised four basic steps:\n\n- 1.   We defined an initial long list of topics, based on a comprehensive review, including media and trend reports, peer disclosures, current reporting requirements and the bank's Risk Event register.\n- 2.  The long list was reduced to a short list (containing 28 value-creating topics), using data analysis by applying weights to the different sources used and subsequently ranking the topics by importance. To provide an insideout perspective, this short list was then submitted for prioritisation to:\n- H Representatives of our four main stakeholder groups (clients, employees, investors and society), who were asked to assess significance to stakeholders.\n- H Members of our Extended Leadership Team, who are asked to assess the impact on ABN AMRO's longterm value creation.\n- 3.  We then performed an outside-in analysis to determine our most material topics. 2 The weighting applied was as follows: 25% outside-in; 75% inside-out (as the insideout perspective also contains outside-in views).\n- 4.  These material topics were then linked to our strategic pillars and to specific key performance indicators (KPIs).\n\n- 2 Based on opportunities and threats identified by the bank, current and forthcoming legislation and investor requirements.",

In 2022, we no longer distinguished between fundamentals & strategic differentiators. Five most material topics were identified from a short list of 28 value creating topics.

These  standards contain clear definitions with regard to clients' sustainability policies, practice  and governance and include both environmental and social criteria for labelling a loan or  investment as sustainable. Definitions are often based on current market practice or |\n\nThe overall target for sustainability (acceleration) asset volume is calculated as the sum of sustainability (acceleration) asset volume and sustainability (acceleration) client asset volume, divided by the sum of the outstanding mortgage loan book, corporate loan book and relevant client asset volume. The sustainability (acceleration) volume consists of the sustainability (acceleration) asset volume and the sustainability (acceleration) client asset volume. The sustainability (acceleration) asset volume includes Sustainability Linked Loans, ESG Best in Class and Acceleration Finance Loans. Acceleration Finance Loans are loans that are used to make a positive environmental or social impact in line with sector best practices. As an example, reals estate financing and mortgages are included in the sustainability (acceleration) volume when the real estate has an A-label or higher. For client assets we have aligned our definition of sustainable acceleration client assets with the definitions set in the EU SFDR regulation (article 8 and 9).\n\n<!-- image -->",

The directive was updated on 1 January 2021, which resulted in a new methodology for calculating the energy performance. The energy label figures in this report consist of a combination of energy labels under the old methodology (prior to 1 January 2021) and the new methodology. Buildings from 2016 onwards without a definite energy label are classified under the old methodology and estimated at energy label A. Buildings built after the 1st of January 2021 are classified under the new methodology and estimated at energy label A+++. Both estimates are based on the Dutch Building Decree.\n\nThe category 'no label' consists of properties that are not required to have a label in the Regulation, while 'unknown' means ABN AMRO does not have the label of the property. In the event multiple real estate objects are related to one loan, the amount of the loan has been allocated to energy labels based on the floor area in square metres of the real estate objects. In line with the European Banking Authority's requirements for reporting on financial information, the energy labels are assigned to any immovable property collateral, regardless of the loan/collateral ratio (commonly referred as the loan-to value ratio).\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions (GHG)\n\nGHG emissions for corporate clients\n\nGHG emissions for client assets\n\nGHG emissions for the shipping\n\nGHG emissions for residential mortgages\n\nGHG emissions for commercial real estate\n\n- \u00c5 Scope 1: Direct GHG emissions that occur from owned or controlled sources\n- \u00c5 Scope 2: Indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heating or cooling\n- \u00c5 Scope 3: All indirect GHG emissions (not included in Scope 2) occurring in the value chain, including own operations\n\nand financed emissions\n\nThe financed GHG emissions have been calculated according to the PCAF Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry (2020) for the corporate loan book, mortgage portfolio, and client asset portfolio. Scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3 related to own operations have been calculated in accordance with the guidelines from the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.\n\nThe ISS ESG database has been used as source to collect GHG emissions for our corporate clients. For corporate clients which are not covered by the ISS ESG database the CBS and the PCAF databases have been used, which provide country and sector-specific carbon intensity information. For clients active in renewable energy production from solarpower, windpower or hydropower we have used an emission intensity of 0 as the nature of the activity already implies there is no emissions associated with these activities.\n\nFor the client assets portfolio, the calculations have been made using the ISS ESG database.\n\nThe Poseidon Principles framework has been used as our main source to collect GHG emissions for the shipping portfolio at vessel level. For all vessels which are not covered by the Poseidon Principles framework the CBS and the PCAF databases have been used, which provide country and sector-specific carbon intensity information.\n\nFor mortgages the calculations are based on floor area, (indicated) energy labels and asset type. CBS data for energy consumption has been used to calculate emission factors per square meters. To convert the energy data into carbon emission data, the emission factors provided by CBS have been used. An attribution factor at loan level has been applied which is the ratio of the gross carrying amount and the property value at origination.\n\nFor the commercial real estate portfolio (residential and non-residential) the GHG emissions calculations are based on floor area, energy label and asset type and the corresponding emission factors provided by the PCAF emission factor database. An attribution factor at portfolio level for residential and non-residential commercial real estate has been applied, using the loan-to-market value based on the most recent property value.\n\n## Sectors that contribute most to climate change\n\nSectors that contribute most to climate change\n\nCarbon-related assets\n\nThese sectors are identified by NACE codes A to H and L, which are Agriculture, Mining, Manufacturing, Energy, Water Supply, Construction, Wholesale and Retail Trade, Transport and Real Estate/Built Environment, as specified in Recital 6 of the Commission Delegates Regulation (EU) 2020/1818.\n\nA carbon-related organisation is an organisation that directly takes part in exploration, mining, extraction, distribution or refining of fossil fuels. These organisations can be identified as the companies excluded from EU-Paris Aligned Benchmarks (under Article 12(1) (d)-(g) Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2020/1818). Identification of such an organisation should be done based on revenue split. However, in this Integrated Annual Report this was done only for the client asset portfolio, while for the banking book portfolio these exposures were identified based on the NACE code of the counterparty's principal activity, due to data constraint. The NACE codes used to identify such organisations were: B05.10, B05.20, B06.10, B06.20, B09.10, C19.20, C20.11, D35.11, D35.21, D35.22 and D35.23. Since NACE code D35.11 does not distinguish between renewable and non-renewable energy, but renewable energy should not be labelled as carbon-related, we have excluded all exposures to clients where the principal activity is renewable energy, or the loan specifically finances a renewable energy project.",

The activity:\n\n- \u00c5 Must make a substantial contribution to one of the six environmental objectives.\n- \u00c5 Must do no significant harm to the other five environmental objectives (known as the DNSH criterion).\n- \u00c5 Should not violate minimum social safeguards (MSS criterion).\n\nFor our pilot, we identified climate change mitigation as the main environmental objective (acquisition and ownership of buildings - activity 7.7 in the taxonomy) and considered the DNSH criteria for climate change adaptation. While we did analyse the MSS criterion, this did not apply to household exposures.\n\n## Substantial Contribution\n\nActivity 7.7 in the Taxonomy (Acquisition and ownership of buildings) makes a substantial contribution when it complies with the specific Technical Screening Criteria ('TSC'). The TSC largely depend on 1) the type of building 2) the building permit date being before or after 31 December 2020, and 3) the energy performance. If the date of the building permit was before 31 December 2020, the building should have at least an Energy Performance Certificate class A. For buildings licensed after 31 December 2020, the building must have a Primary Energy Demand of at least 10% lower than the BENG2 (primary fossil energy consumption) standard. Due to data unavailability of the building permit dates, ABN AMRO has assessed the TSC based on building year of the building instead of the building permit date. As an alternative, the building is within the top 15% of the national or regional building stock expressed as operational Primary Energy Demand (PED) and demonstrated by adequate evidence, which at least compares the performance of the relevant asset to the performance of the national or regional stock built before 31 December 2020 and at least distinguishes between residential and non-residential buildings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Do no significant Harm\n\nAn economic activity aligned with the EU taxonomy may not significantly harm any of the remaining five objectives. For residential real estate, only the DNSH check related to Climate Change Adaptation is applicable. We assessed our mortgage portfolio to check which climate hazards are material, taking the high probability of the occurrence of the climate phenomenon into account. The definition of high risk probability of Kennis Centrum Aanpak Funderingsproblematiek (KCAF) is used for foundation risk. For the other risks the definition of the Climate Adaptation Services (CAS) is used. In the data that is available at CAS, the most severe scenario of Koninklijk Nederlands Meteorologisch Instituut (KNMI) is used. This scenario is in line with the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nWe identified material physical climate risks by taking into account the probability of occurrence of the climate risk. The time horizon used in the assessment is 2050. In this risk assessment we have included plans from the Dutch government aimed at mitigating physical risks. Due to data unavailability, we did not take into account the individual adaptation solutions that home owners implement to mitigate the identified climate risks. The material climate hazards for our mortgage portfolio are flooding, wild fire and subsidence risk. As a result, any real estate object for which a material physical risk has been identified is considered non-compliant with the DNSH criteria and is marked as not aligned with the EU taxonomy.\n\n## Minimum Safeguard\n\nThe UN Guiding Principles on Business & Human Rights (UNGPs) and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines only apply to business entities, but do not apply to individuals. This is because business & human rights standards are meant to shape the conduct of enterprises (and reiterate some of the obligations of States), but do not deal with the obligations or the conduct of private citizens or individuals. As such, the Minimum Safeguard criterion does not apply for our exposures to retail clients.",

These are in addition to our own internal policies, controls and\n\n## Regulation\n\n## Current developments\n\nAnti-money laundering and countering terrorism finance legislation (AML/CFT)\n\nInitial Margin phase 6 (EMIR)\n\nEU banking rules (Basel III/IV)\n\nBenchmark Regulation/IBOR\n\n## EU taxonomy of sustainable activities\n\nThe European Commission has presented an ambitious package of legislative proposals to strengthen the EU's antimoney laundering and countering the financing of terrorism rules. The proposals are aimed at, among other things, introducing new rules in the areas of customer due diligence, beneficial ownership, national supervisors' powers and financial intelligence units in the EU member states, as well as transfers of crypto assets and the establishment of a new EU supervisory authority. On 21 October 2022, the Dutch Minister of Finance submitted a bill with amendments to Dutch AML legislation (Wet plan van aanpak witwassen) for discussion in parliament. The bill comprises four main amendments, the most important being the creation of a legal provision allowing banks to jointly monitor their retail clients' transactions involving more than EUR 100. In addition, institutions in scope of the AML legislation will be required to share data on high-risk customers. There will also be a ban for traders on cash payments for goods of over EUR 3,000. The bill is the subject of a public debate on the privacy of retail clients. It is uncertain what the outcome of the public and political discussions will be and how this will affect the bill.\n\nEU margin rules are largely driven by the regulations for margin requirements specified by the BCBS and the IOSCO Working Group. Being one of the legs of the regulatory margin, initial margin is the collateral that covers a party's current and potential future exposure in the interval between the last collection of (variation) margin and the liquidation of positions or the hedging of that exposure following a default by the other party. Application of initial margin rules depends on the regulatory implementation phase of an in-scope entity. ABN AMRO has been included in phase 5 and as such it implemented the initial margin rules by 1 September 2021. This mainly entailed ensuring custodial arrangements and legal documentation with a selection of core counterparts based on the trade exposures. On 1 September 2022, the initial margin rules entered into force for the phase 6 entities. In implementing these rules with its phase 6 counterparties, ABN AMRO has largely chosen the threshold monitoring route which is also permitted by the regulation. This means Global Markets is required to monitor exposures and take action when the agreed level has been reached.\n\nIn late 2021, the European Commission proposed a review of EU banking rules - the Capital Requirements Regulation and the Capital Requirements Directive. This package finalises the implementation of Basel III (including the finalisation of Basel III, also known as Basel IV) taking into account the specific features of the EU banking sector. Apart from ensuring EU banks will become more resilient to potential future economic shocks, the new rules also aim to support the transition to a more sustainable economy, and ensure that the risks involved in this transition are adequately managed by EU banks. The legislative procedures needed to reach agreement on the changes to the EU banking rules are nearing the final stages, while the new rules (including transitional arrangements) are expected to be implemented as from 2025.\n\nIn 2014, at the request of the G20, the Financial Stability Board issued its report 'Reforming Major Interest Rate Benchmarks'. This report sets out several recommendations for strengthening existing benchmarks for key interbank offered rates (IBOR) in unsecured lending markets, and for promoting the development and adoption of alternative nearly risk-free reference rates, where appropriate. These recommendations led to a fundamental review of the key interest rate benchmarks used in global financial markets. Throughout 2022, as in previous years, public authorities in various jurisdictions continued to make progress on reforming or replacing the existing benchmarks in order to ensure a smooth transition, and ABN AMRO's bank-wide project continued to deliver on the changes required. Whilst in previous years the main focus was on adapting to the new discounting regimes for centrally cleared swaps and bilateral counterparties, and to the new rules relating to swaps denominated in CHF, JPY and GBP, 2022 saw the preparation for changes required in relation to USD-Libor-linked contracts such as loans and swaps. The year 2022 also saw a limited start to the repapering of such agreements.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy Regulation entails a classification system establishing a list of activities considered environmentally sustainable. The system is meant to be used by companies, investors and policymakers in their sustainability reporting in order to prevent greenwashing and help companies become more climate-friendly. The EU Taxonomy Regulation covers six environmental objectives. Two of them have already been published (climate change mitigation and adaptation). The remaining four were expected in 2022, but their publication was postponed and is now expected to be published in 2023. Moreover, on 1 January 2023, the delegated act to include nuclear energy and gas in the EU taxonomy entered into force.\n\n- 1 These regulations were selected for inclusion because of their potential impact on ABN AMRO and relations with its main stakeholder groups.\n\nguidelines, aimed at maintaining the highest ethical standards within the bank and protecting our moderate risk profile.

(hereinafter: ABN AMRO or the bank), based in Amsterdam. The financial statements comprise the consolidated and company annual financial statements.\n\n## In our opinion:\n\n- \u00c5 the accompanying consolidated annual financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of ABN AMRO as at 31 December 2022 and of its result and its cash flows for 2022 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (EU-IFRS) and with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code\n- \u00c5 the accompanying company annual financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of ABN AMRO as at 31 December 2022 and of its result for 2022 in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.\n\nThe consolidated annual financial statements comprise:\n\n- \u00c5 the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2022\n- \u00c5 the following statements for 2022: the consolidated income statement, the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows\n- \u00c5 the notes comprising a summary of the significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.\n\nThe company annual financial statements comprise:\n\n- \u00c5 the company statement of financial position as at 31 December 2022\n- \u00c5 the company income statement for 2022\n- \u00c5 the notes comprising a summary of the accounting policies and other explanatory information.\n\n## Basis for our opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law, including the Dutch Standards on Auditing. Our responsibilities under those standards are further\n\ndescribed in the Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.\n\nWe are independent of ABN AMRO in accordance with the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities, the 'Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties' (Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the 'Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten' (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence) and other relevant independence regulations in the Netherlands. Furthermore we have complied with the 'Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants' (VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).\n\nWe believe the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Information in support of our opinion\n\nWe designed our audit procedures in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our opinion thereon. The following information in support of our opinion and any findings were addressed in this context, and we do not provide a separate opinion or conclusion on these matters.\n\n## Our understanding of the business\n\nABN AMRO provides a broad range of financial services to private and business banking clients. These activities are conducted primarily in the Netherlands, with foreign operations mainly related to private banking activities in Germany and France and clearing operations in the United States. The bank is at the head of a group of entities and we tailored our group audit approach accordingly.\n\n## Materiality\n\nWe determined materiality and identified and assessed the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error in order to design audit procedures responsive to those risks and to obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n| Materiality       | EUR 160 million (2021: EUR 160 million)                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Benchmark applied | 0.7% of total equity (2021: 0.7% of total equity)                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|                   | Based on our professional judgment, a benchmark of 0.7% of total equity is an appropriate quantitative indicator of materiality   as equity best reflects the financial position of ABN AMRO and is the basis for determining available regulatory capital. |\n| Explanation       | We determined materiality consistently with the previous financial year.                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n\n<!-- image -->",

The financial information of this group is included in the consolidated annual financial statements.\n\nBecause we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, we are also responsible for directing, supervising and performing the group audit. In this respect we have determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures to be carried out for components. Decisive were the size and/or the risk profile of the components. On this basis, we selected components for which an audit or review had to be carried out on the complete set of financial information or on specific items.\n\nOur group audit mainly focused on significant components of ABN AMRO in the Netherlands, France, Germany and the United States. We have:\n\n- \u00c5 performed audit procedures ourselves at the central group level and at the components in the Netherlands;\n- \u00c5 used the work of other auditors within our EY network when auditing the components in France, Germany and the United States;\n- \u00c5 performed review procedures or specific audit procedures at other components.\n\nWe sent instructions to component auditors, covering the significant areas and the information required to be reported to us. Based on our risk assessment, we determined the level of involvement in component audits. We have visited the component teams in France, Germany and the United States, reviewed key local working papers and conclusions, met with local management teams and obtained an understanding of key processes. We interacted regularly with the component teams during various stages of the audit, using videoconferencing facilities. Where deemed appropriate, we attended component closing meetings with management. We reviewed key working papers of component auditors using the EY electronic audit file platform, screen sharing or copies of work papers submitted to the group audit team.\n\nThrough these procedures we covered in total 96% of the group's total assets and 82% of operating income.\n\nTotal assets (in %)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Operating income\n\n(in %)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBy performing the procedures mentioned above at components, together with additional procedures at group level, we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence about the group's financial information to provide an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Teaming and use of specialists\n\nWe ensured that the audit teams both at group level and at component level included the appropriate skills and competences which are needed for an audit of a listed bank. We included team members with specialized knowledge in the areas of IT audit, forensics, treasury, and sustainability and have made use of our own specialists in the areas of income tax, valuation of derivatives, financial investments and real estate, goodwill impairment testing, credit risk modelling, macro-economic forecasting, regulatory reporting compliance and legal, and actuarial calculations.\n\n## Our focus on climate risks and the energy transition\n\nThe executive board of ABN AMRO (hereinafter 'management') has reported in the section 'sustainability risk' of the Integrated Annual Report how the bank is addressing risks related to climate change, energy transition and the environment, thereby taking into account related regulatory and supervisory guidance and recommendations.",

Furthermore, we read the specific non-financial information on climate risks, eligible assets in the energy transition and carbon reduction and considered whether there is any material inconsistency with the financial statements.\n\nWe describe in our key audit matter relating to the estimation of impairment allowances for loans and advances to customers the audit procedures responsive to the risk related to climate and environmental risk and energy transition. Based on the audit procedures performed, we do not deem climate-related risks to have a material impact on the financial reporting judgments, estimates or significant assumptions per 31 December 2022.\n\n## Our focus on fraud and non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\n## Our responsibility\n\nAlthough we are not responsible for preventing fraud or non-compliance and we cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations, it is our responsibility to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements, taken as a whole, are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n\n## Our audit response related to fraud risks\n\nWe identified and assessed the risks of material misstatements of the financial statements due to fraud. During our audit we obtained an understanding of the bank and its environment and the components of the system of internal control, including the risk assessment process and management's process for responding to the risks of fraud and monitoring the system of internal control and how the supervisory board exercises oversight, as well as the outcomes. We refer to the section 'risk, funding & capital' as included in the Integrated Annual Report of ABN AMRO for management's fraud risk assessment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe evaluated the design and relevant aspects of the system of internal control and in particular the fraud risk assessment, as well as the code of conduct, whistle blower procedures and incident registration. We evaluated the design and implementation, and where appropriate, tested the operating effectiveness of certain of the internal controls designed to mitigate fraud risks.\n\nAs part of our process of identifying fraud risks, we evaluated fraud risk factors with respect to financial reporting fraud, misappropriation of assets and bribery and corruption in close co-operation with our forensic specialists. We evaluated whether these factors indicate that a risk of material misstatement due to fraud is present. We incorporated elements of unpredictability in our audit and we also considered the outcome of our other audit procedures and evaluated whether any findings were indicative of fraud or non-compliance.\n\nAs in all of our audits, we addressed the risks related to management override of controls. We performed procedures among others to evaluate key accounting estimates for management bias that may represent a risk of material misstatement due to fraud, in particular relating to important judgment areas and significant accounting estimates as disclosed in the 'critical accounting estimates and judgments' section of the accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements. We also used data analysis to identify and address high-risk journal entries and evaluated the business rationale (or the lack thereof) of significant extraordinary transactions, including those with related parties. As described in our key audit matter related to the estimation of impairment allowances for loans and advances to customers, we specifically considered whether the judgments and assumptions in the determination of this allowance indicate a management bias. We did not identify a risk of fraud in revenue recognition.\n\nWe considered available information and made enquiries of relevant executives (including internal audit, legal, security affairs, compliance, risk management and human resources), business line management and the supervisory board.\n\nThe fraud risks we identified, enquiries and other available information did not lead to specific indications of fraud or suspected fraud potentially materially impacting the financial statements.\n\n## Our audit response related to risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations\n\nABN AMRO is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements, including financial reporting standards, corporate tax law and various banking supervisory regulations. Also, ABN AMRO is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in\n\n0\n\n2\n\n2",

Examples are laws and regulations in respect of anti-money laundering ('AML'), sanctions, customer care and market transparency.\n\nWe performed audit procedures regarding compliance with the provisions of those laws and regulations that have a direct effect on the determination of material amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Furthermore, we assessed factors related to the risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements. This includes our industry experience, enquiries of relevant executives, internal audit, legal, compliance, risk management and human resources, business line management, executive board and supervisory board, reading minutes, inspection of internal audit and compliance reports and performing substantive tests of details of classes of transactions, account balances and disclosures.\n\nWe inspected lawyers' letters and correspondence with regulatory authorities and remained alert to any indication of (suspected) non-compliance throughout the audit. In case of potential non-compliance with laws and regulations that may have a material effect on the financial statements, we assessed whether ABN AMRO has an adequate process in place to evaluate the impact of non-compliance for its activities and financial reporting and, where relevant, whether ABN AMRO implemented remediation plans. Finally, we obtained written representations that all known instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations have been disclosed to us. Specifically with regard to the progress on the AML remediation activities, we make reference to the key audit matter on estimation of other provisions and contingent liabilities and related disclosures.\n\n## Our audit response related to going concern\n\nAs disclosed in the 'basis of preparation' of the notes to the consolidated annual financial statements, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. When preparing the financial statements, management made a specific assessment of ABN AMRO's ability to continue as a going concern and to continue its operations for at least the next 12 months. We discussed and evaluated this specific assessment with management, exercising professional judgment and maintaining professional scepticism. We considered whether management's going concern assessment, based on our knowledge and understanding obtained through our audit of the financial statements or otherwise, contains all relevant events and conditions that may cast significant doubt on the bank's ability to continue as a going concern. Furthermore, we assessed the impact that such events and conditions may have on the bank's operations and forecasted cash flows, with a focus on whether the bank meets the regulatory solvency and liquidity requirements. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.\n\nBased on our procedures performed, we did not identify material uncertainties about going concern for the next 12 months. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause a bank to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n## Our key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements. We have communicated the key audit matters to the supervisory board. The key audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all matters discussed. In comparison with the previous year, the nature of our key audit matters remained unchanged.",

Impairment allowances represent the company's best estimate of expected credit losses calculated in accordance with IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments'. At 31 December 2022, the gross loan portfolio of ABN AMRO amounts to EUR 246 billion. The allowances for expected credit losses of EUR 2 billion are deducted from the gross loan balance and disclosed in Note 21 to the financial statements and in the sections credit risk management and credit risk review in the integrated annual report.\n\nThe expected credit losses are calculated based on risk staging of loans, using assumptions such as the probability of default, loss given default, macro-economic scenarios and other forward-looking information. ABN AMRO also recognizes certain expert overlays, among others for uncertainties in the macro-economic environment resulting from the war in Ukraine and the potential impact of the government's nitrogen reducing measures on clients in livestock farming in the Netherlands.\n\nThe determination of impairment allowances is a key area of judgment for management. The determination of the individual or collective recoverability of loans and advances to customers is subject to inherent estimation uncertainty. This also involves setting assumptions and determining scenarios for macro-economic developments, geopolitical trends, climate and other environmental related factors.\n\nGiven the materiality of the loans and advances to customers of ABN AMRO, the complex accounting requirements with respect to calculating allowances for expected credit losses, the subjectivity involved in the judgments made and the inherent risk of management override, we considered this to be a key audit matter.\n\nOur audit procedures included, amongst others, evaluating the appropriateness of ABN AMRO's accounting policies related to expected credit losses according to IFRS 9. We also obtained an understanding of the impairment allowance process, evaluated the design and tested operating effectiveness of internal controls in respect of expected credit loss calculations. We performed substantive procedures, including the reconciliation of the data used in the allowance calculations and disclosures to source systems.\n\nFor individually assessed loan impairment allowances, we selected individual loan files across all stages and performed detailed credit file reviews to assess whether the bank correctly applied its credit risk and staging policy. We challenged the applied recovery scenarios and the weighting of these scenarios. With the support of our valuation specialists, we assessed the assumptions underlying the loan impairment calculation, such as estimated future cash flows and collateral valuations. Furthermore, we agreed the data used to source systems and underlying documentation and we reperformed the impairment calculations to assess the mathematical accuracy.\n\nFurther, with the support of our internal modelling specialists, we assessed the appropriateness of the models used by ABN AMRO for collectively determined impairment allowances and verified whether the models were adequately designed, implemented and periodically validated. We performed an overall assessment of the provision levels by risk stage to determine if they were reasonable considering the risk profile of the loan and advances portfolios, arrears management and credit risk management practices. We challenged the criteria used to allocate loans to risk stage 1, 2 or 3 in accordance with IFRS 9 and tested a sample of loans on appropriate stage allocation. Finally, we assessed the retrospective review procedures performed by management which compare modelled predictions to actual results and expert overlays. To assess the estimation uncertainty inherent in the calculations, we developed our independent range of estimates for a sample of models.\n\nRegarding the application of macro-economic scenarios and forward-looking information, we assessed with the support of our internal economic specialists the base case and alternative economic scenarios. We considered the impact of the uncertainties in geopolitical trends, climate and other environmental related factors. This included challenging probability weights and the severity and magnitude of modelled downside scenarios, as well as assessing the sensitivity of changes in the assumptions in the calculations. We tested the appropriateness of expert overlays and post model adjustments and recalculated a sample. We also considered the impact of the expert overlays and post model adjustments based on findings from regulatory inspections, industry sector trends, product wind-down decisions and considered the ongoing process of model redevelopments at ABN AMRO.\n\nFinally, we evaluated the adequacy of the related disclosures, as included in Note 21 to the financial statements and in the risk management section of the integrated annual report. In particular we evaluated that disclosures adequately convey the degree of estimation uncertainty and the range of possible outcomes under the different economic scenarios.\n\nBased on our procedures performed we consider the estimation of and disclosures on the impairment allowances for loans and advances to customers to be reasonable and in compliance with EU-IFRS.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Where applicable, we tested internal controls related to cloud computing and third-party service providers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Key observations   | Our testing of the general IT controls and the substantive tests performed, provided sufficient evidence to enable us to rely on  the adequate and continued electronic data processing relevant for our audit of the financial statements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |",

By performing these procedures, we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 and Section 2:135b sub-Section 7 of the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The scope of the procedures performed is substantially less than the scope of those performed in our audit of the financial statements.\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the other information, including the management report in accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code and other information required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.

The requirements for this are set out in the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 with regard to regulatory\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntechnical standards on the specification of a single electronic reporting format (hereinafter: the RTS on ESEF).\n\nIn our opinion, the integrated annual report, prepared in the XHTML format, including the partially marked-up consolidated annual financial statements, as included in the reporting package by ABN AMRO, complies in all material respects with the RTS on ESEF.\n\nManagement is responsible for preparing the integrated annual report, including the financial statements, in accordance with the RTS on ESEF, whereby management combines the various components into a single reporting package.\n\nOur responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance for our opinion whether the integrated annual report in this reporting package complies with the RTS on ESEF.\n\nWe performed our examination in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 3950N on assurance engagements relating to compliance with criteria for digital reporting.

Based on the financial reporting frameworks mentioned, management should prepare the financial statements using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Management should disclose events and circumstances that may cast significant doubt on the bank's ability to continue as a going concern in the financial statements.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the bank's financial reporting process.\n\n## Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objective is to plan and perform the audit engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence for our opinion. Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not detect all material errors and fraud during our audit.\n\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. The materiality affects the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and the evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements on our opinion.\n\nWe have exercised professional judgment and have maintained professional scepticism throughout the audit, in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical requirements and independence requirements. The 'Information in support of our opinion' section above includes an informative summary of our responsibilities and the work performed as the basis for our opinion. Our audit further included among others:\n\n- \u00c5 Performing audit procedures responsive to the risks identified, and obtaining audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion\n- \u00c5 Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the bank's internal control\n- \u00c5 Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management\n- \u00c5 Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures\n- \u00c5 Evaluating whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation\n\n## Communication\n\nWe communicate with the supervisory board regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant findings in internal control that we identify during our audit. In this respect we also submit an additional report to the audit committee of the supervisory board in accordance with Article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest entities. The information included in this additional report is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor's report.\n\nWe provide the supervisory board with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the supervisory board, we determine the key audit matters: those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, not communicating the matter is in the public interest.\n\nAmsterdam, 7 March 2023\n\n## Ernst & Young Accountants LLP\n\nsigned by A.B.

A review is aimed at obtaining a limited level of assurance.\n\nFurthermore we have audited the section 'Our valuecreating topics' as included in the non-financial information on page 20 of the Integrated Annual Report. An audit is aimed at obtaining a reasonable level of assurance.\n\nBased on our review procedures performed nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the non-financial information is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the reporting criteria as included in the section 'Reporting criteria'.\n\nIn our opinion the section 'Our value-creating topics' is prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the reporting criteria as included in the section Reporting criteria.\n\nThe non-financial information in scope is included in the chapters 'Introduction' and 'Strategy and value creation' (up to and including page 43) of the Integrated Annual Report (hereinafter: the non-financial information). The non-financial information comprises a representation of the policy and business operations of ABN AMRO Bank N.V. with regard to sustainability and the thereto related, events and achievements during the year.\n\n## Basis for our conclusions\n\nWe have performed our review of the non-financial information and our audit of the section 'Our value-creating topics' in accordance with Dutch law, including Dutch Standard 3810N, 'Assurance-opdrachten inzake maatschappelijke verslagen' (Assurance engagements relating to sustainability reports), which is a specified Dutch Standard that is based on the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000, 'Assurance engagements other than audits or reviews of historical financial information'. Our responsibilities under this standard are further described in the section 'Our responsibilities' of our report.\n\nWe are independent of ABN AMRO Bank N.V. in accordance with the 'Verordening inzake de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assurance-opdrachten' (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence). This includes that we do not perform any activities that could result in a conflict of interest with our independent assurance engagement. Furthermore, we have complied with the 'Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants' (VGBA, Dutch code of ethics).\n\nWe believe that the assurance evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusions.\n\n## Reporting criteria\n\nThe reporting criteria used for the preparation of the nonfinancial information are the International <IR> Framework of the IFRS Foundation and the supplemental reporting criteria applied as disclosed in the appendix 'Our approach to reporting' in the Integrated Annual Report. The reporting criteria used for the section 'Our value-creating topics' are disclosed in the section 'Note on value creation' on page 340 of the Integrated Annual Report.\n\nThe absence of an established practice on which to draw, to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities and over time.\n\nConsequently, the non-financial information, including the section 'Our value-creating topics', needs to be read and understood together with the reporting criteria used.\n\n## Limitations to the scope of our review and our audit\n\nThe non-financial information includes prospective information such as ambitions, strategy, plans, expectations, estimates and risk assessments. Inherent to this prospective information, the actual future results are uncertain. We do not provide any assurance on the assumptions and achievability of prospective information in the non-financial information.\n\nThe references to external sources or websites in the non-financial information are not part of the non-financial information as reviewed by us and the section 'Our valuecreating topics' as audited by us. We therefore do not provide assurance on this information.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The executive board is also responsible for selecting and applying the reporting criteria and for determining that these reporting criteria are suitable for the legitimate information needs of stakeholders, taking into account applicable law and regulations related to reporting. The choices made by the executive board regarding the scope of the non-financial information and the reporting policy are summarised in the appendix 'Our approach to reporting' of the Integrated Annual Report.\n\nFurthermore, the executive board is responsible for such internal control as it determines is necessary to enable the preparation of the non-financial information, including the section 'Our value-creating topics', that is free from material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the reporting process of ABN AMRO Bank N.V.\n\n## Our responsibilities\n\nOur responsibility is to plan and perform the assurance engagement in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and appropriate assurance evidence for our conclusions.\n\nOur review of the non-financial information is aimed at obtaining a limited level of assurance. Procedures performed to obtain a limited level of assurance are aimed to determine the plausibility of information and vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent, than for a reasonable assurance engagement. The level of assurance obtained in a review is therefore substantially less than the assurance obtained in an audit.\n\nOur audit of the section 'Our value-creating topics' is aimed at obtaining a reasonable level of assurance. Our audit has been performed with a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not have detected all material errors and fraud.\n\nWe apply the 'Nadere voorschriften kwaliteitssystemen' (NVKS, Regulations for quality management systems) and accordingly maintain a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and other relevant legal and regulatory requirements.\n\n## Our review and our audit included amongst others:\n\n- \u00c5 Performing an analysis of the external environment and obtaining an understanding of relevant sustainability themes and issues and the characteristics that are most relevant to achieving the company's strategy and value creation\n- Evaluating the appropriateness of the reporting criteria used, their consistent application and related disclosures in the Integrated Annual Report.
