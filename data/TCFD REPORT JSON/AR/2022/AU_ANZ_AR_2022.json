An example of this is how our investment grade lending has increased by 50% since/uni00A02016.\n\nWe also made good progress on the continued digitisation of the bank with the/uni00A0launch of ANZ Plus, where we have e/ffectively built a new retail banking platform that will be the future foundation of ANZ/uni00A0in Australia.\n\nAnother highlight for the year was the agreement announced in July to acquire Suncorp Bank.\n\nWhile still subject to various Government and regulatory approvals, this will provide ANZ with a platform for growth for the",

        "page_content": "coming decades, particularly in the fast-growing Queensland market.\n\nWe believe this acquisition will help ANZ compete more e/ffectively in Queensland and ultimately provide better services to customers across Australia.\n\nThe associated $3.5 billion capital raising was well received despite volatile market conditions. It was the world's largest equity raise this calendar year for a Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) transaction, structured in a way to ensure all/uni00A0ANZ shareholders were treated equally, and I'd like to thank shareholders for their/uni00A0support.\n\nThe annual report also sets out our approach to climate change and we know this is important to all our shareholders.\n\nWe want to be the leading Australia and New Zealand-based bank in supporting customers' transition to net zero emissions by 2050. We also recognise we can have the/uni00A0most impact by working with our customers to reduce their emissions.\n\nOur policy is to support customers through the transition, backing their plans by providing more /finance for less emissions. We have high expectations, particularly for/uni00A0our customers in the energy sector. We/uni00A0expect our energy customers' plans to be net-zero aligned, public and speci/fic.\n\nWe acknowledge some stakeholders have suggested that ANZ immediately cease lending to companies in carbon-intensive sectors like energy.\n\nThis approach may reduce ANZ's exposures or '/financed emissions'. However, it does not reduce emissions in the 'real world' if the company receives funding from an alternate source. We are also then precluded from actively supporting the development of their net-zero aligned transition plans.\n\n## Non-Operating Holding Company\n\nOur core business is banking and that won't/uni00A0change.\n\nHowever, to help us better compete in the future we are introducing a new corporate structure, known as a NonOperating Holding Company. This will be subject to a/uni00A0shareholder vote in December.\n\nLike other traditional banking businesses, ANZ faces signi/ficant disruption, largely from non-banking businesses competing in/uni00A0/financial services. Understandably, these businesses are not regulated in the same way as banks like ANZ.\n\nThe proposed structure will allow our non-banking businesses to operate on a more level playing /field with nonbanking companies, while maintaining an appropriate regulatory environment for the/uni00A0bank as a whole.\n\nThese structures are not new and are common for many /financial institutions around the world, including Barclays, Lloyds Bank, DBS, Citigroup and HSBC as well as Australian /financial institutions Macquarie and Suncorp.\n\nThis will help make our banking business more e/fficient, providing us with greater strategic and operational /flexibility and, importantly, allowing us to better meet our/uni00A0customers' needs.\n\nAll of your Directors intend to vote all the ANZ shares they own or control in favour of/uni00A0the Scheme. I would encourage you to look at the detailed scheme booklet, located at anz.com/schememeeting , which sets/uni00A0out in more detail the bene/fits and the costs of implementation of this proposal.\n\n## Board Renewal\n\nI'd like to acknowledge the enormous contribution of Graeme Liebelt who is retiring from the Board at the upcoming Annual General Meeting.\n\nGraeme has given tireless service over the last nine years, particularly in his roles chairing the Human Resources and Risk committees. I will personally miss his wise counsel, strategic insight and experience. It/uni00A0has been an honour to serve on the Board with him and on behalf of all shareholders I/uni00A0wish him well with his future endeavours.\n\nI am also pleased to formally welcome Je/ff Smith who joined the Board in August and will stand for election at the upcoming AGM. Je/ff is an experienced global business and technology executive having been Chief Information O/fficer at several organisations - including IBM, Suncorp and/uni00A0Telstra - and has already made a signi/ficant contribution for shareholders.\n\nFinally, I'd like to also thank my fellow shareholders for their support in what has/uni00A0been a transformational year and acknowledge the more than 39,000 people/uni00A0who work tirelessly each day for their customers.\n\nPaul O'Sullivan Chairman",

        "page_content": "## CEO's message\n\nWe go into the new year with solid momentum and cash profit before provisions excluding large/notable items growing at 20% in the second half, which is the fastest half-on-half growth we have recorded in more than a decade.\n\nWe also did what we said we would do.\n\nWe restored momentum in Australian home loans with application approval times back in line with industry peers. This was assisted by our decision to bring Australia Retail and/uni00A0Digital Transformation together as one/uni00A0division.\n\nWe continued the re-platforming of Australia Retail onto ANZ Plus, which is our new digital bank, with deposits growing at a rate faster than any new digital bank in Australia. Around a third of those customers joined ANZ for the first time.\n\nIn New Zealand, we maintained an industry leading position across our key segments while also reaching the final stages of BS11. This was one of the largest regulatory programs implemented in New Zealand banking history. It now means we are well positioned to focus on the future and further build the franchise.\n\nInstitutional continues to benefit from our multi-year transformation as rising rates across the globe create favourable conditions for the business.\n\nThe expansion of our platforms strategy, where we lead the market in providing banking services for other financial institutions, resulted in the volume of payments processed using ANZ's infrastructure growing by 85%. We also continued to innovate in our approach to digital assets, executing the first ever Australian bank-issued Australian dollar stablecoin.\n\nAustralia Commercial delivered a strong first-up result as a stand-alone division and is already benefiting from increased focus and a refreshed strategy. A highlight was the commencement of the ANZ Worldline joint venture that will allow us to provide business customers with world-leading point-of-sale and online payment technology.\n\nWe've achieved all this while also preparing the bank for the future.\n\nWe agreed the acquisition of Suncorp Bank which, if approved by government and regulators, will provide an important platform for growth, particularly in the fast-growing and rapidly diversifying Queensland economy.\n\nSuncorp Bank is a well-run business that will/uni00A0see more than one million new retail customers join ANZ, sharing in the benefits of a wider range of products and services. It/uni00A0also means the Suncorp Group is able to/uni00A0focus on its core mission of being the best insurance company in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nThe 'non-operating holding company' structure, which shareholders will have the opportunity to vote on in December, is another important step that will help us further strengthen and grow our core business.\n\n## We are a safer bank\n\nWe continued the systematic de-risking of the bank, highlighted by the sale of our margin lending business and the formal separation of our Wealth businesses to Insignia, formerly known as IOOF, and Zurich last month.\n\nCombined with the exit of Financial Planning & Advice, as well as all the associated remediation being at the very final stage, we are the only major bank in Australia to have removed the risks associated with wealth management for shareholders.\n\nWe further strengthened our loan portfolio, particularly in Commercial and Institutional banking, where we have deliberately exited high-risk portfolios while increasing our focus on investment grade lending.\n\nDuring the year we invested significantly to help prevent customers falling victim to fraud as well as continually improving our cyber defences.\n\nA good example of this is the behavioural biometrics capability we implemented which has detected approximately 3,600 fraudulent applications, preventing nearly $40 million of identity fraud.\n\nWhile preventing cybercrime remains a challenge for all businesses, we take our role seriously and maintain a sophisticated, 24/7 internal Security Operations Centre, analysing millions of events daily. As you would expect, our team works closely with other banks and government agencies around the world to protect against the ever-evolving cyber security threats.\n\n## ANZ Plus\n\nAs mentioned earlier, we launched this year our new retail banking platform in Australia, ANZ Plus.\n\nANZ Plus is effectively a new retail bank; one that is focused on improving the financial wellbeing of our customers. This is good for customers and the early signs are promising with solid deposit growth, particularly with customers new to the bank.\n\nA key feature of ANZ Plus is the ability to easily save for multiple goals without the need to open a new account. This is important because we know a savings habit is core to financial wellbeing.\n\nWe have seen strong growth in the number of savings goals created with 45% of our active customers taking advantage of the functionality, compared with less than 5% on our traditional platform.\n\nANZ Plus also has the very high levels of security our customers and regulators expect with market-leading fraud prevention technology already having a material impact.\n\nWe will begin moving existing customers across to ANZ Plus while also piloting a new/uni00A0digital home loan in the coming weeks. This will see the introduction of a fully automated digital home loan offering, initially focused on the re-finance market, later in 2023.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nANZ has been taking important steps to not only reduce our own emissions but also help our customers, particularly 100 of our largest emitting business customers, reduce their emissions and enhance their resilience to a changing climate.",

This is an exciting opportunity with two important customers that has the potential to develop a domestic, sustainable aviation fuel industry in Australia.\n\nIn New Zealand, we launched our Good Energy Home Loan which allows customers to borrow up to $80,000 at a 3-year fixed rate of 1% to make their homes more energy efficient. We also introduced a similar initiative for business and corporate customers, allowing them to access up to $3 million at a special floating interest rate for up to five years to be used on environmental initiatives.\n\nThere are economic risks ahead, but we are entering 2023 in great shape and with positive momentum.\n\nWe have a balanced portfolio of businesses, leadership in intermediating trade and capital flows, particularly aligned to sustainability and a strong balance sheet which means ANZ is better positioned than most for the opportunities ahead.\n\nFinally, I want to thank the entire team at ANZ for their ongoing commitment to our customers and the community.\n\nOur culture is strong, we have industry leading employee engagement and we have an embedded sense of purpose to/uni00A0shape a world where people and communities thrive.\n\nShayne Elliott Chief Executive O/fficer\n\nShayne Elliott Chief Executive O/fficer\n\nThis has been a transformational year during which we delivered a strong /financial result with all our divisions making a material contribution, demonstrating the bene/fits of a well-managed and diversi/fied portfolio.",

This assisted customers to build repayment bu/ffers ahead of rising interest rates in Australia.\n\nWith interest rates on an upwards trajectory across many geographies and costs for both discretionary and non-discretionary items growing, staying on top of household budgets and mortgage repayments has been a key issue for our customers.

These programs involve close collaboration with partners from the community and government sectors.\n\n## Supporting employee capability and wellbeing\n\nANZ's strong and inclusive culture, built over decades, has supported our people to maintain a strong alignment to our strategy and purpose while the majority of our workforce continued to work /flexibly as the impacts of the pandemic lingered in some geographies. This strong culture supported team connectivity and contributed towards a high level of engagement despite a period of signi/ficant change.\n\nAs employees have started to return to the o/ffice, we've evolved and simpli/fied the behaviours that will continue to build our future success. Our new behaviour framework was introduced in February 2022.\n\nOur behaviours:\n\nCreate opportunities\n\nDeliver what matters\n\nSucceed together\n\nPeoples' needs and expectations of when and/uni00A0where they work have changed, and we know that our employees are seeking value from their day-to-day work. Responding e/ffectively to this is a key enabler of a stable, future-/fit workforce.\n\nFor many years, we have successfully operated a workforce based across multiple geographies and supported /flexibility for all roles. We are committed to hybrid working and the pandemic has uplifted our /flexible working capacity and capability. Key to this is how we support our people leaders and teams to create opportunities, deliver what matters and succeed together while working in a hybrid, /flexible manner. We continued to provide psychological and ergonomic support to our workforce, who have worked from home for the majority of the year.\n\nWe are future proo/fing our workforce in the face of a turbulent external environment and a volatile talent market by focusing on the most important capabilities that will drive our strategic agenda. This year we have continued to invest in key capabilities such as Engineering, Cloud, Data and Digital, and Customer Coaching.\n\n15\n\nANZ is well positioned to attract and retain talent, and our people tell us that they join and stay because we o/ffer challenging, interesting and complex work that matters. They are empowered to work in a way that suits them and ANZ, and because they want to belong to a community that celebrates the value of diversity.\n\nOur focus on employee wellbeing and how we are future-proo/fing our workforce builds on our long history of support for employee diversity, underpinned by a strong culture. We help our people thrive in an internal environment that continues to adapt and evolve to ever-changing external demands.\n\nFair and responsible banking\n\nUnderpinning everything we do is a commitment to fair and responsible banking. Keeping pace with the expectations of customers, employees and the wider community, while behaving fairly, responsibly and maintaining high standards of conduct. We are committed to supporting customers in times of need and ensuring our products and services are accessible and inclusive to all.\n\nWe continue to make progress implementing our strategy to assist customers who may require extra care and those facing /financial di/fficulty in Australia. We are focused on delivering better customer outcomes by strengthening frontline capability and proactive external engagement, as well as improving product design and data use to improve accessibility and limit harm.\n\nWe have improved support for customers by changing the way we manage and think about customer complaints. We have been embedding a culture where complaints are valued as an opportunity to learn, improving products and services, and delivering better customer outcomes. We strive to deliver excellent products and services to our customers but if we get things wrong, we want to know, and seek to resolve complaints with empathy and fairness.\n\nThe expanded use of digital and real time payments has made it easier for criminals to move funds quickly and easily through various accounts, and ultimately o/ffshore, making recall and recovery increasingly di/fficult.

Competition for home loans has intensi/fied further with Retail customers across the sector proactively engaging with mortgage providers and third-party originators leading to increased levels of re/finance activity in the industry.\n\nOur Retail customers continue to display positive /financial wellbeing behaviours o/ffset accounts continue to grow; a large portion of our home loan customers remain ahead in their repayments; and savings have increased for those without a mortgage.

Comfort with and trust of digital and mobile banking channels continues to increase among customers.\n\nLooking ahead to 2023, we face a more subdued lending environment and increased demands on customer cash/flows. We remain focused on growing revenue responsibly and committed to our automation and simpli/fication initiatives to help reshape our business, deliver easy, personalised services to our customers and sustainably grow returns for our shareholders over the long-term.\n\n## Strategy and focus\n\nOur strategy in Australia Retail is to support our customers to achieve their /financial goals, in a way that also helps improve their overall /financial wellbeing.\n\nFor our one million home loan customers, this means making sure they are /financially informed about their mortgage, that it's within their means and they are resilient to potential future events.\n\nThis year we've built momentum in our home loans business by improving turnaround times, enhancing our processing capacity, and simplifying our home loan product o/ffering. We've also invested in tools like the home loan calculator to help our\n\ncustomers understand how changes to interest rates will impact their repayments, and a free home loan check-in to help them /find ways to /fine-tune their home loan so it continues to meet their needs.\n\nWe've invested in building the foundation of our future business, ANZ Plus, with 20 modern cloud-based technology platforms now in place and working at scale. We have launched the /first ANZ Plus transaction and savings product with deposits growth outpacing any new digital bank in Australia. E/fforts to migrate our current 'transact and save' account customers from ANZ to ANZ Plus will continue to be a focus into 2023 and beyond.\n\nWe've been helping customers make the move to digital and mobile channels, so they can bank when and where it is most convenient for them. We launched the Message Us feature in the ANZ App a secure way for our customers to ask questions regarding their personal accounts, including Home Loans, inside the app. Customers can now receive comprehensive help through a messaging experience without having to call or visit a branch. We also introduced Broker Chat, a real-time 'live chat' function via the ANZ Broker Portal for brokers to easily obtain an expected credit response date on an application, check on the assessment for applications and organise call backs from assessors.",

Progressing our ANZ Plus home loan o/ffering will be a key factor in this and is a core priority for 2023.\n\n## Performance highlights\n\nThe Retail and Digital businesses were combined in Australia this year, creating a new Australia Retail Division to increase focus on customers' needs and better position the business for future opportunities. With an emphasis on responsible growth, amidst a challenging operating environment, the Australia Retail Division delivered Cash Pro/fit of $2.1 billion.\n\nImprovements in operational capacity and resilience helped restore Home Loan momentum, with volume growing $5.9 billion in the second half. This was achieved while balancing margins and returns in an extremely competitive environment.\n\nCustomer deposits were up $8.5 billion in the/uni00A0year, representing a 6% increase on the prior year. Many customers are still demonstrating a cautious approach and increasing their savings bu/ffers. In the rising-rate environment, customers are also moving their money from at-call products back to term deposits.\n\nDisciplined cost management saw a reduction in run-the-bank expenses, while the Division continued to invest for the future. This saw substantial progress on ANZ Plus, as well as the modernisation of the contact centre and physical branches to better support our digital transformation journey.\n\n## The changing face of customer service\n\nOur customers continue to expect convenient, /flexible and comprehensive digital banking options, many shifting towards higher levels of self-service, with just eight per cent of our customers relying solely on branches for their everyday banking needs.\n\nOver-the-counter cash and cheque transactions declined 20 per cent YOY for the past two years and ATM transactions declined by 18 per cent in FY22, while the number of customers using digital channels increased steadily - 43 million transactions were completed in digital channels and digital logins increased 15.4 per cent.\n\nThis increased uptake of digital channels and services has shifted the expectations of customers when it comes to face-to-face interactions with our bankers. The role of bankers has changed signi/ffcantly and we're responding by adapting our bricks and mortar presence to enable sta/fi and customers to focus on digital adoption and /ffnancial wellbeing conversations, rather than just transactions.\n\nWe've rolled out new branch formats across 32 locations and are piloting two ANZ Plus stores to meet the demand from our customers who now often visit a branch by appointment when they want help with more complex needs, like home loans or improving /ffnancial wellbeing. It is at these times that relationships and coaching are critical.\n\nWe have also built the principle of self-service into ANZ Plus, with a comprehensive support section housed in the app. Customers can query suspicious transactions; lock, block, cancel or reorder their card; search years of transaction history and change their email address, postal address, Tax File Number, PIN and more - all in the app. We will continue to build-in convenient self-service options as the ANZ Plus product suite expands.\n\nImage: Open layout in one of ANZ's award-winning new branches.\n\nEnhancing the branch experience",

Improving the visibility, focus and accountability of Commercial enables us to better support customers striving to start, run, or grow their businesses.\n\n## Shayne Elliott\n\nCEO/Interim Group Executive, Australia Commercial\n\n## Operating environment\n\nAustralia's small-to-medium business (SME) sector experienced moderate growth against a backdrop of intermittent COVID-19 related shutdowns, high in/flation, increasing input costs, supply chain issues, and workforce shortages. Adapting to the operating conditions, we continued to see many customers invest, better manage costs, and pivot their businesses towards new market opportunities.\n\nWith the unemployment rate reaching a 50-year low, employee vacancies were an ongoing issue for many customers particularly for businesses in regional Australia. This downward trend is expected to continue until early 2023 which will likely put upward pressure on wages, further increasing costs for some businesses.\n\n## Financial Performance Cash continuing 1\n\n| Cash pro/fit ($m)             |       | Net Loans & Advances ($b)    |\n|-------------------------------|-------|------------------------------|\n| FY22 FY21                     | 1,510 | 59.7 FY22 FY21               |\n| 1,107 Return on Avg.

Higher mortgage payments, and price increases for essential goods and services could inhibit future spending although savings bu/ffers, population growth and accelerating wages should limit any impacts.\n\n## Strategy and focus\n\nAustralia Commercial provides banking products and services to ~630,550 Australian small and medium businesses, as well as high net-worth, private banking customers across Australia. Our ~2,800 Commercial employees include bankers and specialists working across all industry sectors who assist customers manage working capital, optimise cash-/flow and support growth with business loans, asset /finance, and transaction banking. Australia Commercial also works closely with ANZ's Retail and Broker teams to deliver customers' home lending needs.\n\nThrough our direct customer relationships and a strong broker network, our Commercial lending increased by 4% during FY22. This result was also driven by the introduction of several self-service features and enhancements to both internet banking and the ANZ App. In a /first for a major Australian bank, eligible customers can join ANZ and open a\n\nbusiness transaction account in just a few minutes via ANZ's app using a driver's licence or passport, and an ABN, creating a fast and simple onboarding experience.\n\nWe also expanded our suite of business management tools and personalised digital experiences to help our customers be /financially ready. This includes investment in online business lending platforms such as ANZ GoBiz which uses customer accounting data to enable online applications for unsecured overdrafts up to $300,000 and term loans up to $500,000, with lending approvals issued in less than 48-hours. The platform assists customers with both cash-/flow and investment opportunities.\n\nThis work resulted in ANZ being awarded Canstar's 2022 Bank of the Year - Small Business, which recognised our business banking products, services, and customer satisfaction relative to peers.\n\nAligned with building our digital capabilities, in April we commenced ANZ Worldline Payment Solutions, a joint venture with leading European payments provider Worldline.\n\nThe new joint venture will provide ANZ Commercial and Institutional customers in Australia access to market-leading pointof-sale and online payment technology.",

This included an increase in our maximum loan term for eligible small business customers from 15-years to 30-years for facilities secured by standard commercial property.\n\nIn addition, we simpli/fied our re/finance process for business lending up to $1m for eligible customers, creating quicker loan approvals and access to appropriate capital.\n\n## Performance highlights\n\nAustralia Commercial delivered a strong /first set of /financial results as a standalone division, increasing cash pro/fit by 36% and revenue by 18% year-on-year. This result was driven by volume growth and disciplined margin management, assisted by the rising rate environment. Expenses were also tightly managed.\n\nNet loans and advances grew 4% driven by strong lending growth in our specialist segments which include agribusiness, health, and property. Our larger Commercial customers had the strongest credit appetite, while smaller business customers continued to prioritise /financial solutions to aid cash-/flow.\n\nCustomer deposit growth of 1% was more subdued this year, following unprecedented government support during COVID-19 in the prior year. An improvement in our risk adjusted returns also demonstrated the continued strength in the credit quality of our Commercial loans.\n\n## Building a gem of a business with help from ANZ GoBiz\n\nBrisbane jeweller and Managing Director Ashley Portas is funding the next growth chapter of his successful jewellery store, Diamondport, with help from an ANZ GoBiz loan.\n\nFounded in 2015 with an initial import focus, the family business expanded four years later when it established its own workshop to enhance its design and production services. This led to 65% year-on-year growth and opened the door to new opportunities.\n\n'When you grow this fast, you need more money to grow. Suddenly, we found ourselves needing more diamonds, new tools, more rings to market and sell,' said Ashley.\n\nTo support the next growth phase Ashley decided to apply for a $200,000 business loan. After approaching an online lender and his existing bank, Ashley discovered ANZ GoBiz o/flered a more convenient digital-enabled alternative.\n\n'I found the ANZ GoBiz o/fler online and really liked what I saw. It only took me 20 minutes to apply,' said Ashley.\n\n'I applied on a Wednesday and was approved by Friday,' Ashley said. 'I had no problems sharing my accounting details and banking information with ANZ, and I found it so refreshing to see a bank like ANZ put their trust in us.'\n\nNow, with /ffnances in place, Diamondport is expanding its portfolio of engagement rings. Alongside traditional designs like solitaire and halo, the team is creating more unique and bespoke engagement ring designs to appeal to a wider customer base.\n\nCustomer story",

Our past e/fforts to build a simpler, more e/fficient Division positioned us well to respond quickly to our customers' needs through the pandemic and provide support during a challenging period.\n\nIn 2022, we made signi/ficant progress in delivering strategic initiatives, including growing the Markets' customer-franchise business, maximising bene/fits from our international network, implementing an improved customer coverage model, building on our digital self-service o/ffering, rolling out more e/fficient digital credit processes and establishing a market-leading Digital Asset Services Team.\n\nWe also focused on extending our platforms as a service to customers. The volume of agency payments, processed by /financial institutions for their customers, using ANZ's infrastructure, grew 85% year-on-year. Overall payments volumes grew 52%, as we continued to invest in digital platforms.\n\nWe continued to build our position as a regional leader in environmental sustainability, participating in $155 billion of/uni00A0sustainable /finance deals in FY22 while rolling out sustainability education programs internally. Looking ahead, we see increasing opportunities for our customers as a result of the super cycle of activity that is underway.\n\n## Performance highlights\n\nANZ Institutional delivered a strong performance, with a cash pro/fit of $1.8 billion while revenues were up 1% for the year and 10% half-on-half. The high-quality result was achieved despite challenging market conditions, re/flecting strong customer momentum and e/ffective margin management. In addition, lending momentum remained robust, up 24% year-on-year.\n\nANZ also maintained our position as the region's leading Institutional bank in key markets where we operate.

We also launched a comprehensive hydrogen guide to support customers in exploring opportunities associated with the emerging sector's rapid commercialisation.\n\nANZ led the market in our approach to digital assets, successfully executing the /first ever Australian bank issued Australian dollar stablecoin (A$DC) payment through a public permissionless blockchain transaction. The team delivered the stablecoin for Victor Smorgon Group, closely followed by the purchase of tokenised Australian carbon credits using the new stablecoin.\n\n23\n\n## ANZ leads landmark tokenised carbon credits transaction\n\nANZ has taken an important next step in progressing its digital asset strategy, supporting long-standing customer Victor Smorgon Group in successfully purchasing tokenised Australian carbon credits (BCAU) using the ANZ-issued stablecoin A$DC.\n\nThis is an important step for ANZ as the bank explores greater circulation of the stablecoin. In this transaction, Victor Smorgon Group used A$DC as a medium of exchange to purchase the BCAU carbon tokens from Zerocap, an Australian digital asset investment platform. Zerocap sourced the BCAU from BetaCarbon, which tokenises Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) into digital tokens, with each representing 1kg of carbon captured. This transaction is also signi/flcant as it provided A$DC/BCAU liquidity, while o/ffering both Victor Smorgon Group and Zerocap redemption rights for A$DC.\n\nThis latest A$DC transaction came after ANZ successfully executed the /flrst Australian-bank issued Australian-dollar stablecoin payment through a public permissionless blockchain transaction in March. A$DC remains fully collateralised by the Australian dollar and is redeemable at par with funds held in an ANZ-managed reserve account.\n\nVictor Smorgon Group CEO Peter Edwards said: 'Victor Smorgon Group is one of Australia's most established and successful family o/seven.superiorces, operating across multiple asset classes, including digital assets. Through the Zerocap platform and continuing our multigenerational working relationship with the ANZ Bank, we are excited to now have an Australian dollar stablecoin giving us a safe and secure gateway to the digital economy.'\n\nANZ Banking Services Lead Nigel Dobson said: 'This milestone transaction brings together two key focus areas for ANZ, sustainability and digital assets. We're seeing increasing customer appetite to use A$DC to enter the digital economy, and will continue to partner with our clients to explore how this technology can help them achieve their goals.'\n\nA milestone transaction and partnership",

The pandemic has accelerated the decline in over-the-counter branch transactions by 40%. Technology will continue to be central to how we make things easier for sta/ff and customers.\n\nWe're bringing forward a major project to install a modern banking platform that is 'cloud-based', providing us with more /flexibility to quickly add functions for our customers and sta/ff. By moving to a modern banking platform we will have a new core system which can continue to deliver reliable, e/fficient and secure services for our customers.\n\nThat's why we've also lifted this program above our strategic acceleration work and given it a foundational title: 'Ng\u0101 Tapuwae o ANZ - The Footsteps of ANZ'.\n\nNg\u0101 Tapuwae is our statement about ensuring quickness of feet either in the depths of our intellectual pursuits or physical prowess.

We are committed to growing cultural competency and understanding of Te Ao M\u0101ori (the M\u0101ori world view) with our sta/ff and enhancing the /financial wellbeing of M\u0101ori.\n\nThis year we released a report called Watch Women Win, which examined the motivations for, and obstacles preventing, women's success. A key /finding was women are inspired by seeing other women celebrated for doing well. We undertook a number of engagements throughout the year meeting successful women and hearing and sharing their stories.\n\nIn February we also launched our Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Strategy, 'Bringing EDI to Life'. This supports our business to create an equitable and inclusive workplace where the diversity of our workforce in its broadest sense can be leveraged to the bene/fit of our customers and Aotearoa New Zealand.\n\n## Performance highlights\n\nNew Zealand delivered another strong year with Cash Pro/fit of NZ$1.77 billion. Home lending continues to be a key driver for us.

Overall, Business and Institutional customers managed well through the COVID-19 disruptions in the /first half of the /financial year.\n\nOur Contact Centre is experiencing increasing demand. We've seen an increase in customer calls, particularly related to an uptick in fraud and scam cases, the wind-up of Bonus Bonds, interest rates and a surge in home loan rollovers.\n\nOur Sta/ff Foundation distributed over NZ $1.1 million in donations to 93 charities across New Zealand.\n\n## Supporting a more sustainable and self-su/ffcient future\n\nChanges to the social, physical and /ffnancial operating environment mean businesses must become more sustainable and energy-e/ficient.\n\nThere is a growing sense that if they are to survive and thrive in a warmer world, they must adapt, invest in technology and become more self-su/ficient and resilient.\n\nTo meet some of these electricity demands, the company has put its abundant roof space to work, installing over 2900 solar panels.\n\nIt is one of the largest solar arrays in the South Island, and now generates over 20 per cent of the company's power requirements.\n\nAs the country's largest bank, we're seeing our customers increasingly turning to us for support and help as they consider how best to adapt and invest in their future.\n\nOne Canterbury business demonstrates this in spades. Hagley Windows and Doors - set up by builder Geo/ffi Ball - has grown from having just two employees in 1983 to more than 190 today.\n\nIn recent years, Hagley has invested millions of dollars in computercontrolled robotic glass-cutting and double-glazing machines, giving it an edge over competitors.\n\nIts high-tech double-glazed window units are a growing part of its business, and now help make thousands of homes and businesses in the South Island warmer, dryer and more energy e/ficient.\n\nAs with any investment, making a business more sustainable comes at a price, but our Business Green loan removes some of that cost barrier.\n\nIt is currently the only advertised green loan product in the market available to business customers and linked to the Green Loan Principles.\n\nANZ has led the way with sustainable /ffnance for our Institutional Business customers and we're proud to now o/ffier a Business Green Loan which will support many more businesses start down the road of becoming more sustainable, resilient and self-su/ficient.\n\nCustomer story\n\nThe company has also made substantial investments in solar power for its own premises.\n\nIt takes considerable power to run a factory the size of two football /ffelds, dozens of machines and an energyhungry glass-toughening furnace.",

The topics below are illustrative to provide stakeholders with an insight into some of the key matters considered by the Board and its Committees during the 2022 financial year and is not intended to be a comprehensive list.\n\n## Strategy and growth\n\nDuring the /financial year, the Board and its Committees continued to focus on longer-term strategic matters.\n\nIn addition to participating in regular strategy sessions, the Board regularly discussed and reviewed ANZ's strategic and growth priorities.\n\nAt each regular Board meeting, there continued to be unstructured discussion with the Chief Executive O/fficer in relation to the progress of Management's key priorities as agreed with the Board.\n\nThe Board also received regular reports on progress (from both a strategic/ operational viewpoint and a technology viewpoint) in the design and build and implementation, including customer migration strategy, relating to ANZ Plus.\n\nMergers & Acquisitions was a key topic of consideration during the year with discussions taking place at both regular and specially convened Board meetings in relation to key potential transactions that have been disclosed to the market, including the acquisition of Suncorp Bank.\n\nAt the Interim Results in May, ANZ announced its intention to apply for approval to implement a non-operating holding company structure. The Board received regular reports throughout the year on the strategic rationale and details of how such a revised structure would work in practice, including in relation to governance and operations. The Board played a key role in the ultimate design and application of the proposed revised structure.\n\n## Risk, regulation and reputation\n\nThe Board Risk Committee and the Board played a key role in reviewing the Group's approach to managing non-/financial risk and the design and implementation of ANZ's revised operational risk and compliance framework.\n\nThe Board and its Committees continued their oversight of the Group's risk appetite settings.\n\nThe Board continued to meet with ANZ's key Australian regulators during the course of the year with the purpose of maintaining constructive two-way dialogue.\n\nThe Board also received regular education and brie/fing materials and held education sessions on key areas such as sanctions, competition law and cyber security, as well as participating in Banking Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR) scenario training.\n\n## Financial/Operational\n\nWhile the Board and its Committees have had a strong focus on the long-term future of the Group, the Board (and its Committees) maintained an equally strong focus on the current performance of the Group, including:\n\n- \u00b7 Reviewing and ultimately approving ANZ's revised structure for its Australia Retail & Commercial businesses.\n- \u00b7 Having regular and broad discussions with the heads of each major business regarding the performance of their business, key issues being focused on and the ongoing changes in the operating environment.\n- \u00b7 Receiving regular reports on the performance of the Australian home loans business against the backdrop of the rapidly changing operating environment.\n- \u00b7 Reviewing, challenging and ultimately endorsing ANZ's operating and strategic plans, both annual and longer-term.\n- \u00b7 Providing oversight of key capital management matters, including the approval of the recent renounceable entitlement o/ffer.\n\n## Changing operating environment\n\nThe Board and its Committees closely monitored the rapidly changing operating environment, including geopolitical matters, in/flation and interest rates and the continuing impact of COVID-19, together with ANZ's approach to dealing with those matters.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our Risk Management Framework (RMF) has remained robust in the face of these challenges, enabling the sound management of our business.\n\nOver the last year we have continued to work towards a stronger and simpler risk and governance framework. Our ability to respond to changes in existing risks, and to deal with emerging risks as they arise has been strengthened, including those discussed below.\n\n## Macroeconomic and Geopolitical environment\n\nThe rising geopolitical tensions including the con/flict in Ukraine, trade tensions, energy security issues in the European Union accompanied with economic challenges relating to rising interest rates, in/flation and real cost of living pressures, are creating uncertainty for many of our customers. The Board and management continually monitor these developing conditions, and maintain provisions and strong capital levels for a range of potential scenarios. In addition, we have focused on the following to help support our customers and their /financial resilience:\n\n## Home Loans and Consumer Lending -\n\nWe continue to engage with our home loans customers to help them better manage their home loan and personal /finances. 70 per cent of our customers have paid additional funds to reduce their principal debt with over half of those more than 2 years ahead on their repayments. Measures such as interest rate /floors and higher interest rate bu/ffers when assessing home loans, and higher household expenditure measures, have contributed to customers being better placed to service their loans.\n\nWe have proactively communicated with our customers to provide reassurance that where required, we have options available to continue to support them.\n\nData Analytics - Data and analytics play an important role in early identi/fication of customers heading towards /financial di/fficulty. We have invested in our retail risk systems to provide quality data analytics to assist our Collections and Hardship teams. Our analytics have focused on customer transaction data and the identi/fication of customers that may need additional support. We are using data analytics to look at savings, credit, and o/ffset accounts to better understand customers' /financial behaviour and potential future outcomes. The analysis considers interest rate changes, increases in living expenses and cash/flow. In our Wholesale portfolio, we are using\n\n## Keeping our community safe\n\nAs part of ANZ's ongoing focus on keeping communities safe, members of the ANZ /ffnancial crime team have security clearance to support intelligence initiatives.\n\nLeveraging lessons from previous operations involving fugitives and high-risk law enforcement targets, the team regularly checks internal and external intelligence sources for information.\n\nIn 2022, a member of the Financial Crime team proactively reached out to law enforcement and regulatory partners to support a live child abduction case. The alleged perpetrator was on the run and actively being sought by law enforcement agencies. The team member checked our systems for the main perpetrators and any known associates, which led to the identi/ffcation of accounts with activity outside of the account holder's normal spending behavior.\n\nexternal (e.g., ASIC's insolvency register, ATO arrears) and internal data sources (e.g., stress sensitivities and savings levels) to identify areas of systemic emerging risks to proactively manage the portfolio.\n\n## Financial health and Wellbeing -\n\nWe have transformed our retail platform by simplifying and rebuilding products, systems and processes to improve the /financial wellbeing of our customers. Our initial 'transact and save' product within the ANZ Plus App has provided functionality to enable customers to have better visibility and control over their money.\n\nThe lessons we have learnt from COVID-19 and recent natural disasters, have been used to develop /financial hardship assistance options that can be implemented quickly.\n\nPortfolio management - Our new Head of Geopolitical Risk provides additional insights to support our customer management and understand the geopolitical impacts to our portfolio. The introduction of this role has provided focused analysis of global issues which allows us to better inform and support our customers and the Board.\n\n## Risk Culture\n\nRisk culture is an important component of our organisational culture and underpins the shared values, behaviours and practices that drive how risk is considered in decisions.\n\nClose examination of those accounts suggested the alleged perpetrator was using the account of a family member to avoid detection. This information was then shared with law enforcement. Law enforcement partners were able to follow up on ANZ's leads and located the victim unharmed.",

        "page_content": "We have made progress in strengthening risk culture through achieving greater awareness of the approach to risk culture and establishing strong leadership to deliver on our risk culture plans. This will allow us to achieve our de/fined target state.\n\nWe have de/fined key risk culture principles that form the foundation of our risk culture approach and have embedded a framework for assessing each risk culture principle across the organisation. This framework incorporates desired risk behaviours and business and risk outcomes. We are monitoring risk culture through our Risk Culture Dashboard which captures risk management and business-related information. Our annual Risk Culture Survey informs us on the perceived and actual e/ffectiveness of our risk behaviours, policies and processes, and decision making. Our Board Risk Committee receives half-yearly updates from management to assist the Board in forming a view on risk culture and the e/ffectiveness of plans and actions.\n\nRisk culture is included as a performance objective for all Group Executives and risk is a key element of the balanced scorecard for our people's performance and remuneration. Behaviours supporting the target risk culture are reinforced through the Enterprise Accountability Group (page 90).\n\nWe acknowledge individuals who role model outstanding risk behaviours for their work to manage and mitigate the organisation's risks.\n\n## Financial crime\n\nWe continue to maintain an e/ffective /financial crime risk management program that anticipates and navigates criminal threats supported by the right people with the right tools. The Financial Crime team continues to be responsible for the delivery of enhanced detection, investigative and/or intelligence capability that is focused on identifying, mitigating and managing /financial crime risk and protecting the community via:\n\n- \u00b7 Partnering with AUSTRAC's Fintel Alliance, and similar programs globally.\n- \u00b7 The development and maintenance of a central data repository, intelligence systems and tools.\n- \u00b7 The creation and delivery of Dynamic Algorithms to meet new threats.\n\n## Non-/financial risk\n\nWe have made further inroads in our non-/financial risk management. We continue to uplift our non-/financial RMF (the I.AM Identify, Act, Monitor framework) to provide\n\na holistic approach to risk management with insights that enable us to anticipate and navigate a changing environment and protect our customers, shareholders and the community from/uni00A0harm.\n\nWe are improving how we manage our non-/financial risk by updating our approach to be more standardised, integrated, dynamic and automated, so that it is both more e/ffective and e/fficient.\n\n## Conduct Risk\n\nThe interests of our customers and community are fundamental to our strategy. We continue to responsibly manage our Conduct Risk, including by identifying, managing, and mitigating instances where our activities, products and/or services may result in unfair customer outcomes and/or damage to market integrity. The articulation of Conduct Risk as a Risk Theme under the new Compliance and Operational Risk model will help manage Conduct Risk as a key material risk for ANZ. To support this, we have developed a global Conduct Risk Framework and Conduct Risk taxonomy which facilitate a clear and consistent way of managing and monitoring the risk, in conjunction with the Compliance and Operational Risk Framework (I.AM).",

Cyber security threats continue to be signi/ficant and our approach to mitigating cyber security risk involves a range of controls relying on people, technology and process. We are continually testing our defences internally and through independent third parties. We have a very sophisticated cyber security protection capability and have invested heavily in a range of recognised industry practices and technologies, processes and defences. We maintain a 24/7 sophisticated internal Security Operations Centre, analysing millions of data events daily including unusual or infrequently seen activities identi/fied by our security team. In addition, we are cooperating with our counterparts, governments and associated entities around the world to protect against cyber security threats, which have increased since COVID-19 and the consequent shift to digital banking and remote working.\n\nWe provide continuing sta/ff education and run customer focused campaigns. We have developed threat intelligence newsletters and a 'Simplifying Cyber for Business' guide. We have continued to sponsor the Australian Computing Academy's Schools Cyber Security Challenges, contributing to content and co-producing cyber security modules for students and teachers as part of the digital curriculum.\n\nClimate change risk: The /financial risks associated with climate change remain a key focus. Climate-related events can include severe storms, drought, /fires, cyclones, hurricanes, /floods and rising sea levels. The impact of these events can be widespread. The impact of these losses on the Group may be exacerbated by a decline in the value and liquidity of assets held as collateral,\n\nwhich may impact the Group's ability to recover its funds when loans default.\n\nRecent examples in Australia include severe drought conditions, bush/fires in 2019/2020, and severe /flooding in 2021 and 2022. In addition, geological event impacts have occurred in New Zealand in recent years.\n\nWe continue to improve our management of climate risks through workstreams focused on regulatory monitoring, policy governance, risk appetite, data and analytics. We have set a public ESG target to develop an enhanced RMF that anticipates potential climate-related impacts, and associated regulatory requirements, by the end of 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor details on our performance against our ESG Targets refer to our ESG Supplement available at anz.com/annualreport\n\nOur Climate Advisory Forum, chaired by the Group Executive, Institutional and includes the Group Chief Risk O/fficer, supports execution of our climate policy, disclosures and related matters across the Group.\n\nWe are focusing on: aligning our lending portfolio with the goals of the Paris Agreement and supporting customers to expand in low or zero emission technologies; and factoring climate change risk into lending decisions for large business customers, assessing their capacity to respond to climate change and the evolving regulatory landscape.\n\nWe participated in APRA's Climate Vulnerability Assessment (CVA), which aims to examine the material exposures and /financial risks that banks, the /financial system and economy may face due to climate risks. APRA's CVA comprised two stress tests, a counterparty assessment and a data assessment. APRA intends to disclose the outcomes of the CVA in late 2022, which may also be used to inform future supervisory guidance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur 2022 Climate-related Financial Disclosures will be released prior to our Annual General Meeting (AGM) and will be available at anz.com/annualreport\n\nBiodiversity risk: Risks associated with biodiversity loss, including as a result of species extinction or decline, ecosystem degradation and nature loss, are emerging risks that we are seeking to understand further. We acknowledge biodiversity risks are closely linked to climate-related risks. In relation to biodiversity, risks can arise from lending to customers that are signi/ficantly dependent on biodiversity and ecosystem services, or who may have negative impacts on biodiversity. In addition to physical risks associated with biodiversity loss, risks can also arise from changing societal preferences and regulatory or policy changes (including potential reforms to halt and reverse forest loss, species extinctions and land degradation). These changes may impact the bank directly, but the greater impact is likely to be through the impact of these changes on some of the bank's customers. We understand that failure to manage these risks may lead to /financial and non-/financial risks and adverse impacts to the Group's Position.\n\nBiodiversity and natural capital loss are addressed in various ways by ANZ's risk policies and processes. In line with our Social and Environmental Risk Policy, we expect our business customers to use internationally accepted industry practices to manage social, environmental and economic impacts, including potential results on biodiversity. This year we also broadened our engagement with 100 of our largest emitting business customers to include a focus on biodiversity, encouraging and supporting them to identify and manage their potential impacts.\n\nWe welcome the establishment of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) and have joined the TNFD Forum to support their work. We recognise their important role in driving widespread and improved disclosures of biodiversity impacts.\n\n## Our Risk Management Framework\n\nThe Board is ultimately responsible for establishing and overseeing the Group's RMF which is supported by the Group's underlying systems, structures, policies, procedures, processes and people. The Board has delegated authority to the Board Risk Committee (BRC) to develop and monitor compliance with the Group's",

The financial results of these divested businesses are treated as discontinued operations from a financial reporting perspective. The financial results after transaction completion primarily relate to residual operational costs on separation and partial recovery of certain costs based on the respective Transition Service Agreements.

The increase in average interest earning assets was driven by higher central bank balances, higher average net loans and advances, partially offset by lower trading assets and investment securities. The decrease of 1 bps was driven by home loan pricing competition in the Australia Retail and New Zealand divisions, growth in lower yielding liquid assets, unfavourable asset and funding mix, and lower average yield in Markets averages earning assets. This was partially offset by improvement in deposit margins from a rising interest rate environment, and higher earnings on capital and replicating deposits.\n\nOther operating income increased $387 million (12%) driven by a $326 million increase from business divestments/closures, including a $307 million gain on completion of the ANZ Worldline partnership, a $251 million loss on divestment of ANZ Share Investing business in the prior year, and an increase in share of associates' profit of $353 million. This was partially offset by a decrease of $270 million in Markets other operating income as Balance Sheet and Derivative Valuation Adjustments were impacted by high volatility and yield curve movements, and a $156 million decrease in net fee and commission income primarily driven by Breakfree package changes in the Australia Retail division.\n\nOperating expenses increased $528 million (6%) driven by investment spend to develop digital capabilities, meet regulatory and compliance obligations and drive volume growth. The inclusion of Cashrewards Limited (Cashrewards) after obtaining control in December 2021 and wage inflation also contributed to the increase.\n\nCredit impairment release decreased $335 million (-59%) driven by a decrease in the collectively assessed credit impairment release, partially offset by a decrease in the individually assessed credit impairment charge.\n\nIncome tax expense decreased $80 million (-3%). The effective tax rate decreased by 160 bps to 29.2% primarily from the non-tax assessable gain on completion of the Worldline partnership.",

This was partially offset by improvement in deposit margins from a rising interest rate environment, favourable deposit mix with growth in at-call deposits, and higher earnings on capital and replicating deposits.\n\nAverage interest earning assets increased $46.3 billion (5%) driven by higher central bank balances, lending growth in the Institutional and Australia Commercial divisions, and home loan growth in the New Zealand division. This was partially offset by lower trading assets and investment securities, lower reverse repurchase agreements, and decline in the Australia Retail division.\n\nAverage deposits and other borrowings increased $67.8 billion (10%) driven by growth in at-call deposits across all divisions and increases in commercial paper, partially offset by lower term deposits and certificates of deposit.\n\nOUR PERFORMANCE\n\n(continued)",

Excluding the Markets business unit.\n\nNet fee and commission income decreased $156 million (-8%) driven by Breakfree package fee changes in the Australia Retail division, lower divested business results, and removal or reduction of funds under management fees in the New Zealand division. This was partially offset by lower customer remediation, higher cards revenue due to recovery in consumer spending, and higher volume-related fees in the Institutional division.\n\nMarkets other operating income decreased $270 million (-24%) as Balance Sheet and Derivative Valuation Adjustments were impacted by high volatility and yield curve movements, and lower income in Credit and Capital Markets was driven by less favourable credit trading conditions and lower levels of customer issuances amid more volatile market conditions. This was partially offset by higher Foreign Exchange, Rates and Commodities income driven by customer demand and more favourable trading conditions.\n\nShare of associates' profit increased $353 million driven by the Group's equity accounted share of AmBank 1MDB settlement and goodwill impairment of $347 million in 2021 and increase in other equity accounted share of profits.\n\nOther increased $460 million primarily driven by a gain on completion of the ANZ Worldline partnership and a loss on divestment of the ANZ Share Investing business in 2021, partially offset by a loss on sale of the financial planning and advice business.",

The inclusion of Cashrewards after obtaining control in December 2021 and wage inflation also contributed to the increase. This was partially offset by benefits from customers continuing to embrace digital channels, productivity improvements arising from technology and back-office optimisation, higher employee leave utilisation and lower customer remediation.\n\nPremises expenses increased $16 million (2%) driven by the modification of a significant lease arrangement, partially offset by ongoing optimisation of property footprint.\n\nTechnology expenses increased $33 million (2%) driven by higher software licence costs and increased spend on investment initiatives, partially offset by lower amortisation.\n\nRestructuring expenses decreased $26 million (-20%) primarily driven by lower charges in the Group Centre and Australia Retail divisions.\n\nOther expenses increased $155 million (9%) driven by increased spend on investment initiatives to develop digital capabilities and meet regulatory and compliance obligations.\n\nOUR PERFORMANCE\n\n(continued)",

This involved the integration of the Australian retail and digital businesses, and the separation of the Australian commercial business into a new division to improve productivity and accountability within the organisation. As a result of these changes there are now six divisions: Australia Retail, Australia Commercial, Institutional, New Zealand, Pacific and Group Centre, aligned to distinct strategies and opportunities within the Group.

Net interest margin decreased driven by asset margin contraction from competitive pressure and unfavourable lending mix from stronger growth in lower margin fixed rate home loans. This was partially offset by improvement in deposit margins from rising interest rate environment and favourable deposit mix. Other operating income increased driven by the loss on divestment of ANZ Share Investing business in the prior year and higher cards revenue due to recovery in consumer spending, partially offset by Breakfree package fee changes. Operating expenses increased driven by higher investment spend on ANZ Plus and home loans momentum, partially offset by lower restructuring expenses. Credit impairment release decreased driven by a lower collectively assessed credit impairment release, partially offset by lower individually assessed credit impairment charge with underlying delinquency and impairment flows remaining subdued with the benefit from previous government and bank COVID-19 support packages persisting.\n\n## Australia Commercial\n\nLending volumes increased driven by Specialist Business lending growth. Net interest margin increased driven by improvement in deposit margins from a rising interest rate environment and favourable deposit mix. This was partially offset by unfavourable lending mix with stronger growth in lower margin large commercial customers, and asset margin contraction from competitive pressure. Other operating income increased driven by the gain on sale relating to the ANZ Worldline partnership. This was partially offset by the loss on sale of the financial planning and advice business and divested business results impact following ANZ Worldline partnership. Operating expenses decreased driven by lower restructuring expenses and lower impact of divested business results. Credit impairment release decreased driven by a lower collectively assessed credit impairment release, partially offset by lower individually assessed credit impairment charge with underlying delinquency and impairment flows remaining subdued with the benefit from previous government and bank COVID-19 support packages persisting.\n\n## Institutional\n\nLending volumes increased across Corporate Finance, Markets and Transaction Banking following strong core lending and customer flows during the period. Customer deposits increased predominantly in Transaction Banking. Net interest margin exMarkets increased primarily driven by improvement in deposit margins from a rising interest rate environment. Other operating income decreased driven by lower Markets revenues as Balance Sheet and Derivative Valuation Adjustments were impacted by high volatility and yield curve movements. Operating expenses increased driven by higher technology costs, partially offset by lower litigation settlements. Credit impairment release decreased driven by collectively assessed credit impairment release in the prior period, partially offset by release of individually assessed credit impairment charges in Transaction Banking. Income tax expense increased driven by the dividend withholding tax on the dividend payment from ANZ PNG to ANZBGL, partially offset by tax rate differentials on profits earned in International, and tax refunds and write-backs.\n\n## New Zealand\n\nLending volumes increased driven by home loan growth. Net interest margin increased driven by improvement in deposit margins from a rising interest rate environment, partially offset by lower home loan margins due to competition, and a higher mix of fixed rate home loans. Other operating income is flat as gains on sale of government securities was offset by lower fees from the removal or reduction of funds under management fees. Operating expenses increased driven by higher investment spend and inflation impacts, partially offset by productivity gains and other savings. Credit impairment charge increased primarily driven by collectively assessed credit impairment charge in the current year as opposed to a release in the prior year.\n\n## Pacific\n\nFinancial performance for the Pacific division is largely consistent with the prior year.\n\n## Group Centre\n\nThe 2022 financial year included the recycling of foreign currency translation reserves from Other comprehensive income to profit or loss on dissolution of Minerva Holdings Limited and ANZ Asia Limited, and a net charge on lease modification impacts of a signification lease arrangement.\n\nThe 2021 financial year included the losses from the Group's share of AmBank 1MDB settlement and goodwill impairment.\n\nANZ 2022 ANNUAL REPORT           55\n\nOUR PERFORMANCE\n\n(continued)",

High Quality Liquid Assets comprise three categories, with the definitions consistent with Basel III LCR:\n\n- \uf0b7 Highest-quality liquid assets: cash, highest credit quality government, central bank or public sector securities eligible for repurchase with central banks to provide same-day liquidity.\n- \uf0b7 High-quality liquid assets: high credit quality government, central bank or public sector securities, high quality corporate debt securities and high quality covered bonds eligible for repurchase with central banks to provide same-day liquidity.\n- \uf0b7 Alternative liquid assets: assets qualifying as collateral for the CLF and other eligible securities listed by the RBNZ.\n\nThe Group monitors and manages the size and composition of its liquid assets portfolio on an ongoing basis in line with regulatory requirements and the risk appetite set by the Board.\n\n## Committed Liquidity Facility\n\nAs part of meeting LCR requirements, the Group has a CLF with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). The CLF was established to offset the shortage of available High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) in Australia and provides an alternative form of contingent liquidity. The CLF is collateralised by assets, including internal residential mortgage backed securities, that are eligible to be pledged as security with the RBA. In September 2021, APRA wrote to ADI's to advise that APRA and the RBA consider there to be sufficient HQLA for ADI's to meet their LCR requirements, and therefore the use of the CLF should no longer be required beyond 2022 calendar year.\n\nConsistent with APRA's requirement to reduce the $10.7 billion CLF with four equal reductions during the 2022 calendar year to $0 on 1 January 2023, ANZ's CLF was $2.7 billion as at 30 September 2022 (2021: $10.7 billion).\n\nThe LCR remained above the regulatory minimum of 100% throughout this period.\n\n## Funding\n\n|                                | 2022  $b   | 2021  $b   |\n|--------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Customer liabilities (funding) | 628.4      | 601.7      |\n| Wholesale funding              | 300.3      | 274.3      |\n| Shareholders' equity           | 66.4       | 63.7       |\n| Total funding                  | 995.1      | 939.7      |\n| Net Stable Funding Ratio       | 119%       | 124%       |\n\nThe Group targets a diversified funding base, avoiding undue concentration by investor type, maturity, market source and currency.\n\nNet Stable Funding Ratio remained above the regulatory minimum of 100% throughout this period.\n\n$15.7 billion of term wholesale debt funding (excluding Additional Tier 1 Capital) with a remaining term greater than one year as at 30 September 2022 was issued during the year. In addition, the Group issued $1.3 billion of Additional Tier 1 Capital during the year (excluding ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited perpetual preference shares, which is classified as a non-controlling interest in the Group).\n\n## RBA Term Funding Facility\n\nAs an additional source of funding, in March 2020, the RBA announced a Term Funding Facility (TFF) for the banking system to support lending to Australian businesses. The TFF is a three-year secured funding facility to ADIs at a fixed rate of 0.25% for drawdowns up to 4 November 2020, and reduced to 0.10% for new drawdowns from 4 November 2020 onwards. The TFF was closed to drawdowns on 30 June 2021.\n\nAs at 30 September 2022, ANZ had drawn $20.1 billion under the RBA's TFF.",

The TLF is a five-year secured funding facility for New Zealand banks at a fixed rate of 0.25%.\n\nIn November 2020 the RBNZ announced a Funding for Lending Programme (FLP) which aimed to lower the cost of borrowing for New Zealand businesses and households. The FLP is a three-year secured funding facility for New Zealand banks at a floating rate of the New Zealand Official Cash Rate (OCR). New Zealand banks were able to obtain initial funding of up to 4% of their lending to New Zealand resident households, non-financial businesses and non-profit institutions serving households as at 31 October 2020 (eligible loans). The initial allocation closed on 6 June 2022. An additional allocation of up to 2% of eligible loans is available, subject to certain conditions until 6 December 2022.\n\nAs at 30 September 2022, ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited had drawn $0.3 billion under the TLF and $2.3 billion under the FLP.\n\n## Capital management\n\n|                                  | 2022   | 2021   | Movt   |\n|----------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Common Equity Tier 1 (Level 2)   |        |        |        |\n| - APRA Basel III                 | 12.3%  | 12.3%  |        |\n| Credit risk weighted assets ($b) | 359.4  | 342.5  | 5%     |\n| Total risk weighted assets ($b)  | 454.7  | 416.1  | 9%     |\n| APRA Leverage Ratio              | 5.4%   | 5.5%   |        |\n\nAPRA, under the authority of the Banking Act 1959, sets minimum regulatory requirements for banks including what is acceptable as regulatory capital and provides methods of measuring the risks incurred by the Bank.\n\nThe Group's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 12.29% based on APRA Basel III standards, exceeding APRA's minimum requirements. It decreased 5 bps driven by the impact of dividends paid during the year, higher underlying CRWA and non-CRWA usage and the impact of the completed share buy-back. This was partially offset by cash earnings and the equity raising to support the acquisition of Suncorp Bank.\n\nAt 30 September 2022, the Group's APRA leverage ratio was 5.4% which is above the 3.5% proposed minimum for internal ratings-based approach ADI (IRB ADI), which includes ANZ.\n\n## Dividends\n\nOur financial performance allowed us to propose that a final dividend of 74 cents be paid on each eligible fully paid ANZ ordinary share, bringing the total dividend for the year ended 30 September 2022 to 146 cents per share. This represents a dividend payout ratio of 64.9% of cash profit from continuing operations.\n\nThe proposed 2022 final dividend of 74 cents per share will be fully franked for Australian taxation purposes, and carry New Zealand imputation credits of NZD 9 cents per ordinary share. It will be paid on 15 December 2022 to owners of ordinary shares at the close of business on 8 November 2022 (record date).\n\nANZ has a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) and a Bonus Option Plan (BOP) that will operate in respect of the proposed 2022 final dividend. For the 2022 final dividend, ANZ intends to provide shares under the DRP and BOP through the issue of new shares.\n\nFurther details on dividends provided for or paid during the year ended 30 September 2022 are set out in Note 6 Dividends in the Financial Report.\n\n## Shareholders returns\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   D Diivviiddeenndd  ppeerr  sshhaarree ( (cceennttss)) |     |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-----|\n|                                                    2022 | 146 |\n|                                                    2021 | 142 |\n\n|   D Diivviiddeenndd  ppaayyoouutt   r raattiioo 1 1 ( (%%)) | 64.8   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n|                                                        2022 |        |\n|                                                        2021 | 64.9   |\n\n- 1.

Suncorp Bank is a quality business and strategically aligned to ANZ. While still subject to government and regulatory approvals, Suncorp Bank will add more than one million retail customers and provide a platform for growth in the fast-growing Queensland market.\n\nSimilarly, there was good progress made on the establishment of a new Non-Operating Holding Company (NOHC) structure. If approved by shareholders at the upcoming Scheme Meeting, following our 2022 Annual General Meeting (AGM), this will create distinct banking and non-banking groups within the organisation, providing greater flexibility to create value for shareholders.\n\nDuring the year we also made changes to improve productivity and accountability within the organisation. As part of these changes, we combined Australia Retail with our Digital Division, while also separating Commercial Australia as a stand-alone business. Together with New Zealand and Institutional, we now have four core business lines with distinct strategies and opportunities.\n\nOperational improvements within Australia Retail have already resulted in home loan processing times being back in-line with market.",

        "page_content": "Our technology continues to be modernised and we exceeded our target of 9,000 systems migrated to the Cloud or decommissioned with 31% of ANZ applications now hosted in the Cloud.\n\nThe successful launch of our new retail banking platform in Australia, ANZ Plus, was a key milestone for the Group. While uptake was initially tracking slower than planned, momentum has improved following the/uni00A0commencement of marketing and branch activity.\n\nFrom a risk perspective, there were no material credit events, no major regulatory breaches and no overdue regulatory issues. While we are progressed on the development of our Group wide nonfinancial risk framework we are behind schedule with some elements and a $500m capital overlay remains in place. Improvements in this area will be a key focus for the Board and management over the next 12-months.\n\n## 2022 variable remuneration outcomes\n\nAs a Board, we believe we have struck a balance between rewarding good performance while also holding management to account for areas that did not achieve expectations.\n\nOur Chief Executive Officer (CEO) performed well this year. In the Board's view he met expectations in relation to his personal objectives. He also has accountability for the Group's performance which was slightly below expectations.\n\nThe Board determined the appropriate 2022 Short Term Variable Remuneration (STVR) outcome was 74% of his maximum opportunity.\n\nThere was no 2022 Long Term Variable Remuneration (LTVR) award made as we transition to awarding LTVR at the beginning of the year rather than the end. The CEO's proposed 2023 LTVR of $3.375m ($3.5m in 2021) will be subject to a shareholder vote at the upcoming AGM.\n\nFor Disclosed Executives, the Board determined their 2022 STVR outcomes at an average outcome of 78% of maximum opportunity (ranging from 71% to 96% of\n\nmaximum opportunity). This reflects the assessment of 'slightly below expectations' within the ANZ Group Performance Framework and their individual and Divisional performance.\n\n51.6% of the performance rights granted in 2018 to the CEO and Disclosed Executives (excluding the Chief Risk Officer (CRO)) vested when their performance was tested in November 2021 against their performance hurdles. The remaining 48.4% of rights lapsed and executives received no value from this proportion of the awards.\n\n## Changes to the way we remunerate executives\n\nThe introduction of a new remuneration Prudential Standard ( CPS 511 Remuneration ) by our regulator APRA has driven a review of how we reward our executives.\n\nWhile the new regulatory standard does not come into effect until 1 January 2023, a range of changes were implemented in 2022.\n\nImportantly, these changes were designed not only to meet both the letter and spirit of APRA's new prudential standard, but also to maintain our strong focus on performance and risk management, and attract, motivate and keep great people.\n\nIn line with CPS 511 , the key structural changes for the CEO and Disclosed Executives include:\n\n- \u00b7 Restructuring long term variable remuneration to now provide material weight to non-financial measures through the LTVR restricted rights award.\n- \u00b7 Longer deferral (up to 6 years for CEO) with around 80% of variable remuneration deferred to ensure long-term focus.\n- \u00b7 The ability to 'clawback' vested cash and equity variable remuneration where appropriate.\n\n## Additionally, we:\n\n- \u00b7 Separated STVR and LTVR for Disclosed Executives, bringing them in-line with the structure for our CEO.\n- \u00b7 Determined a fixed remuneration (FR) structural increase of approximately 4%\n\nfor Disclosed Executives (excluding the CEO) so as to not materially disadvantage Disclosed Executives as a result of the structural changes. Note the Board decided to defer the payment of this increase to 2023, and also decided that the 2022 STVR opportunity would be based on the FR had the structural increase been effective for 2022.\n\nAs the likelihood of vesting is higher for the LTVR restricted rights for the CEO and Disclosed Executives, we have significantly reduced their total remuneration opportunity.\n\nIt is important to note that the change in structure, and in particular, the change in the award of LTVR from the end of the year to the beginning of the year (i.e., resulting in no 2022 LTVR), makes comparisons with prior year difficult. A summary of the new remuneration structure for 2022 can be found in section 3.\n\n## Fixed remuneration\n\nA market FR adjustment was provided for the CRO, effective 1 October 2021.\n\nThere were no other changes to FR, noting that the ~4% structural adjustment for Disclosed Executives as part of the structural changes will only apply from 1 October 2022.\n\nFollowing a market review, the NonExecutive Director (NED) base fee remained unchanged however fees were increased for the Chairman and for the Chairs/members of most Committees from 1 April 2022.\n\nFinally, while there is more to be done, this was a year where we made good progress towards our strategic ambition. Thank you to all our employees for their commitment and contribution this year.\n\nOn behalf of the Board, I invite you to consider our Remuneration Report which will be presented to shareholders at the 2022 AGM.\n\n## Ilana Atlas, AO\n\nChair - Human Resources Committee",

This reduction reflects the various structural changes - particularly the increased certainty of the LTVR RR component and the ~4% FR structural adjustment.\n\nWhile the new structure applied for 2022, the Board determined that the structural FR adjustment would not be effective until 2023, and that the 2022 STVR opportunity would be based on FR had the structural increase been effective for 2022.

        "page_content": "## 4. 2022 outcomes\n\nVariable remuneration is 'at risk' remuneration and can range from zero to maximum opportunity. Annual performance objectives are set at the Group and also at the Divisional/individual level at the start of each year. They are designed to be stretching yet achievable. The HR Committee and the Board make variable remuneration outcome decisions for the CEO and Disclosed Executives following lengthy and detailed discussions and assessment, supported by comprehensive analysis of performance from a number of sources. Where expectations are met, STVR is likely to be awarded around 80% of maximum opportunity. Where performance is below expectations, STVR will be less (potentially down to zero), and where above expectations, STVR will be more (potentially up to maximum opportunity). LTVR will be awarded at the beginning of the year, based on maximum opportunity unless the LTVR RR pre grant assessment results in any reduction (and also subject to shareholder approval for the CEO).\n\nRemuneration outcomes have been presented in the following three ways:\n\n- i. Actual remuneration received (see section 4.1): Reflects the actual remuneration received in 2022 (i.e., cash paid and the value of prior equity awards which vested in 2022).\n- ii. Year-on-year STVR awarded (see section 4.2): Reflects actual cash and deferred shares components of STVR (or Annual Variable Remuneration (AVR)/Variable Remuneration (VR) in prior years) awarded in respect of the relevant financial year. As non-cash components are subject to future vesting outcomes, the awarded value may be higher or lower than the future realised value.\n- iii. Statutory remuneration (see section 9.1): Reflects remuneration in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards which includes FR and the amortised accounting value of variable remuneration (not the actual awarded or received value in respect of the relevant financial year).\n\n## 4.1 2022 actual remuneration received\n\nThis table shows the remuneration the CEO and Disclosed Executives actually received in relation to the 2022 financial year as cash, or in the case of prior equity awards, the value which vested in 2022.

However when comparing outcomes as a percentage of target, the table highlights that despite the CEO's 2022 STVR outcome being higher as a % of target than 2021 (reflecting his better performance in 2022), his actual 2022 STVR dollar outcome is lower due to the reduced STVR opportunity in the new remuneration structure.\n\n## Year-on-year STVR awarded in the relevant /financial year - CEO\n\n|           |                 |                                | Actual STVR   | Actual STVR   | Actual STVR             | STVR as % of       | STVR as % of         |\n|-----------|-----------------|--------------------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|\n|           | Financial  year | STVR   maximum  opportunity  $ | Total STVR $  | STVR cash $   | STVR deferred  shares $ | Target opportunity | Maximum  opportunity |\n| CEO       |                 |                                |               |               |                         |                    |                      |\n| S Elliott | 2022            | 2,500,000                      | 1,860,000     | 930,000       | 930,000                 | 93%                | 74%                  |\n|           | 2021            | 3,750,000                      | 2,000,000     | 1,000,000     | 1,000,000               | 80%                | 53%                  |\n\n## Disclosed Executives\n\n- \u00b7 The average STVR outcome for current Disclosed Executives is 78% of maximum opportunity, reflecting the overall ANZ Group performance assessment of 'slightly below expectations' (see section 4.5.3). Outcomes as a percentage of maximum opportunity range from 71% to 96%, with the variability at the lower end of the range largely due to being behind schedule on building a Group wide nonfinancial risk framework (currently more Divisionally focused), weaker than expected revenue performance in Markets and some below target customer outcomes (in particular delays in the delivery of our digital innovation product ANZ Plus and home loan performance across the full year), and at the higher end, recognition of the successful execution of the Suncorp Bank purchase agreement and the progress made on the establishment of the new Non-Operating Holding Company (NOHC) structure.\n- \u00b7 For the 2022 Disclosed Executives who were in role for full year 2021 and 2022, the year-on-year STVR dollar outcome has reduced on average by 31%, primarily due to the lower STVR opportunity in the new structure. For example as shown below, even where performance as a percentage of target is similar year-on-year, Disclosed Executives are receiving substantially reduced dollar outcomes. However, the outcomes as a percentage of maximum opportunity appear higher year-on-year because the maximum opportunity has been reduced from 150% to 125% of target in the new structure.\n- \u00b7 Variable remuneration continues to differ both year-on-year and between different executives demonstrating the at risk nature of this element of remuneration and the variability in Group and individual performance year-on-year. See section 4.4 for details.\n\nYear-on-year comparisons of maximum opportunity on a percentage basis (as shown in the below table) are not comparable - as the maximum opportunity has been reduced from 150% of the combined variable remuneration target under the previous structure, to 125% of just the STVR target under the new structure. The 2022 STVR opportunity is significantly lower in 2022 due to the changes in the remuneration structure.",

It also needs to consider the experience and expectations of a range of stakeholders (including shareholders, customers, employees, community and regulators).\n- \u00b7 Attract, motivate and keep great people: In determining remuneration outcomes, the Board acknowledge the importance of balancing performance with being market competitive to ensure retention of key talent - particularly in a competitive talent landscape.\n- \u00b7 Focus on how things are achieved as much as what is achieved: The Board ensures that appropriate consideration and weight is given to performance against objectives (which includes a risk modifier), a risk standards assessment (capturing financial and non-financial risks), and how that performance was achieved (i.e., in accordance with our values and purpose).\n- \u00b7 Fair and simple to understand: Variable remuneration should be fair and consistent through the cycle and have regard to external influences outside of management's control.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n\u00b7\n\n\u00b7\n\n## 2022 CEO individual strategic objectives\n\n- Lead and role model the culture and accountability required to transform ANZ\n- Enhance the reputation of ANZ across all stakeholder groups\n- Drive the strategic direction of the organisation with a particular focus on growth, restore Home\n\n## 4.4 Variable remuneration detail\n\n## 4.4.1 CEO PERFORMANCE, STVR AND LTVR\n\n## Performance\n\nWith regard to STVR, the CEO is assessed 50% on the ANZ Group Performance Framework and 50% on achievement of individual strategic objectives aligned to ANZ's strategy. Both the ANZ Group Performance Framework and individual strategic objectives are agreed by the Board at the start of the financial year and are stretching.\n\n## WEIGHTING OF FINANCIAL METRICS STVR\n\nThe/uni00A0CEO's STVR is not formulaic outcomes are moderated by the Risk element of the ANZ Group Performance Framework and the Board's judgement on/uni00A0the appropriate STVR considering all aspects of performance.\n\n## LTVR\n\nTSR (both relative and absolute) continue to determine the outcome of LTVR PR (50% LTVR weighting). However, LTVR now also includes a 50% weighted RR award that is primarily focused on risk-based measures (as part of the pre grant and pre vest assessments - see section 5.2.4). This ensures LTVR has a material weight to non-financial measures as required under the new APRA Prudential Standard CPS 511 Remuneration .\n\nAt the end of the financial year, ANZ's performance is assessed against the ANZ Group Performance Framework, and the\n\nLending momentum in Australia and embed our digital transformation, Sustainability, Platforms and Ecosystems\n\n\u00b7\n\nF\n\n- ocus on sound risk management, operational excellence and resilience including system stability, to ensure ANZ has robust and reliable platforms toGLYPH<31>support long-term growth\n\n\u00b7\n\nCEO's performance is also assessed against this, along with his individual strategic objectives, the ANZ values (behaviours), delivery of the BEAR obligations and ANZ's risk and compliance standards. In conducting the CEO's performance assessment, the HR Committee seeks input from the Chairman, CRO (on risk management), CFO (on financial performance), GE T&C (on talent and culture matters) and Group General Manager Internal Audit (GGM IA) (on internal audit matters). Material risk, audit and conduct events that have either occurred or come to light in the year are also considered together with input from both the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board.\n\n## The Board has assessed the CEO's 2022 performance as follows:\n\nANZ Group Performance Framework\n\n=\n\nSlightly below expectations (see section 4.5.3)\n\nIndividual strategic objectives\n\n=\n\nMet expectations (see Board assessment below)\n\nANZ values\n\n=\n\nAbove expectations\n\nIndividual risk/ compliance assessment\n\n=\n\nMet expectations\n\nOverall\n\n=\n\nMet most but not all expectations\n\nThe Board has considered the CEO's performance in determining the appropriate STVR outcome for 2022.

        "page_content": "## Board assessment of performance on individual strategic objectives:\n\nThe CEO, supported by his executive team, performed well in a challenging environment. In particular, the CEO led the team in the achievement of a number of important outcomes which will transform and position ANZ for long-term sustainable performance and growth. These include:\n\n- \u00b7 Successful execution of an agreement to purchase Suncorp Bank (which is now subject to regulatory approval), with a well-supported adjacent capital raising designed to provide the fairest possible outcome for all shareholders\n- \u00b7 Taking a lead role in developing a new Australia Commercial strategy - while also driving operational improvements in the business\n- \u00b7 Launching and consistently demonstrating the new cultural behaviours (aligned to our strategy)\n- \u00b7 Launching ANZ Plus - a significant step forward in ANZ's digital transformation, laying the foundations for the future of the retail bank\n- \u00b7 Achieving meaningful progress on environmental sustainability strategies\n- \u00b7 De-risking of the business - exiting non-core customers and products, improving the quality of our processes and tightening risk appetite, a major achievement which sets us up well for the uncertain future\n- \u00b7 Progressing the implementation of a NOHC structure - including the relevant regulatory approvals and ensuring ANZ is ready for implementation early in the new year (subject to shareholder approval at the Scheme Meeting following the 2022 AGM)\n\n## STVR and LTVR\n\nAt the end of the financial year, the HR Committee makes a recommendation to the Board for their approval in respect of the CEO's STVR outcome.\n\nThe CEO's STVR will vary up or down yearon-year, it is not guaranteed, and may range from zero to a maximum opportunity.\n\nThe Board determined that an STVR outcome of $1.86m (74% of maximum opportunity) was appropriate for 2022 having regard to both the overall performance of the CEO and also the overall performance of the Group.\n\nWhile there were some challenges impacting what was an overall strong performance year, the CEO ensured the necessary steps were taken to position ANZ well for 2023, as evidenced by:\n\n- \u00b7 Driving a reset of our delivery approach for a new Group wide non-financial risk framework designed to drive a more integrated approach across the Group\n- \u00b7 Further improvements to home loan processing capability and capacity, which contributed to quality growth with a focus on risk adjusted returns\n\nThe CEO role models ANZ's values. His focus on reshaping ANZ, leading by example, contributed to another strong year of employee engagement at 84% (compared to the Finance & Insurance Benchmark of 79%).\n\nHe has communicated clearly and with authenticity, maintained strong and positive relationships with regulators and government, and been proactive in managing our external reputation. As part of the broader focus on our Group purpose he has engaged regularly with non-profit partners, and environmental and other community groups.\n\nThe CEO has a key role in the management of risk, including active engagement in a range of risk forums and committees to set a clear tone in driving a strong risk culture. There have been ongoing strong outcomes from risk metrics including the long run loss rate, however, there were some delivery challenges which slowed down the implementation of a Group wide nonfinancial risk framework.\n\nNo LTVR award was made for 2022 for the CEO, as we transition to awarding LTVR at the beginning of the year rather than the end. The CEO's proposed 2023 LTVR of $3.375m ($3.5m in 2021) is subject to shareholder approval at the 2022 AGM.\n\n## Summary of total remuneration\n\nAwarded remuneration shown below is significantly lower than 2021 due to nil LTVR award in 2022 year as we transitioned to the new remuneration structure and also the lower STVR award.\n\nThe CEO's risk focus encompasses ensuring ANZ has stable systems, and robust and reliable platforms. ANZ's performance in this area in 2022 has been solid, with no major regulatory breaches, positioning us well for long-term growth (see section 4.5.3 for details).\n\nHis continued focus on strong cost management discipline (i.e., 'run the bank' costs were broadly flat), along with productivity initiatives, has enabled ANZ to invest at record levels and improve the customer experience (e.g., simpler home loan offering in Australia, simpler process for refinancing loans for small businesses), and the employee experience (e.g., new technology platform to enable more effective and efficient workforce execution).\n\nExecutive development continued with the movement of Farhan Faruqui into the CFO role in October 2021, and Maile Carnegie to the position of Group Executive, Australia Retail in March 2022, following the separation of the Australia Retail and Australia Commercial businesses.\n\nFinancial performance included strong revenue momentum across all Divisions and strong performance on net interest margin and cost management.\n\nWhile not all initiatives progressed as quickly as we would have liked, there were many positive achievements, and from a long-term strategy perspective, the CEO has significantly moved the dial in support of our future performance and growth.\n\nReceived remuneration is higher in 2022 due to the increased value at vesting of previously awarded deferred shares which vested in 2022 and the 51.6% LTVR vesting outcome in 2022 compared to 43.3% in 2021, noting that the PR which vested in 2022 were settled by delivery of shares which remain subject to a further one-year restriction period.\n\nStatutory remuneration reflects the accounting expense value for 2022 and is thus different to the remuneration received in 2022 (which includes prior year awards which vested).",

Previously referred to as AVR pre-2022.\n\n## 4.4.2 DISCLOSED EXECUTIVE PERFORMANCE\n\n## Performance\n\nAt the start of each year, stretching performance objectives are set in the form of Divisional Performance Frameworks for each of our Disclosed Executives, in alignment with the ANZ Group Performance Framework approved by the Board.\n\nAt the end of the financial year, the performance of each Disclosed Executive/one.superior is assessed against the ANZ Group Performance Framework (25% to 50% weighting), their Divisional Performance Framework, ANZ's values (behaviours), delivery of BEAR obligations and ANZ's risk and compliance standards.\n\nThe ANZ Group Performance Framework weighting for Disclosed Executives reinforces the importance of collective accountability and contribution to Group outcomes. The respective 2022 weighting varies based on role focus:\n\n- \u00b7 50% Group performance weighting: CFO, GE T&C, and GE Technology\n- \u00b7 25% Group performance weighting: CRO, GE Australia Retail, GE & CEO New Zealand, GE Institutional\n\nSimilar to the ANZ Group Performance Framework, the Divisional Performance Frameworks include the key elements of Financial Discipline and Operational Resilience, Customer, and People and Culture, with Risk acting as a modifier./two.superior The weighting of each element varies to reflect the responsibilities of each individual's role. The Financial Discipline and Operational Resilience element weightings range from 20% to 35%.\n\nThe HR Committee seeks input from the CEO, and independent reports from Risk, Finance, Talent and Culture, and Internal Audit, and also reviews material risk, audit and conduct events, and seeks input from both the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board.\n\nThe HR Committee reviews and recommends to the Board for approval the overall performance outcomes for each Disclosed Executive.\n\n## STVR and LTVR\n\nAt the end of the financial year, the CEO and HR Committee determine STVR recommendations for each Disclosed Executive, which are ultimately approved by the Board/three.superior. STVR varies year-on-year in\n\nline with performance - it is not guaranteed and may be adjusted up or down ranging from zero to a maximum opportunity.\n\nAs highlighted in section 4, performance against objectives impacts STVR outcomes (e.g., where expectations are met, STVR is likely to be awarded around target which equates to 80% of maximum opportunity).\n\nThe degree of variance in individual STVR outcomes reflect the weighting of the Group component (i.e., roles with 50% Group weighting will generally have less differentiation), and relative performance of the different areas/individuals, ensuring appropriate alignment between performance and reward. The outcomes demonstrate the at risk nature of STVR, and that outcomes vary across the Disclosed Executives and also from year to year. The average 2022 STVR for Disclosed Executives is 78% of maximum opportunity (ranging from 71% to 96%).\n\nConsistent with the CEO, no 2022 LTVR awards have been made to Disclosed Executives, as we transition to awarding LTVR at the start of the 2023 year under the new executive remuneration structure.\n\n1. Performance arrangements for the CRO are addressed additionally by the Risk Committee. Performance arrangements for the Group Executive and CEO, New Zealand are determined and approved by the ANZ NZ HR Committee/ANZ NZ Board in consultation with and endorsed by the HR Committee/Board, consistent with their respective regulatory obligations. 2. Except for the CRO who has a percentage weighting assigned to risk measures. 3. Remuneration arrangements for the Group Executive and CEO, New Zealand are determined and approved by the ANZ NZ Board in consultation with and endorsed by the Board, consistent with their respective regulatory obligations.",

The Board decides the CEO's variable remuneration outcomes separately to help mitigate potential conflicts of interest. See section 8.1.3.\n\nAt the end of each financial year the Board exercise their judgement to determine a fair and reasonable ANZIP pool. An assessment of financial performance guides the pool range but it is not a formulaic outcome. The Board considers a range of factors including:\n\n- \u00b7 The ANZ Group Performance Framework assessment (see section 4.5.3).\n- \u00b7 The quality of earnings and operating environment.\n- \u00b7 The shareholder experience during 2022 (e.g., shareholder returns and dividend comparison with prior periods).\n- \u00b7 Our Reward Principles (e.g., attract, motivate and keep great people).\n\n## 4.5.2 ANZ GROUP PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK\n\nThe ANZ Group Performance Framework is approved by the Board at the start of each year. The key objective of our Group Performance Framework is to enable aligned focus across the organisation on delivering the critical outcomes that matter most in delivering on our strategy. It plays a key role to:\n\n- \u00b7 message internally what matters most;\n- \u00b7 reinforce the importance of sound management in addition to risk, customer, people and financial outcomes; and\n- \u00b7 inform focus of effort, prioritisation and decision-making across ANZ.",

COVID continued to provide challenges operationally and for our customers. The hard work de-risking and simplifying the Bank over the previous 5 years and the lessons from COVID in 2020 and 2021 meant ANZ was well positioned to manage through a fast-changing environment.\n\nDespite these challenging circumstances, the achievement of many important initiatives position us well for 2023 and beyond (e.g., the agreement to acquire Suncorp Bank which will add more than one million retail customers and provide a platform for growth in the fast-growing Queensland market, the progress made on establishing the NOHC structure which if approved by shareholders will provide greater flexibility to grow value for shareholders, the new Australia Commercial strategy, sustainability investments), Australia home lending has also been returned to quality growth.\n\nDespite many achievements, we assess our 2022 performance as slightly below expectations primarily due to the slower than expected progress on the build of a Group wide non-financial risk framework (the current framework is more Divisionally focused), and the later than expected launch of our digital innovation product ANZ Plus.\n\nThe below table outlines ANZ's performance objectives in 2022 and provides a summary of outcomes for each of the key performance categories to inform the overall assessment for 2022.\n\nPerformance against expectations is evaluated for each category using a holistic assessment of progress and outcomes delivered in line with our Group strategic priorities and annual focus areas.\n\nA range of objective indicators and subjective factors are considered including management input on work undertaken, evidence of outcomes realised and lessons learned, and with consideration given to the operating, regulatory and competitive environment.",

The Group uses cash profit/one.superior as a measure of performance for the Group's ongoing business activities, as this provides a basis to assess Group and Divisional performance against earlier periods and against peer institutions. The adjustments made in arriving at cash profit are included in statutory profit which is subject to audit. Although cash profit is not audited, the external auditor has informed the Audit Committee that the cash profit adjustments have been determined on a consistent basis across each period presented.\n\nStatutory profit has increased 16% compared to the prior financial year, while cash profit from continuing operations has increased 5%. Part of the improvement has been driven by fewer one-off charges and divestment losses in the prior financial year. Underlying performance reflects stronger revenue, a focus on investing for growth.\n\nDuring 2022 the Group completed a $1.5bn share buy-back to return surplus capital to its shareholders and announced the proposed acquisition of Suncorp Bank to accelerate the growth of our Australia Retail and Australia Commercial businesses, anticipated to complete in calendar year 2023 (subject to regulatory approval). The expected acquisition will be partly funded by the $3.5bn equity raise in 2022.

The annual\n\nmarket review of FR initially scheduled for September 2022 has been deferred until early 2023 to ensure the Board has a clearer picture of the impact of any remuneration changes in the market as a result of APRA's new Prudential Standard CPS 511 Remuneration .\n\nThe CEO and Disclosed Executives' variable remuneration is comprised of STVR and LTVR consistent with external market practice.\n\nVariable remuneration is designed to focus our CEO and Disclosed Executives on stretching performance objectives supporting our business strategy, risk management and the delivery of longterm stakeholder value.\n\n## STVR\n\n## Mix of financial and non-financial measures\n\n## Key Individual Assessment Inputs\n\nANZ values Behaviours\n\nRisk/compliance Including material events\n\nANZ Group Performance Framework 25%-50% weighting\n\nIndividual strategic objectives/Divisional Performance Framework 50%-75% weighting\n\nControl function input Risk, Finance, T&C, Audit\n\n## FY22 ANZ Group Performance Framework Objectives below are examples of key drivers of shareholder value\n\nRISK (MODIFIER)\n\nMaintain risk discipline focused on good customer and regulatory outcomes\n\n- \u00b7 Deliver major regulatory commitments\n- \u00b7 Strengthen risk culture\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Improve time to first decision for Australia home loans\n- \u00b7 Embed digital value propositions\n- \u00b7 Accelerate platforms, markets and sustainability strategies within Institutional\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Drive a culture of performance\n- \u00b7 Attract, retain and develop people with critical skills to reinvent banking\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Deliver economic profit to plan or better in a high-quality manner with sustainable returns\n- \u00b7 Restore Australia home lending momentum and sustainably grow market share in target segments\n\nBEAR obligations\n\nVariable remuneration outcomes are based on a range of measures (as illustrated below), with material weight provided to non-financial measures in accordance with Prudential Standard CPS 511 Remuneration . Our variable remuneration approach has a strong focus on driving long-term sustainable outcomes for shareholders. For example, STVR outcomes include a number of objectives that are considered key drivers of shareholder value, and the significant weighting to the LTVR component (>60% of VR) as well as 50% of STVR delivered as ANZ shares, aligns a large proportion of executive remuneration to the shareholder experience (in respect of the share price and dividend).\n\n## LTVR RR\n\nMostly non-financial\n\nLTVR PR Financial\n\n## ALIGNED TO SHAREHOLDER EXPERIENCE\n\n## Prudential Soundness\n\n- \u00b7 Capital ratio and liquidity prudential minimums\n\n## Risk Measures\n\n- \u00b7 Material risk outcomes Considers all risk types including capital adequacy risk, compliance risk, credit risk, liquidity and funding risk, market risk, operational risk, strategic risk, technology risk and conduct risk\n- \u00b7 APRA active supervision\n- \u00b7 Risk culture\n\n## TSR\n\n- \u00b7 75% relative TSR Rewards for performance relative to that of SFS comparator group\n- \u00b7 25% absolute TSR Ensures there is a continued focus on providing positive growth - even when market is declining\n\nMeasures absolute CAGR\n\n## CUSTOMER (35%)\n\nDeliver great customer outcomes, focused on improving financial wellbeing and experience of priority segments\n\n## PEOPLE & CULTURE (30%)\n\nBuild a culture where our diverse teams are engaged and optimised for success\n\n## FINANCIAL DISCIPLINE & OPERATIONAL RESILIENCE (35%)\n\nRun core businesses well, delivering sustainable growth and operational improvements\n\nAdditional financial and non-financial overlays considered by the Board in determining Group and individual performance and the size of the ANZIP pool include:\n\n- \u00b7 Broader financial performance (beyond scorecard measures)\n- \u00b7 The quality of earnings and operating environment\n- \u00b7 The shareholder experience (e.g., share price growth and/uni00A0dividend comparison with prior periods)",

Deferred variable remuneration has significant retention elements, and most importantly, can be adjusted downwards, including to zero, allowing the Board to hold executives accountable, individually or collectively, for the longer-term impacts of their decisions and actions.\n\nBoard discretion is applied when determining all CEO and Disclosed Executive variable remuneration outcomes including:\n\n- \u00b7 STVR and LTVR outcomes for each financial year;\n- \u00b7 LTVR vesting outcomes (pre vest assessment);\n- \u00b7 Consideration of malus or further deferral before any scheduled release of previously deferred remuneration;\n- \u00b7 Consideration of clawback for up to two years post payment or vesting of variable remuneration from 2022 onwards.

Maximum variable remuneration opportunity has reduced from 270% to 200% of FR for the CRO. The remuneration mix is 33.3% FR/33.3% STVR/33.3% LTVR.\n\nNote for both Disclosed Executives and the CRO, as the Board decided to defer payment of the ~4% FR structural increase for Disclosed Executives to 2023, excluding the FR increase, the 2022 actual maximum opportunity remuneration mix for Disclosed Executives is 29% FR/30% STVR/41% LTVR (and for the CRO 32% FR/34% STVR/34% LTVR).\n\n## 5.2 Variable remuneration delivery\n\nVariable remuneration for the CEO and the Disclosed Executives (excluding the CRO) is delivered as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 STVR as 50% cash and 50% shares deferred equally over years 2 and 3; and\n- \u00b7 LTVR as RR and PR deferred over:\n- - year 4 (33%), year 5 (33%) and year 6 (34%) for the CEO; and\n- - year 4 (50%) and year 5 (50%) for Disclosed Executives.\n\nBoth RR and PR are tested against the relevant performance condition (see section/uni00A05) at the end of the four-year\n\nperformance period and are then subject to additional holding period(s) until the completion of the respective deferral periods.\n\nAt target performance, 63% of variable remuneration for the CEO and Disclosed Executives, and 56% of variable remuneration for the CRO will be deferred for at least four years (from the date the Board approved the variable remuneration in October (and the date shareholders approve the CEO's LTVR)), noting that this complies with the BEAR minimum deferral requirement of 60% for the CEO and 40% for Disclosed Executives. If the CEO receives above target STVR, the amount above target will be delivered as 40% cash and 60% deferred shares (20% year 4, 20% year 5, 20% year 6) to ensure compliance with the minimum deferral requirements with respect to BEAR and APRA's Prudential Standard CPS 511 Remuneration .\n\nBefore any scheduled release of deferred remuneration, the Board considers whether malus should be applied to previously deferred remuneration (or further deferral of vesting) for the CEO and Disclosed Executives. The Board will also consider whether clawback should be applied to variable remuneration granted for the 2022 financial year and beyond. See section 5.3.\n\n## 5.2.1 STVR CASH - CEO AND DISCLOSED EXECUTIVES\n\nThe cash component of STVR is paid to executives at the end of the annual Performance and Remuneration Review (December 2022), and from 2022 is subject to clawback for two years post payment.\n\n## 5.2.2 STVR DEFERRED SHARES CEO AND DISCLOSED EXECUTIVES\n\nBy deferring 50% of an executives' STVR as deferred shares over years two and\n\n| Element              | Detail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Description          | RR and PR provide a right to acquire one ordinary ANZ share at nil cost - as long as applicable time and performance  conditions are met.

We grant deferred shares in respect of performance for the 1 October to 30 September financial year in late November each year.\n\nFor deferred variable remuneration for the CEO and Disclosed Executives, we calculate the number of deferred shares to be granted based on the VWAP of the shares traded on the ASX in the five trading days leading up to and including 1 October (i.e., in line with the beginning of the financial year). Allocations prior to the 2022 financial year are based on the VWAP in the five trading days leading up to and including the date of grant. The VWAP used for allocation varies from the fair value VWAP used for disclosure and expensing purposes (i.e., one-day VWAP at the date of grant).\n\nIn some cases, we may grant deferred share rights to executives instead of deferred shares. Each deferred share right entitles the/uni00A0holder to one ordinary share.\n\n## 5.2.3 LTVR - CEO AND DISCLOSED EXECUTIVES\n\nLTVR reinforces the focus on achieving longer term strategic objectives, driving outperformance relative to peers, and creating long-term sustained value for all stakeholders. The following table details design features common to both LTVR RR and PR.\n\nAs part of the transition to the new remuneration structure there is no 2022 LTVR grant, however this section details the LTVR approach that will apply to the 2023 LTVR award to be granted around November/ December 2022.",

A holistic assessment of measures across STVR and LTVR components was considered to reduce the risk of a 'double impact' to remuneration outcomes. Having a risk-based focus reflects the intent of the new Prudential Standard CPS 511 Remuneration in ensuring remuneration arrangements appropriately incentivise individuals to prudently manage risks. The performance conditions have been designed to ensure there is focus on both material risk events and building a strong risk culture over the longer term.\n\n| Element                                  | Performance condition detail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Performance condition detail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| RR pre grant   and pre vest  assessments | Pre grant assessment purpose:  Determines whether any reduction should be made to RR award value and is primarily  based on outcomes in the prior financial year.

The Cost of Capital is determined using methodologies including the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The Cost  of Capital is regularly reviewed and updated to reflect current market conditions. Due to the prospective nature of  the 2023 PR and given the increased volatility in the 10-year bond rate, the Board determined it was appropriate to  use the 2H average Cost of Capital as the CAGR TSR target for the 2023 PR. |\n|                               | If the absolute CAGR of our TSR then the percentage of PR that vest                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|                               | is less than 9.125% is nil                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|                               | is 9.125% is 50%                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|                               | reaches at least 9.125%, but is less than 13.688% is progressively increased on a pro-rata, straight-line,  basis from 50% to 100%                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|                               | is 100%                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Calculating   TSR performance | reaches or exceeds 13.688% When calculating performance against TSR, we: \u00b7 reduce the impact of share price volatility - by using an averaging calculation over a 90-trading day period for  start and end values; \u00b7 ensure an independent measurement - by engaging the services of an external organisation, Mercer Consulting  (Australia) Pty Ltd, to calculate ANZ's performance against the TSR hurdles; and \u00b7 test the performance against the relevant hurdle once only at the end of the four-year performance period -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n\n## 5.3 Downward adjustment - Board discretion\n\nThe Board can exercise its discretion to apply a number of downward adjustment options as part of consequence management (in accordance with applicable law and any terms and conditions provided). The Board may choose to exercise the following options or a combination of these at any time, but will always consider their use if any of the circumstances specified by Prudential Standard CPS 511 Remuneration occur. The downward adjustment options specified in #1 to #3 below are applicable to all employees, while clawback (#4) in 2022 is currently limited to select employees (primarily the CEO, Disclosed Executives and some senior employees in jurisdictions where clawback regulations apply):\n\n- 1. In year adjustment , the most common type of downward adjustment, which reduces the amount of variable remuneration an employee may have otherwise been awarded for that year.\n- 2. Further deferral/freezing delays the decision to pay/allocate variable remuneration, or further defers the vesting of deferred remuneration or freezes vested/unexercised shares and rights. This would typically only be considered where an investigation is pending/underway.\n- 3. Malus is an adjustment to reduce the value of all or part of deferred remuneration before it has vested. Malus is used in cases of more serious performance or behaviour issues. Any and all variable remuneration we award or grant to an employee is subject to ANZ's on-going and absolute discretion to apply malus and adjust variable remuneration downward (including to zero) at any time before the relevant variable remuneration vests.\n- 4. Clawback is the recovery of variable remuneration that has already vested or been paid. This would typically only be considered if the other types of downward adjustment/other consequences are considered inadequate given the severity of the situation.\n\nBefore any scheduled vesting of deferred remuneration, the Board (for the CEO, Disclosed Executives and other specified roles) and/or the EAG (for other employees) considers whether any further deferral, malus, or clawback should be applied. See section 6 for details.",

Accountability and Consequence Framework\n\nThroughout 2022 we continued to strengthen and evolve ANZ's Accountability and Consequence Framework (A&CF). The Enterprise Accountability Group (EAG) is the primary governance mechanism for the operation of the A&CF.\n\n## 6.1 Role of the EAG\n\nThe EAG is chaired by the CEO and members include the CRO, CFO and GE T&C. It operates under the delegated authority of the HR Committee and is responsible for:\n\n- \u00b7 supporting the Board in monitoring the implementation and ongoing effectiveness of ANZ's A&CF;\n- \u00b7 reviewing the most material risk, conduct and audit events, accountability and the application of consequences, where appropriate;\n- \u00b7 providing guidance to the Divisions and considering initiatives across the Divisions to strengthen risk behaviours;\n- \u00b7 acknowledging material positive risk events (new in 2022) and recognising risk role models, whose achievements are profiled across the organisation; and\n- \u00b7 approving the release or application of downward adjustment for deferred variable remuneration (noting that for the CEO and Disclosed Executives this is approved by the Board).\n\n## 6.2 Material positive risk events\n\nIn 2022, the EAG broadened its scope to include the review of material positive risk decisions and events - times when our proactive approach to identifying and mitigating risk have had a material positive outcome. Reviewing these examples provides an opportunity to acknowledge the importance of these events and share learnings across the enterprise.\n\n## 6.3 Risk role models\n\nIn 2022, 59 individuals were recognised by the EAG for role modelling outstanding risk behaviours through their efforts to manage and mitigate the organisation's risks and contribute to our strong risk culture. The recognition provided included a personalised e-mail from the CEO, and having their achievement profiled on our intranet and in internal newsletters.\n\n## 6.4 Implementation of Prudential Standard CPS 511 Remuneration\n\nAs part of the implementation of APRA's new Prudential Standard CPS 511 Remuneration , we conducted a comprehensive review of our A&CF and related processes to ensure alignment with the new Standard. Whilst it was assessed that the enterprise already complies with most of the new requirements, we have taken the opportunity to enhance our existing A&CF and processes.\n\nWe introduced clawback provisions for the CEO and our Disclosed Executives effective 2022, in addition to existing adjustment tools such as in year adjustment, further deferral and malus, which continue to apply.\n\nOther enhancements included further raising employee awareness with respect to accountability and consequences through more explicit references to the A&CF (including remuneration consequences) in employee training and communications, and simplification of our performance and remuneration policy documents.\n\n## 6.5 Consideration of consequences for material risk, audit and conduct events\n\nThe EAG has processes in place to ensure that we mitigate the risk of conflicts of interest in reviewing events and determining accountability and consequences. For example, when undertaking accountability reviews, a recommendation regarding the review leader and scope must be sent to the CRO or (in the case of an event involving Group Risk) the CEO, for review and approval to ensure the individual is capable of undertaking an impartial and unbiased review.\n\nConsiderations regarding accountability and consequences for our most senior executives are considered and determined by the HR Committee and Board.\n\nReports on the most material risk, audit and conduct issues were presented to the HR, Risk and Audit Committees at a concurrent meeting. This information was taken into consideration by the Board when considering the performance of the Group and the 2022 ANZIP variable remuneration pool for all employees and determining the performance and remuneration outcomes of the CEO and Disclosed Executives.\n\nThe HR Committee and Board consider accountability and consequences for the CEO and Disclosed Executives, including the application of malus to previously deferred remuneration. No malus was applied to the previously deferred remuneration of the CEO and Disclosed Executives during 2022.\n\nWhen determining consequences, consideration is given to the level of accountability, and the severity of the issue, including customer impacts. Consequences may include, for example, one or more of the following: counselling, formal warnings, impacts to in year performance and remuneration outcomes or application of malus to previously deferred remuneration and ultimately termination of employment or clawback for the most serious issues.",

We are also focused on ensuring that we learn from the cause of the event, mitigate the risk of future recurrences and continuously seek to strengthen our risk culture. We review the effectiveness of the A&CF every year and implement enhancements to further strengthen the A&CF based on regulatory and internal stakeholder input.\n\n## 6.7 Speak up culture\n\nWe continue to raise employee awareness of, and promote the various ways employees can speak up and raise issues and ideas for improvement including through initiatives such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Whistleblower awareness training sessions;\n- \u00b7 digital communications designed to build confidence and trust in the Whistleblower Program and process; and\n\nthrough monitoring responses in our employee engagement surveys.\n\nIn addition, key risk and speak-up scores, including 'Leaders demonstrate accountability for risk' (86%), 'I can raise issues without fear of reprisals' (80%) and 'When I speak up, my ideas, opinions and concerns are heard' (83%) remained strong and consistent with 2021 and 2020 results./one.superior\n\n## 6.8 Application of consequences\n\nIn 2022, there were 1,133 employee relations cases involving alleged breaches of our Code of Conduct, with 518 resulting in a formal consequence or the employee leaving ANZ, down from 573 in 2021. Breaches ranged from compliance/ procedure breaches (23%), through to general unacceptable behaviour (36%), email/systems misuse (17%), attendance issues (14%), fraud/theft (4%), conflict of interest (2%) and breaches of our Equal Opportunity, Bullying and Harassment Policy (3%). Outcomes following investigations of breaches this year included 95 terminations, 322 warnings and 101 employees leaving ANZ./two.superior\n\nIn relation to the application of consequences to our senior leadership population (senior executives, executives and senior managers), 21 current and former employees (16 in 2021) had a consequence applied as a result of the application of our Code of Conduct Policy and/or findings of accountability for a relevant event. Consequences included warnings, impacts on performance and remuneration outcomes and, for former employees, malus of previously deferred remuneration where relevant.\n\nAll employees and contractors across the enterprise are required to complete mandatory learning modules. Permanent employees who fail to complete their mandatory learning requirements within 30 days of the due date are (in the absence of genuinely exceptional circumstances) ineligible for any FR or variable remuneration as part of our annual Performance and Remuneration Review. In 2022, the mandatory learning course compliance rate across the enterprise was 99.9%.",

Non-Executive Director (NED) remuneration\n\n## 7.1 Remuneration structure\n\nNEDs receive a fee for being a Director of the Board, and additional fees for either chairing, or being a member of a Board Committee. The Chairman of the Board does not receive additional fees for serving on a Board Committee.\n\nThe HR Committee and Board reviewed NED fees for 2022 and determined that the NED member fee and Committee fees for the Audit Committee chair and members would remain unchanged (noting that the Chairman, NED and Committee fees have remained unchanged since 2016 with the exception of the Digital Business & Technology Committee Chair fee which has remained unchanged since 2020). From 1 April 2022 fees increased for the Chairman, and for the chairs and members of the Risk Committee, HR Committee, Digital Business & Technology Committee, and Ethics, Environment, Social & Governance Committee.\n\nIn setting Board and Committee fees, the Board considers: general industry practice, ASX Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations, the responsibilities and risks attached to the NED role, the time commitment expected of NEDs on Group and Company matters, and fees paid to NEDs of comparable companies.\n\nANZ compares NED fees to a comparator group of Australian listed companies with a similar market capitalisation, with particular focus on the major financial services institutions. This is considered an appropriate group, given similarity in size and complexity, nature of work and time commitment by NEDs.\n\nTo maintain NED independence and impartiality:\n\n- \u00b7 NED fees are not linked to the performance of the Group; and\n- \u00b7 NEDs are not eligible to participate in any of the Group's variable remuneration arrangements.\n\nThe current aggregate fee pool for NEDs of $4m was approved by shareholders at the 2012 AGM. The annual total of NEDs' fees, including superannuation contributions, is within this agreed limit.\n\nThis table shows the NED fee policy structure for 2022.\n\n## 2022 NED fee policy structure\n\n1H22\n\n2H22\n\n|                                                    | Chair fee   | Member fee   | Chair fee   | Member fee   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|\n| Board/one.superior/comma.superior /two.superior    | $825,000    | $240,000     | $850,000    | $240,000     |\n| Audit Committee                                    | $65,000     | $32,500      | $65,000     | $32,500      |\n| Risk Committee                                     | $62,000     | $31,000      | $65,000     | $32,500      |\n| HR Committee                                       | $57,000     | $29,000      | $65,000     | $32,500      |\n| Digital Business & Technology Committee            | $45,000     | $15,000      | $55,000     | $27,500      |\n| Ethics, Environment, Social & Governance Committee | $35,000     | $15,000      | $55,000     | $27,500      |\n\n## NED shareholding guidelines\n\nThe HR Committee reviewed the shareholding guideline for the Chairman and determined that from 1 October 2021 it be increased from 200% of the NED member fee to 100% of the Chairman fee (i.e., from $480,000 to $850,000).\n\nWe expect our NEDs to hold ANZ shares. NEDs are required:\n\n- \u00b7 to accumulate shares - over a five-year period from their appointment to the value of:\n- - 100% of the NED member fee for Directors;\n- - 100% of the Chairman fee for the Chairman; and\n- \u00b7 to maintain this shareholding while they are a Director of ANZ.\n\nBased on the ANZ share price as at 30 September 2022, all NEDs but one who have served five years met the holding guideline. The value of the ANZ securities held by one NED who has served for more than 5 years as at 30 September dropped slightly below the guideline due to fluctuations in the ANZ share price.",

Year-on-year differences in fees relate to changes to the NED fee and also to the superannuation Maximum Contribution Base. From 1 October 2021 to 30 June 2022, G Liebelt, and from 1/uni00A0October 2020 to the date of retirement P Dwyer, elected to receive all payments in fees and therefore did not receive superannuation contributions during this period. 2. Non monetary benefits generally consist of company-funded benefits (and the associated Fringe Benefits Tax) such as car parking and gifts provided upon retirement. 3. Long-term benefits and share-based payments do not apply for the NEDs. 4. C O'Reilly's 2022 remuneration reflects a partial service year as she commenced as a NED on 1 November 2021. 5. J Smith's 2022 remuneration reflects a partial service year as he commenced as a NED on 1 August 2022. 6. P Dwyer's 2022 remuneration reflects a partial service year as she retired as a NED on 16 December 2021.",

Go to anz.com > Our company > Strong governance framework > ANZ Human Resources Committee Charter.\n\n## 8.1.2 LINK BETWEEN REMUNERATION AND RISK\n\nThe HR Committee has a strong focus on the relationship between business performance, risk management and remuneration, aligned with our business strategy. The chairs of the Risk and Audit Committees are members of the HR Committee and the full Board is in attendance for specific HR Committee meetings. A concurrent meeting of the HR, Risk and Audit Committees was held to review:\n\n- \u00b7 material risk, conduct and audit events that either occurred or came to light in 2022;\n- \u00b7 2022 performance and variable remuneration recommendations at both the Group, CEO and Disclosed Executive level.\n\nTo further reflect the importance of the link between remuneration and risk:\n\n- \u00b7 the Board had two NEDs (in addition to the Chairman) in 2022 who served on both the HR Committee and the Risk Committee;\n- \u00b7 the HR Committee has free and unfettered access to risk and financial control personnel (the CRO and CFO attend HR Committee meetings for specific agenda items);\n- \u00b7 the CRO (together with GE T&C and GGM IA) provides an independent report to\n\nthe HR Committee on the most material risk, conduct and audit events (as relevant) to help inform considerations of performance and remuneration, and accountability and consequences at the Group, Divisional and individual level;\n\n- \u00b7 the CRO also provides an independent report to assist the Board in their assessment of performance and remuneration outcomes for the CEO and Disclosed Executives;\n- \u00b7 the chairs of the Risk and Audit Committees are asked to provide input to ensure appropriate consideration of all relevant risk and internal audit issues;\n- \u00b7 the ANZ Group Performance Framework and Divisional Performance Frameworks include Risk as a key element acting as a modifier, and it forms an integral part of each framework's assessment and directly impacts the overall outcomes; and\n- \u00b7 the LTVR RR pre grant and pre vest assessments undertaken by the Board are primarily based on non-financial risk outcomes.\n\n## 8.1.3 CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n\nTo help mitigate potential conflicts of interest:\n\n- \u00b7 management are not in attendance when their own performance or remuneration is being discussed by the HR Committee or Board;\n- \u00b7 the CEO's STVR is funded and determined separately from the ANZIP variable remuneration pool;\n- \u00b7 the CRO's remuneration arrangements differ to other Disclosed Executives to preserve the independence of the role;\n- \u00b7 the EAG also has processes in place to help mitigate conflicts of interest as outlined in section 6; and\n- \u00b7 the HR Committee seeks input from a number of sources to inform their consideration of performance and remuneration outcomes for the CEO and Disclosed Executives including:\n- - independent reports from Risk, Finance, Talent and Culture, and Internal Audit;\n- - material risk, conduct and audit event data provided by the CRO;\n- - input from both the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee of the Board.",

This information related to market data, market practices, analysis and modelling, legislative requirements and the interpretation of governance and regulatory requirements.\n\nDuring the year, ANZ did not receive any remuneration recommendations from external consultants about the remuneration of KMP.\n\nANZ employs in-house remuneration professionals who provide recommendations to the HR Committee and the Board. The Board made its decisions independently,\n\nusing the information provided and with careful regard to ANZ's strategic objectives, purpose and values, risk appetite and the ANZBGL Remuneration Policy and Principles.\n\n## 8.2 Internal governance\n\n## 8.2.1 HEDGING PROHIBITION\n\nAll deferred equity must remain at risk until it has fully vested. Accordingly, executives and their associated persons must not enter into any schemes that specifically protect the unvested value of equity allocated.

If an executive is terminated due to redundancy or they are classified as a 'good leaver', unless the Board  determines otherwise, then: \u00b7 their STVR (deferred shares/share rights) remain on foot and are released at the original vesting date; \u00b7 their LTVR (RR/PR) (for grants awarded from 31 December 2020) remain on foot and are released at the  original vesting date/four.numerator (to the extent that the performance hurdles are met); and                                                                           |\n| Change of control   (applies to the CEO only)  | If a change of control or other similar event occurs, then we will test the performance conditions applying   to the CEO's PR. They will vest to the extent that the performance conditions are satisfied. A transitional agreement between ANZBGL and the CEO has been implemented that documents that if  the proposed change in legal structure proceeds (to create distinct banking and non-banking groups,  see 'Note 35 Pending Organisational Changes Impacting Future Reporting Periods' of the Annual Report),  then it will not give rise to a 'Change of Control' under the conditions of grant relating to unvested variable  remuneration equity awards. |\n\n- 1. 3 months by the former acting CFO. 2. For M Carnegie, K Corbally, F Faruqui, G Florian, K van der Merwe, M Whelan and M Hand, their contracts state that in particular circumstances they may be eligible for a retrenchment benefit in accordance with the relevant ANZ policy, as varied from time to time, and M Hand was also eligible to receive a Retirement Allowance on retirement, retrenchment, death, or resignation for illness, incapacity or domestic reasons (see footnote 5 of section 9.1). For A Watson, notice on retrenchment is 6 weeks and compensation on retrenchment is calculated on a scale up to a maximum of 79 weeks after 25 years' service. 3. 6 months by ANZ for the former acting CFO. 4. This approach is more aligned to industry practice. 5. Or deferred share rights granted to the CRO instead of PR.\n- \u00b7 maintain this shareholding level while they are an executive of ANZ.\n\nExecutives are permitted to sell ANZ securities to meet taxation obligations on employee equity even if below the 200% guideline. However, tax obligations for the purpose of these guidelines is limited to that arising from the initial taxing point event (i.e., when the deferred shares vest or rights are exercised).\n\nShareholdings include all vested and unvested equity (excluding PR). Based on equity holdings as at 30 September 2022, and the STVR deferred shares to be granted on 22 November 2022 as a result of the 2022 Performance and Remuneration Review outcomes, the CEO and all Disclosed Executives meet or, if less than five years' tenure, are on track to meet their minimum shareholding guidelines requirements.",

As required by AASB 2 Share-based payments , the amortisation value includes a proportion of the fair value (taking into account market-related vesting conditions) of all equity that had not yet fully vested as at the commencement of the financial year. The fair value is determined at grant date and is allocated on a straight-line basis over the relevant vesting period. The amount included as remuneration neither relates to, nor indicates, the benefit (if any) that the executive may ultimately realise if the equity becomes exercisable. No terms of share-based payments have been altered or modified during the financial year. There were no cash settled share-based payments or any other form of share-based payment compensation during the financial year for the CEO or Disclosed Executives. 8. Other equity allocations relate to shares received in relation to the historical Employee Share Offer. 9. F Farhan's 2022 remuneration reflects a partial service year as he commenced in a Disclosed Executive role on 11 October 2021. 10. A Watson's fixed remuneration is paid in NZD and converted to AUD. 2021 cash salary, superannuation contribution and total remuneration restated to include gross value of KiwiSaver employer superannuation contributions relating to fixed remuneration and cash VR, and this represents a total change of AUD 17,622. In 2019 and 2020 A Watson was eligible to receive shares under the historical Employee Share Offer. That offer provided a grant of ANZ shares in each financial year to eligible employees subject to Board approval. 11. S Buggle's 2022 remuneration reflects a partial service year up to the date he ceased in a Disclosed Executive role on 10 October 2021 (noting his annual fixed remuneration for 2022 remained unchanged at $1.1m). 12. M Hand's 2022 remuneration reflects a partial service year up to the date he ceased in a Disclosed Executive role on 28 February 2022 (noting his annual fixed remuneration for 2022 remained unchanged at $1.2m).",

For the 2022 financial year the five highest paid executives include five Disclosed Executives. Rights granted to Disclosed Executives as remuneration in 2022 are included in the table. No rights have been granted to the CEO, Disclosed Executives or the five highest paid executives since the end of 2022 up to the Directors' Report sign-off date. 2. The point in time value of deferred shares/deferred share rights and/or performance rights is based on the one day VWAP of the Company's shares traded on the ASX on the date of vesting, lapsing/forfeiture or exercising/sale/transfer out of trust, multiplied by the number of deferred shares/deferred share rights and/or performance rights. The exercise price for all deferred share rights/performance rights is $0.00. No terms or conditions of grant of the share-based payment transactions have been altered or modified during the reporting period. 3. The number vested and exercisable is the number of shares, options and rights that remain vested at the end of the reporting period. No shares, options and rights were vested and unexercisable.",

        "page_content": "## Directors' report\n\nThe Directors' Report for the /financial year ended 30 September 2022 has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 . The information below forms part of this Directors' Report:\n\n- \u00b7 Principal activities on page 12;\n- \u00b7 Operating and /financial review on pages 44 to 60;\n- \u00b7 Dividends on page 58;\n- \u00b7 Information on the Directors, Company Secretaries and Directors' meetings on pages 26 to 35;\n- \u00b7 Remuneration report on pages 62 to 103.\n\n## Signi/ficant changes in state of a/ffairs\n\nThere have been no signi/ficant changes in the Group's state of a/ffairs.\n\n## Events since the end of the /financial year\n\nThere have been no signi/ficant events from 30 September 2022 to the date of signing this report.\n\n## Participation in political-related activities\n\nANZ aims to assist the democratic process in Australia by attending and participating in paid events hosted by the major federal political parties. For the year ended 30 September 2022, ANZ contributed $90,000 to participate in political activities hosted by the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal Party of Australia. These activities included speeches, political functions and policy dialogue forums. ANZ discloses these contributions to the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), noting the AEC's reporting year is a di/fferent period to ANZ's /financial year.\n\n## Environmental regulation\n\nANZ recognises the expectations of its stakeholders - customers, shareholders, sta/ff and the community - to operate in a way that mitigates its environmental impact.\n\nIn Australia, ANZ meets the requirements of the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (Cth) , which imposes reporting obligations where energy production, usage or greenhouse gas emissions trigger speci/fied thresholds.\n\nThe Group does not believe that its operations are subject to any other particular and signi/ficant environmental regulation under a law of the Commonwealth of Australia or of an Australian State or Territory. It may become subject to environmental regulation as a result of its lending activities in the ordinary course of business and has developed policies, which are reviewed on a regular basis to help identify and manage such environmental matters.\n\nHaving made due enquiry, and to the best of ANZ's knowledge, no entity of the Group has incurred any material environmental liability during the year.\n\nFurther details of ANZ's environmental performance, including progress against its targets and management of material issues aligned with its commitment to fair and responsible banking and priority areas of /financial wellbeing, environmental sustainability and housing, are available in ANZ's ESG Supplement, at anz.com/annualreport .\n\n## Corporate Governance Statement\n\nANZ is committed to maintaining a high standard in its governance framework. ANZ con/firms it has followed the ASX Corporate Governance Council's Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations (4th edition) during the 2022 /financial year. ANZ's Corporate Governance Statement, together with the ASX Appendix 4G which relates to the Corporate Governance Statement, can be viewed at anz.com/corporategovernance and has been lodged with the ASX.\n\n## Pillar III information\n\nANZ provides information required by APS 330: Public Disclosure in the Regulatory Disclosures section at anz.com/shareholder/ centre/reporting/regulatory-disclosure/ .\n\n## External auditor\n\nThe Group's external auditor is KPMG. The Group appointed Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co (predecessor to KPMG) in 1969.\n\nThe Board Audit Committee conducts a formal annual performance assessment of the external auditor, including whether to commence an external tender for the audit. After considering relevant factors including tenure, audit quality, local and international capability and experience, and independence, the Board Audit Committee resolved to reappoint KPMG for the 30 September 2023 /financial year audit.\n\nKPMG regularly rotates Group Lead Audit Engagement Partner and the Engagement Quality Control Review Partner with the most recent rotation being for the /financial year ended 30 September 2021 and 30 September 2020 respectively.\n\n## Non-audit services\n\nThe Group's Stakeholder Engagement Model for Relationship with the External Auditor (the Policy), which incorporates requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and industry best practice, prevents the external auditor from providing services that are perceived to be in con/flict with the role of the external auditor or breach independence requirements. This includes consulting advice and sub-contracting of operational activities normally undertaken by management, and engagements where the external auditor may ultimately be required to express an opinion on its own work.\n\n## Speci/fically the Policy:\n\n- \u00b7 Limits the scope of non-audit services that may be provided;\n- \u00b7 Requires that audit, audit-related and permitted non-audit services be considered in light of independence requirements and for any potential con/flicts of interest before they are approved by the Audit Committee, or approved by the Chair of the Audit Committee (or delegate) and noti/fied to the Audit Committee; and\n- \u00b7 Requires pre-approval before the external auditor can commence any engagement for the Group.",

In accordance with the employee indemnity policy, the Company has during or since the year ended\n\n105\n\n30 September 2022 paid legal expenses totalling $328,250.32 incurred by Mr Richard Moscati in relation to legal proceedings that had been brought against him and the Company by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions.\n\nThe Company has entered into Indemnity Deeds with each of its Directors, with certain secretaries and former Directors of the Company, and with certain employees and other individuals who act as directors or o/fficers of related bodies corporate or of another company, to indemnify them against liabilities and legal costs of the kind mentioned in the Company's Constitution.\n\nDuring the /financial year, the Company has paid premiums for insurance for the bene/fit of the Directors and employees of the Company and related bodies corporate of the Company. In accordance with common commercial practice, the insurance prohibits disclosure of the nature of the liability insured against and the amount of the premium.\n\n## Key management personnel and employee share and option plans\n\nThe Remuneration Report contains details of Non-Executive Directors, Chief Executive O/fficer and Disclosed Executives' equity holdings and options/rights issued during the 2022 /financial year and as at the date of this report.\n\nNote 31 Employee Share and Option Plans to the 2022 Financial Report contains details of the 2022 /financial year and as at the date of this report:\n\n- \u00b7 Options/rights issued over shares granted to employees;\n- \u00b7 Shares issued as a result of the exercise of options/rights granted to employees; and\n- \u00b7 Other details about share options/rights issued, including any rights to participate in any share issues of the Company.\n\nThe names of all persons who currently hold options/rights are entered in the register kept by the Company pursuant to section 170 of the Corporations Act 2001 .

ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThese are the financial statements for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (the Company) and its controlled entities (together, the Group or ANZ) for the year ended 30 September 2022. The Company is a publicly listed company incorporated and domiciled in Australia. The address of the Company's registered office and its principal place of business is ANZ Centre, 833 Collins Street, Docklands, Victoria, Australia 3008. The Group provides banking and financial services to individuals and business customers and operates in and across 32 markets.\n\nOn 26 October 2022, the Directors resolved to authorise the issue of these financial statements.\n\nInformation in the financial statements is included only to the extent we consider it material and relevant to the understanding of the financial statements. A disclosure is considered material and relevant if, for example:\n\n- \uf0b7 the amount is significant in size (quantitative factor);\n- \uf0b7 the information is significant by nature (qualitative factor);\n- \uf0b7 the user cannot understand the Group's results without the specific disclosure (qualitative factor);\n- \uf0b7 the information is critical to a user's understanding of the impact of significant changes in the Group's business during the period - for example, business acquisitions or disposals (qualitative factor);\n- \uf0b7 the information relates to an aspect of the Group's operations that is important to its future performance (qualitative factor); and\n- \uf0b7 the information is required under legislative requirements of the Corporations Act 2001, the Banking Act 1959 (Cth) or by the Group's principal regulators, including the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA).\n\nThis section of the financial statements:\n\n- \uf0b7 outlines the basis upon which the Group's financial statements have been prepared; and\n- \uf0b7 discusses any new accounting standards or regulations that directly impact the financial statements.\n\n## BASIS OF PREPARATION\n\nThis financial report is a general purpose (Tier 1) financial report prepared by a 'for profit' entity, in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards (AASs) and other authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB), the Corporations Act 2001, and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and interpretations published by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).\n\nWe present the financial statements of the Group in Australian dollars, which is the Company's functional and presentation currency. We have rounded values to the nearest million dollars ($m), unless otherwise stated, as allowed under the ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors Report) Instrument 2016/191. We measure the financial statements of each entity in the Group using the currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates (the functional currency).\n\n## BASIS OF MEASUREMENT AND PRESENTATION\n\nWe have prepared the financial information in accordance with the historical cost basis - except the following assets and liabilities which we have stated at their fair value:\n\n- \uf0b7 derivative financial instruments and in the case of fair value hedging, a fair value adjustment made to the underlying hedged item;\n- \uf0b7 financial instruments held for trading;\n- \uf0b7 financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss;\n- \uf0b7 financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income; and\n- \uf0b7 assets and liabilities classified as held for sale (except those required to be at carrying value).\n\nIn accordance with AASB 119 Employee Benefits (AASB 119) we have measured defined benefit obligations using the Projected Unit Credit Method.\n\nDuring the 2022 financial year, the Group revised its treatment of ongoing trail commission payable to mortgage brokers and now recognises a liability within Payables and other liabilities equal to the present value of expected future trail commission payments and a corresponding increase in capitalised brokerage costs in Net loans and advances. Comparatives have not been restated.\n\nThe sale of Wealth Australia business to IOOF Holdings Limited (IOOF, now known as Insignia Financial Limited) and Zurich Financial Services Australia (Zurich) completed across 2020 and 2019. The separation of the business sold to Zurich completed in early April 2022, and the business sold to IOOF completed in early October 2022. The financial results of these divested businesses are treated as discontinued operations from a financial reporting perspective.",

        "page_content": "## 1. ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\n## BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group comprise the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries. An entity, including a structured entity, is considered a subsidiary of the Group when we determine that the Company has control over the entity. Control exists when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. We assess power by examining existing rights that give the Company the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the entity. We have eliminated, on consolidation, the effect of all transactions between entities in the Group.\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION\n\n## TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the relevant functional currency at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction. At the reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the relevant spot rate. Any foreign currency translation gains or losses that arise are included in profit or loss in the period they arise.\n\nWe measure translation differences on non-monetary items at fair value through profit or loss and report them as part of the fair value gain or loss on these items. For non-monetary items classified as investment securities measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, translation differences are included in Other comprehensive income.\n\n## FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF FOREIGN OPERATIONS THAT HAVE A FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY THAT IS NOT AUSTRALIAN DOLLARS\n\nThe financial statements of our foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars for consolidation into the Group Financial Statements using the following method:\n\n| Foreign currency item   | Exchange rate used                                                                                                                                                         |\n|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Assets and liabilities  | The reporting date rate                                                                                                                                                    |\n| Equity                  | The initial investment date rate                                                                                                                                           |\n| Income and expenses     | The average rate for the period - but if for a significant transaction we believe the average rate is not  reasonable, then we use the rate at the date of the transaction |\n\nExchange differences arising from the translation of financial statements of foreign operations are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity. When we dispose of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences are transferred to profit or loss.\n\n## FIDUCIARY ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Group provides fiduciary services to third parties including custody, nominee and trustee services. This involves the Group holding assets on behalf of third parties and making decisions regarding the purchase and sale of financial instruments. If ANZ is not the beneficial owner or does not control the assets, then we do not recognise these transactions in these financial statements, except when required by accounting standards or another legislative requirement.\n\n## KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nIn the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, management has made a number of judgements and applied estimates and assumptions about past and future events. Further information on the key judgements and estimates that we consider material to the financial statements are contained within each relevant note to the financial statements.\n\nWhilst the course of the COVID-19 pandemic is moderating and the management of its impact on the populace, businesses and economic activity is better understood, the responses of consumers, business and governments remain uncertain. Compounding the effects of the pandemic are mounting geopolitical tensions, global supply chain disruptions, the conflict in Ukraine, commodity price pressures and increasing inflation and interest rates impacting the economy. Thus, there remains an elevated level of estimation uncertainty involved in the preparation of these financial statements.\n\nThe Group has made various accounting estimates in this Financial Report based on forecasts of economic conditions which reflect expectations and assumptions at 30 September 2022 about future events considered reasonable in the circumstances. There is a considerable degree of judgement involved in preparing these estimates. Actual economic conditions are likely to be different from those forecast since anticipated events frequently do not occur as expected, and the effect of these differences may significantly impact accounting estimates included in these financial statements. The significant accounting estimates impacted by these forecasts and associated uncertainties are predominantly related to expected credit losses and recoverable amounts of non-financial assets.\n\nThe impact of these uncertainties on each of these accounting estimates is discussed further below and/or in the relevant notes in this Financial Report. Readers should consider these disclosures in light of the inherent uncertainties described above.",

ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\n## INTEREST RATE BENCHMARK REFORM\n\nInterbank offered rates (IBORs) have played a critical role in global financial markets, serving as reference rates for derivatives, loans and securities, and in the valuation of financial instruments. The IBOR reforms have a wide-ranging impact for the Group and our customers given the fundamental differences between IBORs and risk-free rates (RFRs). The key difference between IBORs and RFRs is that IBOR rates include a term and bank credit risk premium, whereas RFRs do not. As a result of these differences, adjustments are required to an RFR to ensure contracts referencing an IBOR rate transition on an economically comparable basis.\n\n## Update on the Group's approach to interest rate benchmark reform\n\nIn line with the regulatory announcements made in 2021, the majority of IBOR rates, including Pound Sterling (GBP), Euro (EUR), Swiss Franc (CHF), Japanese Yen (JPY), and the US Dollar (USD) 1-week and 2-month LIBOR rate settings ceased on 31 December 2021 and have been replaced by alternative RFRs. This transition had an immaterial impact to the Group's profit and loss. Through its loan and derivative transactions with customers, issuance of debt and its asset and liability management activities the Group continues to have exposure to the remaining USD LIBOR settings and other IBOR-related benchmarks that are due to largely cease by 30 June 2023.\n\nThe Group continues to manage the transition from the remaining USD LIBOR tenors and other remaining IBOR settings to RFR's through its enterprise-wide Benchmark Transition Program (the Program). The program is responsible for managing the risks associated with the transition including operational, market, legal, conduct and financial reporting risks that may arise.\n\n## Exposures subject to benchmark reform as at 30 September 2022\n\nThe table below shows the Group's exposure to interest rate benchmarks subject to IBOR reform. These are financial instruments that contractually reference an IBOR benchmark planned to transition to an RFR and have a contractual maturity date beyond the planned IBOR cessation date.\n\n| As at 30 September 2022                 | USD Libor  $m   | Others  $m   |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------|\n| Loan and advances 1                     | 13,349          | 126          |\n| Non-derivative financial assets 1       | 154             | -            |\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities 2  | 669             | 36           |\n| Derivative asset (notional value) 3     | 571,393         | 14,400       |\n| Derivative liability (notional value) 3 | 553,754         | 14,540       |\n| Loan commitments 1,4                    | 16,312          | 222          |\n\n## Hedge accounting exposures subject to IBOR reform\n\nThe Group has hedge-accounted relationships referencing USD LIBOR, primarily due to fixed rate investment securities and the Group's fixed rate debt issuances denominated in USD that are designated in fair value hedge accounting relationships. The table below details the carrying values of the Group's USD exposures designated in hedge accounting relationships referencing LIBOR that will be impacted by reform. The nominal value of the associated hedging instruments is also included:\n\n| Hedged items                   |                                |                                | As at 30 September 2022  $m   |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Investment securities at FVOCI | Investment securities at FVOCI | Investment securities at FVOCI | 8,457                         |\n| Net loans and advances         | Net loans and advances         | Net loans and advances         | 216                           |\n| Deposits and other borrowings  | Deposits and other borrowings  | Deposits and other borrowings  | 163                           |\n| Debt issuances                 | Debt issuances                 | Debt issuances                 | 19,861                        |\n|                                | Notional designated up to      | Notional designated            |                               |\n|                                | 30 June 2023                   | beyond 30 June 2023            | Total notional amount         |\n| Hedging instruments            | $m                             | $m                             | $m                            |\n| Fair value hedges              | 8,523                          | 21,795                         | 30,318                        |\n| Cash flow hedges               | -                              | 286                            | 286                           |",

ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\n## ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ADOPTED IN THE PERIOD\n\nThere were no new accounting standards or interpretations adopted in 2022 that had a significant effect on the Group.\n\nAccounting policies have been consistently applied, unless otherwise noted.\n\n## ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT EARLY ADOPTED\n\nA number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been published but are not mandatory for the financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2022 and have not been applied by the Group in preparing these financial statements. Further details of these are set out below.\n\n## GENERAL HEDGE ACCOUNTING\n\nAASB 9 Financial Instruments (AASB 9) introduces new hedge accounting requirements which more closely align accounting with risk management activities undertaken when hedging both financial and non-financial risks. AASB 9 provides the Group with an accounting policy choice to continue to apply the AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (AASB 139) hedge accounting requirements until the International Accounting Standards Board's ongoing project on macro hedge accounting is completed. The Group continues to apply the hedge accounting requirements of AASB 139.\n\n## AASB 17 INSURANCE CONTRACTS (AASB 17)\n\nThe final version of AASB 17 was issued in July 2017 and is not effective for the Group until 1 October 2023. It will replace AASB 4 Insurance Contracts, AASB 1023 General Insurance Contracts and AASB 1038 Life Insurance Contracts. AASB 17 establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts.\n\nThe measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements under AASB 17 are significantly different from current accounting standards. Although the overall profit recognised in respect of insurance contracts will not change, it is expected that the timing of profit recognition will change.\n\nAASB 17 is not expected to have a material impact on the Group.\n\n## DEFERRED TAX RELATED TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARISING FROM A SINGLE TRANSACTION\n\nAASB 2021-5 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards - Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction amends AASB 112 Income Taxes and clarifies that entities are required to recognise deferred tax on transactions for which there is both an asset and a liability and that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. This may include transactions such as leases and decommissioning or restoration obligations. This amendment is effective for the Group from 1 October 2023 and is not expected to have a significant impact.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

We use the effective interest rate method to calculate the amortised cost of assets held at amortised cost and to recognise interest income on financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts the stream of estimated future cash receipts or payments over the expected life of the financial instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. For assets subject to prepayment, we determine their expected life on the basis of historical behaviour of the particular asset portfolio - taking into account contractual obligations and prepayment experience.\n\nWe recognise fees and costs, which form an integral part of the financial instrument (for example loan origination fees and costs), using the effective interest rate method. These are presented as part of interest income or expense depending on whether the underlying financial instrument is a financial asset or financial liability.\n\n## Major Bank Levy\n\nThe Major Bank Levy Act 2017 (levy or major bank levy) applies a rate of 0.06% to certain liabilities of the Company. The Group has determined that the levy represents a finance cost for the Group and the Company and it is presented as interest expense in the Income Statement.",

NON-INTEREST INCOME (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\n## OTHER OPERATING INCOME\n\n## Fee and Commission Revenue\n\nWe recognise fee and commission revenue arising from contracts with customers (a) over time when the performance obligation is satisfied across more than one reporting period, or (b) at a point in time when the performance obligation is satisfied immediately or is satisfied within one reporting period.\n\n- \uf0b7 lending fees exclude fees treated as part of the effective yield calculation of interest income. Lending fees include certain guarantee and commitment fees where the loan or guarantee is not likely to be drawn upon, and other fees charged for providing customers a distinct good or service that are recognised separately from the underlying lending product.\n- \uf0b7 non-lending fees include fees associated with deposit and credit card accounts, interchange fees and fees charged for specific customer transactions such as international money transfers. Where the Group provides multiple goods or services to a customer under the same contract, the Group allocates the transaction price of the contract to distinct performance obligations based on the relative stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation. Revenue is recognised as each performance obligation is satisfied.\n- \uf0b7 commissions represent fees from third parties where we act as an agent by arranging a third party (such as an insurance provider) to provide goods and services to a customer. In such cases, we are not primarily responsible for providing the underlying good or service to the customer. If the Group collects funds on behalf of a third party when acting as an agent, we only recognise the net commission it retains as revenue. When the commission is variable based on factors outside our control (such as a trail commission), revenue is only recognised if it is highly probable that a significant reversal of the variable amount will not be required in future periods.\n- \uf0b7 funds management income represents fees earned from customers for providing financial advice and fees for asset management services and advice provided to investment funds. Revenue is recognised either at the point the financial advice is provided or over the period in which the asset management services are delivered. Performance fees associated with funds management activities are only recognised when it becomes highly probable the performance hurdle will be achieved.\n\n## Net Foreign Exchange Earnings and Other Financial Instruments Income\n\nWe recognise the following as net foreign exchange earnings and other financial instruments income:\n\n- \uf0b7 exchange rate differences arising on the settlement of monetary items and translation differences on monetary items translated at rates different to those at which they were initially recognised or included in a previous financial report;\n- \uf0b7 fair value movements (excluding realised and accrued interest) on derivatives that we use to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk on funding instruments not designated as accounting hedges;\n- \uf0b7 the ineffective portions of fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and net investment hedges;\n- \uf0b7 immediately upon sale or repayment of a hedged item, the unamortised fair value adjustments to items designated as fair value hedges and amounts accumulated in equity related to designated cash flow hedges;\n- \uf0b7 fair value movements on financial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss or held for trading;\n- \uf0b7 amounts released from the fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) reserve when a debt instrument classified as FVOCI is sold; and\n- \uf0b7 the gain or loss on derecognition of financial assets or liabilities measured at amortised cost.\n\n## Gain or Loss on Disposal of Non-Financial Assets\n\nThe gain or loss on the disposal of assets is the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the proceeds of disposal net of costs. This is recognised in Other income in the year in which the significant risks and rewards from the asset transfer to the buyer.\n\nWhen a non-financial asset or group of assets is classified as held for sale, the difference between the carrying value immediately prior to reclassification and the fair value less costs to sell is recognised in Other operating income to align with the classification of gain or loss on sale that would have applied if the sale had completed during the year.",

OPERATING EXPENSES (continued)\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\n## OPERATING EXPENSES\n\nOperating expenses are recognised as services are provided to the Group, over the period in which an asset is consumed, or once a liability is created.\n\n## SALARIES AND RELATED COSTS - ANNUAL LEAVE, LONG SERVICE LEAVE AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\n\nWages and salaries, annual leave and other employee entitlements expected to be paid or settled within twelve months of employees rendering service are measured at their nominal amounts using remuneration rates that the Group expects to pay when the liabilities are settled.\n\nWe accrue employee entitlements relating to long service leave using an actuarial calculation. It includes assumptions regarding staff departures, leave utilisation and future salary increases. The result is then discounted using market yields at the reporting date. The market yields are determined from a blended rate of high quality corporate bonds with terms to maturity that closely match the estimated future cash outflows.\n\nIf we expect to pay short term cash bonuses, then a liability is recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount (as a result of past service provided by the employee) and the obligation can be reliably measured.\n\nPersonnel expenses also include share-based payments which may be cash or equity settled. We calculate the fair value of equity settled remuneration at grant date, which is then amortised over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in share capital or the share option reserve as applicable. When we estimate the fair value, we take into account market vesting conditions, such as share price performance conditions. We take non-market vesting conditions, such as service conditions, into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments included in the expense.\n\nAfter the grant of an equity-based award, the amount we recognise as an expense is reversed when non-market vesting conditions are not met, for example an employee fails to satisfy the minimum service period specified in the award on resignation, termination or notice of dismissal for serious misconduct. However, we do not reverse the expense if the award does not vest due to the failure to meet a marketbased performance condition.\n\nFurther information on share-based payment schemes operated by the Group during the current and prior year is included in Note 31 Employee Share and Option Plans.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

        "page_content": "## 5. INCOME TAX (continued)\n\n## TAX CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe Company and all its wholly owned Australian resident entities are part of a tax-consolidated group under Australian taxation law. The Company is the head entity in the tax-consolidated group. We recognise each of the following in the separate financial statements of members of the tax consolidated group on a 'group allocation' basis: tax expense/income, and deferred tax liabilities/assets that arise from temporary differences for members of the tax-consolidated group. The Company (as head entity in the tax-consolidated group) recognises current tax liabilities and assets of the tax-consolidated group.\n\nUnder a tax funding arrangement between the entities in the tax-consolidated group, amounts are recognised as payable to or receivable by the Company and each member of the tax-consolidated group in relation to the tax contribution amounts paid or payable between the Company and the other members of the tax-consolidated group.\n\nMembers of the tax-consolidated group have also entered into a tax sharing agreement that provides for the allocation of income tax liabilities between the entities were the head entity to default on its income tax payment obligations.\n\n## UNRECOGNISED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\n\nUnrecognised deferred tax assets related to unused realised tax losses (on revenue account) total $1 million (2021: $6 million) for the Group and nil (2021: $2 million) for the Company.\n\nUnrecognised deferred tax liabilities related to additional potential foreign tax costs (assuming all retained earnings in offshore branches and subsidiaries are repatriated) total $250 million (2021: $344 million) for the Group and $18 million (2021: $15 million) for the Company.\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\n## INCOME TAX EXPENSE\n\nIncome tax expense comprises both current and deferred taxes and is based on the accounting profit adjusted for differences in the accounting and tax treatments of income and expenses (that is, taxable income). We recognise tax expense in profit or loss except when the tax relates to items recognised directly in equity and other comprehensive income, in which case we recognise the tax directly in equity or other comprehensive income respectively.\n\n## CURRENT TAX EXPENSE\n\nCurrent tax is the tax we expect to pay on taxable income for the year, based on tax rates (and tax laws) which are enacted at the reporting date. We recognise current tax as a liability (or asset) to the extent that it is unpaid (or refundable).\n\n## DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\n\nWe account for deferred tax using the balance sheet method. Deferred tax arises because the accounting income is not always the same as the taxable income. This creates temporary differences, which usually reverse over time. Until they reverse, we recognise a deferred tax asset, or liability, on the balance sheet. We measure deferred taxes at the tax rates that we expect will apply to the period(s) when the asset is realised, or the liability settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date.\n\nWe offset current and deferred tax assets and liabilities only to the extent that:\n\n- \uf0b7 they relate to income taxes imposed by the same taxation authority;\n- \uf0b7 there is a legal right and intention to settle on a net basis; and\n- \uf0b7 it is allowed under the tax law of the relevant jurisdiction.\n\n## KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nJudgement is required in determining provisions held in respect of uncertain tax positions. The Group estimates its tax liabilities based on its understanding of the relevant law in each of the countries in which it operates and seeks independent advice where appropriate.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

Eligible shareholders can elect to forgo their dividend entitlement and instead receive ANZ ordinary shares under the Company's Bonus Option Plan (BOP). For the 2022 final dividend, DRP and BOP participation will be satisfied by an issue of new ANZ ordinary shares. There will be no discount applied to the DRP and BOP price.\n\nRefer to Note 24 Shareholders' Equity for details of shares the Company purchased or issued in respect of the DRP and BOP.",

Instalment tax payments on account of the 2022 financial year, which will be made after 30 September 2022, will generate sufficient franking credits to enable the 2022 final dividend to be fully franked. The extent to which future dividends will be franked will depend on a number of factors, including the level of profits generated by the Group that will be subject to tax in Australia.\n\n## RESTRICTIONS ON THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS\n\nAPRA's written approval is required before paying dividends on ANZ ordinary shares if:\n\n- \uf0b7 the aggregate dividends exceed the Company's after tax earnings (in calculating those after tax earnings, we take into account any payments we made on senior capital instruments) in the financial year to which they relate; or\n- \uf0b7 the Group's Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio falls within capital range buffers specified by APRA.\n\nIf the Company fails to pay a dividend or distribution on its ANZ Capital Notes or ANZ Capital Securities on the scheduled payment date, it may (subject to a number of exceptions) be restricted from resolving to pay or paying any dividend on the ANZ ordinary shares.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE\n\nBasic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares (WANOS) outstanding during the period (after eliminating ANZ shares held within the Group known as treasury shares).

SEGMENT REPORTING\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF SEGMENTS\n\nOn 1 March 2022, the Group announced a structural change to the existing Australia Retail and Commercial division, and the digital businesses in the Group Centre division (formerly known as the Technology, Services & Operations (TSO) and Group Centre division). This involved the integration of the Australian retail and digital businesses, and the separation of the Australian commercial business into a new division to improve productivity and accountability within the organisation. As a result of these changes there are now six divisions: Australia Retail, Australia Commercial, Institutional, New Zealand, Pacific and Group Centre, aligned to distinct strategies and opportunities within the Group. Comparative information has been restated accordingly.\n\nThe Group's six operating segments are presented on a basis that is consistent with the information provided internally to the Chief Executive Officer, who is the chief operating decision maker. This reflects the way the Group's businesses are managed, rather than the legal structure of the Group.\n\nWe measure the performance of these segments on a cash profit basis. To calculate cash profit, we remove certain non-core items from statutory profit. Details of these items are included in the 'Other items' section of this note. Transactions between business units across segments within ANZ are conducted on an arm's length basis and disclosed as part of the income and expenses of these segments.\n\nThe reportable segments are divisions engaged in providing either different products or services or similar products and services in different geographical areas. They are as follows:\n\n## Australia Retail\n\nThe Australia Retail division provides a full range of banking services to Australian consumers.

We deliver our services via our internet and app-based digital solutions and a network of branches, mortgage specialists, relationship managers and contact centres.\n- \uf0b7 Business provides a full range of banking services including small business banking, through our digital, branch and contact centre channels, and traditional relationship banking and sophisticated financial solutions through dedicated managers.

Financial assets are classified into these measurement classifications on the basis of two criteria:\n\n- \uf0b7 the business model within which the financial asset is managed; and\n- \uf0b7 the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset (specifically whether the contractual cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest).\n\nThe resultant financial asset classifications are as follows:\n\n- \uf0b7 Amortised cost: Financial assets with contractual cash flows that comprise solely payments of principal and interest and which are held in a business model whose objective is to collect their cash flows;\n- \uf0b7 FVOCI: Financial assets with contractual cash flows that comprise solely payments of principal and interest and which are held in a business model whose objective is to collect their cash flows or to sell the assets; and\n- \uf0b7 FVTPL: Any other financial assets not falling into the categories above are measured at FVTPL.\n\n## Fair value option for financial assets\n\nA financial asset may be irrevocably designated on initial recognition:\n\n- \uf0b7 at FVTPL when the designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise; or\n- \uf0b7 at FVOCI for investments in equity securities, where that instrument is neither held for trading nor contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination.\n\n## 9. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and other balances, as outlined below, that are convertible into cash with an insignificant risk of changes in value and with remaining maturities of three months or less, including reverse repurchase agreements.\n\n|                                                                       | Consolidated   | Consolidated   | The Company   | The Company   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                                                       | 2022  $m       | 2021  $m       | 2022  $m      | 2021  $m      |\n| Coins, notes and cash at bank                                         | 1,147          | 1,127          | 787           | 721           |\n| Securities purchased under agreements to resell in less than 3 months | 15,996         | 17,571         | 14,372        | 16,465        |\n| Balances with central banks                                           | 127,790        | 107,915        | 118,928       | 101,400       |\n| Settlement balances owed to ANZ within 3 months                       | 23,199         | 24,647         | 21,396        | 22,850        |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                             | 168,132        | 151,260        | 155,483       | 141,436       |",

and\n- \uf0b7 that are settled at a future date.\n\nMovements in the price of the underlying variables, which cause the value of the contract to fluctuate, are reflected in the fair value of the derivative.\n\n## PURPOSE\n\nThe Group's derivative financial instruments have been categorised as following:\n\n| Trading                              | Derivatives held in order to:  \uf0b7 meet customer needs for managing their own risks.  \uf0b7 manage risks in the Group that are not in a designated hedge accounting relationship (some elements of balance  sheet management).  \uf0b7 undertake market making and positioning activities to generate profits from short-term fluctuations in prices   |\n|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Designated in Hedging  Relationships | Derivatives designated into hedge accounting relationships in order to minimise profit or loss volatility by matching  movements in underlying positions relating to:  \uf0b7 hedges of the Group's exposures to interest rate risk and currency risk.                                                                                           |\n\n## TYPES\n\nThe Group offers or uses four different types of derivative financial instruments:\n\n| Forwards   | A contract documenting the rate of interest, or the currency exchange rate, to be paid or received on a notional  principal amount at a future date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Futures    | An exchange traded contract in which the parties agree to buy or sell an asset in the future for a price agreed on the  transaction date, with a net settlement in cash paid on the future date without physical delivery of the asset.                                                                                                                                              |\n| Swaps      | A contract in which two parties exchange one series of cash flows for another.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Options    | A contract in which the buyer of the contract has the right - but not the obligation - to buy (known as a 'call option')  or to sell (known as a 'put option') an asset or instrument at a set price on a future date.

Different arrangements for posting of collateral exist with these exchanges:\n\n- \uf0b7 some transactions are subject to clearing arrangements which result in separate recognition of collateral assets and liabilities, with the carrying values of the associated derivative assets and liabilities held at their fair value.\n- \uf0b7 other transactions, are legally settled by the payment or receipt of collateral which reduces the carrying values of the related derivative instruments by the amount paid or received.\n\n## DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - HELD FOR TRADING\n\nThe majority of the Group's derivative financial instruments are held for trading.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\n| Recognition                              | Initially and at each reporting date, we recognise all derivatives at fair value. If the fair value of a  derivative is positive, then we carry it as an asset, but if its value is negative, then we carry it as a  liability.   Valuation adjustments are integral in determining the fair value of derivatives. This includes:  \uf0b7 a credit valuation adjustment to reflect the counterparty risk and/or event of default; and   |\n|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Derecognition of  assets and liabilities | We remove derivative assets from our Balance Sheet when the contracts expire or we have transferred  substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership. We remove derivative liabilities from our Balance  Sheet when the Group's contractual obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.                                                                                                                                 |\n| Impact on the   Income Statement         | The recognition of gains or losses on derivative financial instruments depends on whether the  derivative is held for trading or is designated in a hedging relationship. For derivative financial  instruments held for trading, gains or losses from changes in the fair value are recognised in profit or  loss.                                                                                                                |\n|                                          | For an instrument designated in a hedging relationship, the recognition of gains or losses depends on  the nature of the item being hedged. Refer to the table on page 138 for details of the recognition  approach applied for each type of hedge accounting relationship.  Sources of hedge ineffectiveness may arise from differences in the interest rate reference rate, margins,                                             |\n| Hedge effectiveness                      | To qualify for hedge accounting under AASB 139, a hedge relationship is expected to be highly  effective. A hedge relationship is highly effective only if the following conditions are met:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|                                          | \uf0b7 the hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash  flows attributable to the hedged risk during the period for which the hedge is designated  (prospective effectiveness); and  \uf0b7 the actual results of the hedge are within the range of 80-125% (retrospective effectiveness).                                                                                                |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nJudgement is required when we select the valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of derivatives, particularly the selection of valuation inputs that are not readily observable, and the application of valuation adjustments to certain derivatives.

By way of exception, bills of exchange (a form of security/transferable instrument) which are used to facilitate the Group's customer lending activities are classified as Loans and advances (rather than Investment securities) to better reflect the substance of the arrangement.\n\nEquity investments not held for trading purposes may be designated at FVOCI on an instrument by instrument basis. If this election is made, gains or losses are not reclassified from Other comprehensive income to profit or loss on disposal of the investment. However, gains or losses may be reclassified within equity.\n\nAssets disclosed as Investment securities are subject to the general classification and measurement policy for Financial Assets outlined at the commencement of the Group's financial asset disclosures on page 133. Additionally, expected credit losses associated with 'Investment securities - debt securities at amortised cost' and 'Investment securities - debt securities at fair value through other comprehensive income' are recognised and measured in accordance with the accounting policy outlined in Note 14 Allowance for Expected Credit Losses. For 'Investment securities - debt securities at fair value through other comprehensive income', the allowance for Expected Credit Loss (ECL) is recognised in the FVOCI reserve in equity with a corresponding charge to profit or loss.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nJudgement is required when we select valuation techniques used to determine the fair value of assets not valued using quoted market prices, particularly the selection of valuation inputs that are not readily observable. Refer to Note 19 Fair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities for further details.",

Subsequently, we then measure loans and advances at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, net of any allowance for expected credit losses, or at fair value when they are specifically designated on initial recognition as fair value through profit or loss, are classified as held for sale or when held for trading.\n\nWe classify contracts to lease assets and hire purchase agreements as finance leases if they transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the customer or an unrelated third party. We include these facilities in 'Other' in the table above.\n\nThe Group enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets that are recognised on its Balance Sheet. When the Group retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of the transferred assets, the transferred assets remain on the Group's Balance Sheet, however if substantially all the risks and rewards are transferred, the Group derecognises the asset. If the risks and rewards are partially retained and control over the asset is lost, the Group derecognises the asset. If control over the asset is not lost, the Group continues to recognise the asset to the extent of its continuing involvement.\n\nWe separately recognise the rights and obligations retained, or created, in the transfer of assets as appropriate.\n\nAssets disclosed as Net loans and advances are subject to the general classification and measurement policy for financial assets outlined on page 133. Additionally, expected credit losses associated with loans and advances at amortised cost are recognised and measured in accordance with the accounting policy outlined in Note 14 Allowance for Expected Credit Losses.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\n## EXPECTED CREDIT LOSS MODEL\n\nThe measurement of expected credit losses reflects an unbiased, probability weighted prediction which evaluates a range of scenarios and takes into account the time value of money, past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions.\n\nExpected credit losses are either measured over 12 months or the expected lifetime of the financial asset, depending on credit deterioration since origination, according to the following three-stage approach:\n\n- \uf0b7 Stage 1: At the origination of a financial asset, and where there has not been a Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) since origination, an allowance equivalent to 12 months ECL is recognised reflecting the expected credit losses resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months from the reporting date. For instruments with a remaining maturity of less than 12 months, expected credit losses are estimated based on default events that are possible over the remaining time to maturity.\n- \uf0b7 Stage 2: Where there has been a SICR since origination, an allowance equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised reflecting expected credit losses resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. If credit risk were to improve in a subsequent period such that the increase in credit risk since origination is no longer considered significant, the exposure returns to a Stage 1 classification with ECL measured accordingly.\n- \uf0b7 Stage 3: Where there is objective evidence of impairment, an allowance equivalent to lifetime ECL is recognised.\n\nExpected credit losses are estimated on a collective basis for exposures in Stage 1 and Stage 2, and on either a collective or individual basis when transferred to Stage 3.\n\n## MEASUREMENT OF EXPECTED CREDIT LOSS\n\nECL is calculated as the product of the following credit risk factors at a facility level, discounted to incorporate the time value of money:\n\n- \uf0b7 Probability of default (PD) - the estimate of the likelihood that a borrower will default over a given period;\n- \uf0b7 Exposure at default (EAD) - the expected balance sheet exposure at default taking into account repayments of principal and interest, expected additional drawdowns and accrued interest; and\n- \uf0b7 Loss given default (LGD) - the expected loss in the event of the borrower defaulting, expressed as a percentage of the facility's EAD, taking into account direct and indirect recovery costs.\n\nThese credit risk factors are adjusted for current and forward-looking information through the use of macroeconomic variables.\n\n## EXPECTED LIFE\n\nWhen estimating ECL for exposures in Stage 2 and 3, the Group considers the expected lifetime over which it is exposed to credit risk.\n\nFor non-retail portfolios, the Group uses the maximum contractual period as the expected lifetime for non-revolving credit facilities. For non-retail revolving credit facilities, such as corporate lines of credit, the expected life reflects the Group's contractual right to withdraw a facility as part of a contractually agreed annual review, after taking into account the applicable notice period.\n\nFor retail portfolios, the expected lifetime is determined using a behavioural term, taking into account expected prepayment behaviour and events that give rise to substantial modifications.\n\n## DEFINITION OF DEFAULT, CREDIT IMPAIRED AND WRITE-OFFS\n\nThe definition of default used in measuring ECL is aligned to the definition used for internal credit risk management purposes across all portfolios. This definition is also in line with the regulatory definition of default. Default occurs when there are indicators that a debtor is unlikely to fully satisfy contractual credit obligations to the Group, or the exposure is 90 days past due.\n\nFinancial assets, including those that are well secured, are considered credit impaired for financial reporting purposes when they default.\n\nWhen there is no realistic probability of recovery, loans are written off against the related impairment allowance on completion of the Group's internal processes and when all reasonably expected recoveries have been collected. In subsequent periods, any recoveries of amounts previously written-off are recorded as a release to the credit impairment charge in the income statement.",

ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (continued)\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT (continued)\n\n## MODIFIED FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nIf the contractual terms of a financial asset are modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one for either credit or commercial reasons, an assessment is made to determine if the changes to the terms of the existing financial asset are considered substantial. This assessment considers both changes in cash flows arising from the modified terms as well as changes in the overall instrument risk profile; for example, changes in the principal (credit limit), term, or type of underlying collateral. Where a modification is considered non-substantial, the existing financial asset is not derecognised and its date of origination continues to be used to determine SICR. Where a modification is considered substantial, the existing financial asset is derecognised and a new financial asset is recognised at its fair value on the modification date, which also becomes the date of origination used to determine SICR for this new asset.\n\n## SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CREDIT RISK (SICR)\n\nStage 2 assets are those that have experienced a SICR since origination. In determining what constitutes a SICR, the Group considers both qualitative and quantitative information:\n\n- i. Internal credit rating grade\n- For the majority of portfolios, the primary indicator of a SICR is a significant deterioration in the internal credit rating grade of a facility since origination and is measured by application of thresholds.\n\nFor non-retail portfolios, a SICR is determined by comparing the Customer Credit Rating (CCR) applicable to a facility at reporting date to the CCR at origination of that facility. A CCR is assigned to each borrower which reflects the PD of the borrower and incorporates both borrower and non-borrower specific information, including forward-looking information. CCRs are subject to review at least annually or more frequently when an event occurs which could affect the credit risk of the customer.\n\nFor retail portfolios, a SICR is determined, depending on the type of facility, by either comparing the scenario weighted lifetime PD at the reporting date to that at origination, or by reference to customer behavioural score thresholds. The scenario weighted lifetime probability of default may increase significantly if:\n\n- \uf0b7 there has been a deterioration in the economic outlook, or an increase in economic uncertainty; or\n- \uf0b7 there has been a deterioration in the customer's overall credit position, or ability to manage their credit obligations.\n- ii. Backstop criteria\n\nThe Group uses 30 days past due arrears as a backstop criterion for both non-retail and retail portfolios. For retail portfolios only, facilities are required to demonstrate three to six months of good payment behaviour prior to being allocated back to Stage 1.\n\n## FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\n\nForward-looking information is incorporated into both our assessment of whether a financial asset has experienced a SICR since origination and in our estimate of ECL. In applying forward-looking information for estimating ECL, the Group considers four probability-weighted forecast economic scenarios as follows:\n\n- i. Base case scenario\n\nThe base case scenario is ANZ's view of future macroeconomic conditions. It reflects management's assumptions used for strategic planning and budgeting, and also informs the Group Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) which is the process the Group applies in strategic and capital planning over a 3-year time horizon;\n\n- ii. Upside and iii. Downside scenarios\n\nThe upside and downside scenarios are fixed by reference to average economic cycle conditions (that is, they are not based on the economic conditions prevailing at balance date) and are based on a combination of more optimistic (in the case of the upside) and pessimistic (in the case of the downside) economic events and uncertainty over long term horizons; and\n\n- iv. Severe downside scenario\n\nTo better reflect the current economic conditions and geopolitical environment, the Group has altered the severe downside scenario in 2022 from a scenario fixed by reference to average economic cycle conditions to one which aligns with the scenario used for Groupwide stress testing.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT (continued)\n\n## FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION (continued)\n\nThe four scenarios are described in terms of macroeconomic variables used in the PD, LGD and EAD models (collectively the ECL models) depending on the lending portfolio and country of the borrower. Examples of the macroeconomic variables include unemployment rates, GDP growth rates, house price indices, commercial property price indices and consumer price indices.\n\nProbability weighting of each scenario is determined by management considering the risks and uncertainties surrounding the base case economic scenario, as well as specific portfolio considerations where required. The Group Asset and Liability Committee (GALCO) is responsible for reviewing and approving the base case economic scenario and the Credit and Market Risk Committee (CMRC) approves the probability weights applied to each scenario.\n\nWhere applicable, temporary adjustments may be made to account for situations where known or expected risks have not been adequately addressed in the modelling process. CMRC is responsible for approving such adjustments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nCollectively assessed allowance for expected credit losses\n\nIn estimating collectively assessed ECL, the Group makes judgements and assumptions in relation to:\n\n- \uf0b7 the selection of an estimation technique or modelling methodology; and\n- \uf0b7 the selection of inputs for those models, and the interdependencies between those inputs.\n\nThe following table summarises the key judgements and assumptions in relation to the model inputs and the interdependencies between those inputs, and highlights significant changes during the current period.\n\nThe judgements and associated assumptions have been made within the context of the uncertainty of how various factors might impact the global economy and reflect historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The Group's ECL estimates are inherently uncertain and, as a result, actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n| Judgement/Assumption                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Considerations for the year ended 30 September 2022                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Determining when a  Significant Increase in  Credit Risk has occurred | In the measurement of ECL, judgement is  involved in setting the rules and trigger points  to determine whether there has been a SICR  since initial recognition of a loan, which would  result in the financial asset moving from Stage 1  to Stage 2.

ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (continued)\n\n## KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES (continued)\n\nThe base case economic forecasts for Australia, New Zealand and Rest of World reflect the expected slow down in economic activity globally from higher interest rates and increasing inflation, along with declining residential property prices until 2024. Tight labour markets are expected to persist until central banks' monetary policies have the intended impact of reducing demand and bringing inflation down.\n\n## Probability weightings\n\nProbability weightings for each scenario are determined by management considering the risks and uncertainties surrounding the base case economic scenario, including the uncertainties described above.\n\nThe base case scenario represents an overall deterioration in the forecasts since September 2021 for all three geographical segments. Given uncertainties associated with how the economy may respond to rapidly moving factors including inflation and lower economic growth globally, the average upside case weighting across geographies has been reduced to 0% (Sep 21: 5%), the base case weighting has been increased to 45% (Sep 21: 41%), and the severe downside scenario increased to 15% (Sep 21: 6%).\n\nThe assigned probability weightings in Australia, New Zealand and Rest of World are subject to a high degree of inherent uncertainty and therefore the actual outcomes may be significantly different to those projected.

Additionally, financial liabilities can be designated at FVTPL where:\n\n- \uf0b7 the designation eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch which would otherwise arise;\n- \uf0b7 a group of financial liabilities are managed and their performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management strategy; or\n- \uf0b7 the financial liability contains one or more embedded derivatives unless:\n- a) the embedded derivative does not significantly modify the cash flows that otherwise would be required by the contract; or b) the embedded derivative is closely related to the host financial liability.\n\nWhere financial liabilities are designated as measured at fair value, gains or losses relating to changes in the entity's own credit risk are included in Other comprehensive income, except where doing so would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss.",

Any remaining amount of fair value gain or loss we recognise directly in profit or loss. Once we have recognised an amount in Other comprehensive income, we do not later reclassify it to profit or loss.\n\nSecurities sold under repurchase agreements represent a liability to repurchase the financial assets that remain on our balance sheet since the risks and rewards of ownership remain with the Group. Over the life of the repurchase agreement, we recognise the difference between the sale price and the repurchase price and charge it to interest expense in profit or loss.",

During 2022, the Group revised its treatment of ongoing trail commission payable to mortgage brokers to recognise a liability within Payables and other liabilities equal to the present value of expected future trail commission payments and a corresponding increase in capitalised brokerage costs in Net loans and advances. The balance at 30 September 2022 was $1,320 million for the Group and the Company. Comparatives have not been restated.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\nThe Group recognises liabilities when there is a present obligation to transfer economic resources as a result of past events.\n\nBelow is the measurement basis for each item classified as other liabilities:\n\n- \uf0b7 Payables, accruals and other liabilities are measured at the contractual amount payable or the best estimate of consideration required to settle the payable.\n- \uf0b7 Liabilities at fair value are trading liabilities measured based on quoted prices in active markets.\n- \uf0b7 Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments using the Group's incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date. The carrying amount is then subsequently adjusted to reflect the interest on the lease liability, lease payments that have been made and any lease reassessments or modifications.\n- \uf0b7 Trail commission liabilities are measured based on the present value of expected future trail commission payments taking into consideration average behavioural loan life and outstanding balances of broker originated loans.",

DEBT ISSUANCES\n\nThe Group uses a variety of funding programmes to issue senior debt (including covered bonds and securitisations) and subordinated debt. The difference between senior debt and subordinated debt is that holders of senior debt take priority over holders of subordinated debt owed by the relevant issuer. In the winding up of the relevant issuer, the subordinated debt will be repaid by the relevant issuer only after the repayment of claims of its depositors, other creditors and the senior debt holders.\n\n|                                              | Consolidated   | Consolidated   | The Company   | The Company   |\n|----------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                              | 2022  $m       | 2021  $m       | 2022  $m      | 2021  $m      |\n| Senior debt                                  | 52,324         | 58,952         | 40,325        | 45,348        |\n| Covered bonds                                | 12,967         | 15,399         | 9,371         | 11,342        |\n| Securitisation                               | 1,115          | 1,424          | -             | -             |\n| Total unsubordinated debt                    | 66,406         | 75,775         | 49,696        | 56,690        |\n| Subordinated debt                            |                |                |               |               |\n| - Additional Tier 1 capital                  | 7,705          | 8,506          | 7,763         | 8,191         |\n| - Tier 2 capital                             | 17,907         | 16,207         | 17,907        | 16,207        |\n| - Other subordinated debt securities 1       | 1,716          | 566            | 462           | -             |\n| Total subordinated debt                      | 27,328         | 25,279         | 26,132        | 24,398        |\n| Total debt issued                            | 93,734         | 101,054        | 75,828        | 81,088        |\n| Residual contractual maturity 2 :            |                |                |               |               |\n| Within one year                              | 25,208         | 22,621         | 21,990        | 18,512        |\n| More than one year                           | 66,660         | 76,594         | 51,929        | 60,605        |\n| No maturity date (instruments in perpetuity) | 1,866          | 1,839          | 1,909         | 1,971         |\n| Total debt issued                            | 93,734         | 101,054        | 75,828        | 81,088        |\n\n## TOTAL DEBT ISSUED BY CURRENCY\n\nThe table below shows the Group's issued debt by currency of issue, which broadly represents the debt holders' base location.\n\nConsolidated\n\nThe Company\n\n|                   |                                                                         | 2022  $m   | 2021  $m   | 2022  $m   | 2021  $m   |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| USD               | United States dollars                                                   | 25,527     | 29,788     | 17,206     | 22,354     |\n| EUR               | Euro                                                                    | 19,923     | 22,984     | 14,049     | 15,294     |\n| AUD               | Australian dollars                                                      | 36,398     | 35,709     | 35,259     | 34,299     |\n| NZD               | New Zealand dollars                                                     | 1,628      | 3,276      | 46         | 839        |\n| JPY               | Japanese yen                                                            | 2,159      | 1,854      | 2,159      | 1,853      |\n| CHF               | Swiss francs                                                            | 954        | 940        | -          | -          |\n| GBP               | Pounds sterling                                                         | 5,261      | 4,286      | 5,261      | 4,287      |\n| HKD               | Hong Kong dollars                                                       | 771        | 727        | 771        | 727        |\n| Other             | Chinese yuan, Norwegian kroner, Singapore dollars and Canadian  dollars | 1,113      | 1,490      | 1,077      | 1,435      |\n| Total debt issued | Total debt issued                                                       | 93,734     | 101,054    | 75,828     | 81,088     |\n\n## SUBORDINATED DEBT\n\nAt 30 September 2022, all subordinated debt issued by the Company qualifies as regulatory capital for the Group (other than the Company's USD 300 million perpetual subordinated notes - refer to commentary below). Depending on their terms and conditions, the Company's subordinated debt instruments are classified as either Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital for the Group (in the case of the ANZ Capital Notes (ANZ CN) and ANZ Capital Securities (ANZ CS)), or Tier 2 capital (in the case of the Company's term subordinated notes) for APRA's capital adequacy purposes.\n\nSubordinated debt issued externally by ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited (ANZ Bank New Zealand) will constitute subordinated debt of both ANZ Bank New Zealand and the Group. Whilst it will constitute tier 2 capital for ANZ Bank New Zealand for the purposes of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) capital requirements, it will not constitute Tier 2 capital for the Group as the terms of the subordinated debt does not satisfy APRA's capital requirements.\n\nTier 2 capital instruments rank ahead of AT1 capital instruments, and AT1 capital instruments rank only ahead of ordinary shares, in any liquidation event impacting the issuer of the instruments.",

DEBT ISSUANCES (continued)\n\n## AT1 Capital\n\nAll outstanding AT1 capital instruments of the Company are Basel III fully compliant instruments (refer to Note 25 Capital Management for further information about Basel III). Each of the ANZ CN and ANZ CS rank equally with each other.\n\nDistributions on the AT1 capital instruments are non-cumulative and subject to the issuer's absolute discretion and certain payment conditions (including regulatory requirements). Distributions on ANZ CNs are franked in line with the franking applied to ANZ ordinary shares.\n\nWhere specified, the AT1 capital instruments provide the issuer with an early redemption or conversion option on a specified date and in certain other circumstances (such as a tax or regulatory event). This redemption option is subject to APRA's prior written approval.\n\nEach of the AT1 capital instruments will immediately convert into a variable number of ANZ ordinary shares (based on the average market price of the shares immediately prior to conversion less a 1% discount, subject to a maximum conversion number of ANZ ordinary shares) if:\n\n- \uf0b7 The Group's or the Company's Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio is equal to or less than 5.125% - known as a Common Equity Capital Trigger Event; or\n- \uf0b7 APRA notifies the Company that, without the conversion or write-off of certain securities or a public sector injection of capital (or equivalent support), it considers that the Company would become non-viable - known as a Non-Viability Trigger Event.\n\nWhere specified, AT1 capital instruments mandatorily convert into a variable number of ANZ ordinary shares (based on the average market price of the shares immediately prior to conversion less a 1% discount):\n\n- \uf0b7 on a specified mandatory conversion date; or\n- \uf0b7 on an earlier date under certain circumstances as set out in the terms.\n\nHowever, the mandatory conversion is deferred for a specified period if certain conversion tests are not met.\n\nPreference shares issued externally by ANZ Bank New Zealand will constitute additional tier 1 capital for ANZ Bank New Zealand for the purposes of the RBNZ's capital requirements, however they will not constitute Additional Tier 1 capital for the Group as the terms of the preference shares do not satisfy APRA's capital requirements. The preference shares are included within non-controlling interests in Note 24 Shareholders' Equity.\n\nThe tables below show the key details of the Group's AT1 capital instruments on issue at 30 September in both the current and prior years:\n\n|                                                                 |                                                                 |                                                                 | Consolidated   | Consolidated   | The Company   | The Company   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                                                 |                                                                 |                                                                 | 2022  $m       | 2021  $m       | 2022  $m      | 2021  $m      |\n| Additional Tier 1 capital (perpetual subordinated securities) 1 | Additional Tier 1 capital (perpetual subordinated securities) 1 | Additional Tier 1 capital (perpetual subordinated securities) 1 |                |                |               |               |\n| ANZ Capital Notes (ANZ CN)                                      | ANZ Capital Notes (ANZ CN)                                      | ANZ Capital Notes (ANZ CN)                                      |                |                |               |               |\n| AUD                                                             | 1,610m                                                          | ANZ CN2 2                                                       | -              | 1,609          | -             | 1,609         |\n| AUD                                                             | 970m                                                            | ANZ CN3                                                         | 970            | 968            | 985           | 998           |\n| AUD                                                             | 1,622m                                                          | ANZ CN4                                                         | 1,619          | 1,617          | 1,619         | 1,617         |\n| AUD                                                             | 931m                                                            | ANZ CN5                                                         | 928            | 927            | 928           | 927           |\n| AUD                                                             | 1,500m                                                          | ANZ CN6                                                         | 1,487          | 1,486          | 1,487         | 1,486         |\n| AUD                                                             | 1,310m                                                          | ANZ CN7                                                         | 1,297          | -              | 1,297         | -             |\n| ANZ Capital Securities (ANZ CS)                                 | ANZ Capital Securities (ANZ CS)                                 | ANZ Capital Securities (ANZ CS)                                 |                |                |               |               |\n| USD                                                             | 1,000m                                                          | ANZ Capital Securities                                          | 1,404          | 1,422          | 1,447         | 1,554         |\n| ANZ NZ Capital Notes (ANZ NZ CN)                                | ANZ NZ Capital Notes (ANZ NZ CN)                                | ANZ NZ Capital Notes (ANZ NZ CN)                                |                |                |               |               |\n| NZD                                                             | 500m                                                            | ANZ NZ Capital Notes 3                                          | -              | 477            | -             | -             |\n| Total Additional Tier 1 capital 4                               | Total Additional Tier 1 capital 4                               | Total Additional Tier 1 capital 4                               | 7,705          | 8,506          | 7,763         | 8,191         |\n\n- 1.

Interest expense on debt issuances is recognised using the effective interest rate method. Where the Group enters into a fair value hedge accounting relationship, the fair value attributable to the hedge risk is reflected in adjustments to the carrying value of the debt.\n\nSubordinated debt with capital-based conversion features (i.e. Common Equity Capital Trigger Events or Non-Viability Trigger Events) are considered to contain embedded derivatives that we account for separately at fair value through profit or loss. The embedded derivatives arise because the amount of shares issued on conversion following any of those trigger events is subject to the maximum conversion number, however they have no significant value as of the reporting date given the remote nature of those trigger events.",

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\n## AN OVERVIEW OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK\n\nThis overview is provided to aid the users of the financial statements in understanding the context of the financial disclosures required under AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures. It should be read in conjunction with the Governance and Risk Management sections of this Annual Report.\n\nThe Board is responsible for establishing and overseeing the Group's Risk Management Framework (RMF). The Board has delegated authority to the Board Risk Committee (BRC) to develop and monitor compliance with the Group's risk management policies. The BRC reports regularly to the Board on its activities.\n\nThe Board approves the strategic objectives of the Group including:\n\n- \uf0b7 the Risk Appetite Statement (RAS), which sets out the Board's expectations regarding the degree of risk that ANZ is prepared to accept in pursuit of its strategic objectives and business plan; and\n- \uf0b7 the Risk Management Strategy (RMS), which describes ANZ's strategy for managing risks and the key elements of the RMF that give effect to this strategy. This includes a description of each material risk, and an overview of how the RMF addresses each risk, with reference to the relevant policies, standards and procedures. It also includes information on how ANZ identifies, measures, evaluates, monitors, reports and controls or mitigates material risks.\n\nThe Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and robust control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations. At ANZ, risk is everyone's responsibility.\n\nThe Group has an independent risk management function, headed by the Chief Risk Officer who:\n\n- \uf0b7 is responsible for overseeing the risk profile and the risk management framework;\n- \uf0b7 can effectively challenge activities and decisions that materially affect ANZ's risk profile; and\n- \uf0b7 has an independent reporting line to the BRC to enable the appropriate escalation of issues of concern.\n\nThe Internal Audit Function reports directly to the Board Audit Committee (BAC). Internal Audit provides:\n\n- \uf0b7 an independent evaluation of the Group's RMF annually that seeks to ensure compliance with, and the effectiveness of, the risk management framework;\n- \uf0b7 facilitation of a comprehensive review every three years that seeks to ensure the appropriateness, effectiveness and adequacy of the risk management framework; and\n- \uf0b7 recommendations to improve the framework and/or work practices to strengthen the effectiveness of day to day operations.",

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## CREDIT RISK\n\n## CREDIT RISK OVERVIEW, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nGranting credit facilities to customers is one of the Group's major sources of income. As this activity is also a principal risk, the Group dedicates considerable resources to its management. The Group assumes credit risk in a wide range of lending and other activities in diverse markets and in many jurisdictions. Credit risks arise from traditional lending to customers as well as from interbank, treasury, trade finance and capital markets activities around the world.\n\nOur credit risk management framework ensures we apply a consistent approach across the Group when we measure, monitor and manage the credit risk appetite set by the Board. The Board is assisted and advised by the BRC in discharging its duty to oversee credit risk. The BRC:\n\n- \uf0b7 sets the credit risk appetite and credit strategies; and\n- \uf0b7 approves credit transactions beyond the discretion of executive management.\n\nWe quantify credit risk through an internal credit rating system (masterscales) to ensure consistency across exposure types and to provide a consistent framework for reporting and analysis. The system uses models and other tools to measure the following for customer exposures:\n\n| Probability of Default (PD)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Expressed by a Customer Credit Rating (CCR), reflecting the Group's assessment of a customer's ability  to service and repay debt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Exposure at Default (EAD)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | The expected balance sheet exposure at default taking into account repayments of principal and  interest, expected additional drawdowns and accrued interest at the time of default.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Loss Given Default (LGD)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Expressed by a Security Indicator (SI) ranging from A to G.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## CREDIT RISK (continued)\n\n## MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK\n\nFor financial assets recognised on the balance sheet, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount. In certain circumstances there may be differences between the carrying amounts reported on the balance sheet and the amounts reported in the tables below. Principally, these differences arise in respect of financial assets that are subject to risks other than credit risk, such as equity instruments which are primarily subject to market risk, or bank notes and coins.\n\nFor undrawn facilities, this maximum exposure to credit risk is the full amount of the committed facilities. For contingent exposures, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the maximum amount the Group would have to pay if the instrument is called upon.\n\nThe table below shows our maximum exposure to credit risk of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet positions before taking account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements.\n\nMaximum exposure\n\n|                                     | Reported   | Reported   | Excluded 1   | Excluded 1   | to credit risk   | to credit risk   |\n|-------------------------------------|------------|------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Consolidated                        | 2022  $m   | 2021  $m   | 2022  $m     | 2021  $m     | 2022  $m         | 2021  $m         |\n| On-balance sheet positions          |            |            |              |              |                  |                  |\n| Net loans and advances              | 672,407    | 629,719    | -            | -            | 672,407          | 629,719          |\n| Other financial assets:             |            |            |              |              |                  |                  |\n| Cash and cash equivalents           | 168,132    | 151,260    | 1,147        | 1,127        | 166,985          | 150,133          |\n| Settlement balances owed to ANZ     | 4,762      | 7,530      | 4,762        | 7,530        | -                | -                |\n| Collateral paid                     | 12,700     | 9,166      | -            | -            | 12,700           | 9,166            |\n| Trading assets                      | 35,237     | 44,688     | 3,860        | 4,996        | 31,377           | 39,692           |\n| Derivative financial instruments    | 90,174     | 38,736     | -            | -            | 90,174           | 38,736           |\n| Investment securities               |            |            |              |              |                  |                  |\n| - debt securities at amortised cost | 7,943      | 7,031      | -            | -            | 7,943            | 7,031            |\n| - debt securities at FVOCI          | 76,817     | 74,743     | -            | -            | 76,817           | 74,743           |\n| - equity securities at FVOCI        | 1,353      | 1,310      | 1,353        | 1,310        | -                | -                |\n| - debt securities at FVTPL          | 40         | 42         | -            | -            | 40               | 42               |\n| Regulatory deposits                 | 632        | 671        | -            | -            | 632              | 671              |\n| Other financial assets 2            | 2,943      | 2,054      | -            | -            | 2,943            | 2,054            |\n| Total other financial assets        | 400,733    | 337,231    | 11,122       | 14,963       | 389,611          | 322,268          |\n| Subtotal                            | 1,073,140  | 966,950    | 11,122       | 14,963       | 1,062,018        | 951,987          |\n| Off-balance sheet positions         |            |            |              |              |                  |                  |\n| Undrawn and contingent facilities 3 | 285,041    | 259,789    | -            | -            | 285,041          | 259,789          |\n| Total                               | 1,358,181  | 1,226,739  | 11,122       | 14,963       | 1,347,059        | 1,211,776        |\n\n- 1.

The Group monitors its credit portfolio to manage risk concentration and rebalance the portfolio. The Group also applies single customer counterparty limits to protect against unacceptably large exposures to one single customer.\n\nComposition of financial instruments that give rise to credit risk by industry group are presented below:\n\n|                                                   | Loans  and advances   | Loans  and advances   | Other financial  assets   | Other financial  assets   |

MANAGEMENT\n\nWe use collateral for on and off-balance sheet exposures to mitigate credit risk if a counterparty cannot meet its repayment obligations. Where there is sufficient collateral, an expected credit loss is not recognised. This is largely the case for certain lending products, such as margin loans and reverse repurchase agreements that are secured by the securities purchased using the lending. For some products, the collateral provided by customers is fundamental to the product's structuring, so it is not strictly the secondary source of repayment - for example, lending secured by trade receivables is typically repaid by the collection of those receivables. During the period there was no change in our collateral policies.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## MARKET RISK\n\n## MARKET RISK OVERVIEW, MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nMarket risk stems from the Group's trading and balance sheet management activities and the impact of changes and correlations between interest rates, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads and volatility in bond, commodity or equity prices.\n\nThe BRC delegates responsibility for day-to-day management of both market risks and compliance with market risk policies to the Credit & Market Risk Committee (CMRC) and the Group Asset & Liability Committee (GALCO).\n\nWithin overall strategies and policies established by the BRC, business units and risk management have joint responsibility for the control of market risk at the Group level. The Market Risk team (a specialist risk management unit independent of the business) allocates market risk limits at various levels and monitors and reports on them daily. This detailed framework allocates individual limits to manage and control exposures using risk factors and profit and loss limits.\n\nManagement, measurement and reporting of market risk is undertaken in two broad categories:\n\n## Traded Market Risk\n\n## Non-Traded Market Risk\n\nRisk of loss from changes in the value of financial instruments due to movements in price factors for both physical and derivative trading positions. Principal risk categories monitored are:\n\n- 1. Currency risk - potential loss arising from changes in foreign exchange rates or their implied volatilities.\n- 2. Interest rate risk - potential loss from changes in market interest rates or their implied volatilities.\n- 3. Credit spread risk - potential loss arising from a movement in margin or spread relative to a benchmark.\n- 4. Commodity risk - potential loss arising from changes in commodity prices or their implied volatilities.\n- 5. Equity risk - potential loss arising from changes in equity prices.\n\n## MEASUREMENT OF MARKET RISK\n\nWe primarily manage and control market risk using Value at Risk (VaR), sensitivity analysis and stress testing.\n\nVaR measures the Group's possible daily loss based on historical market movements.\n\nThe Group's VaR approach for both traded and non-traded risk is historical simulation. We use historical changes in market rates, prices and volatilities over:\n\n- \uf0b7 the previous 500 business days, to calculate standard VaR; and\n- \uf0b7 a 1-year stressed period, to calculate stressed VaR.\n\nWe calculate traded and non-traded VaR using one-day and ten-day holding periods. For stressed VaR, we use a ten-day period. Back testing is used to ensure our VaR models remain accurate.\n\nANZ measures VaR at a 99% confidence interval which means there is a 99% chance that a loss will not exceed the VaR for the relevant holding period.\n\nRisk of loss associated with the management of non-traded interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign exchange exposures. This includes interest rate risk in the banking book. This risk of loss arises from adverse changes in the overall and relative level of interest rates for different tenors, differences in the actual versus expected net interest margin, and the potential valuation risk associated with embedded options in financial instruments and bank products.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

The diversification benefit reflects risks that offset across categories. The high and low VaR figures reported for each factor did not necessarily occur on the same day as the high and low VaR reported for the Group as a whole. Consequently, a diversification benefit for high and low would not be meaningful and is therefore omitted from the table.",

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## MARKET RISK (continued)\n\nNon-traded market risk\n\n## Balance sheet risk management\n\nThe principal objectives of balance sheet risk management are to maintain acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk to mitigate the negative impact of movements in interest rates on the earnings and market value of the Group's banking book, while ensuring the Group maintains sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations as they fall due.\n\n## Interest rate risk management\n\nNon-traded interest rate risk relates to the potential adverse impact of changes in market interest rates on the Group's future Net interest income. This risk arises from two principal sources, namely mismatches between the repricing dates of interest bearing assets and liabilities; and the investment of capital and other non-interest bearing liabilities and assets. Interest rate risk is reported using VaR and scenario analysis (based on the impact of a 1% rate shock). The table below shows VaR figures for non-traded interest rate risk for the combined Group as well as Australia, New Zealand and Asia Pacific, Europe and Americas (APEA) geographies which are calculated separately.\n\n|                                         | 2022      | 2022               | 2022              | 2022                  | 2021      | 2021               | 2021              | 2021                  |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|\n| Consolidated                            | As at  $m | High for  year  $m | Low for  year  $m | Average  for year  $m | As at  $m | High for  year  $m | Low for  year  $m | Average  for year  $m |\n| Non-traded value at risk 99% confidence |           |                    |                   |                       |           |                    |                   |                       |\n| Australia                               | 78.5      | 93.4               | 63.0              | 76.1                  | 67.0      | 81.8               | 61.9              | 69.8                  |\n| New Zealand                             | 25.4      | 27.1               | 20.2              | 23.9                  | 21.6      | 32.8               | 21.6              | 26.7                  |\n| Asia Pacific, Europe & America          | 21.7      | 38.0               | 16.8              | 25.8                  | 31.5      | 34.9               | 29.0              | 32.0                  |\n| Diversification benefit 1               | (38.1)    | n/a                | n/a               | (33.7)                | (32.9)    | n/a                | n/a               | (53.7)                |\n| Total VaR                               | 87.5      | 104.9              | 66.8              | 92.1                  | 87.2      | 87.2               | 59.3              | 74.8                  |\n\n|                                         | 2022      | 2022               | 2022              | 2022                  | 2021      | 2021               | 2021              | 2021                  |\n|-----------------------------------------|-----------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|\n| The Company                             | As at  $m | High for  year  $m | Low for  year  $m | Average  for year  $m | As at  $m | High for  year  $m | Low for  year  $m | Average  for year  $m |\n| Non-traded value at risk 99% confidence |           |                    |                   |                       |           |                    |                   |                       |\n| Australia                               | 78.5      | 93.4               | 63.0              | 76.1                  | 67.0      | 81.8               | 61.9              | 69.8                  |\n| New Zealand                             | 0.0       | 0.1                | 0.0               | 0.0                   | 0.0       | 0.0                | 0.0               | 0.0                   |\n| Asia Pacific, Europe & America          | 22.1      | 37.7               | 16.7              | 25.6                  | 30.8      | 35.2               | 27.5              | 31.2                  |\n| Diversification benefit 1               | (17.1)    | n/a                | n/a               | (20.2)                | (31.9)    | n/a                | n/a               | (36.2)                |\n| Total VaR                               | 83.5      | 94.5               | 62.9              | 81.5                  | 65.9      | 69.9               | 55.0              | 64.8                  |\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## MARKET RISK (continued)\n\nWe undertake scenario analysis to stress test the impact of extreme events on the Group's market risk exposures. We model a 1% overnight parallel positive shift in the yield curve to determine the potential impact on our Net interest income over the next 12 months. This is a standard risk measure which assumes the parallel shift is reflected in all wholesale and customer rates.\n\nThe table below shows the outcome of this risk measure for the current and previous financial years, expressed as a percentage of reported Net interest income.\n\n|                                                             | Consolidated   | Consolidated   | The Company   | The Company   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                                             | 2022           | 2021           | 2022          | 2021          |\n| Impact of 1% rate shock on 12 months of net interest income |                |                |               |               |\n| As at period end                                            | 1.29%          | 2.43%          | 0.90%         | 2.02%         |\n| Maximum exposure                                            | 2.08%          | 2.43%          | 1.65%         | 2.02%         |\n| Minimum exposure                                            | 1.15%          | 0.98%          | 0.71%         | 0.54%         |\n| Average exposure (in absolute terms)                        | 1.56%          | 1.55%          | 1.11%         | 1.08%         |\n\n## EQUITY SECURITIES DESIGNATED AT FVOCI\n\nOur investment securities contain equity investment holdings which predominantly comprise Bank of Tianjin and equity holding in 1835i Ventures Trust business unit. The market risk impact on these equity investments is not captured by the Group's VaR processes for traded and non-traded market risks. Therefore, the Group regularly reviews the valuations of the investments within the portfolio and assesses whether the investments are appropriately measured based on the recognition and measurement policies set out in Note 12 Investment Securities.\n\n## FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK - STRUCTURAL EXPOSURES\n\nOur investment of capital in foreign operations - for example, branches, subsidiaries or associates with functional currencies other than the Australian Dollar - exposes the Group to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates. Variations in the value of these foreign operations arising as a result of exchange differences are reflected in the foreign currency translation reserve in equity.\n\nWhere it is considered appropriate, the Group takes out economic hedges against larger foreign exchange denominated revenue streams (primarily New Zealand Dollar, US Dollar and US Dollar correlated). The primary objective of hedging is to ensure that, if practical, the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on the consolidated capital ratios are minimised.",

The Group's liquidity and funding risks are governed by a set of principles approved by the BRC and include:\n\n- \uf0b7 maintaining the ability to meet all payment obligations in the immediate term;\n- \uf0b7 ensuring that the Group has the ability to meet 'survival horizons' under a range of ANZ specific, and general market, liquidity stress scenarios, at the site and Group-wide level, to meet cash flow obligations over the short to medium term;\n- \uf0b7 maintaining strength in the Group's balance sheet structure to ensure long term resilience in the liquidity and funding risk profile;\n- \uf0b7 ensuring the liquidity management framework is compatible with local regulatory requirements;\n- \uf0b7 preparing daily liquidity reports and scenario analysis to quantify the Group's positions;\n- \uf0b7 targeting a diversified funding base to avoid undue concentrations by investor type, maturity, market source and currency;\n- \uf0b7 holding a portfolio of high quality liquid assets to protect against adverse funding conditions and to support day-to-day operations; and\n- \uf0b7 establishing detailed contingency plans to cover different liquidity crisis events.\n\n## KEY AREAS OF MEASUREMENT FOR LIQUIDITY RISK\n\n## Scenario modelling of funding sources\n\nANZ's liquidity risk appetite is defined by a range of regulatory and internal liquidity metrics mandated by the Board. The metrics cover a range of scenarios of varying duration and level of severity.\n\nA key component of this framework is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), which is a severe short term liquidity stress scenario mandated by banking regulators including APRA. As part of meeting LCR requirements, the Group has a Committed Liquidity Facility (CLF) with the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). The CLF was established to offset the shortage of available High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) in Australia and provides an alternative form of contingent liquidity. The CLF is collateralised by assets, including internal residential mortgage backed securities, that are eligible to be pledged as security with the RBA. In September 2021, APRA wrote to ADI's to advise that APRA and the RBA consider there to be sufficient HQLA for ADI's to meet their LCR requirements, and therefore the use of the CLF should no longer be required beyond 2022 calendar year.\n\nConsistent with APRA's requirement to reduce the $10.7 billion CLF with four equal reductions during the 2022 calendar year to $0 on 1 January 2023, ANZ's CLF was $2.7 billion as at 30 September 2022 (2021: $10.7 billion).\n\n## Liquid assets\n\nThe Group holds a portfolio of high quality (unencumbered) liquid assets to protect the Group's liquidity position in a severely stressed environment and to meet regulatory requirements. HQLA comprise three categories consistent with Basel III LCR requirements:\n\n- \uf0b7 HQLA1- Cash and highest credit quality government, central bank or public sector securities eligible for repurchase with central banks to provide same-day liquidity.\n- \uf0b7 HQLA2 - High credit quality government, central bank or public sector securities, high quality corporate debt securities and high quality covered bonds eligible for repurchase with central banks to provide same-day liquidity.\n- \uf0b7 Alternative liquid assets (ALA) - Assets qualifying as collateral for the CLF and eligible securities that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) will accept in its domestic market operations.\n\n## LIQUIDITY RISK OUTCOMES 1\n\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio - ANZ's Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) averaged 131% for 2022, a decrease from the 2021 average of 137%, and above the regulatory minimum of 100%.\n\nNet Stable Funding Ratio - ANZ's Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) as at 30 September 2022 was 119% (2021: 124%), above the regulatory minimum of 100%.\n\n- 1.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## LIQUIDITY AND FUNDING RISK (continued)\n\n## Liquidity crisis contingency planning\n\nThe Group maintains APRA-endorsed liquidity crisis contingency plans for analysing and responding to a liquidity threatening event at a country and Group-wide level. Key liquidity contingency crisis planning requirements and guidelines include:\n\n| Ongoing business management                    | Early signs/ mild stress                                     | Severe stress                                                    |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| \uf0b7 establish crisis/severity levels             | \uf0b7 monitoring and review                                      | \uf0b7 activate contingency funding plans                             |\n| \uf0b7 liquidity limits  \uf0b7 early warning indicators | \uf0b7 management actions not requiring  business rationalisation | \uf0b7 management actions for altering asset and liability  behaviour |\n\nAssigned responsibility for internal and external communications and the appropriate timing to communicate\n\nSince the precise nature of any stress event cannot be known in advance, we design the plans to be flexible to the nature and severity of the stress event with multiple variables able to be accommodated in any plan.\n\n## Group funding\n\nThe Group monitors the composition and stability of its funding so that it remains within the Group's funding risk appetite. This approach ensures that an appropriate proportion of the Group's assets are funded by stable funding sources, including customer deposits; longer-dated wholesale funding (with a remaining term exceeding one year); and equity.\n\n| Funding plans prepared                                                        | Considerations in preparing funding plans                                                                                                                                                     |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| \uf0b7 3 year strategic plan prepared annually                                     | \uf0b7 customer balance sheet growth                                                                                                                                                               |\n| \uf0b7 annual funding plan as part of the Group's planning  process                | \uf0b7 changes in wholesale funding including: targeted funding volumes; markets;  investors; tenors; and currencies for senior, secured, subordinated, hybrid  transactions and market conditions |\n| \uf0b7 forecasting in light of actual results as a calibration to the  annual plan | \uf0b7 changes in wholesale funding including: targeted funding volumes; markets;  investors; tenors; and currencies for senior, secured, subordinated, hybrid  transactions and market conditions |\n\n## RBA Term Funding Facility\n\nAs an additional source of funding, in March 2020, the RBA announced a Term Funding Facility (TFF) for the banking system to support lending to Australian businesses. The TFF is a three-year secured funding facility to ADIs at a fixed rate of 0.25% for drawdowns up to 4 November 2020, and reduced to 0.10% for new drawdowns from 4 November 2020 onwards. The TFF was closed to drawdowns on 30 June 2021.\n\nAs at 30 September 2022, ANZ had drawn $20.1 billion under the RBA's TFF.\n\n## RBNZ Funding for Lending Programme and Term Lending Facility\n\nBetween May 2020 and July 2021, the RBNZ made funds available under a Term Lending Facility (TLF) to promote lending to businesses. The TLF is a five-year secured funding facility for New Zealand banks at a fixed rate of 0.25%.\n\nIn November 2020 the RBNZ announced a Funding for Lending Programme (FLP) which aimed to lower the cost of borrowing for New Zealand businesses and households. The FLP is a three-year secured funding facility for New Zealand banks at a floating rate of the New Zealand Official Cash Rate (OCR). New Zealand banks were able to obtain initial funding of up to 4% of their lending to New Zealand resident households, non-financial businesses and non-profit institutions serving households as at 31 October 2020 (eligible loans). The initial allocation closed on 6 June 2022. An additional allocation of up to 2% of eligible loans is available, subject to certain conditions until 6 December 2022.\n\nAs at 30 September 2022, ANZ Bank New Zealand had drawn $0.3 billion under the TLF and $2.3 billion under the FLP.",

All outstanding debt issuance and subordinated debt is profiled on the earliest date on which the Group may be required to pay. All at-call liabilities are reported in the 'Less than 3 months' category unless there is a longer minimum notice period. The amounts represent principal and interest cash flows - so they may differ from equivalent amounts reported on balance sheet.\n\nIt should be noted that this is not how the Group manages its liquidity risk.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES (continued)\n\n## FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE\n\nThe fair valuation of financial assets and financial liabilities is generally determined at the individual instrument level.\n\nIf the Group holds offsetting risk positions, then we use the portfolio exception in AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement (AASB 13) to measure the fair value of such groups of financial assets and financial liabilities. We measure the portfolio based on the price that would be received to sell a net long position (an asset) for a particular risk exposure, or to transfer a net short position (a liability) for a particular risk exposure.\n\n## Fair value designation\n\nWe designate certain loans and advances and certain deposits and other borrowings and debt issuances as fair value through profit or loss:\n\n- \uf0b7 where they contain a separable embedded derivative which significantly modifies the instruments' cash flow ensuring we recognise the fair value movements on the assets or liabilities in profit or loss in the same period as the movement on the associated hedging instruments; or\n- \uf0b7 in order to eliminate an accounting mismatch which would arise if the asset or liabilities were otherwise carried at amortised cost. This mismatch arises due to measuring the derivative financial instruments (which we use to mitigate interest rate risk of these assets or liabilities) at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nOur approach ensures that we recognise the fair value movements on the assets or liabilities in profit or loss in the same period as the movement on the associated derivatives.\n\nWe may also designate certain loans and advances, certain deposits and other borrowings and debt issuances as fair value through profit or loss where they are managed on a fair value basis to align the measurement with how the instruments are managed.\n\n## FAIR VALUE APPROACH AND VALUATION TECHNIQUES\n\nWe use valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities for recognition, measurement and disclosure purposes where no quoted price in an active market exists for that asset or liability.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES (continued)\n\n## FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY\n\nThe Group categorises assets and liabilities carried at fair value into a fair value hierarchy in accordance with AASB 13 based on the observability of inputs used to measure the fair value:\n\n- \uf0b7 Level 1 - valuations based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\n- \uf0b7 Level 2 - valuations using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for a similar asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and\n- \uf0b7 Level 3 - valuations where significant unobservable inputs are used to measure the fair value of the asset or liability.\n\nThe following table presents assets and liabilities carried at fair value in accordance with the fair value hierarchy:\n\n|                                           | Fair value measurements                     | Fair value measurements                     | Fair value measurements            | Fair value measurements            | Fair value measurements              | Fair value measurements              | Fair value measurements   | Fair value measurements   |\n|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n|                                           | Quoted price in  active markets   (Level 1) | Quoted price in  active markets   (Level 1) | Using observable  inputs (Level 2) | Using observable  inputs (Level 2) | Using unobservable  inputs (Level 3) | Using unobservable  inputs (Level 3) | Total                     | Total                     |\n|                                           | 2022                                        | 2021                                        | 2022                               | 2021                               | 2022                                 | 2021                                 | 2022                      | 2021                      |\n| Consolidated                              | $m                                          | $m                                          | $m                                 | $m                                 | $m                                   | $m                                   | $m                        | $m                        |\n| Assets                                    |                                             |                                             |                                    |                                    |                                      |                                      |                           |                           |\n| Trading assets 1                          | 28,455                                      | 36,025                                      | 6,782                              | 8,663                              | -

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES (continued)\n\n## FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT INCORPORATING UNOBSERVABLE MARKET DATA\n\n## Level 3 fair value measurements\n\nLevel 3 financial instruments are a net asset of $1,802 million (2021: $1,467 million) for the Group and $1,429 million (2021: $1,160 million) for the Company.\n\nThe assets and liabilities which incorporate significant unobservable inputs are:\n\n- \uf0b7 equity securities for which there is no active market or traded prices cannot be observed;\n- \uf0b7 loans and advances measured at fair value for which there is no observable market data; and\n- \uf0b7 derivatives referencing market rates that cannot be observed primarily due to lack of market activity.\n\n## Level 3 Transfers\n\nDuring the year, the Group and the Company transferred $312 million of Loan and advances measured at fair value from Level 2 to Level 3, as a result of valuation parameters becoming unobservable during the year. There were no other transfers into or out of Level 3 in the current or prior year.\n\nThe material Level 3 financial instruments as at 30 September 2022 are listed as below:\n\n## i) Investment Securities - equity holdings classified as FVOCI\n\n## Bank of Tianjin (BoT)\n\nThe Group holds an investment in the Bank of Tianjin. The investment is valued based on comparative price-to-book (P/B) multiples (a P/B multiple is the ratio of the market value of equity to the book value of equity). The extent of judgement applied in determining the appropriate multiple and comparator group from which the multiple is derived resulted in the Level 3 classification. As at September 2022, the BoT equity holding balance was $854 million (2021: $991 million). A decrease in the BoT fair valuation in the financial year was mainly due to a decrease in the P/B multiple used in the valuation.\n\n## 1835i Ventures Trust\n\nThe Group holds $324 million (2021: $241 million) of unlisted equities in its 1835i Ventures Trust business unit classified as FVOCI, for which there are no active markets or traded price observed resulting in Level 3 classification. The increase in the 1835i equity holding balance in the financial year were mainly due to new equity investments as well as revaluation increases.\n\n## Institutional division - Equity Holdings\n\nThe Group holds $137 million (2021: $4 million) of unlisted equities in the Institutional division classified as FVOCI, for which there are no active markets or traded prices available, resulting in Level 3 classification. The increase in the Institutional division equity holdings balance was mainly due to new equity purchases during the financial year.\n\n## ii) Net loans and advances - classified as FVTPL\n\n## Syndication Loans\n\nThe Group holds $403 million (2021: $110 million) of syndication loans for sale which are measured at FVTPL. These loans are classified as Level 3 when there is no observable market data available for the valuation. During the financial year the Group transferred $312 million of syndication loans measured at fair value from Level 2 to Level 3, due to valuation parameters for these financial instruments becoming unobservable.\n\n## Sensitivity to Level 3 data inputs\n\nWhen we make assumptions due to significant inputs to a valuation not being directly observable (Level 3 inputs), then changing these assumptions changes the Group's estimate of the instrument's fair value. Favourable and unfavourable changes are determined by changing the primary unobservable parameters used to derive the fair valuation.\n\n## Investment Securities - equity holdings\n\nThe valuation of the equity investments are sensitive to variations in select unobservable inputs, with valuation techniques used including P/B multiples and discounted cashflow techniques. If for example, a 10% increase or decrease to the primary input into the valuations were to occur (such as the P/B multiple), it would result in a $135 million increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio, which would be recognised in shareholders' equity in the Group ($102m for the Company), with no impact to net profit or loss.\n\n## Net Loans and Advances\n\nSyndicated loan valuations are sensitive to credit spreads and discount curves in determining their fair valuation. However as these are primarily investment-grade loans, an increase or decrease in credit spreads and / or interest yield would have an immaterial impact on net profit or net assets of the Group.\n\n## Other\n\nThe remaining Level 3 balance is immaterial and changes in inputs have a minimal impact on net profit and net assets of the Group.\n\n## Deferred fair value gains and losses\n\nWhere fair values are determined using unobservable inputs significant to the fair value of a financial instrument, the Group does not immediately recognise the difference between the transaction price and the amount we determine based on the valuation technique (day one gain or loss) in profit or loss. After initial recognition, we recognise the deferred amount in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the life of the transaction or until all inputs become observable. Day one gains and losses which have been deferred are not material.",

While this is the value at which we expect the assets will be realised and the liabilities settled, the Group provides an estimate of the fair value of the financial assets and financial liabilities at balance date in the tables below.\n\n|                               |         |         | Categorised into fair value hierarchy   | Categorised into fair value hierarchy   | Categorised into fair value hierarchy   | Categorised into fair value hierarchy   | Categorised into fair value hierarchy              | Categorised into fair value hierarchy              |                  |                  |\n|-------------------------------|---------|---------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                               |         |         | Quoted price  active markets  (Level 1) | Quoted price  active markets  (Level 1) | Using observable  inputs (Level 2)      | Using observable  inputs (Level 2)      | With significant non- observable inputs  (Level 3) | With significant non- observable inputs  (Level 3) | Total fair value | Total fair value |\n|                               | 2022    | 2021    | 2022                                    | 2021                                    | 2022                                    | 2021                                    | 2022                                               | 2021                                               | 2022             | 2021             |\n| Consolidated                  | $m      | $m      | $m                                      | $m                                      | $m                                      | $m                                      | $m                                                 | $m                                                 | $m               | $m               |\n| Financial assets              |         |         |                                         |                                         |                                         |                                         |                                                    |                                                    |                  |                  |\n| Investment securities         | 7,943   | 7,031   | -

The Group therefore regularly evaluates the key valuation assumptions used in the determination of the fair valuation of financial instruments incorporated within the financial statements, as this can involve a high degree of judgement and estimation in determining the carrying values at the balance sheet date.\n\nIn determining the fair valuation of financial instruments, the Group has considered the impact of related economic and market conditions on fair value measurement assumptions and the appropriateness of valuation inputs in these estimates, notably valuation adjustments, as well as the impact of these matters on the classification of financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nMost of the valuation models the Group uses employ only observable market data as inputs. For certain financial instruments, we may use data that is not readily observable in current markets. If we use unobservable market data, then we need to exercise more judgement to determine fair value depending on the significance of the unobservable input to the overall valuation. Generally, we derive unobservable inputs from other relevant market data and compare them to observed transaction prices where available. When establishing the fair value of a financial instrument using a valuation technique, the Group also considers any required valuation adjustments in determining the fair value. We may apply adjustments (such as credit valuation adjustments and funding valuation adjustments - refer to Note 11 Derivative Financial Instruments) to reflect the Group's assessment of factors that market participants would consider in determining fair value of a particular financial instrument.",

Goodwill excludes notional goodwill in equity accounted investments.\n- 2. 2022 goodwill addition relates to acquisition of Cashrewards.\n- 3. 2021 goodwill impairment expense relates to the write-off on reclassification of ANZ Share Investing business to held for sale with a remaining $13 million derecognised on sale of the business. This impairment was recognised in Other income to align with the classification on completion of the disposal in 2021.\n- 4. 2022 goodwill written-off on disposal/exit relates to the exit of the financial planning and advice business.\n- 5. Includes impact of foreign currency translation differences.\n\n## IMPAIRMENT TESTING FOR CASH GENERATING UNITS CONTAINING GOODWILL\n\nGoodwill acquired in a business combination is tested for impairment annually and whenever there are indicators of potential impairment. Goodwill is allocated at the date of acquisition to the cash generating unit (CGU) or group of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the related business combination.\n\nGoodwill is considered to be impaired if the carrying amount of the relevant CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. We estimate the recoverable amount of each CGU to which goodwill is allocated using a fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCOD) approach, with a value-in-use (VIU) assessment performed where the FVLCOD is less than the carrying amount.\n\nDuring the year ended 30 September 2022, the Group restructured its business to establish separate Australia Retail and Australia Commercial divisions. For the purpose of goodwill impairment testing, these changes led to the creation of new CGUs which reflect the new divisional structure. Goodwill is allocated to the following CGUs based on the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored.\n\n| Cash generating units:   | 2022  $m   | 2021  $m   |\n|--------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Australia Retail         | 178        | 100        |\n| Australia Commercial     | -          | 40         |\n| New Zealand              | 1,706      | 1,849      |\n| Institutional            | 1,022      | 1,100      |",

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (continued)\n\nWe estimate the FVLCOD of each CGU to which goodwill is allocated by applying observable price earnings multiples of comparable companies to the estimated future maintainable earnings of each CGU. A deduction is then made for estimated costs of disposal. The valuation is considered to be level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to unobservable inputs used in the valuation.\n\nManagement's approach and the key assumptions used in determining FVLCOD are as follows:\n\n| Key assumption                | Approach to determining the value (or values) for each key assumption                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Future maintainable earnings  | Future maintainable earnings for each CGU is estimated as the sum of:  \uf0b7 The Group's 2023 financial plan for each CGU; and  \uf0b7 An allocation of the central costs recorded outside of the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated.  Where relevant, adjustments are made to the Group's financial plan to reflect the long-term expectations for  items such as expected credit losses and investment spend.                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Price/Earnings (P/E) multiple | P/E multiples applicable to each CGU have been derived from a comparator group of publicly traded  companies, and include a 30% control premium, discussed below.  In the case of the New Zealand and Institutional CGUs, management has made downwards adjustments to  P/E multiples to address specific factors relevant to those CGUs.  A control premium has been applied which recognises the increased consideration a potential acquirer  would be willing to pay in order to gain sufficient ownership to achieve control over the relevant activities of |\n| Costs of disposal             | Costs of disposal have been estimated as 2% of the fair value of the CGU based on those observed from  historical and recent transactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n\nAs noted above, our impairment testing did not result in any material impairment of goodwill being identified as at 30 September 2022.\n\nThe FVLCOD estimates for each CGU are sensitive to assumptions about P/E multiples, future maintainable earnings and control premium (30%). However, each CGU would continue to show a surplus in recoverable amount over carrying amount even where other reasonably possible alternative estimates were used.",

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (continued)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nManagement judgement is used to assess the recoverable value of goodwill and other intangible assets, and the useful economic life of an asset, or whether an asset has an indefinite life. We reassess the recoverability of the carrying value at each reporting date.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nA number of key judgements are required in the determination of whether or not a goodwill balance is impaired including:\n\n- \uf0b7 the level at which goodwill is allocated - consistent with prior periods the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated are the Group's revenue generating segments that benefit from relevant historical business combinations generating goodwill.\n- \uf0b7 determination of the carrying amount of each CGU which includes an allocation, on a reasonable and consistent basis, of corporate assets and liabilities that are not directly attributable to the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated.\n- \uf0b7 assessment of the recoverable amount of each CGU including:\n- o selection of the model used to determine the fair value - the Group has used the market multiple approach to estimate the fair value; and\n- o selection of the key assumptions in respect of future maintainable earnings, the P/E multiple applied, including selection of an appropriate comparator group and determination of an appropriate control premium, and costs of disposal as described above.\n\n## Software and other intangible assets\n\nAt each reporting date, software and other intangible assets are assessed for indicators of impairment and, where such indicators are identified, an impairment assessment is performed. In the event that an asset's carrying amount is determined to be greater than its recoverable amount, the carrying amount of the asset is written down immediately. Those assets not yet ready for use are tested for impairment annually.\n\nIn addition, the expected useful lives of intangible assets are assessed at each reporting date. The assessment requires management judgement, and in relation to our software assets, a number of factors can influence the expected useful lives. These factors include changes to business strategy, significant divestments and the pace of technological change.",

OTHER PROVISIONS (continued)\n\n## Customer remediation\n\nCustomer remediation includes provisions for expected refunds to customers, remediation project costs and related customer and regulatory claims, penalties and litigation costs and outcomes.\n\n## Restructuring costs\n\nProvisions for restructuring costs arise from activities related to material changes in the scope of business undertaken by the Group or the manner in which that business is undertaken and include employee termination benefits. Costs relating to on-going activities are not provided for and are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Non-lending losses, frauds and forgeries\n\nNon-lending losses include losses arising from certain legal actions not directly related to amounts of principal outstanding for loans and advances and losses arising from forgeries, frauds and the correction of operational issues. The amounts recognised are the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties that surround the events and circumstances that affect the provision.\n\n## Other\n\nOther provisions comprise various other provisions including workers compensation, make-good provisions associated with leased premises, warranties and indemnities provided in connection with various disposals of businesses and assets, and contingent liabilities recognised as part of a business combination.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\nThe Group recognises provisions when there is a present obligation arising from a past event, an outflow of economic resources is probable, and the amount of the provision can be measured reliably.\n\nThe amount recognised is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the timing and amount of the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the estimated cash flows required to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nThe Group holds provisions for various obligations including customer remediation, restructuring costs, non-lending losses, fraud and forgeries and litigation related claims. These provisions involve judgements regarding the timing and outcome of future events, including estimates of expenditure required to satisfy such obligations. Where relevant, expert legal advice has been obtained and, in light of such advice, provisions and/or disclosures as deemed appropriate have been made.\n\nIn relation to customer remediation, determining the amount of the provisions, which represent management's best estimate of the cost of settling the identified matters, requires the exercise of significant judgement. It will often be necessary to form a view on a number of different assumptions, including, the number of impacted customers, the average refund per customer, the associated remediation project costs, and the implications of regulatory exposures and customer claims having regard to their specific facts and circumstances. There is a heightened level of estimation uncertainty where the customer remediation provision relates to a legal proceeding or matter. The appropriateness of the underlying assumptions is reviewed on a regular basis against actual experience and other relevant evidence including expert legal advice, and adjustments are made to the provisions where appropriate.",

ANZ Bank New Zealand must not resolve to pay any dividend or make any other distribution on its ordinary shares until the next PPS dividend payment date if a PPS is not paid.\n\nShould ANZ Bank New Zealand elect to pay a PPS dividend, the PPS dividend is 6.95% per annum up until 18 July 2028 and thereafter a floating rate equal to the aggregate of the New Zealand 3 month bank bill rate plus 3.25%, multiplied by one minus the New Zealand company tax rate (where the PPS dividend is fully imputed), with PPS dividend payments due on 18 January, 18 April, 18 July and 18 October each year.\n\n## Redemption features\n\nHolders of PPS have no right to require that the PPS be redeemed. ANZ Bank New Zealand may at its option redeem all of the PPS on an optional redemption date (each PPS dividend date from 18 July 2028), or at any time following the occurrence of a tax event or regulatory event , subject to prior written approval of RBNZ and meeting of other conditions.",

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\n\n## CAPITAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY\n\nANZ's capital management strategy aims to protect the interests of depositors, creditors and shareholders. We achieve this through an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) whereby ANZ conducts detailed strategic and capital planning over a 3 year time horizon. The process involves:\n\n- \uf0b7 forecasting economic variables, financial performance of ANZ's divisions and the financial impact of new strategic initiatives to be implemented during the planning period;\n- \uf0b7 performing stress tests under different economic scenarios to determine the level of additional capital (stress capital buffer) needed to absorb losses that may be experienced under an economic downturn;\n- \uf0b7 reviewing capital ratios and targets across various classes of capital against ANZ's risk profile; and\n- \uf0b7 developing a capital plan, taking into account capital ratio targets, current and future capital issuances requirements and options around capital products, timing and markets to execute the capital plan under differing market and economic conditions.\n\nThe capital plan is approved by the Board and updated as required. The Board and senior management are provided with regular updates of ANZ's capital position. Any material actions required to ensure ongoing prudent capital management are submitted to the Board for approval. Throughout the year, the Group maintained compliance with all the regulatory requirements related to Capital Adequacy in the jurisdictions in which it operates.\n\n## REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\n\n## Australia\n\nAs ANZ is an Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) in Australia, it is primarily regulated by APRA under the Banking Act 1959 (Cth). ANZ must comply with the minimum regulatory capital requirements, prudential capital ratios and specific reporting levels that APRA sets and which are consistent with the global Basel III capital framework. This is the common framework for determining the appropriate level of bank regulatory capital as set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). APRA requirements are summarised below:\n\nRegulatory Capital Definition\n\n| Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital                                                                                                                   | Tier 1 Capital                                                                                                            | Tier 2 Capital                                                                      | Total Capital                            |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Shareholders' equity adjusted for  specific items.                                                                                                    | CET1 Capital plus certain  securities with complying loss  absorbing characteristics known  as Additional Tier 1 Capital. | Subordinated debt instruments  which have a minimum term of 5  years at issue date. | Tier 1 plus Tier 2 Capital.              |\n| Minimum Prudential Capital Ratios (PCRs)                                                                                                              | Minimum Prudential Capital Ratios (PCRs)                                                                                  | Minimum Prudential Capital Ratios (PCRs)                                            | Minimum Prudential Capital Ratios (PCRs) |\n| CET1 Ratio                                                                                                                                            | Tier 1 Ratio                                                                                                              | Total Capital Ratio                                                                 |                                          |\n| CET1 Capital divided by total risk  weighted assets must be at least 4.5%.                                                                            | Tier 1 Capital divided by total risk  weighted assets must be at least  6.0%.                                             | Total Capital divided by total risk weighted  assets must be at least 8.0%.         |                                          |\n| Reporting Levels                                                                                                                                      | Reporting Levels                                                                                                          | Reporting Levels                                                                    | Reporting Levels                         |\n| Level 1                                                                                                                                               | Level 2                                                                                                                   | Level 3                                                                             |                                          |\n| The ADI on a stand-alone basis (that is  the Company and specified subsidiaries  which are consolidated to form the  ADI's Extended Licensed Entity). | The consolidated Group less  certain subsidiaries and associates  that are excluded under  prudential standards.          | A conglomerate Group at the widest level.                                           |                                          |\n\nAPRA also requires the ADI to hold additional CET1 buffers as follows:\n\n- \uf0b7 a capital conservation buffer (CCB) of 3.5% which is inclusive of the additional 1% surcharge for domestically systemically important banks (D-SIBs). APRA has determined that ANZ is a D-SIB.\n- \uf0b7 a countercyclical capital buffer which is set on a jurisdictional basis. The requirement is currently set to zero for Australia.\n\nANZ reports to APRA on a Level 1 and Level 2 basis, and measures capital adequacy monthly on a Level 1 and Level 2 basis, and is not yet required to maintain capital on a Level 3 basis (APRA have yet to conclude required timing for Level 3 reporting).",

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## Life Insurance and Funds Management\n\nAs required by APRA's Prudential Standards, insurance and funds management activities are:\n\n- \uf0b7 de-consolidated for the purposes of calculating capital adequacy; and\n- \uf0b7 excluded from the risk-based capital adequacy framework.\n\nWe deduct the investment in these controlled entities 100% from CET1 capital, and if we include any profits from these activities in the Group's results, then we exclude them from the determination of CET1 capital to the extent they have not been remitted to the Company.\n\n## Outside Australia\n\nIn addition to APRA, the Company's branch operations and major banking subsidiary operations are also overseen by local regulators such as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the US Federal Reserve, the UK Prudential Regulation Authority, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission. They may impose minimum capital levels on operations in their individual jurisdictions.\n\n## CAPITAL ADEQUACY 1\n\nThe following table provides details of the Group's capital adequacy ratios at 30 September:\n\n|                                                    | Consolidated   | Consolidated   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|\n|                                                    | 2022  $m       | 2021  $m       |\n| Qualifying capital                                 |                |                |\n| Tier 1                                             |                |                |\n| Shareholders' equity and non-controlling interests | 66,401         | 63,676         |\n| Prudential adjustments to shareholders' equity     | (175)          | 3              |\n| Gross Common Equity Tier 1 capital                 | 66,226         | 63,679         |\n| Deductions                                         | (10,354)       | (12,320)       |\n| Common Equity Tier 1 capital                       | 55,872         | 51,359         |\n| Additional Tier 1 capital 2                        | 7,686          | 8,114          |\n| Tier 1 capital                                     | 63,558         | 59,473         |\n| Tier 2 capital 3                                   | 19,277         | 17,125         |\n| Total qualifying capital                           | 82,835         | 76,598         |\n| Capital adequacy ratios (Level 2)                  |                |                |\n| Common Equity Tier 1                               | 12.3%          | 12.3%          |\n| Tier 1                                             | 14.0%          | 14.3%          |\n| Tier 2                                             | 4.2%           | 4.1%           |\n| Total capital ratio                                | 18.2%          | 18.4%          |\n| Risk weighted assets                               | 454,718        | 416,086        |\n\n- 2.

The Group manages such restrictions within our risk management framework, as outlined in Note 18 Financial Risk Management and our capital management strategy, as outlined in Note 25 Capital Management.\n\nAs at 30 September 2022, there were no significant restrictions on the ability of an entity within the Group to transfer assets, pay dividends or make other capital distributions to other entities in the Group.",

CONTROLLED ENTITIES (continued)\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\nThe Group's subsidiaries are those entities it controls through:\n\n- \uf0b7 being exposed to, or having rights to, variable returns from the entity; and\n- \uf0b7 being able to affect those returns through its power over the entity.\n\nThe Group assesses whether it has power over those entities by examining the Group's existing rights to direct the relevant activities of the entity.\n\nIf the Group sells or acquires subsidiaries during the year, it includes their operating results in the Group results to the date of disposal or from the date of acquisition. When the Group's control ceases, it derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any related noncontrolling interest and other components of equity.\n\nIf the Group's ownership interest in a subsidiary changes in a way that does not result in a loss of control, then the Group accounts for that as a transaction with equity holders in their capacity as equity holders.\n\nAll transactions between Group entities are eliminated on consolidation.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES (continued)\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\nAn associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence over its operating and financial policies but does not control. The Group accounts for associates using the equity method. Its investments in associates are carried at cost plus the post-acquisition share of changes in the associate's net assets less accumulated impairments. Dividends the Group receives from associates are recognised as a reduction in the carrying amount of the investment. The Group includes goodwill recognised by the associate in the carrying amount of the investment. It does not individually test the goodwill incorporated in the associates carrying amount for impairment.\n\nAt least at each reporting date, the Group reviews investments in associates for any indication of impairment. If an indication of impairment exists, then the Group determines the recoverable amount of the associate using the higher of:\n\n- \uf0b7 the associate's fair value less cost of disposal; and\n- \uf0b7 its value-in-use.\n\nWe use a discounted cash flow methodology, and when applicable, other methodologies (such as capitalisation of earnings methodology), to determine the recoverable amount.\n\n## KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are assessed at each reporting date and tested for impairment when there is an indication that the investment may be impaired. In addition, the Group is required to assess at each reporting date whether the recoverable amount of the Group's investment has increased to such a level as to support the reversal of prior period impairments.\n\nDuring the year ended 30 September 2022, the fair value less costs of disposal of the Group's investment in PT Bank Pan Indonesia (PT Panin) as determined by reference to the quoted share price increased significantly and as at 30 September 2022 was greater than its carrying value. The increase in fair value is a significant reversal of the position at 30 September 2021 when the fair value less cost of disposal determined by reference to share price was lower than the carrying value of the investment.\n\nIn considering whether a full or partial reversal of previous periods' impairments of PT Panin is appropriate, the Group has assessed particular features of the PT Panin stock. Given the recent rapid increase and ongoing elevated volatility in the share price, the Group has determined that none of the prior period impairment will be reversed.\n\nIf management had assessed these factors differently, then the amount of impairment reversed could be anywhere between nil and $220 million.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

STRUCTURED ENTITIES\n\nA Structured Entity (SE) is an entity that has been designed such that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in determining who controls the entity. SEs are generally established with restrictions on their ongoing activities in order to achieve narrow and well defined objectives.\n\nSEs are classified as subsidiaries and consolidated when control exists. If the Group does not control a SE, then it is not consolidated. This note provides information on both consolidated and unconsolidated SEs.\n\nThe Group's involvement with SEs is as follows:\n\n| Type                             | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Securitisation                   | The Group establishes SEs to securitise customer loans and advances that it has originated, in order to diversify  sources of funding for liquidity management.

STRUCTURED ENTITIES (continued)\n\n## UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES\n\n## GROUP'S INTEREST IN UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES\n\nAn 'interest' in an unconsolidated SE is any form of contractual or non-contractual involvement with a SE that exposes the Group to variability of returns from the performance of that SE. These interests include, but are not limited to: holdings of debt or equity securities; derivatives that pass-on risks specific to the performance of the SE; lending; loan commitments; financial guarantees; and fees from funds management activities.\n\nFor the purpose of disclosing interests in unconsolidated SEs:\n\n- \uf0b7 no disclosure is made if the Group's involvement is not more than a passive interest - for example: when the Group's involvement constitutes a typical customer-supplier relationship. On this basis, exposures to unconsolidated SEs that arise from lending, trading and investing activities are not considered disclosable interests - unless the design of the structured entity allows the Group to participate in decisions about the relevant activities (being those that significantly affect the entity's returns).\n- \uf0b7 'interests' do not include derivatives intended to expose the Group to market-risk (rather than performance risk specific to the SE) or derivatives through which the Group creates, rather than absorbs, variability of the unconsolidated SE (such as purchase of credit protection under a credit default swap).\n\nThe table below sets out the Group's interests in unconsolidated SEs together with the maximum exposure to loss that could arise from those interests:\n\n|                                  | Securitisation   | Securitisation   | Structured finance   | Structured finance   | Total    | Total    |\n|----------------------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------|----------|\n|                                  | 2022  $m         | 2021  $m         | 2022  $m             | 2021  $m             | 2022  $m | 2021  $m |\n| On-balance sheet interests       |                  |                  |                      |                      |          |          |\n| Investment securities            | 3,352            | 2,624            | -                    | -                    | 3,352    | 2,624    |\n| Gross loans and advances         | 9,433            | 7,697            | 43                   | 53                   | 9,476    | 7,750    |\n| Total on-balance sheet           | 12,785           | 10,321           | 43                   | 53                   | 12,828   | 10,374   |\n| Off-balance sheet interests      |                  |                  |                      |                      |          |          |\n| Commitments (facilities undrawn) | 2,078            | 2,034            | -                    | -                    | 2,078    | 2,034    |\n| Guarantees                       | 50               | 50               | -                    | -                    | 50       | 50       |\n| Total off-balance sheet          | 2,128            | 2,084            | -                    | -                    | 2,128    | 2,084    |\n| Maximum exposure to loss         | 14,913           | 12,405           | 43                   | 53                   | 14,956   | 12,458   |\n\nIn addition to the interests above, the Group earned funds management fees from unconsolidated investment funds of $181 million (2021: $192 million) during the year.\n\nThe Group's maximum exposure to loss represents the maximum amount of loss that the Group could incur as a result of its involvement with unconsolidated SEs if loss events were to take place - regardless of the probability of occurrence. This does not in any way represent the actual losses expected to be incurred. Furthermore, the maximum exposure to loss is stated gross of the effects of hedging and collateral arrangements entered into to mitigate ANZ's exposure to loss.\n\nThe maximum exposure to loss has been determined as:\n\n- \uf0b7 the carrying amount of Investment securities measured at amortised cost; and\n- \uf0b7 the carrying amount plus the undrawn amount of any committed loans and advances.\n\nThe size of unconsolidated SEs is indicated by total assets which vary by SE with the largest single SE having a value of approximately $5.2 billion.\n\nThe Group did not provide any non-contractual support to unconsolidated SEs during the year (2021: nil) nor does it have any current intention to provide financial or other support to unconsolidated SEs.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

STRUCTURED ENTITIES (continued)\n\n## SPONSORED UNCONSOLIDATED STRUCTURED ENTITIES\n\nThe Group may also sponsor unconsolidated SEs in which it has no disclosable interest.\n\nFor the purposes of this disclosure, the Group considers itself the 'sponsor' of an unconsolidated SE if it is the primary party involved in the design and establishment of that SE and:\n\n- \uf0b7 the Group is the major user of that SE; or\n- \uf0b7 the Group's name appears in the name of that SE, or on its products; or\n- \uf0b7 the Group provides implicit or explicit guarantees of that SE's performance.\n\nThe Group has sponsored the ANZ PIE Fund in New Zealand, which invests only in deposits with ANZ Bank New Zealand. The Group does not provide any implicit or explicit guarantees of the capital value or performance of investments in the ANZ PIE Fund. There was no income received from, nor assets transferred to, this entity during the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## KEY JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES\n\nSignificant judgement is required in assessing whether the Group has control over Structured Entities. Judgement is required to determine the existence of:\n\n- \uf0b7 power over the relevant activities (being those that significantly affect the entity's returns); and\n- \uf0b7 exposure to variable returns of the entity.\n\n## 29. TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS\n\nIn the normal course of business the Group enters into transactions where it transfers financial assets directly to third parties or to SEs. These transfers may give rise to the Group fully, or partially, derecognising those financial assets - depending on the Group's exposure to the risks and rewards or control over the transferred assets. If the Group retains substantially all of the risk and rewards of a transferred asset, the transfer does not qualify for derecognition and the asset remains on the Group's balance sheet in its entirety.\n\n## SECURITISATIONS\n\nNet loans and advances include residential mortgages securitised under the Group's securitisation programs which are assigned to bankruptcy remote SEs to provide security for obligations payable on the notes issued by the SEs. The holders of the issued notes have full recourse to the pool of residential mortgages which have been securitised and the Group cannot otherwise pledge or dispose of the transferred assets.\n\nIn some instances, the Group is also the holder of the securitised notes issued by the SEs. In addition, the Group is entitled to any residual income of the SEs and sometimes enters into derivatives with the SEs. The Group retains the risks and rewards of the residential mortgages and continues to recognise the mortgages as financial assets.\n\nThe Group is exposed to variable returns from its involvement with these securitisation SEs and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the SEs activities. The SEs are therefore consolidated by the Group.",

        "page_content": "## 29. TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS (continued)\n\n## COVERED BONDS\n\nThe Group operates various global covered bond programs to raise funding in its primary markets. Net loans and advances include residential mortgages assigned to bankruptcy remote SEs associated with these covered bond programs. The mortgages provide security for the obligations payable on the issued covered bonds.\n\nThe covered bond holders have dual recourse to the issuer and the cover pool of assets. The issuer cannot otherwise pledge or dispose of the transferred assets, however, subject to legal arrangements it may repurchase and substitute assets as long as the required cover is maintained.\n\nThe Company is required to maintain the cover pool at a level sufficient to cover the bond obligations. In addition, the Company is entitled to any residual income of the covered bond SEs and enters into derivatives with the SEs. The Company retains the majority of the risks and rewards of the residential mortgages and continues to recognise the mortgages as financial assets. The obligation to pay this amount to the SEs is recognised as a financial liability of the Company.\n\nThe Group is exposed to variable returns from its involvement with the covered bond SEs and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the SEs activities. The SEs are therefore consolidated by the Group. The covered bonds issued externally are included within debt issuances.\n\n## REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS\n\nWhen the Group sells securities subject to repurchase agreements under which we retain substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, then those assets do not qualify for derecognition. An associated liability is recognised for the consideration received from the counterparty.\n\n## STRUCTURED FINANCE ARRANGEMENTS\n\nThe Group arranges funding for certain customer transactions through structured leasing. These transactions are recognised on Group's balance sheet as lease receivables or loans. At times, other financial institutions participate in the funding of these arrangements. This participation involves a proportionate transfer of the rights to the assets recognised by the Group. The participating banks have limited recourse to the leased assets and related proceeds. Where the Group continues to be exposed to some of the risks of the transferred assets through a derivative or other continuing involvement, the Group does not derecognise the lease receivable or loan. Instead, the Group recognises an associated liability representing its obligations to the participating financial institutions.\n\nThe tables below set out the balance of assets transferred that do not qualify for derecognition, along with the associated liabilities.\n\n|                                               | Securitisations 1,2   | Securitisations 1,2   | Covered bonds   | Covered bonds   | Repurchase  agreements   | Repurchase  agreements   | Structured finance  arrangements   | Structured finance  arrangements   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                                               | 2022                  | 2021                  | 2022            | 2021            | 2022                     | 2021                     | 2022                               | 2021                               |\n| Consolidated                                  | $m                    | $m                    | $m              | $m              | $m                       | $m                       | $m                                 | $m                                 |\n| Current carrying amount of assets transferred | 1,121                 | 1,430                 | 27,575          | 28,816          | 52,757                   | 51,208                   | 36                                 | 55                                 |\n| Carrying amount of associated liabilities     | 1,115                 | 1,424                 | 12,967          | 15,399          | 47,229                   | 46,147                   | 36                                 | 55                                 |\n\n|                                               | Securitisations 1,2   | Securitisations 1,2   | Covered bonds   | Covered bonds   | Repurchase  agreements   | Repurchase  agreements   | Structured finance  arrangements   | Structured finance  arrangements   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                                               | 2022                  | 2021                  | 2022            | 2021            | 2022                     | 2021                     | 2022                               | 2021                               |\n| The Company                                   | $m                    | $m                    | $m              | $m              | $m                       | $m                       | $m                                 | $m                                 |\n| Current carrying amount of assets transferred | 1,121                 | 1,430                 | 17,953          | 17,925          | 47,846                   | 48,663                   | -                                  | -                                  |\n| Carrying amount of associated liabilities     | 1,121                 | 1,430                 | 17,953          | 17,925          | 42,940                   | 43,925                   | -                                  | -                                  |\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

In 2022, the Group made defined benefit contributions totalling $2 million (2021: $3 million). It expects to make contributions of approximately $2 million next financial year.\n\n## GOVERNANCE OF THE SCHEMES AND FUNDING OF THE DEFINED BENEFIT SECTIONS\n\nThe main defined benefit superannuation schemes in which the Group participates operate under trust law and are managed and administered on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the relevant trust deed and rules and all relevant legislation. These schemes have corporate trustees, which are wholly owned subsidiaries of the Group. The trustees are the legal owners of the assets, which are held separately from the assets of the Group, and are responsible for setting investment policy and agreeing funding requirements with the employer through the triennial actuarial valuation process.\n\nThe Group has defined benefit arrangements in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Philippines, Taiwan and United Kingdom. The defined benefit section of the ANZ Australian Staff Superannuation Scheme, the ANZ UK Staff Pension Scheme and the ANZ National Retirement Scheme in New Zealand are the three largest plans. They have been closed to new members since 1987, 2004 and 1991 respectively. None of the schemes had a material deficit, or surplus, at the last funding valuation. The Group has no present liability under any of the schemes' trust deeds to fund a deficit (measured on a funding basis). A contingent liability of the Group may arise if any of the schemes were wound up.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT\n\n## Defined benefit superannuation schemes\n\nThe Group operates a small number of defined benefit schemes. Independent actuaries calculate the liability and expenses related to providing benefits to employees under each defined benefit scheme. They use the Projected Unit Credit Method to value the liabilities. The balance sheet includes:\n\n- \uf0b7 a defined benefit liability if the obligation is greater than the fair value of the schemes assets; and\n- \uf0b7 an asset (capped to its recoverable amount) if the fair value of the assets is greater than the obligation.\n\nIn each reporting period, the movements in the net defined benefit liability are recognised as follows:\n\n- \uf0b7 the net movement relating to the current period's service cost, net interest on the defined benefit liability, past service costs and other costs (such as the effects of any curtailments and settlements) as operating expenses;\n- \uf0b7 remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (which comprise actuarial gains and losses and return on scheme assets, excluding interest income included in net interest) directly in retained earnings through other comprehensive income; and\n- \uf0b7 contributions of the Group directly against the net defined benefit position.\n\n## Defined contribution superannuation schemes\n\nThe Group operates a number of defined contribution schemes. It also contributes (according to local law, in the various countries in which it operates) to Government and other plans that have the characteristics of defined contribution plans. The Group's contributions to these schemes are recognised as personnel expenses when they are incurred.",

EMPLOYEE SHARE AND OPTION PLANS (continued)\n\n## Fair Value Assumptions\n\nWhen determining the fair value, we apply the standard market techniques for valuation, including Monte Carlo and/or Black Scholes pricing models. We do so in accordance with the requirements of AASB 2 Share-based Payments. The models take into account early exercise of vested equity, nontransferability and internal/external performance hurdles (if any).\n\nThe table below shows the significant assumptions we used as inputs into our fair value calculation of instruments granted during the period. We present the values as weighted averages, but the specific values we use for each allocation are the ones we use for the fair value calculation.\n\n|                                              | 2022                      | 2022                | 2021                      | 2021                 |\n|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|\n|                                              | Deferred   share   rights | Performance  rights | Deferred   share   rights | Performance   rights |\n| Exercise price ($)                           | 0.00                      | 0.00                | 0.00                      | 0.00                 |\n| Share closing price at grant date ($)        | 26.62                     | 26.92               | 23.37                     | 23.32                |\n| Expected volatility of ANZ share price (%) 1 | 20.0                      | 20.0                | 26.5                      | 25.0                 |\n| Equity term (years)                          | 2.2                       | 6.0                 | 2.3                       | 6.0                  |\n| Vesting period (years)                       | 2.1                       | 4.0                 | 2.0                       | 4.0                  |\n| Expected life (years)                        | 2.1                       | 4.0                 | 2.0                       | 4.0                  |\n| Expected dividend yield (%)                  | 5.50                      | 5.50                | 4.85                      | 5.25                 |\n| Risk free interest rate (%)                  | 0.80                      | 1.25                | 0.10                      | 0.21                 |\n| Fair value ($)                               | 23.71                     | 10.38               | 21.15                     | 9.56                 |\n\n## SATISFYING EQUITY AWARDS\n\nAll shares underpinning equity awards may be purchased on market, reallocated or be newly issued shares, or a combination.\n\nThe equity we purchased on market during the 2022 financial year (either under the ANZ Employee Share Acquisition Plan and the ANZ Share Option Plan, or to satisfy options or rights) for all employees amounted to 4,230,962 shares at an average price of $27.57 per share (2021: 3,593,574 shares at an average price of $22.03 per share).\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS\n\n## CREDIT RELATED COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n\n|                                   | Consolidated   | Consolidated   | The Company   | The Company   |\n|-----------------------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                   | 2022  $m       | 2021  $m       | 2022  $m      | 2021  $m      |\n| Contract amount of:               |                |                |               |               |\n| Undrawn facilities                | 236,051        | 212,265        | 201,204       | 176,077       |\n| Guarantees and letters of credit  | 23,729         | 30,027         | 21,557        | 27,957        |\n| Performance related contingencies | 26,036         | 18,303         | 24,634        | 17,085        |\n| Total                             | 285,816        | 260,595        | 247,395       | 221,119       |\n\n## UNDRAWN FACILITIES\n\nThe majority of undrawn facilities are subject to customers maintaining specific credit and other requirements or conditions. Many of these facilities are expected to be only partially used, and others may never be used at all. As such, the total of the nominal principal amounts is not necessarily representative of future liquidity risks or future cash requirements. Based on the earliest date on which the Group or the Company may be required to pay, the full amount of undrawn facilities for the Group and the Company mature within 12 months.\n\n## GUARANTEES, LETTERS OF CREDIT AND PERFORMANCE RELATED CONTINGENCIES\n\nGuarantees, letters of credit and performance related contingencies relate to transactions that the Group has entered into as principal - including guarantees, standby letters of credit and documentary letters of credit.\n\nDocumentary letters of credit involve the Group issuing letters of credit guaranteeing payment in favour of an exporter. They are secured against an underlying shipment of goods or backed by a confirmatory letter of credit from another bank.\n\nPerformance related contingencies are liabilities that oblige the Group to make payments to a third party if the customer fails to fulfil its non-monetary obligations under the contract.\n\nTo reflect the risk associated with these transactions, we apply the same credit origination, portfolio management and collateral requirements that we apply to loans. The contract amount represents the maximum potential amount that we could lose if the counterparty fails to meet its financial obligations. As the facilities may expire without being drawn upon, the notional amounts do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements. Based on the earliest date on which the Group or the Company may be required to pay, the full amount of guarantees and letters of credit and performance related contingencies for the Group and the Company mature within 12 months.\n\n## OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\n\nAs at 30 September 2022, the Group had contingent liabilities in respect of the matters outlined below. Where relevant, expert legal advice has been obtained and, in the light of such advice, provisions (refer to Note 23 Other Provisions) and/or disclosures as deemed appropriate have been made. In some instances we have not disclosed the estimated financial impact of the individual items either because it is not practicable to do so or because such disclosure may prejudice the interests of the Group.\n\n## REGULATORY AND CUSTOMER EXPOSURES\n\nThe Group regularly engages with its regulators in relation to regulatory investigations, surveillance and reviews, reportable situations, civil enforcement actions (whether by court action or otherwise), formal and informal inquiries and regulatory supervisory activities in Australia and globally. The Group has received various notices and requests for information from its regulators as part of both industry-wide and Group-specific reviews and has also made disclosures to its regulators at its own instigation. The nature of these interactions can be wide ranging and, for example, include or have included in recent years a range of matters including responsible lending practices, regulated lending requirements, product suitability and distribution, interest and fees and the entitlement to charge them, customer remediation, wealth advice, insurance distribution, pricing, competition, conduct in financial markets and financial transactions, capital market transactions, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing obligations, privacy obligations and information security, business continuity management, reporting and disclosure obligations and product disclosure documentation. There may be exposures to customers which are additional to any regulatory exposures. These could include class actions, individual claims or customer remediation or compensation activities. The outcomes and total costs associated with such reviews and possible exposures remain uncertain.",

COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS (continued)\n\n## OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (continued)\n\n## BENCHMARK/RATE ACTIONS\n\nIn July and August 2016, class action complaints were brought in the United States District Court against local and international banks, including the Company. The class actions are expressed to apply to persons and entities that engaged in US-based transactions in financial instruments that were priced, benchmarked, and/or settled based on certain benchmark rates. The claimants sought damages or compensation in amounts not specified, and alleged that the defendant banks, including the Company, violated US anti-trust laws, antiracketeering laws, and (in one case only), the Commodity Exchange Act and unjust enrichment principles. As at 30 September 2022, ANZ has reached agreements to settle each of these matters. The financial impact is not material. The settlements are without admission of liability and remain subject to finalisation and court approval.\n\nIn February 2017, the South African Competition Commission commenced proceedings against local and international banks including the Company alleging breaches of the cartel provisions of the South African Competition Act in respect of trading in the South African rand. The potential civil penalty or other financial impact is uncertain.\n\n## CAPITAL RAISING ACTION\n\nIn September 2018, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) commenced civil penalty proceedings against the Company alleging failure to comply with continuous disclosure obligations in connection with the Company's August 2015 underwritten institutional equity placement. ASIC alleges the Company should have advised the market that the joint lead managers took up approximately 25.5 million ordinary shares of the placement. The Company is defending the allegations.\n\n## CONSUMER CREDIT INSURANCE LITIGATION\n\nIn February 2020, a class action was brought against the Company alleging breaches of financial advice obligations, misleading or deceptive conduct and unconscionable conduct in relation to the distribution of consumer credit insurance products. The issuers of the insurance products, QBE and OnePath Life, are also defendants to the claim. The Company is defending the allegations.\n\n## ESANDA DEALER CAR LOAN LITIGATION\n\nIn August 2020, a class action was brought against the Company alleging unfair conduct, misleading or deceptive conduct and equitable mistake in relation to the use of flex commissions in dealer arranged Esanda car loans. The Company is defending the allegations.\n\n## ONEPATH SUPERANNUATION LITIGATION\n\nIn December 2020, a class action was brought against OnePath Custodians, OnePath Life and the Company alleging that OnePath Custodians breached its obligations under superannuation legislation, and its duties as trustee, in respect of superannuation investments and fees. The claim also alleges that the Company was involved in some of OnePath Custodians' investment breaches. The Company is defending the allegations.\n\n## NEW ZEALAND LOAN INFORMATION LITIGATION\n\nIn September 2021, a representative proceeding was brought against ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited, alleging breaches of disclosure requirements under consumer credit legislation in respect of variation letters sent to certain loan customers. ANZ Bank New Zealand Limited is defending the allegations.\n\n## CREDIT CARDS LITIGATION\n\nIn November 2021, a class action was brought against the Company alleging that certain interest terms in credit card contracts were unfair contract terms and that it was unconscionable for the Company to rely on them. The Company is defending the allegations.\n\n## UNLICENSED THIRD PARTIES ACTION\n\nIn November 2021, ASIC commenced civil penalty proceedings against the Company alleging that three unlicensed third parties provided home loan application documents to the Company's lenders, including in connection with the Company's home loan introducer program. ASIC alleges that the Company contravened its obligations under credit legislation.\n\n## AVAILABLE FUNDS ACTION\n\nIn May 2022, ASIC commenced civil penalty proceedings against the Company in relation to fees charged to customers in some circumstances for credit card cash advance transactions made using recently deposited unprocessed funds. ASIC alleges that the Company made false or misleading representations, engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct and breached certain statutory obligations as a credit licensee. The Company is defending the allegations.",

COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS (continued)\n\n## OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (continued)\n\n## ROYAL COMMISSION\n\nThe Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry released its final report on 4 February 2019. Following the Royal Commission there have been, and continue to be, additional costs and further exposures, including exposures associated with further regulator activity or potential customer exposures such as class actions, individual claims or customer remediation or compensation activities. The outcomes and total costs associated with these possible exposures remain uncertain.\n\n## SECURITY RECOVERY ACTIONS\n\nVarious claims have been made or are anticipated, arising from security recovery actions taken to resolve impaired assets. These claims will be defended.\n\n## WARRANTIES, INDEMNITIES AND PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT FEES\n\nThe Group has provided warranties, indemnities and other commitments in favour of the purchaser and other persons in connection with various disposals of businesses and assets and other transactions, covering a range of matters and risks. It is exposed to claims under those warranties, indemnities and commitments, some of which are currently active. The outcomes and total costs associated with these exposures remain uncertain.\n\nThe Group has entered an arrangement to pay performance management fees to external fund managers in the event predetermined performance criteria are satisfied in relation to certain Group investments. The satisfaction of the performance criteria and associated performance management fee remains uncertain.\n\n## CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT OBLIGATIONS\n\nCertain group companies have a commitment to comply with rules governing various clearing and settlement arrangements which could result in a credit risk exposure and loss if another member institution fails to settle its payment clearing activities. The Group's potential exposure arising from these arrangements is unquantifiable in advance.\n\nCertain group companies hold memberships of central clearing houses, including ASX Clear (Futures), London Clearing House (LCH) SwapClear and RepoClear, Korea Exchange (KRX), Hong Kong Exchange (HKEX), Clearing Corporation of India and the Shanghai Clearing House. These memberships allow the relevant group company to centrally clear derivative instruments in line with cross-border regulatory requirements. Common to all of these memberships is the requirement for the relevant group company to make default fund contributions. In the event of a default by another member, the relevant group company could potentially be required to commit additional default fund contributions which are unquantifiable in advance.\n\n## PARENT ENTITY GUARANTEES\n\nThe Company has issued letters of comfort and guarantees in respect of certain subsidiaries in the normal course of business. Under these letters and guarantees, the Company undertakes to ensure that those subsidiaries continue to meet their financial obligations, subject to certain conditions including that the entity remains a controlled entity of the Company.\n\n## SALE OF GRINDLAYS BUSINESS\n\nOn 31 July 2000, the Company completed the sale to Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) of ANZ Grindlays Bank Limited (Grindlays) and certain other businesses. The Company provided warranties and indemnities relating to those businesses.\n\nThe indemnified matters include civil penalty proceedings and criminal prosecutions brought by Indian authorities against Grindlays and certain of its officers, in relation to certain transactions conducted in 1991 that are alleged to have breached the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973. Civil penalties were imposed in 2007 which are the subject of appeals. The criminal prosecutions are being defended.\n\n## CONTINGENT ASSETS\n\n## NATIONAL HOUSING BANK\n\nThe Company is pursuing recovery of the proceeds of certain disputed cheques which were credited to the account of a former Grindlays customer in the early 1990s.\n\nThe disputed cheques were drawn on the National Housing Bank (NHB) in India. Proceedings between Grindlays and NHB concerning the proceeds of the cheques were resolved in early 2002.\n\nRecovery is now being pursued from the estate of the Grindlays customer who received the cheque proceeds. Any amounts recovered are to be shared between the Company and NHB.",

The Policy allows certain non-audit services to be provided where the service would not contravene auditor independence requirements. KPMG Australia or any of its related practices may not provide services that are perceived to be in conflict with the role of the external auditor or breach auditor independence. These include consulting advice and subcontracting of operational activities normally undertaken by management, and engagements where the external auditor may ultimately be required to express an opinion on its own work.",

PENDING ORGANISATIONAL CHANGES IMPACTING FUTURE REPORTING PERIODS\n\n## Non-Operating Holding Company\n\nOn 4 May 2022, the Group announced its intention to lodge a formal application with APRA, the Federal Treasurer and other applicable regulators to establish a non-operating holding company and create distinct bank and non-bank groups within the organisation to assist ANZ to better deliver its strategy to strengthen and grow its core business further.\n\nShould the proposed restructure proceed, ANZ will establish a non-operating holding company, ANZ Group Holdings Limited, as the new listed parent holding company of the ANZ Group by a scheme of arrangement and to separate ANZ's banking and certain non-banking businesses into the ANZ Bank Group and ANZ Non-Bank Group. The 'ANZ Bank Group' would comprise the current Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited and the majority of its present-day subsidiaries. The 'ANZ Non-Bank Group' would house banking-adjacent businesses developed or acquired by the ANZ Group, as we continue to seek ways to bring the best new technology and banking-adjacent services to our customers.\n\nThe Explanatory Memorandum has been registered with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and ANZ shareholders will be asked to vote on the scheme on 15 December 2022. A copy of the Explanatory Memorandum will be made available on ANZ's website (www.anz.com/schememeeting).\n\n## Suncorp Bank Acquisition\n\nOn 18 July 2022, the Group announced an agreement to purchase 100% of the shares in SBGH Limited, the immediate non-operating holding company of Suncorp Bank. The acquisition is subject to a minimum completion period of 12 months and to certain conditions, being Federal Treasurer approval, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission authorisation or approval and certain amendments to the State Financial Institutions and Metway Merger Act 1996 (Qld). Unless the parties agree otherwise, the last date for satisfaction of these conditions is 24 months after signing (after which either party may terminate the agreement). The final purchase price is subject to completion adjustments and may be more or less than $4.9 billion. In addition, ANZ will also acquire Suncorp Bank's Additional Tier I capital notes at face value ($0.6 billion as at June 2022). Completion is expected in the second half of calendar year 2023.\n\n## 36.

        "page_content": "## KEY AUDIT MATTERS (continued)\n\n## ALLOWANCE FOR EXPECTED CREDIT LOSSES (Group $4,395m; Company $3,599m)\n\nRefer to the critical accounting estimates and judgements disclosures in relation to the allowance for expected credit losses in Note 14 to the Group and Company Financial Reports.\n\n## The Key Audit Matter\n\nAllowance for expected credit losses is a key audit matter due to the significance of the loans and advances balances to the financial statements and the inherent complexity of the Company and Group's Expected Credit Loss models (ECL models) used to measure ECL allowances. These models are reliant on data and a number of estimates including the impact of multiple economic scenarios and other assumptions such as defining a significant increase in credit risk (SICR).\n\nAASB 9 Financial Instruments requires the Company and Group to measure ECLs on a forward-looking basis reflecting a range of economic conditions. Post-model adjustments are made by the Company and Group to address known ECL model limitations or emerging trends in the loan portfolios. We exercise significant judgement in challenging the economic scenarios used and the judgmental post-model adjustments the Company and Group applies to the ECL results.\n\nAdditional subjectivity and judgement has been introduced into the Group and Company's measurement of ECL due to the heightened uncertainty associated with the impact of the economic outlook to the Group and Company's customers, increasing our audit effort thereon.\n\nThe Company and Group's criteria selected to identify a SICR, such as a decrease in customer credit rating (CCR), are key areas of judgement within the Company and Group's ECL methodology as these criteria determine if a forward-looking 12 month or lifetime allowance is recorded.\n\nAdditionally, allowances for individually assessed wholesale loans exceeding specific thresholds are assessed by the Company and Group. We exercise significant judgement in challenging the assessment of specific allowances based on the expected future cash repayments and estimated proceeds from the value of the collateral held by the Company and Group in respect of the loans.\n\n## How the matter was addressed in our audits\n\nOur audit procedures for the allowance for ECL included assessing the Company and Group's significant accounting policies against the requirements of the accounting standard. Additionally, our procedures included:\n\nTesting key controls of the Company and Group in relation to:\n\n- \uf0b7 The ECL model governance and validation processes which involved assessment of model performance;\n- \uf0b7 The assessment and approval of the forward-looking macroeconomic assumptions and scenario weightings through challenge applied by the Company and Group's internal governance processes;\n- \uf0b7 Reconciliation of the data used in the ECL calculation process to gross balances recorded within the general ledger as well as source systems;\n- \uf0b7 Customer credit rating (CCR) for wholesale loans (larger customer exposures are monitored individually). This covered elements such as: approval of new lending facilities against the Company and Group's lending policies, monitoring of counterparty credit quality against the Company and Group's exposure criteria for internal factors specific to the counterparty or external macroeconomic factors, and accuracy and timeliness of CCR and security indicator (SI) assessments against the requirements of the Company and Group's lending policies and regulatory requirements;\n- \uf0b7 IT system controls which record retail loans lending arrears, group exposures into delinquency buckets, and re-calculate individual allowances. We tested automated calculation and change management controls and evaluated the Company and Group's oversight of the portfolios, with a focus on controls over delinquency monitoring.\n\nWe tested relevant General Information Technology Controls (GITCs) in relation to the key IT applications used by the Company and Group in measuring ECL allowances as detailed in the IT Systems and Controls key audit matter below.\n\n## In addition to controls testing, our procedures included:\n\n- \uf0b7 Re-performing credit assessments of a sample of wholesale loans controlled by the Company and Group's specialist workout and recovery team assessed as higher risk or impaired, and a sample of other loans, focusing on larger exposures assessed by the Company and Group as showing signs of deterioration, or in areas of emerging risk. For each loan sampled, we challenged the Company and Group's assessment of CCR and SI using the customer's financial position, the valuation of security, and, where relevant, the risk of stranded assets, to inform our overall assessment of loan recoverability and the impact on the credit allowance. To do this, we used the information on the Company's and Group's loan file and discussed the facts and circumstances of the case with the loan officer. Exercising our judgement, our procedures included using our understanding of relevant industries and the macro-economic environment and comparing data and assumptions used by the Company and Group in recoverability assessments to externally sourced evidence, such as commodity prices, publicly available audited financial statements and comparable external valuations of collateral held. Where relevant we assessed the forecast timing of future cash flows in the context of underlying valuations and approved business plans and challenged key assumptions in the valuations;\n- \uf0b7 Obtaining an understanding of the Company and Group's processes to determine ECL allowances, evaluating the Company and Group's ECL model methodologies against established market practices and criteria in the accounting standards;\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

We compared the Company and Group's forecast GDP, unemployment rates, CPI and property price indices to relevant publicly available macro-economic information, and considered other known variables and information obtained through our other audit procedures to identify contradictory indicators;\n- \uf0b7 Testing the implementation of the Company and Group's SICR methodology by re-performing the staging calculation for a sample of loans taking into consideration movements in the CCR from loan origination and comparing our result to actual staging applied on an individual account level in the Company and Group's ECL model;\n- \uf0b7 Assessing the accuracy of the data used in the ECL models by checking a sample of data fields such as account balance and CCR to relevant source systems.\n\nWe challenged key assumptions in the components of the Company and Group's post-model adjustments to the ECL allowance balance. This included:\n\n- \uf0b7 Assessing post-model adjustments against the Company and Group's ECL model and data deficiencies identified by the Company and Group's ECL model validation processes, particularly in light of the significant volatility in economic scenarios;\n- \uf0b7 Comparing underlying data used in concentration risk and economic cycle allowances to underlying loan portfolio characteristics of recent loss experience, current market conditions and specific risks in the Company and Group's loan portfolios;\n- \uf0b7 Assessing certain post-model adjustments identified by the Group and Company against internal and external information;\n- \uf0b7 Assessing the completeness of post-model adjustments by checking the consistency of risks we identified in the loan portfolios against the Company and Group's assessment.\n\nAssessing the appropriateness of the Company and Group's disclosures in the financial reports using our understanding obtained from our testing and against the requirements of the accounting standards.\n\n## SUBJECTIVE AND COMPLEX VALUATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS HELD AT FAIR VALUE:\n\n## GROUP\n\n- - FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 3 ASSET POSITIONS $1,833m\n- - FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 2 ASSET POSITIONS $108,853m\n- - FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 3 LIABILITY POSITIONS $31m\n- - FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 2 LIABILITY POSITIONS $88,977m\n\n## COMPANY\n\n- - FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 3 ASSET POSITIONS $1,449m\n- - FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 2 ASSET POSITIONS $105,583m\n- - FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 3 LIABILITY POSITIONS $20m\n- - FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 2 LIABILITY POSITIONS $86,652m\n\nRefer to the critical accounting estimates, judgements and disclosures of fair values in Note 19 to the Group and Company Financial Reports.\n\n## The Key Audit Matter\n\nThe fair value of the Company and Group's Level 3 and 2 financial instruments is determined by the Company and Group's application of valuation techniques which often involve the exercise of judgement and the use of assumptions and estimates.\n\nIn assessing this Key Audit Matter, we involved our valuation specialists to supplement our senior team members who understand the Company and Group's methods, assumptions and data relevant to their valuation of Financial Instruments.\n\nThe Company and Group's valuation of Level 3 and Level 2 financial instruments held at fair value is a Key Audit Matter due to:\n\n- \uf0b7 The high degree of estimation uncertainty and potentially significant range of reasonable outcomes associated with the valuation of financial instruments classified as Level 3 where significant pricing inputs used in the valuation methodology and models are not observable.\n- \uf0b7 The complexity associated with the Company and Group's valuation methodology and models of certain more complex Level 2 financial instruments leading to an increase in subjectivity and estimation uncertainty.\n\nThese factors increased the level of judgement applied by us and our audit effort thereon.",

This involved sourcing independent inputs from comparable data in the market and available alternatives. We challenged the Company and Group where our revaluations significantly differed from the Company and Group's valuations.\n- \uf0b7 Assessing the appropriateness of the Company and Group's disclosures in the financial reports using our understanding obtained from our testing and against the requirements of the accounting standards.\n\n## CARRYING VALUE OF INVESTMENT IN PT BANK PAN INDONESIA (PT PANIN) (Group $1,318m)\n\nRefer to the critical accounting estimates, judgements and disclosures in Note 27 to the Group Financial Report.\n\n## The Key Audit Matter\n\nThe carrying value of the Group's investment in associate, PT Panin, is a key audit matter as:\n\n- \uf0b7 The investment is equity accounted as an associate and where indicators of impairment are identified the recoverable amount must be assessed. This involves judgement and consideration of valuation models given historical volatility in the market price of the shares and limited liquidity in the market for the shares. Impairment has been recognised in prior periods.\n- \uf0b7 The Group's impairment assessment identified that the Group's investment in associate, PT Panin, experienced a significant increase in the quoted share price during the period. At 30 September 2022, this indicated a value greater than its carrying value, indicating a possible reversal of previous impairment under accounting standard requirements.\n- \uf0b7 We critically evaluated the Group's conclusion not to reverse the impairment losses recorded against the investment in PT Panin in prior periods. This required analysis of the market and comparison against the Group's value in use modelled outcome and other fair value approaches.\n- \uf0b7 We focused on critically evaluating the Group's judgement in relation to key assumptions for assessing the recoverable amount, including:\n- \uf0b7 The nature of alternative valuation methodologies;\n- \uf0b7 Forecast earnings, forecast growth rates and terminal growth rates - the Group's model is highly sensitive to small changes in these assumptions;\n- \uf0b7 Discount rates - these are complicated in nature and vary according to the conditions and environment the associate investment operates in.\n- \uf0b7 We involved our valuation specialists to supplement our senior team members in assessing this key audit matter.\n\n## How the matter was addressed in our audit\n\nWorking with our valuation specialists, our procedures included:\n\n- \uf0b7 Considering the appropriateness of the recoverable amount assessment used by the Group to conclude the carrying value of the Group's investment in associate, PT Panin, is supportable;\n- \uf0b7 Understanding the features of the PT Panin stock and the drivers of the recent significant increase in fair value indicated by reference to the quoted share price. This included analysis of the volatility of movements, the nature and size of the Group's shareholdings and the volumes of trading of the limited free float of shares;\n- \uf0b7 Critically evaluating other fair valuation approaches and comparing this to the quoted share price value, and the Group's value in use outcome;\n- \uf0b7 Considering the appropriateness of the value in use valuation method applied by the Group against the requirements of the accounting standards. This included:\n- \uf0b7 Assessing the integrity of the model used, including the accuracy of the underlying calculation formulas;\n- \uf0b7 Assessing the Group's key assumptions used in the model, such as, discount rates, forecast earnings, forecast growth rates and terminal growth rate by comparing to external observable metrics, historical experience, our knowledge of the markets and current market practice;\n\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT (CONTINUED)\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS",

We did this by obtaining an understanding of the matter and its status and independently assessing this against the recognition requirements of the accounting standards;\n- \uf0b7 For a sample of individual customer remediation matters:\n- \uf0b7 Assessing and challenging the methods, data and assumptions used by the Company and Group to provide for customer remediation matters;\n- \uf0b7 Sample checking data accuracy to underlying systems;\n- \uf0b7 Performing model integrity checks;\n- \uf0b7 Testing the accuracy of historical remediation provisions by comparing to actual payments. We used this knowledge to challenge the Group's and Company's current estimates and to inform our further procedures.\n- \uf0b7 Testing completeness by evaluating where exposures may have arisen based upon our knowledge and experience of broader industry matters, the Company and Group's documentation and the current regulatory environment. We also checked the features of these exposures against the criteria defining a provision or a contingency in the accounting standards;",

The controls over access, changes to and operation of IT systems are key to the recording of financial information and the preparation of financial reports which provide a true and fair view of the Company and Group's financial positions and performance.\n\nThe IT systems and controls, as they impact the financial recording and reporting of the Company and Group's transactions, is a key audit matter as our audit approaches could significantly differ depending on the effective operation of the Company and Group's IT controls. We work with our IT specialists as a core part of our audit team.\n\n## How the matter was addressed in our audits\n\nOur testing focused on the technology control environments for key IT applications (systems) used in processing significant transactions and recording balances in the general ledgers, and the automated controls embedded within these systems which link the technology-enabled business processes. Working with our IT specialists, our audit procedures included:\n\n- \uf0b7 Assessing the governance and higher-level controls across the IT environments, including those regarding policy design, policy review and awareness, and IT Risk and cyber security management practices;\n- \uf0b7 Design and operating effectiveness testing of key controls across the user access management lifecycle, including how users are on-boarded, reviewed for access levels assigned, and removed on a timely basis from key IT applications and supporting infrastructure. We also examined the management of privileged roles and functions across relevant IT application and the supporting infrastructure;\n- \uf0b7 Design and operating effectiveness testing of key controls for IT change management including authorisation of changes prior to development, testing performed and approvals prior to migration into the production environment of key IT applications. We assessed user  access to release changes to IT application production environments across the Company and Group and whether access was commensurate with their job responsibilities;\n- \uf0b7 Design and operating effectiveness testing of key controls used by the Company and Group's technology teams to restrict access to and monitor system batch job schedules;\n- \uf0b7 Design and operating effectiveness testing of key automated business process controls including those relating to enforcing segregation of duties to avoid conflicts from inappropriate role combinations within IT applications. Our testing included:\n- \uf0b7 Configurations to perform calculations, mappings and flagging of financial transactions, and automated reconciliation controls (both between systems and intra-system); and\n- \uf0b7 Data integrity of key system reporting used by us in our audit to select samples and analyse data used by the Company and Group to generate financial reporting.\n\n## OTHER INFORMATION\n\nOther Information is financial and non-financial information in Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited's annual reporting which is provided in addition to the Financial Reports and the Auditor's Report.

The scope of work comprised limited assurance over the material text and data claims as specified in the table below:\n\n| ESG Information                            | Page   |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 2022 Performance Snapshot                  | 3      |\n| What matters most   to our stakeholders    | 10     |\n| Our approach to societal  challenges       | 14-15  |\n| Our approach to   climate change           | 16-17  |\n| Performance overview   (Five year summary) | 60     |\n\nThe ANZ 2022 Annual Report and ANZ 2022 Annual Review covers ANZ's global operations for the year ended 30 September 2022 unless otherwise indicated.\n\n## Criteria\n\nThe ESG Information has been extracted from and prepared by ANZ on a consistent basis with the information in the ANZ 2022 ESG Supplement and accompanying ANZ\n\n2022 ESG Supplement Data Pack, copies of which are available at anz.com/annualreport (the criteria). The ANZ 2022 ESG Supplement and ANZ 2022 ESG Supplement Data Pack has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards published by the Global Reporting Initiative, version dated 2016 and management's basis of reporting, a summary of which is included in the Explanatory Notes section in the ANZ 2022 ESG Supplement.\n\n## Basis of our Conclusion\n\nWe conducted our work in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements ISAE 3000 (Standard). In accordance with the Standard we have:\n\n- \u00b7 Used our professional judgement to plan and perform the engagement to obtain limited assurance that we are not aware of any material misstatements in the ESG Information, whether due to fraud or error;\n- \u00b7 Considered relevant internal controls when designing our assurance procedures, however we do not express a conclusion on their effectiveness; and\n- \u00b7 Ensured that the engagement team possess the appropriate knowledge, skills and professional competencies.\n\n## Summary of Procedures Performed\n\nOur limited assurance conclusion is based on the evidence obtained from performing the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 Interviews with relevant employees responsible for developing the content (text and data) within the ESG Information to understand the approach for monitoring, collation and reporting of such information and the accuracy, completeness and existence of reported text and data;\n- \u00b7 Undertaking analytical review procedures to support the reasonableness of the data;\n- \u00b7 Identifying and testing assumptions supporting the calculations;\n- \u00b7 Comparing text and data (on a sample basis) presented to underlying sources; and\n- \u00b7 Reviewing the ANZ 2022 Annual Report, ANZ 2022 Annual Review and ANZ 2022 ESG Supplement and ANZ 2022 ESG Supplement Data Pack in their entirety for consistency with the ESG Information and our knowledge obtained through our assurance engagement.\n\n## How the Standard De/fines Limited Assurance and Material Misstatement\n\nA limited assurance engagement is restricted primarily to enquiries and analytical procedures. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. The Standard requires our report to be worded around what we have not found, rather than what we have found.\n\nMisstatements, including omissions, are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence relevant decisions of the Directors of ANZ.\n\n## Use of this Assurance Report\n\nThis report has been prepared for the Directors of ANZ Banking Group Limited for the purpose of providing an assurance conclusion on the ESG Information within the ANZ 2022 Annual Report and ANZ 2022 Annual Review and may not be suitable for another purpose. We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this report, to any person other than the Directors of ANZ, or for any other purpose than that for which it was prepared.",

        "page_content": "## Glossary\n\nAASs Australian Accounting Standards.\n\nAASB Australian Accounting Standards Board. The term 'AASB' is commonly used when identifying AASs issued by the AASB. In doing so, the term is used together with the AAS number.\n\nADI Authorised Deposit-taking Institution as defined by APRA.\n\nANZEST ANZ Employee Share Trust.\n\nANZ Research - Economics , a business unit within ANZ, which conducts analysis of key economic inputs and developments and assessment of the potential impacts on the local, regional and global economies.\n\nAPRA Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.\n\nAPS ADI Prudential Standard.\n\nAT1 Additional Tier 1 capital.\n\nASX Australian Securities Exchange.\n\nBCBS Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise coins, notes, money at call, balances held with central banks, liquid settlement balances (readily convertible to known amounts of cash which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value) and securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repurchase agreements) in less than three months.\n\nCash profit is an additional measure of profit which is prepared on a basis other than in accordance with accounting standards. Cash profit represents ANZ's preferred measure of the result of the core business activities of the Group, enabling readers to assess Group and Divisional performance against prior periods and against peer institutions. To calculate cash profit, the Group excludes non-core items from statutory profit as noted below. These items are calculated consistently period on period so as not to discriminate between positive and negative adjustments.\n\nGains and losses are adjusted where they are significant, or have the potential to be significant in any one period, and fall into one of three categories:\n\n- 1.  gains or losses included in earnings arising from changes in tax, legal or accounting legislation or other non-core items not associated with the core operations of the Group;\n- 2.  economic hedging impacts and similar accounting items that represent timing differences that will reverse through earnings in the future; and\n- 3.  accounting reclassifications between individual line items that do not impact reported results, such as credit risk on impaired derivatives.\n\nCash profit is not a measure of cash flow or profit determined on a cash accounting basis.\n\nCollectively assessed allowance for expected credit loss represents the Expected Credit Loss (ECL), which incorporates forward-looking information and does not require an actual loss event to have occurred for a credit loss provision to be recognised.\n\nCommitted Liquidity Facility (CLF) is a facility with the RBA that was established to offset the shortage of available High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) in Australia and provides an alternative form of contingent liquidity. The CLF is collateralised by assets, including internal residential mortgagebacked securities, that are eligible to be pledged as security with the RBA. The total amount of the CLF available to a qualifying ADI is set annually by APRA. In September 2021, APRA wrote to ADIs to advise that APRA and the RBA consider there to be sufficient HQLA for ADIs to meet their Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requirements, and therefore the use of the CLF should no longer be required beyond 2022 calendar year.\n\nCoronavirus (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness which was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. COVID-19 was characterised as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation on 11 March 2020.\n\nCovered bonds are bonds issued by an ADI to external investors secured against a pool of the ADI's assets (the cover pool) assigned to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity. The primary assets forming the cover pool are mortgage loans. The mortgages remain on the issuer's balance sheet. The covered bond holders have dual recourse to the issuer and the cover pool assets. The mortgages included in the cover pool cannot be otherwise pledged or disposed of but may be repurchased and substituted in order to maintain the credit quality of the pool. The Group issues covered bonds as part of its funding activities.\n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss resulting from the failure of ANZ's customers and counterparties to honour or perform fully the terms of a loan or contract.\n\nCredit risk weighted assets (CRWA) represent assets which are weighted for credit risk according to a set formula as prescribed in APS 112/113.\n\nCustomer deposits represent term deposits, other deposits bearing interest, deposits not bearing interest and borrowing corporations' debt excluding securitisation deposits.\n\nCustomer remediation includes provisions for expected refunds to customers, remediation project costs and related customer and regulatory claims, penalties and litigation outcomes.\n\nDerivative credit valuation adjustment (CVA) Over the life of a derivative instrument, ANZ uses a model to adjust fair value to take into account the impact of counterparty credit quality. The methodology calculates the present value of expected losses over the life of the financial instrument as a function of probability of default, loss given default, expected credit risk exposure and an asset correlation factor. Impaired derivatives are also subject to a CVA.\n\nDividend payout ratio is the total ordinary dividend payment divided by profit attributable to shareholders of the Company.\n\nEmbedded losses In relation to interest rate risk in the banking book, APRA requires ADIs to give consideration to embedded gains or losses in banking book items that are not accounted for on a marked-to-market basis when determining regulatory capital. The embedded loss or gain measures the difference between the book value and the economic value of banking book activities at a point in time.\n\nFair value is an amount at which an asset or liability could be exchanged between knowledgeable and willing parties in an arm's length transaction.\n\n## Funding for Lending Programme (FLP)\n\nrefers to three-year funding announced by the RBNZ in November 2020 and offered to New Zealand banks, which aimed to lower the cost of borrowing for New Zealand businesses and households.",

The risk generally arises from:\n\n- 1.  Repricing and yield curve risk - the risk to earnings or market value as a result of changes in the overall level of interest rates and/or the relativity of these rates across the yield curve;\n- 2.  Basis risk - the risk to earnings or market value arising from volatility in the interest margin applicable to banking book items; and\n- 3.  Optionality risk - the risk to earnings or market value arising from the existence of stand-alone or embedded options in banking book items.\n\n## Internationally comparable ratios are\n\nANZ's interpretation of the regulations documented in the Basel Committee publications; 'Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems' (June 2011) and 'International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards' (June 2006). They also include differences identified in APRA's information paper entitled International Capital Comparison Study (13 July 2015).\n\nLevel 1 in the context of APRA supervision, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited consolidated with certain approved subsidiaries.\n\nLevel 2 in the context of APRA supervision, the consolidated ANZ Group excluding associates, insurance and funds management entities, commercial non-financial entities and certain securitisation vehicles.\n\nLevel 3 in the context of APRA supervision, the consolidated ANZ Group.\n\nNet interest margin is net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets.\n\nNet loans and advances represent gross loans and advances less allowance for expected credit losses.\n\nNet Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is the ratio of the amount of available stable funding (ASF) to the amount of required stable funding (RSF) defined by APRA. The amount of ASF is the portion of an ADI capital and liabilities expected to be a reliable source of funds over a one year time horizon. The amount of RSF is a function of the liquidity characteristics and residual maturities of an ADI's assets and off-balance sheet activities. ADIs must maintain an NSFR of at least 100%.\n\nNet tangible assets equal share capital and reserves attributable to shareholders of the Company less unamortised intangible assets (including goodwill and software).\n\nNZX New Zealand's Exchange.\n\nRBA Reserve Bank of Australia, Australia's central bank.\n\nRBNZ Reserve Bank of New Zealand, New Zealand's central bank.\n\n## Regulatory deposits are mandatory\n\nreserve deposits lodged with local central banks in accordance with statutory requirements.\n\nRestructured items comprise facilities in which the original contractual terms have been modified for reasons related to the financial difficulties of the customer. Restructuring may consist of reduction of interest, principal or other payments legally due, or an extension in maturity materially beyond those typically offered to new facilities with similar risk.\n\nReturn on average assets is the profit attributable to shareholders of the Company, divided by average total assets.\n\nReturn on average ordinary shareholders' equity is the profit attributable to shareholders of the Company, divided by average ordinary shareholders' equity.\n\nRisk weighted assets (RWA) are risk weighted according to each asset's inherent potential for default and what the likely losses would be in the case of default. In the case of non-asset backed risks (i.e. market and operational risk), RWA is determined by multiplying the capital requirements for those risks by 12.5.\n\n## Settlement balances owed to/by ANZ\n\nrepresent financial assets and/or liabilities which are in the course of being settled. These may include trade dated assets and liabilities, vostro accounts and securities settlement accounts.\n\n## Term Funding Facility (TFF) refers\n\nto three-year funding announced by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) on 19 March 2020 and offered to ADIs in order to support lending to Australian businesses at low cost.\n\nTerm Lending Facility (TLF) refers to three to five-year funding offered by the RBNZ between May 2020 and July 2021 to promote lending to New Zealand businesses.",
