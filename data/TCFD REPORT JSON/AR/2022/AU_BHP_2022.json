        "page_content": "## Chair's review\n\nDear Shareholders,\n\nI am pleased to provide BHP's Annual Report for FY2022 which was a transformational year for your company.\n\nDuring the year BHP:\n\n- -  unified our dual listed company structure under a single parent company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange\n- -  merged our Petroleum business with Woodside to create a top 10 energy provider and provide shareholders with further choice as to their exposure to oil and gas\n- -  simplified the coal portfolio through the sale of our interests in Cerrej\u00f3n and BHP Mitsui Coal to concentrate on higher-quality metallurgical coal which is forecast to be critical for making the steel necessary to support decarbonisation and infrastructure growth over coming decades\n- -  approved an investment of US$5.7 billion in our Jansen Potash Project in Canada, marking BHP's entry into a new commodity which provides shareholders with exposure to the growing population megatrend\n\nYour Board would like to thank all shareholders for the trust you have shown in supporting these changes which set your company up to deliver value into the future.\n\nThat trust is built over time and through performance, and this year Mike Henry, his management team and all our people, have continued to deliver strong operational and financial performance through a challenging period of ongoing pandemic disruption, global supply chain challenges and cost pressures.\n\n## Safety and wellbeing\n\nIn terms of safety, FY2022 was the third consecutive year in which there were no workplace occupational fatalities, and the Group made strong progress on other leading safety indicators such as a 30 per cent reduction in high-potential injuries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThese are pleasing indicators of the progress we can make when our focus is unwavering. To achieve truly safe, inclusive and diverse workplaces for all our people we know we must bring this same focus to bear on all aspects of workplace safety including addressing sexual harassment, racism and bullying.\n\n## The value we create\n\nIt is against a backdrop of commitment to performance and continuous improvement, that BHP has delivered considerable value to you, our shareholders.\n\nIn FY2022, the Board determined dividends worth US$36 billion to shareholders (including the distribution of Woodside shares). This takes the total amount returned to shareholders over the past four years to more than US$50 billion.\n\nBut it is not just value to shareholders. This year, we also made substantial headway in our sustainability aspirations and focus on social value. We provided shareholders with the first 'Say on Climate' shareholder resolution in the Australian market, and our Climate Transition Action Plan (Plan) was supported by almost 85 per cent of shareholders. This Plan aligns our climate goals with our strategic goals, and provides a clear basis for measuring BHP's climate performance.\n\nWe also launched a social value framework and scorecard with 2030 goals to bring additional transparency to our social value goals and outcomes. We are working hard to embed social value in our strategy, capital allocation decisions, plans, processes and culture. It is not only the right thing to do, but we believe it provides a significant competitive advantage for BHP and is vital to delivering long-term sustainable value.\n\nAs well as the value delivered to shareholders, this year, we made significant contributions to the communities where we operate, through employment, partnerships, and taxes and royalties paid to governments. This amounted to US$57.5 billion in Australia, US$7.7 billion in Chile and US$12.9 billion in the rest of the world, and our local procurement has increased 40 per cent over the past three years with US$2.7 billion directed to 2,700 local suppliers during FY2022.\n\nFY2022 was a successful year of transformation for our business. I am confident we are building BHP for the future and to create enduring value for our shareholders and communities, customers, suppliers and partners.\n\n## Board succession\n\nWe welcomed Michelle Hinchliffe and Catherine Tanna to the BHP Board as independent Non-executive Directors. Both bring over 35 years' experience to BHP - Michelle in financial controls and risk management, and Catherine in energy, long-life capital allocation and HSE. We are delighted to welcome Michelle and Catherine.\n\nAt the other end of the succession process, we will farewell Malcolm Broomhead and John Mogford at the conclusion of the 2022 Annual General Meeting. Both have announced their intention to retire following exceptional periods of service, and I would like to thank Malcolm and John for their outstanding contribution to BHP and the Board.\n\nFY2022 was a successful year of transformation for our business. I am confident we are building BHP for the future and to create enduring value for our shareholders and communities, customers, suppliers and partners.\n\nThank you for your continued support of BHP.\n\nKen MacKenzie Chair\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Chief Executive Officer's review\n\nDear Shareholders,\n\nBHP performed well in FY2022. Our strong production outcomes and solid cost control allowed us to capture the greatest benefit from the tailwind of high commodity prices during the year. It was pleasing to all of us at BHP to be able to deliver not only record returns to shareholders, but also record contributions to our other stakeholders. We paid record taxes and royalties during the year of US$17.3 billion, slightly higher than our cash returns to shareholders of US$16.4 billion.\n\nMost importantly, we did so safely and sustainably. No one has lost their life while working at BHP for over three and a half consecutive years now. This is a very significant milestone, but we must guard against complacency. We will continue to prioritise our efforts to reduce fatal risk from our workplaces. We also reduced our operational greenhouse gas emissions by 24 per cent over the past two years and have reduced freshwater withdrawals by almost 30 per cent since 2017.\n\nWe were successful in partially mitigating the impacts of a number of external challenges, including the ongoing pandemic, to deliver well against our production and unit cost guidance for the year. We achieved record full-year shipments from our Western Australia Iron Ore business for the third year running, and we remain the world's lowest cost major producer. In copper, our Escondida business in Chile had record material mined and near-record concentrator throughput, while Olympic Dam in South Australia performed strongly in the fourth quarter after our major smelter maintenance overhaul, which takes place every four years.\n\nWe anticipate the economic headwinds, including inflation and tight labour markets, and the impacts from COVID-19 will continue through the year ahead. We aim to navigate these challenges better than our competitors and have the focus and capabilities in place to enable us to do so. Our continued high performance in the past year is thanks to 80,000 highly capable, diverse, engaged people across BHP, who have continued to show tremendous resilience in the face of the multiple challenges thrown at us by the external environment.\n\nWe will be safer, more reliable, lower cost and more productive if we are able to more fully harness the experience, passion and ingenuity of everyone across BHP. This is being hard-\n\nwired through the BHP Operating System (BOS), which is building a continuous improvement culture and capability right through to the fingertips of the company. This shift, coupled with our progress on creating a more inclusive and diverse workforce is unlocking performance and achieving this in a way that is exciting for BHP and more fulfilling for our people.\n\nI am proud to say that the proportion of females and Indigenous peoples at BHP continues to grow. Representation of female employees reached 32.3 per cent in FY2022 and the executive leadership team is fully balanced. Indigenous peoples now represent 8.3 per cent of our operational workforce in Australia, 8.7 per cent in Chile and 7.2 per cent in our Jansen Potash Project in Canada.\n\nWhile we have made strong progress in improving the composition of our workforce, you will see in this year's report increased disclosure in respect of cases of sexual harassment, racism and bullying that have occurred during the year in the company. I am ashamed that these behaviours still occur in BHP. We are fiercely determined to stop them from happening. During the year, we progressed work on upgrading our facilities, improving our processes, providing more support to impacted persons and bystanders, and shifting culture. In the past year, we invested more than US$200 million to improve the security and experience in our accommodation villages, established a global support service to provide dedicated, end-to-end case coordination for anyone impacted by sexual harassment, and enhanced training programs, including for both leaders and bystanders. Most recently we took time out from work and production across all of BHP to discuss sexual harassment, racism and bullying. These Safety Stops involved the whole of the workforce globally and were intended to build awareness, understanding, capability, and collective commitment to action.\n\nAs well as building an even safer and more inclusive workplace at BHP, we must help to build a better world for all of our stakeholders. We aim to create social value, which is the positive contribution BHP makes to society: our people, partners, the economy, the environment and local communities for the mutual benefit of shareholders and the community. We see this as fundamental to our long-term success and a competitive advantage that will support growth.\n\nBHP performed well in FY2022 with strong production outcomes and solid cost control. We paid record taxes and royalties during the year of US$17.3 billion and cash returns to shareholders of US$16.4 billion. And most importantly, we did so safely and sustainably.\n\nDuring the year, we launched our new social value framework and set short-term milestones as well as 2030 goals under each of our six social value pillars. Our commitment to social value contributes to the relevant United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals and aligns with our continued support for the UN Global Compact and its 10 principles.\n\nFY2022 was a year in which we also made significant progress transforming our business for the future through reshaping our portfolio and simplifying our corporate structure. We divested our Petroleum business and created a stronger, more resilient stand-alone business by merging it with Woodside, creating more choice and opportunity for value for shareholders. We further optimised our coal portfolio through the divestment of our stakes in BHP Mitsui Coal and in Cerrej\u00f3n. We approved the Jansen Stage 1 Potash Project in Canada, opening up a new long-term growth front for the company in potash, a fertiliser that will enable more sustainable farming globally. Finally, we unified our corporate structure, removing the more complex dual listed structure in place since the BHP and Billiton merger of 2001.\n\nWe now have a leaner, more agile and more efficient BHP, with a portfolio more aligned to the global megatrends unfolding around us, and better positioned to grow value by supplying the commodities required for a decarbonising world.\n\nI am excited about our plans for the year ahead and for the future. Despite external volatility, the fundamentals that underpin our business are positive and strongly position BHP for enduring success.\n\nThank you for your ongoing support.\n\nMike Henry Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Being the best operator will help us safely generate better return on capital employed and outcompete others for new opportunities.\n- -  We have delivered strong and consistent results and returns through our portfolio and operating discipline. We achieved net operating cashflow on a Total operations basis of US$32.2 billion in FY2022, above US$15 billion for the sixth consecutive year.\n- -  We believe our focus on social value will lead to us being the partner of choice with communities, governments, suppliers and customers. We seek respectful, mutually beneficial relationships with the communities where we operate and the suppliers, customers and governments we interact with. Our experience has been that engaging with\n\nthose around us creates optionality, stronger relationships and access to more diverse thinking. It helps us be more creative and to find different ways to problem solve. It also means we are better able to see things coming towards us and can act pre-emptively. Aligning strongly with partners can prevent issues or delays with projects and, if issues do arise, means we are better able to collectively work on solutions.\n\n- -  We assess and rank decarbonisation projects across our operated assets through our Capital Allocation Framework (CAF). During FY2022, we integrated our 1.5\u00b0C Paris-aligned scenario into our strategy and capital allocation process, helping to ensure our capital expenditure plans are not misaligned with the Paris Agreement's aim to pursue efforts to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.\n- manage risk, streamline processes and improve productivity.\n- -  The combination of our people, strategy and operational systems will help us to outperform our competitors and attract a lower cost of capital, while our CAF helps us make better use of this capital.\n\nWe bring together essential resources, a strong balance sheet and a differentiated operating capability underpinned by our technical Centres of Excellence and the BHP Operating System (BOS).\n\nThis combination of operational excellence, a strong portfolio of large, long-life, quality assets and focus on social value will assist us to grow value more consistently for all stakeholders and underpin continued attractive returns and longterm value for our shareholders.\n\n- -  We recruit and retain the best people and empower them to run our operations safely and productively. We promote an inclusive and diverse environment where safety and wellbeing are the highest priorities, invest in development programs to build capability and improve performance and offer competitive remuneration. We invest in technology to\n\n## Our people\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Health and safety\n\nOur highest priority is the safety of our workforce and the communities where we operate. We achieved a third consecutive year without a fatality and have seen a sustained improvement in the high-potential injury frequency rate which fell by 30 per cent in FY2022 from FY2021.\n\nWe are committed to protecting the health and wellbeing of our workforce. Over the past five years, we have achieved a 68 per cent reduction in the total number of workers exposed to our most material occupational exposures.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to OFR 7.4 and 7.6.\n\nOur focus on safety and health underpins our strong operational performance and this includes eliminating sexual harassment, racism and bullying. We are committed to eliminating incidents of sexual harassment in our workplaces and accommodation villages, and have strengthened our approach to prevention, reporting and response. Our focus on gender balance is an important factor in addressing this unacceptable behaviour.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to OFR 7.5.\n\n## Inclusion and diversity\n\nWe continue to build a more inclusive and diverse workforce that further enhances our performance and better reflects the communities where we operate:\n\n- -  We remain on track to achieve our aspirational goal for a genderbalanced employee workforce globally by FY2025.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to OFR 6.\n\n- -  We made progress during FY2022 against targets for increased Indigenous employment in our Minerals Australia operations, Minerals Americas operations in Chile and our Jansen Potash Project in Canada.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to OFR 6.",

We recently completed the sale of our interest in BHP Mitsui Coal (BMC), further focusing our coal portfolio on higher-quality coals for steelmaking with greater potential upside for quality premiums as steelmakers seek to improve blast furnace utilisation and reduce emissions intensity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to OFR 5.1.\n\nWe hold the second-largest nickel sulphide endowment globally 4 and our nickel operations in Western Australia have one of the lowest production emissions intensities of benchmarked mines.\u00b2 We achieved our first saleable production of nickel sulphate crystals for the lithium-ion battery industry in the December 2021 quarter. We are growing value by supplying 87 per cent of BHP's battery-suitable nickel to battery material suppliers in FY2022. We are seeking more nickel resources through exploration, acquisition and early-stage entry.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to OFR 5.1.\n\nWe are developing one of the world's largest potash mines in Canada. The proposed mine has been designed based on a sustainable approach with a relatively low emissions footprint and low water intensity compared to existing potash mines. The Jansen Potash Project is expected to increase BHP's product diversification, customer base and operating footprint, opening up a new future growth front.

Our pillars map to the UN Sustainable Development Goals as follows: Decarbonisation - Goal 13; Healthy environment - Goals 6, 14, 15; Indigenous partnerships - Goals 8, 10, 17; Safe, inclusive and future-ready workforce - Goals 3, 5, 10; Thriving, empowered communities - Goals 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 16 and Responsible supply chains - Goals 10, 12, 16, 17.\n- 2 With widespread adoption expected post-2030.\n- 3 These positions are expressed using terms that are defined in the Glossary to this Report, including the terms 'target', 'goal', 'net zero' and 'carbon neutral'. The baseline year(s) of our targets will be adjusted for any material acquisitions and divestments, and to reflect progressive refinement of emissions reporting methodologies. The targets' boundaries may in some cases differ from required reporting boundaries. The use of carbon offsets will be governed by BHP's approach to carbon offsetting described at bhp.com/climate. The Scopes 1 and 2 operational emissions target is for FY2030. The Scope 3 goals are for CY2030. For further information on our GHG targets and goals, refer to 'BHP's climate change targets and goals' in OFR 7.8.\n- 4 Nature positive is defined by the WBCSD/TNFD as 'A high-level goal and concept describing a future state of nature (e.g. biodiversity, ecosystem services and natural capital) which is greater than the current state.' It includes land and water management practices that halt and reverse nature loss - that is, supporting healthy, functioning ecosystems.\n- 5 Land under stewardship which has a formal management plan including nature-positive practices.\n- 6 Natural capital accounts are a way to measure the amount, condition and value of environmental assets in a given area. It helps describe changes in ecosystems and how these impact wellbeing and economies.",

Highlights included three years fatality-free, a reduction in the total number of workers exposed to our most material occupational exposures by 68 per cent, a 15 per cent decrease in operational GHG emissions from our adjusted FY2017 baseline, social investment of US$681.4 million over five years and a 29 per cent reduction in freshwater withdrawal volumes from our adjusted FY2017 baseline.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to OFR 7.3 and 7.8.\n\n- -  Our Chilean operations Escondida and Spence, and Olympic Dam in Australia were awarded the Copper Mark during FY2022 recognising responsible production practices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our social value performance refer to OFR 7.\n\n## Supporting local economic development\n\nWe aim to source and promote locally available goods and services as an important part of our external expenditure to help local communities thrive. Our operated assets develop local procurement plans designed to identify opportunities for local suppliers, including small businesses.\n\nIn FY2022, BHP made US$18.8 billion in payments to suppliers globally, including US$17.6 billion in payments to more than 8,000 suppliers in the regions where we operate. Of the latter amount, US$2.7 billion, or 15.2 per cent, was paid to local suppliers in the communities where we operate.\n\nOur expenditure with local suppliers was primarily in Australia (59 per cent) and Chile (30 per cent). Of our total supplier spend, 94.4 per cent was in the regions where we operate.\n\n## 2030 social value scorecard\n\nIn June 2022, we launched our social value scorecard with 2030 goals, metrics and milestones (below). We believe it will enhance our opportunity to run our business in a way that delivers long-term, sustainable value to BHP, our shareholders and the broader community.\n\nThis scorecard provides clarity to our teams on our ambitions and allows us to measure progress, transparently report and hold ourselves to account.\n\nOur metrics will evolve over time and some are future metrics that will be developed in the coming years. They show where we are headed with measuring our performance.\n\nAt its core, this scorecard represents an emphasis on partnerships, listening and co-design, recognising that it is not for us alone to decide what is of value to communities or the environment, and that addressing challenges like climate change require collaboration.\n\nWe will disclose our performance against this scorecard every year as part of our Annual Report, starting in FY2023.\n\n| Safe, inclusive and   future-ready workforce                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Thriving, empowered   communities                                                                                                                                                         | Responsible   supply chains                                                                                                                                             |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| A thriving workforce that is safe, healthy, gender  balanced at every level, culturally diverse 10  and  inclusive and skilled for the future.                                                                                                             | Partner with communities and stakeholders   to co-create and implement plans that   deliver jointly defined economic, social and   environmental outcomes.                                | Together with our partners, we create sustainable,  ethical and transparent supply chains.                                                                              |\n| #  reduction in life-altering injury or illness 11 Available in FY2023 %  engagement and Perception Survey  wellbeing score %  female workforce representation  Diversity index available in FY2024                                                        | %  co-created plans  Delivery metric to be added in FY2024 #  community feedback on co-creation and  implementation process  Available in FY2024 $  total economic contribution (US$)     | #  customer Net Promoter Score (NPS) 14 #  supplier Net Promoter Score (NPS) 14                                                                                         |\n| FY2023:  Achieve 100% adherence  to sexual harassment program 12 FY2024:  >90% implementation of plan for  controls identified and approved through the Fatality  Elimination Program and 100% adherence   to the psychosocial risk 13  management program | FY2023:  Release Equitable Transition  principles - refer to OFR 7.1 FY2023/2024:  Embed co-creation  approach including metrics and measurement FY2025:  Implement co-created plans that | FY2024:  Implement LME Responsible  Sourcing requirements FY2024:  Complete ICMM Performance  Expectations for all operating assets FY2024:  Determine ethical supplier |\n\n- 7 All land and water areas across Minerals Americas and Minerals Australia.\n\n8\n\nProgress to plan will be partner-measured using a traffic light score on Indigenous partnership satisfaction in relation to the milestones agreed in partnership.\n\n- 9 Relationship health will be partner-measured using a traffic light score.\n- 10  Cultural diversity in our workforce will be measured based on our substantive progress towards reflecting the cultural diversity of the community.\n- 11  Reduction in life-altering injury or illness: includes life-altering or long-term permanent disabling injuries and illnesses as defined by the BHP Risk Management Framework.\n- 12  The core components of the sexual harassment program include: culture, leadership and training; security measures at accommodation villages; recruitment processes; contractor and third-party engagement; emergency response; trauma-informed (wellbeing) care; accessible, confidential reporting and person-centric investigations; and appropriate disciplinary action.\n- 13  Psychosocial risks or hazards are factors in the design or management of work or the social conditions that increase the risk of work-related stress and can lead to psychological or physical harm. Examples of psychosocial hazards include exposure to unreasonable behaviours, including bullying, racism and sexual harassment, fatigue, poor supervisor support, poor communication or change management or high job demands.\n- 14  Net Promoter Scores show respective feedback from our customers and suppliers, and measures the willingness of our customers/suppliers to recommend BHP to others.

BOS is, at its heart, a people program. It is designed to provide a way of working that creates a culture at BHP where we make continuous improvement central to everyone's role.\n\nWe continued to deploy BOS throughout our business in FY2022 and expect full deployment by the end of FY2024. BOS has delivered over US$2 billion in estimated, recurring and one-time cost and revenue improvements since we developed it in CY2018. Based on the success we are seeing, we believe it will deliver further gains in the future.\n\n## Embracing technology and innovation\n\nThe power of data, innovation and technology, together with the BOS, have helped accelerate continuous improvement across our value chain, from the geoscience required in exploration through to the marketing of our products.\n\nWe have used technology to:\n\n- -  maintain safe, predictable and productive operations\n- -  drive productivity improvements, with an emphasis on automation and real-time data-driven insights and decision-making\n- -  help drive inclusion and diversity by providing greater opportunities for roles that were traditionally labour intensive\n- -  unlock the next stage of value growth at BHP, from realising greater margins at our existing operations to finding new assets\n- -  improve sustainability outcomes through innovation\n\nThe use of technology such as in autonomous trucks, production innovation such as primary sulphide leaching at our copper assets (which has helped us to extract more copper from ore) and digital transformation across all parts of our business has helped to improve safety, increase productivity, reduce costs, build capability and accelerate value creation.\n\nExamples of our application of technology and innovation in FY2022 include:\n\n- -  We continued to automate our global trucking fleets. At South Flank we began to automate our fleet of 41 Komatsu haul trucks in the June 2022 quarter, with the program expected to be completed within 18 months. We continued deployment at Goonyella Riverside (expected to be completed by the end of December 2022) and completed the rollout at Daunia. We also commenced autonomous drilling at Spence. We expect to commence the rollout of automated trucks at Spence in FY2023.\n- -  We began testing two automated shiploaders at the Port Hedland export facility in Western Australia. In what we believe is a world first, 3D laser scan technology has been used in the A$50 million project. We intend to fully automate eight shiploaders by FY2024. The project is expected to enable an increase in production of more than 1 million tonnes of iron ore each year through greater precision, reduced spillage, faster load times and equipment optimisation.\n- -  Our in-house Grade Adjustment Model has been introduced at multiple WAIO sites and is expected to enable a US$22.8 million annual revenue uplift at WAIO. The model uses machine learning to target a reduction in iron ore grade variability across the supply chain. It uses data sources that capture movements of ore to map the iron grade coming from the mine to the iron ore grade shipped at port.\n- -  Through our Maintenance and Engineering Centre of Excellence, we continued the rollout of our Total Equipment Strategies (TES), which were initially applied to our mobile fleets and have been extended to our fixed plant. These strategies use mathematical analysis of breakdowns, maintenance patterns and original equipment manufacturer recommendations to recalibrate our maintenance programs to increase availability and reliability, and reduce maintenance costs and inventory values. For example, at our Newman iron ore operation in Western Australia, the mobile TES project for CAT 6060 excavators helped to extend the average equipment life by 40 per cent and delivered an availability uplift of 2 per cent. The outcome is 3.5 years of extra life which has helped to achieve capital productivity by deferral of US$120 million of capital expenditure over five years.\n\n## Financial excellence\n\nWe use the Capital Allocation Framework (CAF) to assess the most effective and efficient way to deploy capital. This prioritises maintaining safe and reliable operations, meeting our social value and GHG emissions reductions targets, goals and strategies, keeping our balance sheet strong and delivering strong growth and returns for our shareholders. We then look at what would be the most valuable risk-adjusted use for any excess capital. We evaluate the range of investment opportunities and aim to optimise the portfolio based on our assessment of risk, returns and future optionality. We then develop a long-term capital plan and guidance for the Group.\n\nSince the CAF's introduction in FY2016, we have balanced reinvestment in the business with cash returns to shareholders. We want shareholders to see the short-term benefit of these cash returns and trust us to plan for the future by investing where it matters.\n\n## What is the BHP Operating System?\n\nThe BHP Operating System (BOS) is a way of working that seeks to make improvement part of what we do every day through the application of BOS tools and practices. It is anchored in three principles that will help us deliver exceptional safety and productivity performance and an inclusive and empowered culture:\n\n- -Serve our customers - deliver what internal and external customers need, at the right time and at the appropriate levels of quality and cost.\n- -Pursue operating perfection - pursue 100 per cent safety for our people, 100 per cent value for our customers, 0 per cent waste.\n- -Empower our people - support our people with the right conditions and leadership to excel. They know their work and how to improve it.\n\nThrough BOS principles and practices we are delivering more to our employees and contractors, suppliers, shareholders, customers and the communities whose resources we develop.\n\n<!-- image -->",

We believe unification gives us a corporate structure that is simpler, more agile and more efficient.\n\n## Merging Petroleum with Woodside\n\nDuring FY2022, we merged our Petroleum business with Woodside Energy Group Ltd (Woodside) to create a global top 10 independent energy company by production. Woodside acquired BHP's Petroleum business in exchange for Woodside shares that were distributed to BHP shareholders through an in specie dividend.\n\nBased on Woodside's share price of US$21.39 (A$29.76) at 31 May 2022, the closing date of the transaction, the implied value of BHP's Petroleum business was US$19.6 billion (A$27.2 billion).\n\nBHP shareholders gained exposure to assets in Woodside through the transaction and greater choice about how to weight their exposure to the different investment and sector propositions. The transaction increased BHP's portfolio weighting towards future facing commodities that support economic growth and have potential upside through the energy transition.\n\n## Consolidating our coal portfolio\n\nIn January 2022, we divested our 33.3 per cent interest in Cerrej\u00f3n, a non-operated energy coal joint venture in Colombia, to Glencore, for a total cash consideration of approximately US$294 million.\n\nIn May 2022, we divested our 80 per cent interest in BHP Mitsui Coal Pty Ltd (BMC), a metallurgical coal joint venture in Queensland operated by BMC, to Stanmore Resources Limited, for a total cash consideration of up to US$1.35 billion in paid and deferred amounts, plus a final completion adjustment amount.\n\nIn June 2022, we announced that, following a two-year review, we would retain New South Wales Energy Coal (NSWEC). We will be seeking approvals to continue mining at NSWEC beyond its current mining consent that expires in 2026 and intend to proceed with a managed process to cease mining at the asset by the end of FY2030.\n\nThese portfolio changes are consistent with our strategy to focus on producing higher-quality metallurgical coal.\n\n## Investing in a new commodity - potash\n\nPotash enables more efficient and sustainable farming which we believe will be increasingly important in feeding a growing population, and potentially opens a new long-term growth front for BHP.\n\nIn August 2021, we approved US$5.7 billion in capital expenditure for Jansen Stage 1 in Saskatchewan, Canada, with first potash production expected in CY2027. We are working to bring forward Jansen Stage 1 first production and are assessing options to accelerate Jansen Stage 2.\n\nThe US$2.97 billion Jansen project to finish the excavation and lining of the production and service shafts, and to continue the installation of essential surface infrastructure and utilities, was completed in June 2022. For FY2023, approximately US$740 million in capital expenditure is planned for work at Jansen Stage 1, which will continue to focus on civil and mechanical construction on the surface and underground, as well as equipment procurement and port construction.\n\n## Unlocking growth potential at our assets\n\nThe large endowments we have under our control are becoming increasingly valuable as the resources industry finds high-quality, Tier 1 (large, low-cost and long-life) resources harder to access, deeper, of lower grade, or in countries with more challenging operating conditions.\n\n## Copper\n\nWe hold the largest copper endowment in the world at among the highest average grade.\u00b9\n\n- -  This includes 27 billion tonnes of ore at an average grade of 0.52 per cent at Escondida, where we are targeting an annual average of 1.2 million tonnes (Mt) of copper production over the medium term, a 20 per cent increase on Escondida's FY2022 production of 1 Mt.\n- -  On the basis that tailings storage facility anomalies are resolved, production at Spence is expected to reach and average approximately 270 kilotonnes per annum (ktpa) of production for four years (including cathodes) following the completion of Spence Growth Option (SGO) plant modifications. This will be supported by capital expenditure of approximately US$100 million, which is planned for the SGO plant modifications and these are currently planned to be completed in CY2023, with further studies ongoing for additional capacity uplift.\n- -  At Olympic Dam, we have improved operating stability over time. Smelter operations have been strong following our planned major smelter maintenance, completed in January 2022. The next major rebuild is not expected for six years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Nickel\n\nWe hold the second-largest nickel sulphide endowment globally\u00b2 and own the majority of tenements of known resource in the AgnewWiluna basin in Western Australia.\n\n- -  Our nickel sulphate plant at Nickel West delivered first crystals in October 2021, allowing us to add further value to our nickel production. We intend to capitalise on the expected ongoing global demand for nickel for the electric vehicle industry, as the method we use to produce nickel sulphate results in a product we believe is ideal for battery production.\n- -  We continue to explore ways to increase the scale of Nickel West.\n\n## Iron Ore\n\nWe are one of the world's largest iron ore producers and expect to increase production over the medium-term.\n\n- -  We have secured an increase to our WAIO iron ore environmental licence to expand port operations up to 330 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) subject to the outcomes of a standard appeals process.\n- -  The ramp up of WAIO's US$3.6 billion South Flank mine is ahead of schedule and we have revised our medium-term production guidance to more than 300 Mtpa. We are assessing expansion alternatives to take us toward 330 Mtpa of production.\n- 1 Based on ownership interest.

        "page_content": "## 3  Positioning for the future continued\n\n## Growth through exploration, focused on copper and nickel\n\nOur exploration program is focused on copper and nickel. We look to identify and gain access to new search spaces to test targets capable of delivering high-quality, Tier 1 deposits, and maintain research and technology activities aligned with our exploration strategy.\n\nDespite the slowdown and restrictions on movement due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in FY2022 our field teams pursued copper opportunities in Chile, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, the United States and Australia. This involved early-stage reconnaissance work through target definition and drill testing.\n\nElsewhere for copper, we continued to seek, secure and test concessions in regions such as Ecuador, South Australia, Chile, Mexico, and Peru.\n\nWe have also increased the number of highquality nickel projects within the exploration pipeline. We are actively exploring nickel targets in Western Australia, while in Canada, we continued our partnership with Midland Exploration Inc in Canada through our 5 per cent interest and collaboration on a target generation program. BHP made a US$40 million investment in Kabanga Nickel in Tanzania in FY2022, which offers an opportunity to expand the immediate search space to add to the known resource.\n\nOur business partnerships continued to deliver encouraging results. In Ecuador, we maintained a 13.6 per cent ownership in SolGold plc, the majority owner and operator of the Alpala porphyry copper-gold project. In Mexico, we continued our financial agreement with Riverside Resources, a US company with significant operating experience in Mexico, securing additional areas that are scheduled to be drill tested during FY2023. In Australia, we initiated work with Encounter Resources to explore for sediment-hosted copper deposits in the Northern Territory. We also entered into a Letter of Intent with Mundoro to cooperatively explore for copper resources in the highly prospective belt in Serbia and Bulgaria. Several drill-ready targets are scheduled to be tested during FY2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Copper exploration regions\n- Nickel exploration regions\n\n## Exploration expenditure\n\nOur resource assessment exploration expenditure increased by 30 per cent in FY2022 to US$179 million, while our greenfield expenditure increased by 43 per cent to US$77 million.

This, combined with our focus on operational excellence and safety, quality assets and leading approach to social value means we remain positioned to deliver consistently strong results through the cycle.\n\nOur operational performance, combined with higher prices for most of our core commodities, drove our positive results this year.\n\n## US$ 78.1 bn\n\nOur total FY2022 economic contribution\n\n## US$ 17.3 bn\n\nTax, royalty and other payments to governments in FY2022\n\n## 325 US cents\n\nShareholder dividends per share\n\n48.7 per cent\n\nUnderlying return on capital employed\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur operational performance, combined with higher prices for most of our core commodities, drove underlying EBITDA (excluding Petroleum) up 16 per cent to US$40.6 billion, at a record margin of 65 per cent. Underlying attributable profit increased to US$21.3 billion (for continuing operations)\n\nExcluding Petroleum, underlying EBITDA was up 16 per cent to US$40.6 billion at a record margin of 65 per cent. Underlying attributable profit increased to US$21.3 billion (for continuing operations).\n\nThe shareholder dividend for the first half was 150 US cents per share. Combined with 175 US cents per share in the second half, the total return to shareholders in FY2022 was a record US$16.4 billion, which represents a 77 per cent payout ratio. We also distributed US$19.6 billion as an in specie dividend through the merger of our Petroleum business with Woodside.\n\nBHP's total direct economic contribution in FY2022 was US$78.1 billion. This includes payments to suppliers, wages and benefits for around 80,000 employees and contractors, dividends, taxes, royalties and voluntary investment in social projects across the communities where we operate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nIn FY2022, our tax, royalty and other payments to governments totalled US$17.3 billion. Of this, 77.5 per cent or US$13.4 billion was paid in Australia. During the last decade, we paid US$90.5 billion globally in taxes, royalties and other payments, including US$70 billion (approximately A$90.1 billion) in Australia.\n\nBHP's global adjusted effective tax rate in FY2022 was 32.1 per cent, 1 which is broadly in line with our average adjusted effective tax rate over the past decade of 33.3 per cent. 1 Once royalties are included, our FY2022 rate increases to 38.9 per cent. 1\n\nWe continue to use our Capital Allocation Framework to decide where to direct cash to generate the strongest returns. Over the year, underlying return on capital employed strengthened to 48.7 per cent.\n\nWe are proud of these results, the record shareholder returns, and the economic contribution we have made to the governments and communities where we operate.\n\nThank you for your continued support.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDavid Lamont\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\n- 1 Presented on a Total operations basis.\n\n<!-- image -->",

exceptional items. |         | Underlying EBITDA is used to help  assess current operational profitability  excluding the impacts of sunk costs   (i.e. depreciation from initial investment).  It is a measure that management uses  internally to assess the performance  of the Group's segments and make  decisions on the allocation of resources. |          | Net operating cash flows provide  insights into how we are managing  costs and increasing productivity  across BHP.                                                                                                                                        | Underlying return on capital employed  is an indicator of the Group's capital  efficiency.

Attributable profit of US$30.9 billion includes an exceptional gain of US$7.1 billion (after tax), compared to an attributable profit of US$11.3 billion including an exceptional loss of US$5.8 billion (after tax) in the prior period. The FY2022 exceptional gain includes a US$1.1 billion exceptional loss related to Continuing operations comprising of Samarco dam failure impacts, corporate structure unification costs and US deferred tax asset impairments partially offset by the net gain on disposal of BMC. The net gain on merger of our Petroleum business with Woodside is included as an exceptional item related to Discontinued operations included within Profit/(loss) after taxation from Discontinued operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on Exceptional items\n\nrefer to Financial Statements note 3 'Exceptional items' and Financial Statements note 27 'Discontinued operations'.\n\nRevenue of US$65.1 billion increased by US$8.2 billion, or 14 per cent from FY2021. This increase was mainly due to higher average realised prices for metallurgical coal, thermal coal, copper and nickel, partially offset by lower average realised prices for iron ore.\n\nLower volumes were experienced across the Group's portfolio due to COVID-19 impacts, the planned major smelter maintenance campaign at Olympic Dam and lower feed grade at Escondida and Spence. Volume decline was partially offset by higher concentrate sales at Spence reflecting the continued ramp up of the Spence Growth Option.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor information on our average realised prices and production of our commodities refer to OFR 10.\n\nTotal expenses excluding net finance costs of US$32.4 billion increased by US$1.5 billion, or 5 per cent from FY2021. This included higher raw materials and consumables of US$1.1 billion due to South Flank operational ramp up and higher input prices mainly due to higher diesel and acid prices, higher royalties of US$0.9 billion mainly driven by prices for metallurgical coal and thermal coal and US$0.7 billion third-party purchases mainly due to higher nickel prices. Higher depreciation and amortisation expense of US$0.6 billion reflected the commissioning of South Flank, Spence Growth Option, and the completion of the major smelter maintenance at Olympic Dam. The increase also included US$0.4 billion of costs related to corporate structure unification. This was partly offset by lower impairments of US$2.0 billion mainly due to Potash and NSWEC asset impairment charges in the prior period.\n\n## Principal factors that affect Underlying EBITDA\n\nLoss from equity accounted investments, related\n\nimpairments and expenses of US$19 million decreased by US$0.9 billion from FY2021. The decrease was primarily related to a lower increase in the Samarco Dam failure provision compared to FY2021 and US$0.5 billion impairment of Cerrej\u00f3n in FY2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the total impact of the Samarco dam failure provision and impairment charges connected with equity accounted investments, refer to Financial Statements note 3 'Exceptional items' and Financial Statements note 13 'Impairment of noncurrent assets' respectively.\n\nNet finance costs of US$1.0 billion decreased by US$0.3 billion, or 21 per cent from FY2021. This was mainly due to premiums of US$395 million paid as part of the multi-currency hybrid debt repurchase programs completed during FY2021.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on net finance costs refer to Financial Statements note 22 'Net finance costs'.\n\nTotal taxation expense of US$10.7 billion increased by US$0.1 billion from FY2021. The increase is primarily due to higher profits from higher prices offset by FY2021 reduction of US tax credits related to Chilean taxes and tax losses assessed as not recoverable not repeating.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on income tax expense refer to Financial Statements note 6 'Income tax expense'.\n\nThe following table and commentary describes the impact of the

Higher costs at Spence due to a ramp-up of concentrate volumes, and a  prior year one-off gain due to the cancellation of power contracts at Escondida and Spence.

Woodside has subsequently acquired the entire share capital of BHP Petroleum International Pty Ltd (BHP Petroleum) in exchange for new Woodside ordinary shares.\n\nWhile the merger had an economic effective date of 1 July 2021, the Group continued to control the Petroleum assets and carry on business in the normal course for 11 months until 1 June 2022 (Completion Date). As such, the Group recognises its share of revenue, expenses, net finance costs and associated income tax expense related to the discontinued operation until the Completion Date.\n\nAll income and expense items relating to the Petroleum Discontinued Operation have been\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nremoved from the individual line items in the Consolidated Income Statement. The post-tax loss of the Petroleum Discontinued Operation is presented as a single amount in the line item titled 'Profit/(loss) after taxation from Discontinued operations'.\n\nPetroleum's contribution to BHP's 2022 financial results comprised a US$2.5 billion profit after taxation.\n\nAs consideration for the sale of BHP Petroleum, the Group received 914,768,948 newly issued Woodside ordinary shares at Completion Date. On the Completion Date, the Group paid a fully franked in specie dividend in the form of Woodside shares to eligible BHP shareholders. Eligible BHP shareholders received one Woodside share for every 5.5340 BHP shares they held on the Group's register at the record date of 26 May 2022. As part of completion and in order to reflect the economic effective date, the\n\nGroup made a net cash payment of US$0.7 billion to Woodside in addition to US$0.4 billion in cash that was left in the BHP Petroleum bank accounts to fund ongoing operations. The total cash transfer of US$1.1 billion reflects the net cash flows generated by BHP Petroleum between 1 July 2021 and Completion Date adjusted for dividends Woodside would have paid on the newly issued Woodside ordinary shares, had the merger completed on 1 July 2021. The net cash completion payment to Woodside is subject to a customary post-completion review, which may result in an adjustment to the amount paid. The merger generated a net gain after tax of US$8.2 billion that has been included in the line item titled 'Profit/(loss) after taxation from Discontinued operations' and treated as an exceptional item.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information refer to Financial Statements note 27 'Discontinued operations'.\n\n## Cash flow\n\nThe following table provides a summary of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement contained in Financial Statements 1.4, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents.\n\n| Year ended 30 June                                                                | 2022  US$M   | 2021  US$M  Restated   | 2020  US$M  Restated   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Net operating cash flows from Continuing operations                               | 29,285       | 25,883                 | 14,685                 |\n| Net operating cash flows from Discontinued operations                             | 2,889        | 1,351                  | 1,021                  |\n| Net operating cash flows                                                          | 32,174       | 27,234                 | 15,706                 |\n| Net investing cash flows from Continuing operations                               | (4,973)      | (6,325)                | (6,583)                |\n| Net investing cash flows from Discontinued operations                             | (904)        | (1,520)                | (1,033)                |\n| Net cash completion payment on merger of Petroleum with Woodside                  | (683)        | -                      | -                      |\n| Cash and cash equivalents disposed on merger of Petroleum with Woodside           | (399)        | -                      | -                      |\n| Net investing cash flows                                                          | (6,959)      | (7,845)                | (7,616)                |\n| Net financing cash flows from Continuing operations                               | (22,734)     | (17,884)               | (9,713)                |\n| Net financing cash flows from Discontinued operations                             | (33)         | (38)                   | (39)                   |\n| Net financing cash flows                                                          | (22,767)     | (17,922)               | (9,752)                |\n| Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents                              | 2,448        | 1,467                  | (1,662)                |\n| Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents from Continuing operations   | 1,578        | 1,674                  | (1,611)                |\n| Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents from Discontinued operations | 1,952        | (207)                  | (51)                   |\n| Net cash completion payment on merger of Petroleum with Woodside                  | (683)        | -                      | -                      |\n| Cash and cash equivalents disposed on merger of Petroleum with Woodside           | (399)        | -                      | -                      |\n\nNet operating cash inflows from Continuing operations of US$29.3 billion increased by US$3.4 billion. This reflects higher net commodity prices, favourable foreign exchange and strong underlying operational performance partially offset by COVID-19 impacts.\n\nNet investing cash outflows from Continuing operations of US$5.0 billion decreased by US$1.4 billion. This is primarily due to net proceeds received of US$1.3 billion, including adjustment for working capital, related to the sale of BHP's 80 per cent interest in BMC to Stanmore Resources Limited completed in the current period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information and a breakdown of capital and exploration expenditure on a commodity basis refer to OFR 10.\n\nNet financing cash outflows from Continuing operations of US$22.7 billion increased by US$4.9 billion. This increase reflects higher dividends paid to BHP shareholders of US$10.0 billion offset by lower net repayments of interest bearing liabilities of US$5.6 billion\n\nmainly due to bond maturity payments and early repayment of hybrid bonds executed in the FY2021 year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information, refer to Financial Statements note 20 'Net debt'.\n\nNet cash flows from Discontinued operations relate to the Group's Petroleum business that was merged with Woodside on 1 June 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further information, refer to Financial Statements note 27 'Discontinued operations'.\n\nUnderlying return on capital employed (ROCE) of 48.7 per cent increased by 16.2 percentage points (FY2021: 32.5 per cent) reflecting the significant increase in profit after taxation excluding net finance costs and exceptional items of US$6.4 billion. The increase is also due to the disposal of the Group's Petroleum business and BMC reducing average capital employed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on Assets under Construction refer to Financial Statements note 11 'Property, plant and equipment'.\n\n## 4.4 Debt and sources of liquidity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur policies on debt and liquidity management have the following objectives:\n\n- -  a strong balance sheet through the cycle\n- -  diversification of funding sources\n- -  maintain borrowings and excess cash predominantly in US dollars\n\n## Interest bearing liabilities, net debt and gearing\n\nAt the end of FY2022, Interest bearing liabilities were US$16.4 billion (FY2021: US$21.0 billion) and Cash and cash equivalents were US$17.2 billion (FY2021: US$15.2 billion). This resulted in Net debt 1 of US$0.3 billion, which represented a decrease of US$3.8 billion compared with the net debt position at 30 June 2021. This was primarily due to significant operating cash flows generated from strong coal and copper prices and reliable operating performance which more than offset the payment",

The commodities produced by our Minerals Australia assets are transported by rail and road to port and exported to our global customers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOperating and Financial Review\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Iron Ore\n\n## Western Australia Iron Ore\n\n## Overview\n\nWestern Australia Iron Ore (WAIO) is an integrated system of four processing hubs and five open-cut operational mines in the Pilbara region of northern Western Australia, connected by more than 1,000 kilometres of rail infrastructure and port facilities.\n\nWAIO's Pilbara reserve base is relatively concentrated, allowing development through integrated mining hubs connected to the mines and satellite orebodies by conveyors or spur lines. This approach seeks to maximise the value of installed infrastructure by using the same processing plant and rail infrastructure for several orebodies.\n\nOre is crushed, beneficiated (where necessary)\n\nand blended at the processing hubs - Mt Newman operations (which has our beneficiation plant), Yandi, Mining Area C and Jimblebar - to create lump and fines products that are transported along the Port Hedland-Mt Newman rail line to the Finucane Island and Nelson Point port facilities at Port Hedland.\n\nThere are four main WAIO joint ventures (JVs): Mt Newman, Yandi, Mt Goldsworthy (which includes the new South Flank mining area) and Jimblebar. BHP's interest in each is 85 per cent, with Mitsui and ITOCHU owning the remaining 15 per cent. The joint ventures are unincorporated, except Jimblebar.\n\nBHP, Mitsui, ITOCHU and POSCO are also participants in the POSMAC JV. BHP's interest in POSMAC is 65 per cent. The ore from the POSMAC JV is sold to the main joint ventures.\n\nAll ore is transported on the Mt Newman JV and Mt Goldsworthy JV rail lines. The Nelson Point port facility is owned by the Mt Newman JV and the Finucane Island facility is owned by the Mt Goldsworthy JV. On 7 September 2021, BHP received regulatory approval to increase its export capacity at WAIO's Port Hedland operations up to 330 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) (100 per cent basis) subject to the outcomes of a standard\n\nappeals process. We are assessing 330 Mtpa expansion alternatives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur near-term focus remains on sustainable production of 290 Mtpa of iron ore in the short term. Successful tie-in of capital projects, including the port debottlenecking project, is expected to enable growth in excess of 300 Mtpa in the medium term.\n\n## Key developments in FY2022\n\nWAIO's production of 249 million tonnes (Mt) or 283 Mt on a 100 per cent basis was in line with the prior period, primarily reflecting continued strong supply chain performance and favourable weather compared to the prior period, offset by the impacts of temporary labour constraints relating to COVID-19 and planned major maintenance including the Jimblebar train load out and car dumper one. Our preventative maintenance programs continue to underpin the strength of the WAIO supply chain, delivering increased car dumper, reclaimer and ship loader availability year-on-year and enabling record sales volumes of 284 Mt (100 per cent basis).\n\nSouth Flank ramp up to full production capacity of 80 Mtpa (100 per cent basis) is ahead of schedule with an average rate of 67 Mtpa achieved in the June 2022 quarter contributing to record production from the Mining Area C hub and record lump sales in FY2022. Yandi continues its end-of-life ramp-down as South Flank continues to ramp up. Yandi is expected to provide supply chain flexibility with a lower level of production to continue for a few years.\n\nTesting of two new automated shiploaders has commenced at our Port Hedland operations. This project is utilising 3D laser technology, which is expected to support the full automation of WAIO's eight shiploaders by CY2023. Together with planned autonomous haulage rollouts at both South Flank and Newman West, these initiatives are expected to deliver significant safety, production and cost improvements as well as new job and development opportunities for our people.",

It comprises underground and surface operations, and is a fully integrated processing facility from ore to metal.\n\nOre mined underground is hauled by an automated train system to crushing, storage and ore hoisting facilities or trucked directly to the surface.\n\nOlympic Dam has a fully integrated metallurgical complex with a grinding and concentrating circuit, a hydrometallurgical plant incorporating solvent extraction circuits for copper and uranium, a copper smelter, a copper refinery, including an electro-refinery and an electrowinning-refinery, and a recovery circuit for precious metals.\n\n## Key developments in FY2022\n\nOlympic Dam copper production decreased by 33 per cent to 138 kilotonnes (kt) primarily as a result of a major smelter maintenance campaign (SCM21) completed in January 2022 which was delayed due to COVID-19 impacts on the availability of the workforce. Near-record production in the June 2022 quarter followed the successful ramp up of the smelter to full capacity in April 2022. Average copper grade of 2.14 per cent was achieved in FY2022 as the majority of material mined is from the Southern Mine Area, investment in which over the past few years enabled strong underground mine performance and a stable ore blend to be delivered to the processing plant. The maintenance campaign included the rebuild of the flash furnace and its ancillary equipment, and refurbishment of the acid plant, which has resulted in significant plant improvements. Short-term focus is on delivering operational stability and improved production performance, through debottlenecking existing facilities.\n\nIn February 2022, to support future secure and sustainable water sources for regional South\n\nAustralia, Olympic Dam entered a Memorandum of Understanding with the South Australian Government, SA Water and OZ Minerals to progress a business case to examine the building of a desalination plant and pipeline. Olympic Dam has also entered into a renewable energy supply arrangement to enable the asset to draw energy supplies from a solar-wind hybrid plant to reduce the Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from its electricity consumption by 2025. In FY2022, Olympic Dam became the first Australian copper mine to be awarded the Copper Mark, an international accreditation that recognises responsible production practice.\n\nThe Oak Dam exploration program is continuing next stage resource definition drilling with six drill rigs now active on site, an increase from two drill rigs previously, after commencing the program in May 2021. This program is focused on resource definition and potential development pathways.\n\n.\n\n## Coal\n\n## BHP Mitsubishi Alliance\n\n## Overview\n\nBHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA) (BHP ownership: 50 per cent) operates seven metallurgical coal mines - Goonyella Riverside, Broadmeadow, Daunia, Peak Downs, Saraji, Blackwater and Caval Ridge in the Bowen Basin, Queensland. With the exception of the Broadmeadow underground longwall operation, BMA's mines are open cut. A small proportion of BMA's production is sold as energy coal. BMA has access to infrastructure, including a modern, multi-user rail network and owns and operates its own coal-loading terminal at Hay Point, near Mackay. BMA has contracted capacity at two other multi-user port facilities - the Port of Gladstone (RG Tanna Coal Terminal) and Dalrymple Bay Coal Terminal (DBCT). Following BHP's divestment of BHP Mitsui Coal Pty Ltd (BMC), BMA no longer has contracted access to BMC's port allocations at DBCT and North Queensland Export Terminal (NQXT).\n\n## Key developments in FY2022\n\nBMA production decreased by 9 per cent to 29 Mt or 58 Mt on a 100 per cent basis.\n\nSignificant wet weather impacts across most BMA operations and labour constraints, including COVID-19 related absences, which impacted stripping and mine productivity, more than offset record production at the Broadmeadow mine.\n\nFollowing the automation of Daunia's truck fleet in November 2021, the automation of Goonyella's pre-strip truck fleet was completed in March 2022 with the Goonyella coal truck fleet expected to be fully autonomous by the end of December 2022.\n\nDuring the year, BMA commenced a project for the fabrication and installation of a new berth superstructure and shiploader at Hay Point Coal Terminal, with a focus on improving the facility's operational resilience to withstand significant weather events and increasing its throughput capacity.\n\nIn response to regular wet weather events, BMA is continuing to implement a range of wet weather mitigation measures which are aimed at improving the ability to operate in adverse weather conditions. These measures include using drone mapping and rain on grid modelling to manage surface water flows to less impactful areas, improved road preparation and the use of nitrogen filled tyres to enable operation in lightning conditions.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the change to the Queensland royalty regime from 1 July 2022, we will assess the impact on BMA economic reserves and mine lives, as well as the impact on production, jobs and the communities of Central Queensland. This further cost pressure is expected to discourage investment, operational growth, job creation and local business spending across the state.",

        "page_content": "New South Wales Energy Coal\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\nNew South Wales Energy Coal (NSWEC) (BHP ownership: 100 per cent) comprises the Mt Arthur Coal open-cut energy coal mine in the Hunter Valley. It has access to infrastructure in the Hunter Region, including a multi-user rail network and coal loading terminal access at the Port of Newcastle through Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group (BHP ownership: 28 per cent) and Port Waratah Coal Services.\n\n## Key developments in FY2022\n\nNSWEC production decreased by 4 per cent to 14 Mt primarily reflecting lower volumes due to an increased proportion of washed coal to capitalise on higher margins for higher quality coals, COVID-19 related labour constraints which impacted stripping performance and mine productivity and wet weather. Higher-quality coals made up almost 90 per cent of sales compared to approximately 60 per cent of sales in the prior year, generating a price premium of nearly 150 per cent between high-quality and lower-quality coals in FY2022.\n\nOn 16 June 2022, we announced that we will retain NSWEC in our portfolio, seek the relevant approvals to continue mining beyond its current mining consent that expires in CY2026 and proceed with a managed process to cease mining at the asset by the end of FY2030. A review was announced in August 2020 and a trade sale process for NSWEC was conducted, however the process did not result in a viable offer. Our assessment of the resource economics, geotechnical profile and future investment requirements led us to determine that continued mining in the near term and moving to closure in FY2030 provides the optimal financial outcome when compared to alternate options. Continuation of mining to the end of FY2030 is expected to afford eight years to work with our people, state and federal governments and local communities in the Hunter Valley region on an equitable transition approach that supports longterm community sustainability.\n\nOperating and Financial Review\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## BHP Mitsui Coal divestment\n\nOn 3 May 2022, we completed the divestment of our 80 per cent interest in BMC, a metallurgical coal joint venture in Queensland operated by BMC, to Stanmore Resources Limited. Stanmore Resources paid US$1.1 billion cash consideration at completion plus a preliminary completion adjustment of approximately US$200 million for working capital. The sum of US$100 million cash remains payable to BHP on 3 November 2022, with potential for an additional amount of up to US$150 million in a price-linked earnout payable to BHP in CY2024. The total cash consideration for the transaction is up to US$1.35 billion plus the final completion adjustment amount.\n\n## Nickel\n\n## Nickel West\n\n## Overview\n\nNickel West (BHP ownership: 100 per cent) is a fully integrated nickel business located in Western Australia, with three streams of concentrate. It comprises open-cut and underground mines, concentrators, a smelter and refinery. Nickel West owns the majority of tenements of known resource in the AgnewWiluna basin in Western Australia.\n\nDisseminated sulphide ore is mined at the Mt Keith open-pit operation and Mt Keith Satellite mine (Yakabindie) and crushed and processed onsite to produce nickel concentrate. Nickel sulphide ore is mined at the Cliffs and Leinster underground mines and processed through a concentrator and dryer at Leinster. A concentrator plant in Kambalda processes ore and concentrate purchased from third parties.\n\nThe three streams feed the Kalgoorlie nickel smelter, which uses a flash furnace to produce nickel matte. The Kwinana nickel refinery then turns this into nickel powder, briquettes and nickel sulphate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key developments in FY2022\n\nNickel West production decreased by 14 per cent to 77 kt primarily due to the significant impacts of COVID-19 related labour absences and workforce shortages, and unplanned downtime at the oxygen plant leading to a 15day smelter outage in the June 2022 quarter.\n\nThe nickel sulphate plant at the Kwinana nickel refinery has been commissioned, with first saleable production achieved in the December 2021 quarter. The plant is expected to produce approximately 100 kilotonnes per annum (ktpa) of nickel sulphate for the lithium-ion battery industry.\n\nLeinster B11, BHP's first block cave, continues development whilst producing. Ore is being hoisted to the Leinster concentrator and the undercut and drawbell development essential to this mining method are expected to be complete in CY2023.\n\nNickel West expanded its commitment to sourcing renewable energy through the execution of power purchase agreements for 100 per cent output of the 75MW Flat Rocks Wind Farm and for 50 per cent of the 100MW Merredin Solar Farm. The combined output from these two renewable farms is expected to generate the equivalent of greater than 100 per cent of the current power requirements of Nickel West's Kalgoorlie nickel smelter, Kambalda nickel concentrator and Kwinana nickel refinery from CY2024.\n\nTransAlta has begun construction at the Northern Goldfields Solar Project, a large-scale, off-grid mining solar and battery energy storage systems, to help power Nickel West's Mt Keith and Leinster operations. The solar project due to be commissioned in early 2023, is expected to reduce Scope 2 emissions by 12 per cent at these operations.",

Despite these challenges, Escondida achieved record material mined for the 2022 financial year and near-record concentrator throughput of 367 ktpd.\n\n## Pampa Norte\n\n## Overview\n\nPampa Norte (BHP ownership: 100 per cent) consists of two assets in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile - Spence and Cerro Colorado.\n\nSpence produces copper cathodes and copper concentrate, with by-products including gold, silver and molybdenum.\n\nCerro Colorado produces copper cathodes. Its current environmental licence expires at the end of CY2023.\n\n## Key developments in FY2022\n\nPampa Norte copper production increased by 29 per cent to 281 kt reflecting the ramp up of the Spence Growth Option, partially offset by the impact of lower cathode production as a result of a 14 per cent decline in Pampa Norte stacking feed grade. The molybdenum plant at Spence produced and sold its first batch of molybdenum concentrate during Q4 FY2022. During May 2022, the new copper concentrator in Spence was inaugurated. The concentrator operates on desalinated seawater and is powered from renewable sources, and will allow the operation to be extended by 50 years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Potash\n\n## Jansen Potash Project\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Jansen Potash Project (BHP ownership: 100 per cent) is located about 140 kilometres east of Saskatoon, Canada.\n\nJansen's large resource provides the opportunity to develop the project in stages, with Jansen Stage 1 (Jansen S1) expected to produce approximately 4.35 Mt of potash per annum on completion in CY2027 and sequenced brownfield expansions of up to 12 Mtpa (approximately 4 Mtpa per stage).\n\nBHP holds mineral leases covering around 9,600 square kilometres in the Saskatchewan potash basin.\n\n## Key developments in FY2022\n\nExcavation and lining of the production and service shafts was completed in June 2022.\n\nOn 17 August 2021, BHP approved US$5.7 billion (C$7.5 billion) in capital expenditure for Jansen S1. Jansen S1 includes the design, engineering and construction of an underground potash mine and surface infrastructure, including a processing facility, a product storage building and rail infrastructure. Jansen S1 product is intended to be shipped to export markets through Westshore, in Delta, British Columbia. The project includes funding for the required port and rail infrastructure. First ore is targeted in CY2027, with construction expected to take approximately six years, followed by a ramp-up period of two years.\n\nOpportunities to bring forward Jansen S1 continue to be assessed.

Pellets are independently marketed by Samarco and sold to customers around the world.\n\n## Key developments in FY2022\n\nSamarco produced 4 million tonnes of pellets and ore fines in FY2022 (BHP Share), operating at 26 per cent of its total 26 Mtpa production capacity following the resumption of operations in December 2020. Studies to increase production to 100 per cent by FY2029 are progressing.\n\nThe progressive decharacterisation of Samarco's\n\nupstream tailings dam structures is on track and planned to be completed by FY2029. These structures have been certified by independent third parties as stable, are following local stability and monitoring requirements, and have not received tailings since 2015.\n\nBroader studies to unlock solutions for Samarco to operate without tailings dams beyond FY2030 are continuing.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the Fund\u00e3o dam failure and the response refer to OFR 8.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 5.3 Commercial\n\nBHP's Commercial function seeks to maximise commercial and social value while minimising costs across the end-to-end supply chain.\n\nThe function is organised around the following core activities in our value chain, supported by credit and market risk management and strategy and planning activities.\n\n## Sales and Marketing\n\nSales and Marketing connects BHP's resources to market through commercial expertise, sales and operations planning, customer insights and proactive risk management. It presents a single face to markets across multiple assets, with a view to realising maximum value for our products and supporting sustainability initiatives in our downstream supply chain.\n\n## Maritime and Supply Chain Excellence\n\nMaritime and Supply Chain Excellence manages BHP's enterprise-wide maritime transportation strategy and the chartering of ocean freight to meet BHP's inbound and outbound transportation needs. It focuses on supply chain excellence and sourcing cost-efficient marine freight in addition to partnering within the maritime ecosystem to reduce the GHG emissions intensity of BHP-chartered shipping of our products. It also seeks to manage supply chain risk by vetting the safety performance of the ships loading BHP cargo.\n\n## Procurement\n\nOur global Procurement team connects asset teams and suppliers to procure the goods and services used by our projects, operated assets and functions globally. Procurement partners with our suppliers to optimise equipment performance, reduce operating costs, optimise working capital and generate social value. Through innovation we work with suppliers to reduce the GHG emissions intensity of inbound goods and services and the operational GHG emissions of our operated assets. Procurement manages supply chain",

The team works with our Procurement, Maritime and Supply Chain Excellence, and Sales and Marketing sub-functions to help optimise end-to-end commercial value, and with the Portfolio Strategy and Development and External Affairs functions to identify and respond to long-run strategic changes in our operating environment.\n\n## Global Business Services\n\nGlobal Business Services unites shared services and repeatable process activity across the Group into a single operation. Commencing operation in FY2022 with the BHP Operating System and with process transformation capabilities at its core, it has the mandate to aggregate, operate and improve end-to-end processes on behalf of assets and functions to drive operational excellence.\n\n## 6  People and culture\n\n## Our employees and contractors, around 80,000 globally, are the foundation of our business.\n\nWe aim to attract, recruit, empower and retain the best people.\n\nTo enable our people to perform at their best, safety is our highest priority and we invest in technology and innovative and effective ways to manage risk, streamline processes and improve productivity. We offer competitive remuneration and invest in development programs to build capability and improve performance.\n\n## Developing our capabilities and an enabled culture\n\nTo drive continuous improvement, we respect people's differences and encourage self-accountability, a hunger to learn and a commercial mindset.\n\nOne of the ways we seek to achieve this is by applying the BHP Operating System (BOS) practices to help build leader capability. BOS is a way of leading and working that focuses on the safety of our people, value for our customers, setting clear goals and measuring progress and a mindset of zero waste. In FY2022, we continued to train our leaders through BOS learning academies to improve operational capability and culture, with more than 3,000 people leaders participating.\n\nThree times a year we ask our employees and contractors about their experiences working with BHP via a short Engagement and Perception Survey. After each survey, our team leaders assess what is working well, what they can learn from others and take action to address improvement areas. Despite significant absences and workplace disruptions caused by COVID-19, we maintained a high response rate of 82 per cent of employees in March 2022 (81 per cent in February 2021) and achieved a strong engagement score of 82 per cent favourable (84 per cent in February 2021). In particular, 80 per cent of our employees and 88 per cent of our contractors (from 7,932 responses) would recommend BHP as a great place to work, which places us in the top third of global organisations as benchmarked by Qualtrics.\n\nIn FY2022, we transformed our approach to developing frontline leadership with the launch of BHP Leadership Programs for supervisors, superintendents and managers. Through a combination of assessment, workshops, experiences and coaching, the suite of programs is designed to identify and develop leaders and prepare them to take on greater responsibility. We anticipate more than 1,000 leaders each year will develop their ability through these programs to lead inclusively, ethically and through complexity as they play their critical role to deliver continuous improvement.\n\nOur Operations Services business unit provides maintenance and production services across our Minerals Australia assets. It employs people on a permanent basis and supports skills building through a structured coaching and in-field training program designed to enable our workforce to deliver consistent equipment operation and maintenance that balances safety, maximum productivity and equipment reliability. Operations Services had more than 3,500 employees as at 30 June 2022 and is expected to continue to grow.\n\nTo help bolster Australia's skills base and create new career pathways into the mining sector, the BHP FutureFit Academy located in Perth, Western Australia and Mackay, Queensland, provides a pathway to join Minerals Australia through an accredited maintenance and production traineeship or a trade apprenticeship. Once trained and qualified, employees move to one of our Australian operations. The FutureFit Academy training includes the skills required for an increasingly technological and digitised world and focuses on our safety, respectful behaviour, culture, and productive ways of working. This helps FutureFit graduates to be 'BHP site ready' when they graduate. In FY2022, the FutureFit Academy trained more than 417 apprentices and trainees, with 175 graduating. In FY2023, the FutureFit Academy is expanding the program to include Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO) and Nickel West. New curricula will be offered, including belt splicing, electrical and auto electrical. The belt splicing program will commence at Newman in August 2022. For more information on BHP's FutureFit Academy see our case study at bhp. com/people.\n\nIn Minerals Americas, the focus has been on implementing an integrated approach to capability building through defining frameworks and programs for workforce upskilling and reskilling as we transition into autonomous operations at our operated assets. Early career programs (for graduates and trainees in roles such as operators, maintainers, supervisors and engineers) are also a key area to build a sustainable base of diverse talent with the required capabilities. We will also continue building partnerships with training and learning institutions to develop those identified capabilities for the future.\n\nThe talent market is dynamic and increasingly competitive. We continue to work on our attraction and retention strategies through strategic workforce planning, talent acquisition, inclusion and diversity, internal talent management, employee mobility and our total value proposition.\n\nWe believe we are strongly and competitively placed in the market and regularly review our positioning and total reward strategies, with culture being our competitive edge. We have deployed new proactive recruitment methods, including recruitment marketing and talent pooling, strategies for securing critical skills and made improvements to our recruitment processes to increase speed while maintaining our focus on the suitability of candidates.\n\n## Inclusion and diversity\n\nWe believe that an inclusive and diverse workforce promotes safety, productivity and wellbeing, and underpins our ability to attract and retain employees. Our systems, processes and practices are designed to support fair treatment for our people.\n\nOur Inclusion and Diversity Position Statement confirms our vision, commitment and contributions to inclusion and diversity. We have further work to do to achieve this goal.\n\nOur strategy is to focus on attracting and retaining a workforce that is truly representative of society. We intend to do this by addressing the barriers and impacts of bias and racism experienced by people within underrepresented groups by listening to their experience combined with insights from our engagement surveys and the recently deployed self-identification survey, 'Tell Us About You'. So far, around 10,000 people have confidentially shared with us information about themselves (a 22 per cent response rate), which is a good starting point and we expect to see participation grow over time. Our intention is to contrast this data with national/regional census data over time to measure how diverse we are against the general population.\n\nTo help mitigate gender pay disparities, we have taken steps to reduce potential bias in remuneration at the time of recruitment and we conduct an annual gender pay review, the results of which are reported to the BHP Remuneration Committee.",

At 30 June 2022, women represented 32.3 per cent of our employee workforce, up from 17.6 per cent when we set our aspirational goal. We are confident of achieving gender balance by the end of FY2025.\n\nThe percentage of employees newly hired to work for BHP in FY2022 was 52.7 per cent male and 47.3 per cent female. This is a marked increase on our baseline for our aspirational goal, which was 10.4 per cent female hired in FY2015.\n\nWe also improved our representation of women in leadership by 2.7 percentage points compared to FY2021, with 27.9 per cent female people leaders at the end of FY2022.\n\nTo further accelerate female representation in FY2022, we:\n\n- -  continued market mapping to proactively target people or groups of people not actively looking to work for BHP or our industry\n- -  implemented a 'Tell Us About You' survey, our first self-identification survey to measure the rich diversity of our workforce\n- -  integrated inclusive leadership capabilities at all levels of our leadership learning curriculum\n- -  embedded the Ways of Working Framework to guide employees and leaders to 'Work where you get great outcomes'\n- -  launched Phase 3 of the Respectful Behaviour campaign to reinforce our zero tolerance of sexual harassment, racism and bullying including global 'Stop for Safety' sessions for all employees and contractors\n\nThe table below shows the gender composition of our employees, senior leaders and the Board over the last three financial years 1,2\n\n|                                          | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Female employees                         | 12,674 | 11,868 | 9,961  |\n| Male employees                           | 26,536 | 27,953 | 27,557 |\n| Female people leaders                    | 1,695  | 1,439  | 1,157  |\n| Male people leaders                      | 4,380  | 4,276  | 4,002  |\n| Female Executive Leadership Team members | 5      | 5      | 4      |\n| Male Executive Leadership Team members   | 5      | 5      | 6      |\n| Female Board members                     | 4      | 4      | 3      |\n| Male Board members                       | 8      | 8      | 9      |\n\n- 1 Based on a 'point-in-time' snapshot of employees as at 30 June 2022, as used in internal management reporting for the purposes of monitoring progress against our goals.

We recognise, as part of our Global Indigenous Peoples Strategy, that we can contribute to the economic empowerment of Indigenous peoples through providing opportunities for employment, training, procurement and by supporting Indigenous enterprises.\n\nWe have set targets to increase Indigenous employment in our Minerals Australia operations, Minerals Americas operations in Chile and our Jansen Potash Project and operations in Canada.\n\nIn our Minerals Australia operations, we have achieved the Australian Indigenous employment target of 8 per cent ahead of schedule (8.3 per cent of employees at 30 June 2022) through significant effort with targeted Indigenous recruitment campaigns, a tailored application process focused on the cultural needs of applicants and BHP's commitment to the regional communities where we operate. A key focus in Australia now is the retention and development of our Indigenous workforce. New targets have been set and engagement strategies are being developed as part of BHP's next Minerals Australia Reconciliation Action Plan.\n\nFrom FY2023 the targets for Indigenous employee representation are 9.7 per cent by the end of FY2027 in our Minerals Australia operations, 10 per cent by the end of FY2025 in our Minerals Americas operations in Chile and 20 per cent by the end of FY2026 in our Jansen Potash Project and operations in Canada.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor information on our 2030 goals related to Indigenous partnerships refer to OFR 7.13.\n\n## LGBT+ inclusion\n\nOur LGBT+ ally employee inclusion group, Jasper, established in 2017, is a natural extension of our inclusion and diversity aspirations and reflects our value of Respect under Our Charter .\n\nIts membership base grew to around 2,000 in FY2022, with eight regional chapters globally.\n\nIn FY2022, we continued to close gaps for LGBT+ inclusion, such as releasing guidelines and implementing support for transgender and gender diverse recruitment, and updated our parental leave policy to be more inclusive by making language more gender neutral and ensuring it applies to birth, long-term guardianship and adoption aligned to changes in Australia.\n\n## Flexible working\n\nOur flexible working has evolved throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and we have embedded a hybrid working model for employees in nonoperational roles, allowing office and homebased working arrangements, while requiring 30 to 50 per cent of work to be based in the office, depending on the nature of work.\n\nWe understand many site-based employees are in roles that cannot be performed remotely.

As a result of the COVID-19 restrictions, we implemented controls across our business to reduce the number of workers required onsite and manage planned and unplanned absences, such as temporary remote working arrangements, increased health and safety requirements, asset-based vaccination campaigns, self-testing and office-testing campaigns and hybrid working. In Australia we also introduced vaccination against COVID-19 as a site access requirement after consultation with employees and unions. In Canada, all employees are required to remain fully vaccinated against COVID-19 to perform work at site including a third booster shot.\n\nWith state border closures restricting the mobilisation of employees and contractors to our operating sites in Australia at times during FY2022, changes to rosters and hours of work were made to ensure operational requirements for essential work were met. There has also been a further extension of flexible work options for employees and contractors in Australia in response to government-imposed lockdowns preventing them from attending their normal place of work. Flexible work options, including staggered start times, working from home and adapted working hours were in place across many of our office settings.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor information on the impact of COVID-19 on our workforce refer to OFR 7.6.\n\nMore information on people is available at bhp.com/people.",

We also know our stakeholders and partners are increasingly focused on our sustainability performance and use it as a key determinant in assessing BHP and our industry. We strive to continuously improve and exceed these expectations.\n\nA commitment to sustainability sometimes requires us to make difficult choices and we seek to gain and maintain the support of all our stakeholders and partners as we manage complex issues. We respect the right of every stakeholder and partner to challenge the choices we make and recognise that by listening to their views and concerns BHP becomes a better company.\n\nWe define our approach to sustainability through Our Charter and it is governed through the Our Requirements standards. These standards describe our mandatory minimum performance requirements and provide the foundation to develop and implement management systems at our operated assets.\n\nOur approach to sustainability is overseen by BHP's Board.

The 2030 goals comprise overarching long-term goals across six key focus areas and are underpinned by short-term metrics\n\nand milestones. We are working to embed them through asset plans and capital allocation.\n\nThe key changes compared to the previous five-year sustainability targets include a new time horizon of seven years to align with BHP's 2030 climate change targets and goals and reference timelines set out in global frameworks and agreements, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement, the Convention of Biological Diversity and the Global Goal for Nature. The goals provide opportunities for BHP to engage and work in partnership with others, build capability and co-design approaches to deliver positive outcomes and shared prosperity for people and our planet. They are reinforced by our continued commitment to pursue zero significant health, safety, environment, community or supply chain events and to making a social investment of at least 1 per cent pre-tax profit.\u00b9\n\n- 1 To date, our voluntary social investment has been calculated as 1 per cent of the average of the previous three years' pre-tax profit.

We will seek to understand how impacts may be differently\n- experienced, including for Indigenous peoples, and recognise that plans and solutions must take into account the particular strengths of each community and tackle the unique impacts they experience.\n- -  Recognise that the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development are interrelated - we will aim to avoid or mitigate adverse environmental impacts of change and transitions, while pursuing opportunities to build climate resilience and environmentally sustainable communities.\n\nGiven change and transitions will involve multiple actors, we will seek to be a catalyst to bring people together and use our relationships to advocate for equitable change and transitions in line with the above principles.\n\n- 1 These include our Indigenous Peoples Framework, Social Value Framework, Inclusion and Diversity Statement, Climate Change Strategy, approach to the environment, Closure Strategy, Human Rights Policy Statement, and approach to community engagement.\n\n| Our sustainability approach - TCFD index 1                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Disclosure requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Reference in this Report                       |\n| Governance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                |\n| Disclose the organisation's governance around climate-related risks and opportunities.                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                |\n| a) Describe the board's oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities.                                                                                                                                                                            | OFR 7.8                                        |\n| b) Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.                                                                                                                                                         | OFR 7.8                                        |\n| Strategy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                |\n| Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the  organisation's businesses, strategy, and financial planning where such information is material.                                                             |                                                |\n| a)  Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the organisation has identified over the short, medium, and long term.                                                                                                                          | OFR 7.8                                        |\n| b)  Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organisation's businesses, strategy, and  financial planning.                                                                                                                  | OFR 7.8;

Our sustainability reporting, including on our website and in our ESG Standards and Databook, is prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 2021 Sustainability Reporting Standards, the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) Sustainable Development Framework, the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Metals and Mining standard. It also serves as our UN Global Compact (UNGC) Communication on Progress on implementation of the UNGC Ten Principles and support for its broader development objectives. We have included a summary of our TCFD disclosures in the table below.\n\nThere are also responsible mining and sourcing standards that we commit to voluntarily or as part of our memberships.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information about our implementation of these standards refer to OFR 7.9 Value Chain Sustainability\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 7.2  Our material sustainability issues\n\n## Annual sustainability materiality assessment\n\nEach year we identify the sustainability issues most material to our business and stakeholders by assessing the economic, social, environmental and cultural impact of our activities and business relationships.\n\nIn FY2022, we adopted the approach of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI 3: Material Topics 2021) to consider actual and potential negative and positive impacts of our business in order to determine our material sustainability issues for reporting. In doing so we considered BHP's material risk profile 1 , information recorded in our internal event management system, our social value framework and social investment priorities and a number of other sources. These included issues raised at our Annual General Meetings and through industry sustainability standards and benchmark assessments. We also consult with stakeholders, such as through the BHP Forum on Corporate Responsibility, via ESG investor round tables and advisory groups and with internal stakeholders via focused discussions.\n\nThe material sustainability issues identified through our FY2022 assessment are shown in the table below. These issues are consistent with our FY2021 assessment with the addition of security services, sexual harassment and value chain sustainability.\n\n- 1 'Material' in this context refers to the materiality of a risk under BHP's Risk Framework.

Highlights include three years fatality-free, a reduction in the total number of workers exposed to our most material occupational exposures by 68 per cent, a 15 per cent decrease in operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from our adjusted FY2017 baseline, social investment of US$681.4 million over five years and a 29 per cent reduction in freshwater withdrawal volumes from our adjusted FY2017 baseline.\n\nThe FY2017 baselines and FY2018 - FY2022 data for our occupational exposures, GHG emissions and withdrawal of freshwater have been adjusted for the merger of our Petroleum business with Woodside and divestment of our interest in BHP Mitsui Coal (BMC) in FY2022, (to exclude data related to those operations), together with adjustments made and reported in previous years to ensure ongoing comparability of performance. FY2022 data for safety, social investment and significant community and environmental events includes the operated assets in our Petroleum business up to the date of the merger (1 June 2022) and BMC up to the date of completion of the sale (3 May 2022).",

The highest number of events with potential for one or more fatalities was related to vehicle and mobile equipment accidents. High-potential injury trends remain a primary focus to assess progress against our most important safety objective, eliminating fatalities\n- -  an increase in total recordable injury frequency (TRIF) of 8 per cent from FY2021. This shift was influenced by COVID-19 through an 8 per cent reduction in hours worked between the first and second halves of FY2022. TRIF has decreased by 9 per cent since FY2018. The highest number of injuries was related to slips, trips and falls for both employees and contractors\n- -  a consistent application of field leadership activities, which occurred at a sustainable frequency rate of 9,341 activities per million hours worked with over 1,517,117 activities completed and more than 68,000 employees and contractors participating in the program at least once. Scheduled activities compared to non-scheduled activities increased by 46 per cent from FY2021 and coaching increased by 6 per cent\n- -  one safety fine at our operated assets\n\nOur results were achieved through a sustained focus on improving our management of risk, including through new and existing programs such as:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -  Fatality Elimination Program\n- -  Integrated Contractor Management Program\n- -  Field Leadership Program\n\n## Fatality Elimination Program\n\nIn FY2022, we continued our Fatality Elimination Program (FEL) towards our goal of no fatalities across our business.\n\nFatality elimination is not a new priority for us. We have been seeking to improve our safety performance for many years and have considerably reduced high-potential injuries. However, there continues to be more to do to systematise a common set of controls.\n\n## In FY2022 we:\n\n- -  developed five-year fatality elimination roadmap guidelines, including the recommended sequencing of strengthened controls based on effort, cost and near miss reduction impact\n- -  updated the Our Requirements for Safety standard to reflect FEL deliverables\n- -  created the 'Control Shift' methodology for assets to replicate FEL processes for specific risks not considered within our top 10 risks (i.e. vehicle and mobile equipment, dropped object, electrical, lifting, geotechnical failure, entanglement/crushing, energy release, loss of containment, fire/explosion, fall from height)\n- -  created an online dashboard to enhance local implementation plans, providing global visibility of challenges, similarities and differences, thereby assisting assets with their implementation\n- -  published technical bulletins related to FEL controls to provide detailed implementation guidance based on site experience and lessons learnt\n- -  undertook a human performance benchmarking study to identify the latest developments and best practices in the field of human behaviour\n\n## Performance data - workforce health and safety for FY2022 1\n\n## High-potential injuries 2\n\n| Year ended 30 June      |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| High-potential injuries |     23 |     33 |     42 |\n\n|                                   |   Employees |   Contractors |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------|---------------|\n| High-potential injury frequency 3 |        0.03 |          0.03 |\n\n## Total recordable injury frequency\n\n| Year ended 30 June                  |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total recordable injury frequency 4 |      4 |    3.7 |    4.2 |\n\n|                                     |   Employees |   Contractors |\n|-------------------------------------|-------------|---------------|\n| Total recordable injury frequency 3 |        0.77 |          0.82 |\n\n- 1 Data includes BMC up to the date of completion of the sale (3 May 2022) and operated assets in our Petroleum business up to the date of the merger with Woodside (1 June 2022).\n- 2 High-potential injury includes injuries with fatality potential.

Introduced in FY2020, the program is focused on building long-term mutually beneficial relationships, integrating and simplifying processes and systems, and creating an inclusive, respectful and caring workforce culture. Since its introduction, the program has standardised roles and responsibilities of contract owners and promoted improved partnerships with BHP service providers through the implementation of the Our Requirements for Contractor Management standard for existing and new onsite service contracts.\n\n## In FY2022 we:\n\n- -  developed the scope of work library as an online resource containing best practice examples for different types of contractor engagements\n- -  created contract execution plans as a means of applying the Our Requirements for Contractor Management standard\n- -  established an integration stream ensuring enhancements are holistic and cover functional interactions\n- -  undertook assurance and audit activities across BHP including contractor engagements\n- -  implemented a contractor perception survey that runs in parallel with our internal survey. The survey highlighted some results on the experience of our contractor workforce consistent with the internal survey and other areas of focus\n- -  determined organisational design changes to improve contract ownership and management practices\n- -  commenced deployment of a technology solution which supports an enterprisewide approach to contractor on-boarding and management\n\n## Field Leadership Program\n\nLeaders spending time in the field is vital to maintaining safe operations. Our global Field Leadership Program encourages the workforce to provide feedback to their leaders about safety to reinforce an interdependent culture of safety. It involves leaders engaging with workers in the field to drive a common approach to improving health, safety and environment (HSE) performance. The program helps verify that critical safety controls are in place, being applied and are effective in managing risks that have the potential to result in fatalities.\n\n## In FY2022 we:\n\n- -  enhanced the efficiency and effectiveness of supervisor time in the field by integrating the BHP Operating System (BOS) process confirmation and field leadership planned task observation processes into a planned task confirmation\n- -  continued to improve the quality of field leadership activities by increasing coaching and delivery of field leadership engagements\n- -  conducted field leadership activities to support the verification of risks that have",

Our position on this is clear and aligned to our aspiration of a genderbalanced employee workforce by FY2025. Gender balance in every team and at every level is an important part of our approach to eliminate sexual harassment.\n\nThe Australian Human Rights Commission's most recent national survey on sexual harassment in Australian workplaces has found that 71 per cent of Australians have been sexually harassed in their lifetimes and 39 per cent of Australian women experienced sexual harassment in the workplace in the five years to 2018. The same survey concluded that in the mining industry an estimated 74 per cent of women and 32 per cent of men had experienced workplace sexual harassment in the past five years. Back in 2018, we accepted those findings as true for our industry and for BHP globally, and we have focused on understanding why the behaviours exist, and what we needed to do to urgently address them at BHP.\n\nWe are deeply sorry and apologise unreservedly to those who have experienced, or continue to experience, any form of sexual harassment anywhere at BHP. We recognise the harmful impacts on individuals resulting from these behaviours.\n\nWe understand that it can be difficult for people to come forward to report sexual harassment and thank all of those who have, for their courage in doing so. We are also grateful to our employees and other stakeholders for their insights and suggestions for changes in our workplaces. Their feedback informs our approach. We are determined to make continued progress in eliminating sexual harassment and in ensuring our workplaces are safe and inclusive for everyone.\n\n- 1 'Sexual harassment' is, as defined in the Respect @ Work report, an unwelcome sexual advance, unwelcome request for sexual favours or other unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, which makes a person feel offended, humiliated and/ or intimidated, where a reasonable person would anticipate that reaction in the circumstances. Sexual harassment encompasses a range of conduct including displaying sexually graphic images, sexually suggestive comments, suggestive or inappropriate looks, gestures or staring, nonconsensual touching or acts of a sexual nature and sexual assault.\n- 2 EthicsPoint is our confidential reporting tool. It is accessible to all, including external stakeholders and the public, to report conduct that may be unethical, illegal or inconsistent with Our Code of Conduct .\n- 3 This does not include investigations that are currently in progress.\n\n## Our approach to prevent sexual harassment\n\nIn 2018, we defined sexual harassment as a health and safety risk, to be overseen in the same way as other occupational health and safety risks. This approach provides the right framework for addressing these behaviours, allowing us to apply a systematic, risk-based approach to evaluating and managing the risks. Our approach includes conducting risk assessments to identify scenarios in which sexual harassment risks may arise, their causes and the controls we can implement to prevent them and reduce harm.\n\nAs part of our risk assessment processes, we engaged members of our workforce with experience at site and accommodation villages, and experts in health and safety, harassment and inclusion and diversity. Through this, we identified factors that can contribute to the risk of workplace sexual harassment that are more pronounced in the mining industry, as well as factors that are common across all industries and workplaces. Examples of risks that can be more pronounced in the mining industry include isolated or remote working locations, a largely male-dominated workforce and accommodation villages.\n\nTaking these into account, we identified and developed controls and actions to help prevent sexual harassment and reduce its harmful impacts. Our core controls and areas for action are culture, leadership and training; security measures at accommodation villages; recruitment processes; contractor and third-party engagement; emergency response; traumainformed (wellbeing) care; accessible, confidential reporting and person-centred investigations; and appropriate disciplinary action.\n\n## Reports of sexual harassment\n\nThe reporting rate of sexual harassment at BHP has increased in recent years. We believe this reflects the actions we have taken to increase awareness and promote and centralise reporting and investigations, along with broader societal developments and intolerance of this behaviour. Since October 2020, BHP managers and leaders have been required to enter any serious conduct issues raised directly with them, including sexual harassment, into EthicsPoint 2 (anonymously if requested). This year, 47 per cent of reports received into EthicsPoint have been logged by managers or leaders in accordance with this policy.\n\nDuring FY2022, across BHP's global operations and offices, 103 reported and investigated cases of conduct of sexual harassment were substantiated. 3\n\nOf the 103 substantiated cases:\n\n- -  37 involved non-consensual kissing or touching of a sexual nature, which includes a broad range of behaviour of varying severity. None of these cases involved non-consensual penetration or intercourse, however we recognise that this conduct can occur and has occurred in the past,\n- -  66 involved other forms of sexual harassment, including inappropriate comments of a sexual nature, unwelcome gestures or comments, sending inappropriate text messages or\n- images, or other unwanted advances or invitations,\n- -  Of these 103 substantiated cases, in 101 cases the individual responsible has had their employment terminated (or they have been removed from site if a contractor), they have resigned or are otherwise no longer working at BHP.\n\nIn addition to the matters listed above, in FY2022 87 reports of sexual harassment went through Alternative Resolution Options (AROs). AROs are alternative forms of response and resolution other than investigations, including supported conversations with respondents, additional training, monitoring or awareness raising on BHP's expectations of respectful behaviours in the workplace. This process only occurs where an ARO is proportionate to the nature of the conduct and with the agreement of the impacted person.\n\nWe continue to work with external experts on how best to respond to cases to ensure we have a proportionate approach to reports. We will continue to monitor and review the use of AROs to ensure it is meeting the needs of impacted people where it is used and to improve reporting to support organisational learnings.\n\nWe will continue to encourage reporting and we are committed to taking action. We put the needs of anyone impacted by this behaviour at the forefront of our processes and we are committed to validating, caring for and supporting anyone in our business who is affected by this behaviour. This includes internal practical and wellbeing support mechanisms, support through our tailored Employee Assistance Program and options to access trauma-specific clinical and non-clinical care with experienced clinicians.\n\nWe are committed to working closely with our people, others in industry and other stakeholders to implement the necessary processes and systems designed to ensure our workplaces are safe and inclusive for everyone.\n\n## Actions we are taking\n\n## Oversight\n\nIn FY2022, a Project Management Office (PMO) was established through the office of the CEO to provide central governance over all sexual harassment work. The priority focus areas of that work include driving progress toward gender balance, creating a safe and respectful workplace, building accountability and capability of leaders, upskilling our workforce to be 'active bystanders', enhancing our policies, processes and controls, and providing person-centred and trauma-informed response and support. The PMO reports on progress against implementation of our critical controls and other key focus areas that underpin our overarching sexual harassment prevention strategy to senior management and the Board.\n\n## Security and physical infrastructure\n\nWe have continued to invest in security programs and physical infrastructure designed to prevent and respond to sexual harassment at our accommodation facilities. Our minimum security requirements for all BHP owned and operated accommodation villages include requirements for access controls, village policies and procedures",

We ceased using non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) or imposing confidentiality obligations on complainants in settlement agreements relating to sexual harassment in March 2019 and we do not enforce any NDAs or confidentiality obligations on complainants in historical agreements.\n\nInvestigation of reports of sexual harassment are conducted by our specialised Central Investigation team, which is independent of our other business units. This team includes experts trained in a person-centred, trauma-informed approach to ensure that the impacted person is placed at the centre of all decisions made during the investigation process and to minimise the risk of further harm to that individual.\n\nWe established our global Support Service in FY2022, to provide dedicated, end-to-end case coordination for anyone impacted by sexual harassment, designed to ensure they obtain appropriate support and information. The Support Service can also provide resolution options when an investigation is not wanted by the impacted person or cannot proceed.\n\n## Communication of expectations\n\nOur position on sexual harassment has been reinforced through regular senior leadership communications. These include messages from our CEO, on-site signage regarding our expectations and avenues for support, and we have provided sexual harassment prevention training to BHP line leaders, aimed at setting clear expectations about appropriate conduct and driving consistent disciplinary outcomes. Across June and July 2022, we held Safety Stops specifically focused on sexual harassment, racism and bullying for our teams globally. The stops were intended to build awareness, understanding, and capability, as well as to reinforce expectations within our teams.\n\n## Alcohol use\n\nAs part of our commitment to health and safety, all workplaces should be free from the use of alcohol and illegal drugs, and the misuse of other substances, in accordance with Our Code of Conduct . All those who attend a BHP site, including employees, are expected to be alcohol and drug free, and may be asked to undergo random alcohol and drug testing. We also provide support for those who need it to address an alcohol or drug dependency.\n\nFor accommodation villages, our Minerals Australia Alcohol Management Standard was implemented across our owned and operated village facilities from 1 July 2021. It includes a range of limits on alcohol consumption. Residents and visitors who breach the standard may be subject to action, including removal of access to the village for a resident or visitor, or disciplinary action for employees. Since the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nintroduction of the standard, our reviews have indicated that there has been a reduction in alcohol consumption, and residents are making healthier choices, with an increase in the use of recreational facilities. Alcohol is not permitted at our accommodation villages in Chile and Canada.\n\n## Listening to employees, measuring progress and assigning accountability\n\nWe have channels through which the Board and senior leaders receive information on workplace culture and conduct. These include anonymous employee and contractor perception surveys and our Field Leadership Program. Our perception surveys are conducted three times per year and were redesigned in FY2021 to include more targeted questions to provide leaders with greater insight into key safety and engagement metrics, which we have identified as critical foundations for our culture. Executive leadership and Group-wide performance criteria are linked to remuneration that includes progress towards greater inclusion, diversity and gender representation. In FY2022, we introduced key performance indicators for our Executive Leadership Team and other BHP employees that linked remuneration outcomes to progress against our program of work to address sexual harassment. This includes implementation of controls in line with BHP's sexual harassment risk assessments.\n\n## Engaging with and learning from others\n\nWe continue to measure and test our focus and areas for action. In FY2022 we:\n\n- -  engaged and learnt from external experts who reviewed the controls we have in place and advised on best practice in preventing sexual harassment, and minimising further harm when responding to sexual harassment\n- -  engaged Kristen Hilton (former Victorian Equal Opportunity and Human Rights Commissioner) to provide expert guidance on our prevention and response framework\n- -  conducted a sexual harassment audit across Minerals Americas further to the FY2021 sexual harassment audit conducted across Minerals Australia\n- -  contributed to knowledge sharing with other industry participants in relation to addressing sexual harassment, and considered broader learnings from external reports such as the Australian Human Rights Commission's Respect@Work: Sexual Harassment National Inquiry Report and the R eport into Workplace Culture at Rio Tinto by Elizabeth Broderick & Co\n- -  worked with our contracting and supplier organisations to address sexual harassment, including collaboration on response protocols, joint training sessions and knowledge sharing\n- -  undertook a series of listening workshops\n\nThrough these initiatives we identified a need for further focus on preventative controls, particularly with respect to culture and behaviours. This is in addition to the controls already in place or committed for implementation in FY2022 which included security, accommodation standards, alcohol measures, recruitment and discipline.\n\nWe are committed to working with others in the industry and beyond to address sexual\n\nharassment risks. BHP is a member of the Minerals Council of Australia Respect@Work Taskforce and the Chamber of Minerals & Energy WA Safe and Respectful Behaviours Working Group. Both groups aim to build industry capability and capacity though sharing knowledge and developing shared resources.\n\nIn FY2022, we participated in Western Australia's parliamentary inquiry into sexual harassment against women in the FIFO mining industry (WA Inquiry), including through a detailed written submission in August 2021 (available at parliament.wa.gov.au). BHP welcomes the final report titled 'Enough is enough' released on 23 June 2022. We acknowledge the significant work of the parliamentary committee and in particular, the many people who shared their stories and experiences as part of the inquiry process.\n\n## Continuing to make progress\n\nWhile we have made progress, there is still much more to do. Our focus in FY2023 will be to continue:\n\n- -  focusing on increasing female leader representation across our operations\n- -  continuous improvement across our suite of controls\n- -   engaging with our people, encouraging and empowering them to take action as active bystanders and enhance capability\n- -  encouraging increased reporting\n- -  enhancing our approach to supporting impacted persons to thrive at BHP and have successful careers with us\n\n## 7.6  Health\n\n## We are committed to protecting the health and wellbeing of our workforce.\n\nWe set clear mandatory minimum performance standards to identify, assess and manage health risks and their potential impacts and monitor the health of our workforce.\n\n## Occupational illness\n\nThe reported occurrence of occupational illness 1 for employees in FY2022 was 265, which was 3.89 per million hours worked, representing a decrease in incidence compared to FY2021, which was 4.36 per million hours worked.\n\nFor our contractor workforce, the reported occupational illness 1 in FY2022 was 151, which was 1.61 per million hours worked, representing a decrease in incidence compared to FY2021 which was 1.87 per million hours worked. Due to regulatory regimes and limited access to data, we do not have full oversight of the incidence of contractor noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) cases.\n\nMusculoskeletal illness is the predominant occupational illness category representing 65 per cent of our workforce illnesses. These are conditions impacting the musculoskeletal system and connective tissues caused by repetitive workrelated stress or strain or exposure over time.\n\n- 1 An illness that occurs as a consequence of workrelated activities or exposure.",

Where workers are exposed to noise above acceptable levels, workers are placed in hearing conservation programs, which include a periodic hearing test and hearing protection fit testing. Through our Sustainability in Design program, we have also established design recommendations that seek to eliminate or reduce high or prolonged noise exposures. Other illness categories include skin diseases, temperature-related illnesses, mental illness, bites, stings and other unspecified illnesses.\n\nOur occupational illness data excludes cases of COVID-19 among our employees and contractors. In settings of high levels of community transmission and with an evolving understanding of the epidemiological criteria for infection and COVID-19 variants with evidence of increased transmission, it is difficult to conclude, with reasonable certainty, that a person was infected because of work-related activities or exposure. For information on our response to COVID-19, refer to 'COVID-19' further in 7.6.\n\n## Occupational exposures\n\nOccupational exposure limits (OELs) for our most material exposures are set according to the latest scientific evidence, which for a number of agents, such as diesel particulate matter (DPM), resulted in lower limits than\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNoise-induced hearing loss         Musculoskeletal illness         Other illnesses\n\n- 1 Data includes BMC up to the date of completion of the sale (3 May 2022), operated assets in our Petroleum business up to the date of the merger with Woodside (1 June 2022) and Onshore US assets up to the date of completion of the sale (31 October 2018), as applicable.\n- 2 Occupational illnesses excludes COVID-19 related data.\n- 3 Due to the lag nature of incident reporting and subsequent verification, final results may vary post reporting.

That achievement at the end of FY2022 in number of workers potentially exposed to levels exceeding our OELs include; no workers potentially exposed to coal mine dust, 78 per cent reduction in the number of workers potentially exposed to DPM 5 and a 61 per cent reduction in the number of workers potentially exposed to respirable silica.\n\nThis year, an internal audit conducted on FY2021 workforce occupational exposures data at Nickel West identified that a statistical analysis error resulted in an underestimation of the number of workers assessed as potentially exposed to DPM.\n\nThis has resulted in an increase in the FY2021 total number of workers potentially exposed to material exposures compared to what was reported last year.\n\nWith the conclusion of our five-year public target, we will continue to manage exposures to as low as reasonably practicable by focusing our efforts in FY2023 on further implementation of exposure reduction projects, sustaining the exposure reductions achieved by leveraging our Risk Framework and identifying exposure reduction opportunities for inclusion in FY2024 plans and beyond.\n\n## Coal mine dust lung disease\n\nAs at 30 June 2022, 12 cases of coal mine dust lung disease (CMDLD) 6 among our employees were reported to the Queensland Department of Natural Resources Mines and Energy (DNRME). 7 In addition to these cases, there were four\n\n- 1 For exposures exceeding our FY2017 occupational exposure limits, without considering protection afforded by the use of personal protective equipment (where required).\n- 2 The baseline exposure profile is derived through a combination of quantitative exposure measurements and qualitative assessments undertaken by specialist occupational hygienists consistent with best practice as defined by the American Industrial Hygiene Association.\n- 3 Occupational Exposure target excludes Projects.\n- 4 The FY2017 to FY2022 data has been adjusted to exclude Discontinued operations (Onshore US assets, Petroleum) and the divestment of BMC.\n- 5 FY2021 data includes adjustment to DPM exposures as a result of misstatement in previous year.\n- 6 CMDLD is the name given to the lung diseases related to exposure to coal mine dust and includes coal workers' pneumoconiosis, silicosis, mixed dust pneumoconiosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n- 7 Cases reported to DNRME are not an indication of work relatedness.

In FY2022, we continued to implement our Group-wide Mental Health Framework to raise awareness of mental wellbeing, reduce stigma and increase the capacity of our leaders to recognise and support individuals experiencing mental illness. As a founding member of the Global Business Collaboration for Better Workplace Mental Health, we continue to contribute to the global business-led alliance to advocate for and accelerate positive change for mental health in the workplace worldwide.\n\nTo support the proactive management of mental wellbeing and give our workforce the tools and skills needed to build resilience and positive mental health, we provide and promote the Employee Assistance Program, our mental health toolkit, Thrive, education and awareness campaigns (including stigma reduction) and the BHP Resilience Program.\n\nIn May 2022, we continued with our annual BHP Mental Health month, with the aim of increasing mental wellbeing and encouraging everyone to support and look out for one another. We continued to support global mental health campaigns during FY2022, including World Mental Health Day, R U OK? Day and Movember. In FY2022, we also commenced work to develop a Group-wide psychosocial risk management approach with the aim of taking a proactive and systemic approach to sustaining a mentally healthy workplace. This process will contribute to achieving our 2030 goal for a safe, inclusive and future ready workforce.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nWe continued to navigate the challenges of the global COVID-19 pandemic, including high community transmissions and variants that are more transmissible. In FY2022, we continued to adapt COVID-19 controls based on current scientific evidence and medical advice designed to protect our workforce and minimise the risk of workplace transmission.\n\nWe strongly support vaccination as a control to protect the health of our workforce and the communities where we operate. As part of our COVID-19 controls, we require vaccinations as a condition of workplace entry subject to local laws and regulatory requirements. We also implemented pre-entry testing programs across our operations and offices globally - aimed at reducing workplace transmissions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information on health, including a case study on how we supported our people and the communities where we operate through COVID-19, is available at bhp.com/health.\n\n## 7.7  Ethics and business conduct\n\n## Our conduct\n\nOur Code of Conduct ( Our Code ) 1 brings our values to life so we can make the right choices every day. It applies to everyone who works for us, with us, or on our behalf. To ensure all employees and contractors understand how Our Code applies, regular training is mandatory. There are consequences for breaching Our Code and we encourage people to speak up\n\n| Harassment and bullying              | 49.6%   |\n|--------------------------------------|---------|\n| Sexual  harassment                   | 11.9%   |\n| Fraud                                | 9.8%    |\n| Discrimination                       | 8.4%    |\n| Other 1                              | 8.6%    |\n| Health, safety or environment breach | 9.8%    |\n| Retaliation for speaking up          | 2%      |\n\n- 1 Inclusions are anti-competitive behaviour; attempts to identify an anonymous reporter, community relations or human rights breach; cybersecurity or data privacy breach; deficiencies in a business conduct investigation; improper political or governmental conduct; inappropriate or unauthorised external communication; information on other support service providers; physical violence; and trade control breach.\n\nwhere a decision or action is not in line with Our Code or Our Charter .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our Code is available in five languages and accessible at bhp.com.\n\nBHP encourages individuals to speak up and report concerns about any conduct that is inconsistent with Our Charter , Our Code or internal requirements, or conduct that may be illegal or improper. BHP requires reports of business conduct concerns to be treated with appropriate confidentiality and prohibits any kind of retaliation against people who make or may make a report, or who cooperate with an investigation. We consider all forms of retaliation to be misconduct and grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.\n\nIn FY2022, 5,402 reports were received into EthicsPoint (of these 4,714 were classified as business conduct concerns) 2 representing an increase of 33 per cent in business conduct concerns from FY2021. These include reports directly made by employees, contractors or community members. It also includes reports made to leaders (31 per cent) who are then required to register them in EthicsPoint. We believe the increase corresponds to the continuous effort by BHP to promote the reporting of disrespectful behaviour to create an environment in which people can feel safe speaking up. The introduction of a global service to support people involved in sexual harassment incidents and discuss resolution options has also encouraged employees and contractors to report instances of sexual harassment.

Of the total business conduct reports closed during FY2022, 43 per cent contained one or more substantiated allegations. 2\n\n## Transparency and accountability\n\nWe support initiatives by governments of the countries where we operate to publicly disclose the content of our licences or contracts for the development and production of minerals that form the basis of our payments to government, as outlined in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) Standard.\n\nOther initiatives include our work in partnership with Transparency International, our representation on the Board of the EITI, our financial support for and Steering Committee membership of the Bribery Prevention Network (in Australia) and our funding of the BHP Foundation, including its Natural Resource Governance Global Program.\n\nIn FY2022, we also continued our active and public support for ultimate beneficial ownership transparency. This support included co-hosting (with EITI, Open Ownership and the B Team) a Beneficial Ownership Transparency Forum in London and leading efforts with EITI for BHP and other leading resources companies to publicly commit to a Statement by Companies on Beneficial Ownership Transparency, launched at the Forum. Through the Statement, BHP and other leading resources companies recognise the need for publicly available company ownership information and (among other things) commit to promote the global adoption of beneficial ownership transparency, to disclose beneficial ownership data, and to identify and use beneficial ownership data in due diligence processes. Our efforts are complementary to BHP Foundation's partnership with EITI and Open Ownership to support governments to transform the availability and use of beneficial ownership data for effective governance in the extractive sector.\n\nMulti-lateral measures to improve governance, such as these, should help ensure transparency and accountability are cornerstones of a successful energy transition that benefits the citizens of countries bestowed with critical minerals.\n\n## Anti-corruption\n\nWe continue our commitment to the global fight against corruption in the resources industry. Our commitment to anti-corruption is embodied in Our Charter and Our Code .\n\nAs part of this commitment, we prohibit authorising, offering, giving or promising anything of value directly or indirectly to anyone to influence them in their role, or to encourage them to perform their work disloyally or otherwise improperly.\n\n- 1 This excludes reports not containing a business conduct concern and excludes reports logged by leaders on behalf of others.\n- 2 The calculation is based on reports received and completed in FY2022, containing one or more substantiated allegations. Not all reports resulted in a finding. This can occur if there is insufficient information, the respondent is not able to be identified, was previously terminated, or that the impacted person did not wish to proceed.\n\nWe also prohibit facilitation payments, which are payments to government officials for routine government actions. Our people must take care that third parties acting on our behalf do not violate anti-corruption laws. Disciplinary action including dismissal, or termination of contractual relationships, may follow from a breach of these requirements.\n\nTo manage corruption risk, we work to ensure optimal resource allocation to areas of our business with the highest exposure to corruption risks. The identification, assessment and management of corruption risks associated with growth opportunities remains a significant area of focus for our Compliance function, via a sub-team dedicated to supporting functions that are responsible for initiating transactions and growth opportunities in countries with high corruption risks.\n\nAll activities that potentially involve higher exposure to corruption risk require review or approval by our Compliance function, as documented in our anti-corruption compliance framework. In FY2022 Compliance and Global Corporate Affairs implemented a new end-to-end workflow system for sponsorships, donations and community development projects, which provides greater data for enhanced monitoring and increased governance over contracting and post-contact expenditure reporting.\n\nOur Compliance function regularly reviews our anti-corruption framework for compliance with the requirements of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, the Australian Criminal Code and the applicable laws and regulatory developments of all places where\n\nwe do business. These laws are consistent with the standards of the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.\n\nOur Compliance function is independent of our assets and regions and reports to the Chief Legal Governance and External Affairs Officer. The Chief Compliance Officer also reports quarterly to the Risk and Audit Committee on compliance issues and meets at least annually with the Committee Chair.\n\nThe Compliance team also participates in anti-corruption risk assessments in respect of our operated assets or functions, our interests in non-operated assets and new business opportunities that we consider are exposed to material anti-corruption risks. In FY2022, the team provided input into 44 anti-corruption risk assessments.\n\nRisk awareness in first-line employees remains a critical preventative measure. Anti-corruption training is required to be provided to all employees and contractors as part of mandatory annual training on Our Code . Our Compliance function also regularly communicates and engages with identified higher-risk roles. In FY2022, additional risk-based anti-corruption training was undertaken by 1,578 employees and contractors, as well as employees of some of our business partners and community partners.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information on ethics and business conduct is available at bhp.com/ethics\n\n<!-- image -->",

Achievement of this goal is uncertain, particularly given the challenges of a net zero pathway for our customers in steelmaking, and we cannot ensure the outcome alone. To progress towards this goal: 2\n- -  We will target net zero by 2050 for the operational GHG emissions of our direct suppliers. 3\n- -  We will target net zero by 2050 for GHG emissions from all shipping of BHP products.\n- -  We will continue to partner with customers and others to try to accelerate the transition to carbon neutral steelmaking and other downstream processes.\n- -  Our 2030 goals are to:\n- -  support industry to develop technologies and pathways capable of 30 per cent emissions intensity reduction in integrated steelmaking, with widespread adoption expected post 2030\n- -  support 40 per cent emissions intensity reduction of BHP-chartered shipping of BHP products\n\n## Climate Transition Action Plan progress\n\n## FY2022 progress on operational decarbonisation targets and goals\n\nTo support progress towards our long-term goal to achieve net zero operational GHG emissions by 2050, in FY2022, we achieved our short-term target due to significant progress made through the execution of Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), particularly in Chile at two of our copper operated assets but also increasingly across our Australian operations. Meeting our FY2022 target keeps us on track to achieve our FY2030 medium-term target.\n\n- 1 These positions are expressed using terms that are defined in the Glossary to this Report, including the terms 'target', 'goal', 'net zero' and 'carbon neutral'. The baseline year(s) of our targets will be adjusted for any material acquisitions and divestments, and to reflect progressive refinement of emissions reporting methodologies.

Our Board is actively engaged in the governance of climate change issues, including our strategic approach, oversight of material risk management and performance against our targets, goals and strategies, supported by the Sustainability Committee and the Risk and Audit Committee.\n\nThe Board strengthened the link between executive remuneration and delivery of our climate change strategy in 2020, with performance on decarbonisation and adaptation now representing 10 per cent of the Cash and Deferred Plan scorecard.\n\nThe Board obtains advice from climate change experts, including by seeking the input of management (including Dr Fiona Wild, our Vice President Sustainability and Climate Change) and independent advisers. In addition, our Forum on Corporate Responsibility (which includes Don Henry, former CEO of the Australian Conservation Foundation and Changhua Wu, former Greater China Director, the Climate Group) engages with operational management teams and with the Sustainability Committee and the Board as appropriate.\n\nBelow Board level, key decisions in relation to climate change are made by the CEO and management, in accordance with their delegated authority. Our Executive Leadership Team (ELT) is held to account for a range of measures, including climate-related performance, which are then cascaded through the organisation. While our Board is ultimately responsible for our strategic approach to climate change issues, management has primary responsibility for the design and implementation of our climate change strategy with execution overseen by the Climate Change Steering Committee. BHP has a dedicated Climate Change team responsible for advising the ELT. The team collaborates with BHP's asset and function teams, external partners and industry to develop practical climate change solutions, designed to preserve and unlock long-term value for BHP. It regularly\n\nprepares information and advice for the ELT, Sustainability Committee, Risk and Audit Committee and the Board on climate-related strategy, risks (both threats and opportunities) and performance against climate-related metrics. It also uses key risk indicators to help monitor performance against our appetite for climate change-related risks and monitors relevant signposts through our emerging risk process. Climate-related activity is also undertaken across the Group, including in our Portfolio Strategy and Development; Commercial; Planning and Technical; and Environment teams.\n\n## Climate risk management\n\nBHP applies a single, Group-wide approach to the management of risk, known as the Risk Framework. Risks are assessed to determine their potential impacts and likelihood, enable prioritisation and determine risk treatment options. We then implement controls designed to prevent, minimise or mitigate threats, and enable or enhance opportunities. Risks and controls are reviewed periodically and on an ad hoc basis to evaluate performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on BHP's Risk Framework refer to OFR 9.\n\nClimate-related risks can be grouped into two categories:\n\n- -Transition risks arise from policy, regulatory, legal, technological, market and other societal responses to the challenges posed by climate change and the transition to a lowcarbon economy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more information refer to Transition risks.\n- -Physical risks refer to acute risks that are event-driven, including increased severity and frequency of extreme weather events, and chronic risks resulting from longer-term changes in climate patterns.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to Physical risks.\n\n## Transition risks\n\nTransition risks are identified, assessed and managed in line with BHP's Risk Framework.\n\nWe consider these across short (up to two years), medium (two to five years) and long-term (five to 30 years) time horizons.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on risks associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy and why these risks are important to BHP, potential threats and opportunities, and key management actions refer to OFR 9.1.\n\n## Scenario analysis\n\nWhen forming strategy, we consider the impact of a range of future pathway scenarios, including our 1.5\u00b0C Paris-aligned scenario, 1 and potential responses to the threats and opportunities presented by climate change. At the time of publication of this Report, signposts do not yet indicate the appropriate measures are in place to drive decarbonisation at the pace or scale required for us to assess achieving the aims of the Paris Agreement as the most likely future outcome. However, as governments, institutions, companies and society increasingly focus on addressing climate change, the potential for a non-linear and/or more rapid transition and the subsequent impact on threats and opportunities increases.\n\nWe seek to maximise our exposure to products with significant opportunity under all scenarios and to minimise the risk that capital will be stranded in a rapidly decarbonising world through portfolio commodity mix and the position of our operated assets on their cost curves.\n\nTwo scenarios (Central Energy View and Lower Carbon View) 2 are currently being used as inputs to our operational planning cases, based on our current estimates of the most likely range of future states for the global economy and associated sub-systems. In addition to our operational planning scenarios, we utilise a range of scenarios, including our 1.5\u00b0C Parisaligned scenario when testing the resilience of our portfolio, forming strategy and making investment decisions. These scenarios are reviewed periodically to reflect new information and are benchmarked against scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and third-party energy and resource research organisations (including the",

        "page_content": "International Energy Agency, IHS Markit, Wood Mackenzie, Bloomberg New Energy Finance and CRU); an update of the scenarios is expected during FY2023.\n\nThe energy and resources modelling from BHP's 1.5\u00b0C scenario, which was conducted in 2020, remains consistent with the updated carbon budget released in the Working Group I report as the first part of the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) in 2021.\n\n## Capital alignment\n\nDuring FY2022, we systematically integrated our 1.5\u00b0C Paris-aligned scenario into our strategy and capital allocation process to test the extent to which our capital allocation is aligned with a rapidly decarbonising global economy. Specifically, we apply our 1.5\u00b0C scenario to assess whether future demand for our products under that scenario supports ongoing capital investment. Our analysis and that of others, including the International Energy Agency, have shown that many of the commodities we currently produce are critical for the aims of the Paris Agreement to be met.\n\nThe impact of our 1.5\u00b0C scenario on our portfolio value was assessed after the merger of our Petroleum business with Woodside and the sale of a number of our coal assets, and was reviewed against portfolio mix and major capital allocation decisions. Our portfolio value increased under the 1.5\u00b0C scenario, consistent with the demand outcomes of the analysis published in the BHP Climate Change Report 2020 1 that indicated the world would need around twice as much steel, copper and potash, and four times as much nickel in the next 30 years as it did in the last 30. It also indicated a reduction in the future demand for oil and energy coal.\n\nOur focus for capital expenditure is now on commodities we assess as having a significant upside through the transition. Furthermore, the internal allocation of capital under our Capital Allocation Framework and all major investment decisions now require an assessment of investment viability under our 1.5\u00b0C Parisaligned scenario.\n\nThrough these processes, we demonstrate our commitment to ensuring our capital expenditure plans are not misaligned with the Paris Agreement's aim to pursue efforts to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. Our total capital and exploration expenditure for Continuing operations in FY2022 was US$6.1 billion, of which US$73 million or 1 per cent was for our energy coal assets. Spend in FY2022 and all currently approved spend for energy coal assets is limited to maintenance capital. Additional capital is expected to be required for the proposed life extension of the Mt Arthur Coal mine through to the end of FY2030, should\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrelevant approvals be received. This is expected to provide certainty for our people and the community about the future of the mine and time to work together with the community on a plan that contributes to helping the region diversify and strengthen its economy.\n\nIn FY2020, we announced a commitment of at least US$400 million to invest in GHG emissions reduction across our operated assets and value chain over the five-year life of our Climate Investment Program. We spent US$47 million on initiatives consistent with this program in FY2022, targeting operational, maritime, and steelmaking emissions and BHP Ventures investments. This figure does not include the operating expenditure associated with renewable electricity arrangements established at a number of our operations, which collectively represented the main source of operational emissions abatement for BHP in FY2022. More than US$200 million has been included in approved budgets for FY2023 as our decarbonisation programs further mature, and we will continue expenditure of up to US$75 million over the coming years channelled towards partnerships with our customers in the steel sector.\n\nOur capital allocation process is structured to ensure capital expenditure plans are aligned with our FY2030 and 2050 operational emissions reduction target and goal. We expect to spend around US$4 billion on operational decarbonisation by FY2030, with plans reflecting an annual capital allocation of between approximately US$200 million and approximately US$600 million per year over the next five years. Going forward, as our climate response is further integrated into business-as-usual planning, our spending on climate initiatives is expected to become increasingly indistinguishable from normal business spending.\n\n## How we think about and use carbon pricing\n\nOur assets and markets are likely to continue to be subject to variations in regulation and levels of carbon pricing depending on location and industry. Similarly, the competitiveness of our products and the processes in which they are used will be impacted by the adoption of carbon legislation in customer countries. We utilise an explicit regulatory carbon price forecast for major BHP operational, competitor and customer countries. In determining our forecast, we consider factors such as a country's current and announced climate policies and targets and societal factors such as public acceptance and demographics. We forecast the global range of regional carbon prices to reach between US$0-175/tCO2-e in FY2030, and US$10-250/tCO2-e in FY2050, and US$10-175/ tCO2-e in FY2030 and US$100-250/tCO2-e in FY2050 in BHP's current major operational and market countries.\n\nWe have incorporated regional carbon price assumptions in our planning, investment decisions and asset valuations for more than 10 years. They are used together with our operational planning cases based on the current economic outlook for asset planning, asset valuations and operational decision-making.\n\nOur carbon price forecasts are also used along with other qualitative and quantitative metrics, such as the outcomes of our Paris-aligned 1.5\u00b0C scenario analysis (refer to 'Scenario analysis' and 'Capital alignment'), in our assessment of investments under the Capital Allocation Framework and to inform our portfolio strategy and investment decisions.\n\nWhen considering initiatives to meet our operational emission medium-term target and long-term goal, we consider a number of additional metrics including the initiatives' position on our internal marginal abatement project cost curve, technology maturity and ultimate abatement potential. This informs the implied costs and benefits of our decarbonisation initiatives, allowing us to prioritise and rank those initiatives based on an implied price on carbon.\n\n## Green revenue\n\nGreen revenue is intended as a measure of the extent to which products and services contribute to the transition to a green economy. 2 While these contributions will be measured on a range of important indicators (including water conservation, biodiversity or reforestation), much of the discussion about green revenue remains focused on the contribution to the transition to clean energy that is vital for climate change mitigation.\n\nWe expect many of the resources we produce to be important for the energy transition. For example, the International Energy Agency's 'The Role of Critical Minerals in Clean Energy Transitions' report 3 highlights the critical role of copper and nickel, and BHP's own 1.5\u00b0C scenario 4 indicates the case for copper, nickel and potash could be more compelling as the world takes action to decarbonise. Iron ore also fares slightly better under our 1.5\u00b0C scenario versus certain other scenarios, as steel requirements of the energy transition are expected to be considerable.\n\nIn FY2022, we consulted with investors, industry and standard setters to explore ways of establishing clear methodologies for classification and measurement of green revenue within the resources sector. As yet, no agreed or established approach exists. A green revenue measure based on end use continues to be challenging for copper and steel as they undergo multiple stages of processing and have a diverse range of end uses. This challenge is despite the widely recognised importance",

Battery manufacture contributes to climate change mitigation. 1 Therefore, for illustrative purposes, 2 we have measured the revenue from our sales to battery materials suppliers as green revenue. Battery-suitable nickel is defined as nickel briquettes, nickel powder and nickel sulphate. It does not include off-specification nickel metal. A total of 87 per cent of BHP's battery-suitable nickel was sold to global battery material suppliers in FY2022, 3 an increase of 15 per cent on FY2021. For FY2022, BHP's green revenue from battery-suitable nickel amounted to US$1,164 million, 4 an increase of 53 per cent on FY2021.\n\nAustralian uranium is sold for nuclear power generation only, a low emissions source of electricity. Therefore, also for illustrative purposes, we have measured all revenue from uranium as green revenue. For FY2022, BHP's green revenue from uranium was US$207 million, which is a decrease of 17 per cent on FY2021.\n\n## Emissions intensity of production\n\nAs well as assessing commodities based on their end uses, it is important to consider the GHG emissions associated with the production of commodities in determining their role in the transition to a net zero economy. Given production of many commodities is expected to need to continue or even increase, it is critical that their production has the lowest possible associated GHG emissions and optimal performance under other sustainability indicators. For example, our Chilean copper operated asset, Escondida, is aiming to have 100 per cent renewable electricity supply by the mid-2020s and sources desalinated water for operational purposes, minimising water extraction from sensitive Andean aquifers.\n\n- 1 For example, the EU taxonomy recognises battery manufacture as a significant contributor to climate change mitigation. The EU Taxonomy is a classification system, establishing a list of environmentally sustainable economic activities. Note the EU taxonomy does not presently cover the mining sector. For more information refer to 32021R2139 - EN - EUR-Lex, available at eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ TXT/?uri=celex%3A32021R2139.\n- 2 Recognising that a settled methodology for classifying green revenue in the resources sector has yet to be determined.\n- 3 Based on percentage of battery-suitable nickel sales to battery material suppliers. Where a customer's planned end use is not known with certainty to be for battery supply, assumptions of usage have been made using historical nickel usage for those customers.\n- 4 Calculated based on gross revenue from batterysuitable nickel multiplied by percentage of BHP's sales of battery-suitable nickel, as applicable to battery material suppliers.\n\nSource: Skarn Associates, BHP\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Skarn Associates, BHP\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 The copper mines emissions intensity curve is based on CY2021 data estimates from Skarn Associates. The emissions intensity basis is tonnes of CO2-equivalent per tonne of copper equivalent finished metal per mine. We have overlayed Escondida, Pampa Norte (comprised of Spence and Cerro Colorado) and Olympic Dam with reported BHP data points for CY2021 for: i) production (copper - concentrate and cathode; copper equivalent tonnes); ii) Scope 1 emissions; and iii) Scope 2 emissions. For copper cathode only, emissions intensity estimates from freight only are included and utilise Skarn Associates' data. This is to avoid double counting as smelting and refining emissions would already be included in the Scopes 1 and 2 emissions of BHP assets for cathode production. Downstream emissions intensity estimates of copper concentrate, relating to smelting and refining - to produce finished metal as well as emissions from freight - utilise Skarn Associates' data across the dataset. Noting the renewable PPA arrangements that commenced at Escondida and Spence in FY2022, we have also provided the indicative emission intensities for Escondida and Pampa Norte based on FY2022 data (noting the rest of the of data in the curve is based on CY2021 data).\n- 2 Copper-and-Nickel equivalent calculations: For the copper mines and nickel emission intensity curves, the basis of the intensity is tonne of copper equivalent and nickel equivalent production respectively. Copper equivalent and nickel equivalent production allows comparison of single commodity operations with those that produce byand co-products. For example, Escondida's copper equivalent production is calculated as Escondida's CY2021 revenue, divided by the CY2021 average realised copper price. For FY2022 estimates in the copper mines intensity curve - highlighting renewable PPA impacts - FY2022 revenue, divided by the FY2022 average realised copper price are used.\n- 3 The nickel emissions intensity curve is based on CY2021 data estimates from Skarn Associates. The emissions intensity basis is tonnes of CO2-equivalent per tonne of nickel equivalent in first saleable metal. Under the Skarn Associates methodology, this includes processed output from the mine, concentrator and smelter (production and emissions from refineries are not included). For Nickel West, this includes only production attributable to BHP ores (Mt Keith and Leinster) and excludes any production and emissions from third party ores. We have overlayed Nickel West with reported BHP data points for CY2021 for: i) production attributable to BHP ores (nickel tonnes and nickel equivalent tonnes); ii) Scope 1 emissions; and iii) Scope 2 emissions. To calculate nickel equivalent production, we have used average realised CY2021 nickel prices as well as Skarn Associates' estimate for the CY2021 cobalt price. For emissions, we have pro-rated Scopes 1 and 2 emissions from the Kalgoorlie smelter to account for emissions attributable to BHP production only (i.e. excluding third-party feed) and excluded emissions from the Kambalda concentrator. To avoid double counting, we have removed Skarn Associates' estimated intensity for downstream processing (i.e. that attributable to smelting) and have not included emissions from the Kwinana refinery as this is outside of the boundary of the Skarn Associates' methodology. Emissions intensity estimates for Upstream+Freight+Port+Ocean utilises Skarn Associates data across the dataset. Upstream emissions are applicable to only Nickel pig iron (NPI) and Ferro-nickel (FeNi) plants' emissions relating to upstream mining and logistics per Skarn Associates' methodology.",

BHP operations have been aggregated to BMA level, noting BMC is not highlighted as a BHP operation given the recent divestment of BHP's interest in BMC. BMA has been overlayed with reported BHP data points for CY2021 for: i) metallurgical coal production; ii) Scope 1 emissions; and iii) Scope 2 emissions incorporating BHP operated integrated rail and port emissions. Emission intensity estimates for Freight + Port + Ocean logistics of metallurgical coal products utilise Skarn Associates data across the dataset. As BMA utilises both integrated (included in Scopes 1 and 2 emissions) and third-party rail and port services, this may result in partial double counting of emissions. We have also updated the global warming potential factor for CH 4 to the IPCC AR5 across the dataset for better comparability.\n\nThis year, in addition to the absolute emissions from each of our operated assets, we disclose CY2021 GHG operational emissions intensity estimates for BHP's iron ore, metallurgical coal, copper and nickel operated assets compared to other mines. Due to the different structure of various mines to aid comparability and consistency with the Skarn Associates 3 data for the non-BHP mines, we have included select Scope 3 emissions estimates for downstream transport and processing of the commodity, where appropriate. Given the commencement of renewable PPAs at Escondida and at Spence\n\n(which, together with Cerro Colorado, comprises Pampa Norte) during FY2022, we have also overlayed the FY2022 intensity of Escondida and Pampa Norte to reflect an indicative change in emissions intensity on the curve from these initiatives from FY2022 onwards. Based on this analysis, GHG emissions intensity of BHP's operated assets is estimated to be either in the lowest quartile or the lowest half of the mines covered. As our decarbonisation strategy is executed, we expect the emissions intensity of our operated assets to further decline.\n\nOther sustainability indicators for our operated assets are disclosed in our ESG Standards and Databook available at bhp.com/sustainability. More information on our performance in relation to absolute GHG emissions is provided in 'Operational GHG emissions and energy consumption' and 'Value chain GHG emissions'.\n\n## Equitable change and transitions\n\nThere are communities around the world that rely on mining certain commodities that may therefore be disproportionately impacted by the transition to a low-carbon economy. Solutions will require a multi-stakeholder approach including the local community, investors, financiers, government at all levels and, of course, resource companies such as BHP.\n\nWe have outlined our approach to equitable\n\nchange and transition, taking into account the Paris Agreement and the International Labour Organisation's (ILO's) Just Transition Guidelines, in OFR 7.1, recognising the role of BHP through changes and transitions. The approach to equitable change and transition will inform implementation of our strategy for decarbonisation and adaptation to the potential physical impacts of climate change, as well as apply to the intended closure of NSWEC.\n\n## Physical risks\n\nOur Adaptation Strategy outlines the proactive and collaborative approach we need to take to build the safety, productivity and climate resilience of our operated assets, investments, portfolio, supply chain, communities and ecosystems by adapting to the physical risks of climate change. We have analysed specific climate-related hazards and developed a more detailed approach to enable financial and economic evaluation of physical climate risks and adaptation measures in future years.\n\nBHP requires operated assets and functions to identify and progressively assess potential physical climate change risks (including to our value chain) and build climate change adaptation into their plans, activities and investments. In FY2022, we progressed our Adaptation Strategy, conducting a physical climate risk identification process for our operated assets and supply chain. Risks associated with each hazard were prioritised in accordance with our risk process under BHP's Risk Framework, including consideration of their materiality. Across our portfolio of operated assets and associated value chains, we have identified a number of common, high potential impact physical climate risks; where the 'Highest potential impact physical climate risks across BHP's operated assets' table presents the top eight. 4\n\n- 3 For more information refer to skarnassociates.com/ghg.\n- 4   The first seven risks in the table were selected based on the number of operated assets that identified them as material in accordance with BHP's Risk Framework and the average Maximum Foreseeable Loss severity rating assigned to each. The absence of a tick means either the risk was identified at the asset, but not rated as material under our Risk Framework, or that it was not identified for that asset. Legacy assets and nonoperated joint ventures have been excluded from the analysis. Legacy assets are to be included in the risk evaluations planned for FY2023. The eighth risk in the table is a collation of material value chain risks with implications across the regions; its position in the table does not indicate its level of potential impact relative to the other risks.",

        "page_content": "The risk management column in the table describes our current approach, which is subject to review for new or additional climaterelated measures arising from the subsequent risk evaluation work program planned for our operated assets (including legacy assets) in FY2023.\n\nTo underpin the subsequent risk evaluation work program planned across all of our operated assets (including legacy assets) and key supply chain infrastructure, we have sourced projections of acute and chronic climate variables from a leading climate science consultancy. The risk evaluation process will be a further step toward identifying and prioritising additional adaptation measures and reporting potential financial impacts in later years, including a value-at-risk range. We have already allocated US$200 million to studies on physical climate risk prevention and mitigation measures at our Minerals Americas operated assets.\n\nWe have also identified a number of opportunities to adapt to the potential physical impacts of climate change, primarily related to improving operational efficiency and innovation, taking collaborative action to grow the resilience of our value chain, and supporting local communities and ecosystems. In FY2023, we plan to undertake risk evaluations at our operated assets (including legacy assets) including assessment of chronic physical risks, implement any 'quick win' adaptation actions and initiate studies on measures expected to require significant capital investment. We also plan to further study prioritised value chain risks to understand with more specificity where risk is concentrated. These actions are intended to contribute to addressing the climate-related risks noted under the Inadequate business resilience risk factor in OFR 9.1. We also intend to continue to build an understanding of how the communities where we operate may be impacted by future climate events and embed consideration of ecosystem-based adaptation, to contribute to both climate resilience and BHP's biodiversity commitments and goals.\n\n## Operational GHG emissions and energy consumption\n\nWe recognise the role we must play in helping the world achieve its decarbonisation ambitions. This includes reducing our operational emissions and working with our supply chains to reduce their emissions. Looking to the future, our aim remains to position BHP to thrive in a low-carbon world by minimising emissions from existing products while helping to provide commodities that the world needs to achieve a net zero future.\n\nRefer to 'BHP's climate change targets and goals' for our operational emissions target and goal.\n\n- 1 Baseline adjusted to remove Discontinued operations (Onshore US assets and Petroleum) and BMC and for method changes (use of IPCC AR5 Global Warming Potentials (GWP) and a move to facility-specific emissions calculation methodology for fugitives at Caval Ridge) to ensure ongoing comparability of performance. For more information refer to the BHP Scopes 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions calculation methodology available at bhp.com/climate.\n- 2   Original baseline adjusted in FY2019 to remove Discontinued operations (Onshore US assets).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe review our performance against targets annually and consider opportunities to accelerate ambition regularly. We have successfully achieved our short-term target set in 2018 to maintain operational GHG emissions at or below adjusted FY2017 levels by FY2022, while continuing to grow our business. Our performance against our short-term target is described in 'Operational GHG emissions and energy consumption - FY2022 performance'.\n\nOur operational GHG emissions are measured against our target performance based on an operational control, market-based methodology. We also disclose operational GHG emissions by equity share and financial control in our ESG Standards and Databook available at bhp.com/climate.\n\n## Operational GHG emissions and energy consumption - FY2022 performance\n\nIn FY2022, our operational GHG emissions were 15 per cent lower than the adjusted FY2017 baseline 1 of 12.9 MtCO2-e on the basis of operated assets held by BHP as at 30 June 2022, demonstrating achievement of our short-term target for FY2022. With inclusion of BHP's recent divestments, Discontinued operations (Petroleum) and BMC operations (both annualised for FY2022), operational GHG emissions were also 15 per cent lower than the previously adjusted FY2017 baseline. 2\n\nIn FY2022, total operational energy consumption decreased 4 per cent from FY2021. This was largely driven by reduced energy use at Olympic Dam due to scheduled maintenance and reduced fuel consumption at our operated coal assets. Scope 1 and 2 emissions decreased 25 per cent from FY2021 primarily due to an increase in the renewable component of our energy consumption at Escondida and Pampa Norte in Chile.\n\n## Operational energy consumption by source (PJ) 1,2\n\n| Year ended 30 June                                                                     | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Consumption of fuel                                                                    | 112    | 118    | 114    |\n| - Coal and coke                                                                        | 1      | 1      | 1      |\n| - Natural gas                                                                          | 22     | 23     | 21     |\n| - Distillate/gasoline                                                                  | 87     | 91     | 90     |\n| - Other                                                                                | 2      | 3      | 2      |\n| Consumption of electricity                                                             | 37     | 37     | 36     |\n| - Consumption of electricity from grid                                                 | 33     | 33     | 32     |\n| Total operational energy consumption                                                   | 149    | 155    | 150    |\n| Total operational energy consumption   (adjusted for divested operations) 8            |        |        |        |\n|                                                                                        | 132    | 137    | 135    |\n| Operational energy consumption from renewable sources 3                                | 17.1   | 0.5    | 0.0    |\n| Operational energy intensity (gigajoules per tonne of copper  equivalent production) 9 | 18     | 21     | 19     |\n\n## Operational GHG emissions (MtCO2-e) 1,4,5,11\n\n| Year ended 30 June 2022                                                                          | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Scope 1 GHG emissions 6                                                                          | 9.2    | 10.1   | 9.6    |\n| Scope 2 GHG emissions 7                                                                          | 3.1    | 6.2    | 6.3    |\n| Total operational GHG emissions                                                                  | 12.3   | 16.3   | 15.9   |\n| Scope 1 GHG emissions (adjusted for divested operations) 8                                       | 7.9    | 8.8    | 8.3    |\n| Scope 2 GHG emissions (adjusted for divested operations) 8                                       | 3.0    | 6.1    | 6.2    |\n| Total operational GHG emissions   (adjusted for divested operations) 8                           | 11.0   | 14.9   | 14.6   |\n| Carbon offsets retired 12                                                                        | -      | 0.3    |        |\n| Total operational GHG emissions (including carbon offsets) 12                                    | 12.3   | 16.0   |        |\n| Operational GHG emissions intensity   (tonnes CO2-e per tonne of copper equivalent production) 9 | 1.5    | 2.2    | 2.0    |\n| Percentage of Scope 1 GHG emissions covered under  an emissions-limiting regulation 10           | 78%    | 81%    | 81%    |\n| Percentage of Scope 1 GHG emissions from methane 13                                              | 18%    | 22%    | 19%    |\n| Scope 2 GHG emissions (location based) 7                                                         | 4.8    | 5.0    | 5.1    |\n\n- 1 Data in italics indicates that data has been adjusted since it was previously reported. FY2021 originally reported energy data that has been restated is 92 PJ distillate/gasoline consumption, and 2 PJ other energy consumption, due to amended classification of petroleum based oils and greases to the 'other' category. FY2021 originally reported emissions data that has been restated is 10.0 MtCO2-e for Scope 1 GHG emissions and 16.2 MtCO2-e for total operational GHG emissions, due to minor amendments to fugitive emissions from the coal operated assets as part of the annual reconciliation process for Australian regulatory reporting purposes. FY2021 and FY2020 'Total operational GHG emissions (adjusted for divested operations)' have been restated from 16.2 and 15.9 Mt CO2-e respectively due to the exclusion of Discontinued operations (Petroleum) and BMC (also see footnote 8). Previously reported data excluded Discontinued operations (Onshore US assets) only. Additionally, non-material adjustments in prior year asset-level data and changes to presentation of the data has, in certain instances, resulted in minor impacts to the rounding of data since it was previously reported.\n- 2 Calculated based on an operational control approach in line with World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development guidance. Consumption of fuel and consumption of electricity refers to annual quantity of energy consumed from the combustion of fuel; and the operation of any facility; and energy consumed resulting from the purchase of electricity, heat, steam or cooling by the company for its own use. Data has been rounded to the nearest 1 PJ to be consistent with asset/regional energy information in this Report. In some instances, the sum of totals for sources, commodities and assets may differ due to rounding.",

Renewable energy consumption at Escondida and Pampa Norte is currently sourced from invoice data; some refinements may need to be made to renewable energy reported from these assets in the future.\n- 4 BHP currently uses GWP from the IPCC AR5 based on a 100-year timeframe for all operations. Minerals Americas operated assets transitioned from IPCC Assessment Report 4 (AR4) to AR5 GWP in FY2022; all other operated assets transitioned in FY2021.\n- 5 Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions have been calculated based on an operational control approach (unless otherwise stated) in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. For more information refer to the BHP Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions calculation methodology available at bhp.com/climate. Data has been rounded to the nearest 0.1 MtCO2-e to be consistent with asset/regional GHG emissions information in this Report. In some instances, the sum of totals for sources, commodities and assets may differ due to rounding.\n- 6 Scope 1 refers to direct GHG emissions from operated assets. Scope 1 emissions currently include diesel consumed in explosives; some refinements may be made to emissions reported from this source in future.\n- 7 Scope 2 refers to indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heat or cooling that is consumed by operated assets. Our Scope 2 GHG emissions have been calculated using the market-based method, in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2 Guidance unless otherwise specified. A residual mix emission factor is currently unavailable to account for grid electricity emissions remaining after removal of quantities directly contracted between parties; this may result in double counting of low emissions or renewable electricity contributions across grid-supplied consumers. Scope 2 emissions from Escondida and Pampa Norte are currently sourced from metered data; some refinements may need to be made to emissions reported from these assets in the future.\n- 8 Divested operations are BMC (sale completed on 3 May 2022), BHP's Petroleum business (merger with Woodside completed on 1 June 2022) and Onshore US assets (sale completed on 31 October 2018). Nonmaterial acquisitions and divestments are included in the total.\n- 9 For this purpose, copper equivalent production has been calculated based on FY2022 average realised product prices for FY2022 production, FY2021 average realised product prices for FY2021 production and FY2020 average realised product prices for FY2020 production. Production figures used are consistent with energy and GHG emissions reporting boundaries (i.e. BHP operational control) and are taken on 100 per cent basis.\n- 10  Scope 1 GHG emissions from BHP's facilities covered by the Safeguard Mechanism administered by the Clean Energy Regulator in Australia, Saskatchewan Output-Based Performance Standards (OBPS) program in Canada, and the distillate and gasoline emissions from turbine boilers at the cathode plant at Escondida covered by the Green Tax legislation in Chile. FY2020 has been restated from 80 per cent due to changes in reported emissions at Australian Petroleum operations.\n- 11  More information on our strategy to further reduce GHG emissions, including our investments in low-emissions technology and natural climate solutions, is available in the BHP Climate Change Report 2020 and the BHP Climate Transition Action Plan 2021 available at bhp.com/climate.\n- 12  From FY2021, we have calculated an additional operational GHG emissions total for the reporting year including contributions from the retirement of a quantity of carbon offsets. This figure is calculated by subtracting the number of carbon offsets retired, if any (each equivalent to a single tonne of CO2-e reduced or 'removed' from the atmosphere) from the total GHG emissions reported under our operational control boundary for the year. This is not intended to establish a recurrent approach. More information on our approach to carbon offset use and the specifics of the carbon offsets retired in FY2021 is available at bhp.com/climate. BHP is committed to transparently disclosing the carbon offsets that we retire towards meeting our own climate change targets and goals. We did not retire any offsets for this purpose in FY2022.\n- 13  In FY2022, the Caval Ridge operation moved to a facility-specific emissions calculation methodology for fugitive emissions as detailed in the NGER (Measurement) Determination 2008 (Method 2 - extraction of coal). When comparing FY2022 to FY2021, this methodology change contributed 1.6 per cent of the overall 4 per cent reduction in our Percentage of Scope 1 GHG emissions from methane.\n\n## Our operational decarbonisation pathway\n\n## Decarbonising electricity\n\nDecarbonising electricity by switching to renewables at our operated assets is a priority decarbonisation lever for this decade, in addition to a focus on preparing the business for widespread diesel displacement in the 2030s. The majority of our electricity supply is delivered via electricity networks and is accounted for as Scope 2 emissions. We are currently working to reduce Scope 2 emissions via renewable energy PPAs, such as those already executed in Chile, Queensland, South Australia and grid connected sites in Western Australia. Additionally, work is underway to decarbonise remote power demands in Western Australia either through PPAs with independent power producers or via 'behind the meter' renewable energy installations where we self-generate electricity in the Pilbara.\n\nPower decarbonisation progressed with key successes in FY2022 including:\n\n- -  The Minerals Americas PPAs became operational in August 2021 and January 2022, with Escondida and Spence aiming to use 100 per cent renewable electricity by the mid-2020s.\n- -  BMA's PPA with CleanCo will deliver approximately 50 per cent of its annual electricity from renewable sources by 2025. 1\n- -  Nickel West signed PPAs to provide its operations with renewable power, with agreements for the Flat Rocks Wind Farm, the Merredin Solar Farm and the Northern Goldfields Solar Project.\n- -  Olympic Dam entered into renewable energy supply arrangements for up to 50 per cent of its electricity by 2025. 2\n\n## Decarbonising diesel\n\nDiesel displacement represents the largest technical challenge to our decarbonisation pathway for operated assets in terms of the magnitude of GHG emissions abatement required, predominantly driven by consumption by our haul truck fleet. We are taking steps now to accelerate the essential role that original equipment manufacturers must play in the development of new equipment to address emissions from our trucks and rail fleet. This includes partnerships to trial batteryelectric locomotives, to develop electrified haul trucks and collaboration such as the 'Charge On Innovation Challenge' aimed at developing\n\n- 1 Including the purchase of large-scale generation certificates (LGCs).\n- 2   Including the purchase of LGCs. A portion of the LGCs are to be created from the new Port Augusta Renewable Energy Park.\n\nconcepts for large-scale haul truck electrification and charging systems. In addition to progressing the availability of fleet solutions for zero emission material movement, we are working on readying the business for electrification of material movement by better understanding the energy balance associated with a fully electrified operation, quantifying future electricity demand and associated infrastructure requirements (e.g. transmission lines), modelling potential changes to our concept of operations, and evaluating our reliance on supporting infrastructure such as trolley lines and fast charging capabilities.\n\n## Decarbonising fugitive emissions\n\nAlthough currently relatively small in relation to other emissions sources at BHP's operated assets, fugitive methane emissions pose considerable technical and economic challenges for our abatement ambitions. We are working closely with a range of leading organisations in technology, research and industry across the globe, to develop new approaches and address the issue collectively. This includes investigating opportunities for improving the comprehensiveness and accuracy of methane emissions measurement. Under current reporting requirements, we use a combination of direct measurement and default, productionbased factors for different coal mine methane sources. While emerging satellite and aerialbased sensing technology is providing new and potentially valuable perspectives, much more work is required to understand its practical application to geographically large, diffuse sources of very dilute methane such as open-cut coal mines - particularly in crowded neighbourhoods such as the Bowen Basin and Hunter Valley where numerous mines co-exist in close proximity with a range of other significant industrial and agricultural methane sources.\n\n## Project prioritisation\n\nThrough studies and our capital allocation process, we seek to optimise the risk and reward proposition for operational decarbonisation projects to allocate capital and optimise decarbonisation at a portfolio level. We have developed an internal marginal abatement cost curve designed to support the allocation of capital towards the most economically efficient and effective decarbonisation projects.\n\nWe regularly monitor our forecasted operational GHG emissions to check we are on track. As a result of actions taken in recent years, particularly securing the supply of renewable energy at some operations, we achieved our short-term target, for FY2022, and our currently projected performance in FY2030 is tracking to plan against our medium-term target. Progression of planned project studies are regularly reviewed.\n\n## Value chain GHG emissions\n\nWe recognise the importance of supporting the climate transition in our value chain. In 2020, BHP set Scope 3 emissions goals for 2030 to support decarbonisation for processing of our steelmaking products and maritime transportation of our products. In 2021, we added to these goals with a long-term goal and targets for Scope 3, supported by an action",

Access by steelmakers to higher-quality metallurgical coal and iron ore products, which enables them to be more efficient and lower-emissions intensity, is an important component of the transition to a low-carbon future. To support this, we are assessing the opportunity to implement beneficiation at our Jimblebar iron ore operation and metallurgical coal product improvements at our BMA operations.\n\nIn FY2022, BHP signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to partner with South Korean steelmaking company POSCO to study optimising coal/coke quality for lowcarbon blast furnace operation and CCUS. This is in addition to our existing partnerships with Baowu, JFE and HBIS. Across the four partnerships, we are working with companies that represent approximately 12 per cent of reported global steel production capacity, covering 31 per cent of our direct sales in iron ore and 19 per cent in metallurgical coal in FY2022. BHP has committed to invest up to US$75 million in research and development\n\nof steel decarbonisation pathways through these customer partnerships. The goal of these partnerships is to support the maturation and scaling-up of fit-for-purpose solutions across the steelmaking value-chain in all stages of steel decarbonisation.\n\nWe intend to progress our customer partnerships over three phases:\n\n- 1.   Conduct feasibility studies or lab/bench-scale research and development in priority areas.\n- 2.   Pilot-scale trial, where we jointly test potential solutions to key technical challenges at a larger scale that is sufficient to understand the impact of raw material and operational parameters.\n- 3.   Trial at a customer plant, where we focus on optimal, high impact decarbonisation solutions for deployment on a limited basis at select sites.\n\nIn FY2023, we intend to progress a subset of existing customer partnerships on projects that in aggregate have the potential to deliver 30 per cent emissions intensity reduction if adopted at scale post-2030. We will also continue exploring other partnerships that are complementary to our geographic or technology priorities, or that can help make existing projects more effective and efficient. For instance, on 20 July 2022, we announced a new MOU with Tata Steel to collaborate on the use of biomass as a source of energy and the application of CCU in steel production.\n\n## Maritime\n\nOur strategy for supporting the maritime industry's climate transition includes advocacy, adoption of low- and zero-emissions fuels or other efficiency technologies (like wind-assisted propulsion) and deploying real-time data analytics to optimise vessel and route selection to improve operational efficiency. For example, in FY2022:\n\n- -Advocacy: We signed the industry call to action with more than 150 other organisations urging governments to commit to decarbonising international shipping by 2050, surpassing the levels of ambition set out in the International Maritime Organisation's Initial GHG Strategy. This is in addition to the advocacy work we do with the Global Centre for Maritime Decarbonisation in Singapore, of which we became a founding member in FY2021.\n- -Zero-emission fuels: We joined the US Government's First Mover's Coalition, launched at COP26 in Glasgow, as a member in the shipping sector. This means we commit to 10 per cent of BHP's products shipped to our customers on our time charter vessels being on vessels using zero-emissions fuels by FY2030. 2 BHP has also formed a consortium with Rio Tinto, Oldendorff, Star Bulk and the Global Maritime Forum to analyse and support the development of an iron ore maritime green corridor, fuelled by green ammonia.\n- 2 Subject to the availability of technology, supply, safety standards and the establishment of reasonable thresholds for price premiums.",

BHP has chartered the world's first LNG-fuelled Newcastlemax bulk carriers to transport iron ore from Western Australia to Asia from Eastern Pacific Shipping (EPS) for five years and awarded the LNG fuel contract to Shell. The fuel, along with improved efficiency of the vessel design, is expected to reduce GHG emissions intensity by up to 30 per cent on a per voyage basis. We have already operationalised two vessels and expect to deliver another three vessels in FY2023. BHP is also exploring biofuels as an interim GHG emission abatement option for shipping. In FY2022, we issued a Request for Proposal for procurement of sustainablecertified (REDII or ISCC) 1 biodiesel.\n\n## Procurement\n\nIn FY2022, we conducted a survey and assessment of the climate positions of our top 500 direct suppliers, representing approximately 76 per cent of our spend. 2 Through this study, we found that 27 per cent of the suppliers surveyed have Scope 1 and Scope 2 targets and/or goals aligned with our own. In the coming years, we intend to systematise our tracking and engagement of suppliers in relation to their public climate strategies.\n\nIn order to engage and incentivise our suppliers, we integrated climate commitments into our sourcing document and evaluation criteria. We intend to continue to refine and integrate metrics related to incentivising positive climate outcomes from our suppliers going forward.\n\n## Scope 3 GHG emissions performance\n\nThe most material part of BHP's reported Scope 3 emissions inventory comes from the downstream processing of our products, in particular from the emissions generated by steelmaking through the processing of iron ore and metallurgical coal. We estimate that in FY2022, emissions associated with the processing of our sold products was 307 MtCO2-e, an increase of 2 per cent from FY2021. The increase comes primarily from an increase in the production of iron ore from Samarco.\n\nAfter the merger of our Petroleum business with Woodside, emissions associated with the use of our energy products is now only from energy coal, 3 which in FY2022 was 38 MtCO2-e.\n\nWe are also progressing and improving our approach and methodology for GHG emissions estimations. Key refinements to our methodology for Scope 3 this year, in line with the GHG Protocol, include:\n\n- -Categories 1 and 2 Purchased goods and services (including capital goods): We piloted switching the emissions estimation of high-spend goods from select categories (including explosives, grinding media, conveyor belts, tyres, and select bulk materials) from spend-based emissions\n- and non-battery products to increase transparency as our nickel business grows to be sufficiently material to report.\n- -Category 11 Use of sold products: BHP has historically marketed a small portion of BMA products against thermal coal indexes. In FY2022, this portion was approximately 6 per cent, up from 2 per cent in FY2021. For purposes of enhancing the transparency and accuracy of our Scope 3 emissions reporting, for FY2022 we have broken out the energy coal portion of BMA product. The portion of energy coal in BMA's product mix is influenced by both production and market forces; we anticipate that assessments into improved product quality will support a reduction in BMA products marketed as thermal coal.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to the BHP Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions calculation methodology available at bhp.com/climate.\n\n- factors to industry average quantity-based emissions factors or emissions factors sourced directly from suppliers.\n- -Categories 4 and 9 Upstream and downstream transportation and distribution: We successfully developed and operationalised a carbon accounting and decision support system tailored to ship chartering, leveraging DNV's Veracity platform.\n- -Category 10 Processing of sold products:\n- -  We increased the granularity of calculations for downstream emissions associated with the processing of our copper products, removing the double counting of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions previously present in our calculations.\n- -  We also began reporting downstream Scope 3 emissions for nickel processing accounting for emissions from battery\n\n## Scope 3 GHG emissions by category (MtCO2-e) 1\n\n| Year ended 30 June                               | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Upstream                                         |        |        |        |\n| Purchased goods and services                     |        |        |        |\n| (including capital goods) 2                      | 9.9    | 10.1   | 9.8    |\n| Fuel and energy related activities               | 1.0    | 1.1    | 1.2    |\n| Upstream transportation and distribution 3       | 4.6    | 4.8    | 4.6    |\n| Business travel 4                                | 0.1    | 0.1    | 0.1    |\n| Employee commuting 4                             | 0.3    | 0.4    | 0.2    |\n| Downstream                                       |        |        |        |\n| Downstream transportation and distribution 5     | 3.2    | 3.1    | 2.9    |\n| Investments (i.e. our non-operated assets) 6     | 2.7    | 2.7    | 2.7    |\n| Processing of sold products 7                    |        |        |        |\n| GHG emissions from steelmaking 8                 | 305.3  | 300.5  | 292.9  |\n| - Iron ore processing to crude steel             | 270.8  | 260.7  | 252.8  |\n| - Metallurgical coal processing to crude steel 9 | 34.5   | 39.8   | 40.1   |\n| Copper processing 10                             | 1.0    | 1.0    | 1.0    |\n| Nickel processing 11                             | 0.3    |        |        |\n| Total processing of sold products                | 306.7  | 301.5  | 294.0  |\n| Use of sold products                             |        |        |        |\n| Energy coal 12,13                                | 37.6   | 38.3   | 56.4   |\n| Natural gas 13                                   | 17.4   | 19.5   | 20.6   |\n| Crude oil and condensates 13                     | 15.9   | 16.8   | 17.9   |\n| Natural gas liquids 13                           | 1.7    | 1.8    | 1.9    |\n| Total use of sold products                       | 72.6   | 76.4   | 96.8   |\n| Total Scope 3 GHG emissions                      | 401.2  | 400.1  | 412.3  |\n| Total Scope 3 GHG emissions                      |        |        |        |\n| (adjusted for divested operations) 14            | 364.3  | 359.7  | 369.5  |\n\n- 3 Includes product transport where freight costs are covered by BHP, for example under Cost and Freight (CFR) or similar terms, as well as purchased transport services for process inputs to our operations. In FY2022, we successfully developed and operationalised a carbon accounting and decision support system tailored to ship chartering, leveraging DNV's Veracity platform. This also resulted in a restatement of our maritime emissions in the 'Upstream transportation and distribution' category for FY2021 and FY2020. For FY2022, we have also added GHG emissions associated with inbound freight to this category of purchased goods that we transitioned to a quantity method in the 'Purchased goods and services (including capital goods)' category.

In FY2022, we successfully developed and operationalised a carbon accounting and decision support system tailored to ship chartering, leveraging DNV's Veracity platform. This also resulted in a restatement of our maritime emissions in the 'Downstream transportation and distribution' category for FY2021 and FY2020. Previously reported GHG emissions for this category were 3.8 MtCO2-e in FY2021 and 4.0 MtCO2-e in FY2020.\n- 7 Scope 3 GHG emissions associated with downstream processing of our zinc, gold, silver, ethane, cobalt, and uranium oxide products are not currently included, as production volumes are relatively low and a large range of possible end uses apply and/or downstream emissions are estimated to be immaterial. Processing/refining of petroleum products is also excluded as these emissions are considered immaterial compared to the end-use product combustion reported in the 'Use of sold products' category.\n- 6 For BHP, this category covers the Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions (on an equity basis) from our assets that are owned as a joint venture but not operated by BHP. In FY2022, all GHG emissions estimates from non-operated assets were developed from data provided directly by operators. Emissions from Tamakaya Energ\u00eda SpA (i.e. the Kelar Power plant) that are additional to the emissions reported under Scope 2 for Escondida and Pampa Norte under the operational control boundary are reported in the Scope 3 'Investments' (i.e. our non-operated assets) category. The categorisation of Scope 3 emissions from Tamakaya Energ\u00eda SpA is under review and may change in the future. Tamakaya Energ\u00eda SpA emissions for FY2021 and FY2020 have been restated to include emissions associated with Kelar Power Plant generation that was sold to the grid and to update data that was provisional in FY2021. Due to the effective economic date of 31 December 2020 for the sale of BHP's interest in Cerrej\u00f3n, Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (on an equity basis) from Cerrej\u00f3n are not included in FY2022. Scope 1 and 2 emissions (on an equity basis) from our Petroleum non-operated assets are reported for the Rhourde Ouled Djemma (ROD) Integrated Development, Algeria up to the date of divestment of our interest in the ROD Integrated Development in April 2022, and for the other Petroleum non-operated assets up to the completion date of the merger of our Petroleum business with Woodside of 1 June 2022. Previously reported GHG emissions for this category were 2.5 MtCO2-e in FY2021 and 2.6 MtCO2-e in FY2020.\n- 8 All our iron ore and metallurgical coal products are assumed to be processed into steel. Allocation of steelmaking GHG emissions to BHP's metallurgical coal is based on the global average input mass ratio of metallurgical coal vs iron ore to the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) steelmaking route. The GHG emission factor used to estimate Scope 3 GHG emissions reflects the blast furnace integrated steelmaking route into which the majority of BHP's steelmaking raw materials portfolio is sold. The estimation also considers BHP iron ore product quality and its impact on the amount of ore required to produce steel. We will monitor and adjust, as required, the balance of intensity factors to reflect any evolution in our product quality and/or flows through to other pathways (such as direct reduced iron electric arc furnace (DRI-EAF)).\n- 10  In FY2022, we increased the granularity of calculations for downstream emissions associated with the processing of our copper products. We now split our product volumes into copper concentrates that are processed into cathodes by third parties and our own copper cathodes, which are assumed to be processed into copper semi-fabricated products. This has also removed the double counting of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions previously present in our calculations. This has resulted in a restatement of copper processing in the 'Processing of sold products' category for FY2021 and FY2020. Previously reported GHG emissions for copper processing in the 'Processing of sold products' category were 5.0 MtCO2-e in FY2021 and 5.2 MtCO2-e in FY2020.\n- 9 Emissions associated with customers' processing of metallurgical coal products (on an equity basis) from BMC are reported up to the completion date of divestment of our interest in BMC of 3 May, 2022. This does not have an impact on total GHG emissions reported from steelmaking due to the integrated nature of our calculations with our iron ore production volumes, and therefore does not impact the illustrative 'Total Scope 3 emissions (adjusted for divested operations)' figure provided at the end of the table. See footnote 14 for more details.\n- 11  In FY2022, we also began reporting downstream Scope 3 emissions for nickel processing to increase transparency as our nickel business grows to be sufficiently material to report. Our methodology covers downstream emissions from customers' processing of BHP's nickel products in four segments. Based on sales data, we estimate emissions of (1) our nickel intermediates that goes to third-party refiners; (2) nickel metal that goes into stainless steel and alloys production; (3) nickel metal that goes into nickel sulphate (NiSO 4 ) for battery value chains; and (4) BHP's NiSO 4 that goes directly into battery precursor active material production. Historical emissions have not been retroactively reported as GHG emissions for nickel processing in the 'Processing of sold products' category are estimated to be immaterial.\n- 13  All crude oil and condensates are conservatively assumed to be refined and combusted as diesel. Energy coal, natural gas and natural gas liquids are assumed to be combusted. Scope 3 emissions associated with customers' use of energy products from our Petroleum business were reported up to the date of divestment of our interest in the ROD Integrated Development in April 2022, and up to the effective date of the merger of our Petroleum business with Woodside of 1 June 2022 for the other Petroleum assets.\n- 12  BHP has historically marketed a small portion of BMA products against thermal coal indexes. In FY2022, this portion was approximately 6 per cent, up from 2 per cent in FY2021. For purposes of enhancing the transparency and accuracy of our Scope 3 emissions reporting, for FY2022 we have estimated the energy coal component of BMA production based on the percentage of BMA product marketed as thermal coal and associated GHG emissions and included that under energy coal in the 'Use of sold products' category. We have not restated energy coal emissions in the 'Use of sold products' category for FY2021 and FY2020 as the energy coal component of BMA's sales in those years is estimated to be immaterial. We will continue to review the energy coal contribution from BMA in future years. Due to the effective economic date of 31 December 2020 for sale of BHP's interest in Cerrej\u00f3n, Scope 3 emissions for customers' processing of product from Cerrej\u00f3n are not included in FY2022.\n- 14  Due to the merger of our Petroleum business with Woodside (completed on 1 June 2022), divestment of our interest in the ROD Integrated Development (completed in April 2022), divestment of our interest in BMC (completed on 3 May 2022), and divestment of our interest in Cerrej\u00f3n (completed 31 December 2020), associated downstream Scope 3 emissions from the 'Use of sold products' and 'Investments' categories are removed to generate this illustrative total, noting that other categories have not been removed for the merger or divestments due to the complexity of underlying data. Due to the current methodology we use for estimating steelmaking emissions, the removal of BMC emissions does not impact the total for 'Processing of sold products' category (also see footnote 9). Due to the effective economic date of 31 December 2020 for sale of BHP's interest in Cerrej\u00f3n, Scope 3 emissions (on an equity basis) from Cerrej\u00f3n are not included in FY2022 reporting. As a result, the removal of Cerrej\u00f3n only impacts FY2021 and FY2020 emissions totals for the 'Total Scope 3 GHG emissions (adjusted for divested operations)' figure.\n\n## Natural climate solutions\n\nInvesting in natural ecosystems is a costeffective and immediately available solution to mitigate climate change that often provides sustainability co-benefits, such as biodiversity conservation, improved water quality or support for local communities. We support the development of market mechanisms that channel private sector finance into projects that increase carbon storage or avoid GHG emissions through conservation, restoration and improved management of terrestrial landscapes, wetlands and coastal and marine\n\necosystems. We focus on project support, governance, knowledge and innovation, and market stimulation for carbon credits generated by these projects. For example, in FY2022 we launched a new A$3 million grants program to help drive the development of the Australian blue carbon market by providing funding and support to emerging blue carbon projects. 1\n\n## Governance\n\nBHP advocates for the development of efficient global carbon markets that facilitate high-quality offsetting that is both cost-effective and delivers\n\n- 1 For more information refer to bhp.com/news/articles/2022/06/new-bhp-grants-to-support-blue-carbon-market.\n- 2 For more information refer to bhp.com/sustainability/communities/social-investment.\n- 3 For example, we undertook a pilot carbon neutral commodity transaction with US copper cable and wire manufacturer, Southwire. We did not retire any of the offsets tied to that transaction against our own voluntary targets or goals.

We are an active member on several international carbon markets bodies including the International Emissions Trading Association and the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets.\n\n## Use of carbon credits or offsets\n\nBHP prioritises emissions reduction at our operated assets to achieve our Scope 1 and 2 target and goal, with investments in external carbon offset projects considered complementary to this 'structural abatement'.\n\nAlthough we prioritise internal emission reduction, we acknowledge a role for offsets in a temporary or transitional capacity while abatement options are being studied, as well as for 'hard to abate' emissions with limited or no current technological solutions, and where access to renewable energy is constrained.\n\nBHP has five potential 'use cases' for carbon offsets, to complement the structural emissions abatement that we prioritise (refer to the 'BHP Carbon Offset Use Cases' table). This includes contributing to our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emission reduction targets and goals and complying with emissions regulations (e.g. under the Australian Safeguard mechanism) as we work to decarbonise our business. We use our social investment to fund research into new and emerging natural carbon offsetting methodologies, and to fund offsets projects with social value co-benefits in line with our social value framework. 2 We also explore commercial opportunities to work with organisations in our value chain to supply offsets to supplement their focus on emissions abatement, including the bundling of offsets into product transactions. 3\n\n## Sourcing\n\nWe perform due diligence designed to ensure we invest in carbon offsets that adhere to the following minimum quality standards: 4\n\n- -Registered under an internationally recognised standard that independently verifies and issues voluntary carbon credits and/or satisfies national carbon offset standards for compliance offsets.\n- -Adheres to a robust emission reduction accounting methodology to provide assurance of the volume of emissions reduced through a project.\n- -Demonstrates that the emissions reductions are additional to ensure that the emissions would not have been reduced in the absence of a carbon offset market.\n- -Has a high likelihood of permanence to ensure the emissions reduction are ongoing and not reversed (e.g. in the case of forestry projects, the trees are not cut down or destroyed by a natural disaster).\n- -Provides robust mitigation against leakage ensuring an offsetting project does not increase emissions elsewhere (e.g. an area is protected from deforestation through offsetting but another forest area is destroyed).",

We see a role for offsets from solutions that remove atmospheric carbon as well as avoid emissions. While we prioritise offsets from nature-based solutions, we also consider the sourcing of offsets from engineered solutions.\n\nBHP is committed to transparently disclosing the carbon offsets that we retire towards meeting our own climate change targets and goals. We did not retire any offsets for this purpose in FY2022.\n\n## Engagement and disclosure\n\nAchieving the aims of the Paris Agreement will require supportive policy across jurisdictions globally. The policy-making process is complex, and change is unlikely to be smooth or linear. We believe BHP can best support policy development by ensuring we meet our own climate targets, goals and strategies, continuing to make the case for the economic opportunities arising from the energy transition, and focusing on those policy areas where we are likely to have the greatest ability to influence change.\n\nOur Global Climate Policy Standards clarify how our policy positions on climate change should be reflected in our own advocacy and the advocacy of the associations we belong to. Over the past five years, we have introduced a range of measures to strengthen governance of our membership of industry associations and monitor their climate change advocacy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information on our approach to industry associations is available at bhp.com/about/operating-ethically/ industry-associations.\n\nBHP was one of the first companies to align its climate-related disclosures with the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's TCFD, of which our Vice President Sustainability\n\n3.\n\nRegulatory compliance\n\nUsing offsets to comply with regulation in our operational locations, as we work to decarbonise our business.\n\n4.\n\nSocial investment\n\nOffsets generated through our actions to develop global carbon markets, invest in nature and support communities to deliver social value.\n\nand Climate Change, Dr Fiona Wild, has been a member since its inception in late 2015. We published our Climate Change Report in 2020, and also participate in the CA100+ Net Zero Carbon Benchmark (NZCB), which assesses the world's largest corporate GHG emitters on their progress in the transition to the net zero future.\n\nIn September 2021, we published the CTAP, which sets out the steps BHP intends to take to reduce GHG emissions to net zero within our own operations and to pursue net zero in our value chain. The CTAP received approval from 84.9 per cent of shareholders in the 'Say on Climate' advisory vote at our AGMs in 2021.\n\nWe also engage on policy matters directly with government and through our membership of industry associations and issue-specific coalitions and initiatives. Examples of these engagements are provided at bhp.com and in the 'Climate policy engagement' section of our CTAP.\n\nOur TCFD-aligned disclosures and information in support of our NZCB assessment can be found throughout this Report, in our BHP Climate Change Report 2020 and CTAP and at bhp.com.

We strive to work with our customers, suppliers and other stakeholders in the value chain to create social value through sustainable practices across the full life cycle of our products.\n\nBHP takes a systems approach to value chain sustainability, designed to assess and work with others to improve the sustainability impacts of our upstream supply chains, inbound and outbound logistics, and our products as they move through extraction, processing and use.\n\nIn FY2022, BHP developed a sustainability standards strategy that defines our pathway for the implementation of responsible mining and sourcing standards. The strategy is focused on the foundations needed to enable a more efficient adoption of standards to better position BHP's participation in the sustainability\n\n5.\n\n## Commercial opportunities\n\nBundling offsets into BHP product transactions to differentiate our products and supplement our customers' focus on emissions abatement.\n\nstandards landscape. We also established a global sustainability standards team to enhance our systems and processes, integrate planning and enable a more strategic approach to the governance and implementation of sustainability standards across BHP's operated assets. This team also has accountability for sustainability reporting and disclosure, bringing together our work on sustainability standards and further strengthening our approach to transparency and standards across the value chain.\n\nThe standards that form part of our strategy are:\n\n- -  the Copper Mark\n- -  the London Metal Exchange (LME) Policy on Responsible Sourcing of LME-Listed Brands\n- -  the ICMM Mining Principles and associated Performance Expectations\n- -  the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management\n- -  Towards Sustainable Mining (TSM)\n\n## Accreditations\n\nOur Chilean operations Escondida and Spence, and Olympic Dam in Australia were awarded the Copper Mark during FY2022 to recognise their responsible production practices. The Copper Mark is a voluntary assurance framework that independently assesses participants in 32 critical areas, including environment, community, human rights and governance issues for mining, smelting and refining operations.\n\nEscondida, Spence and Olympic Dam also completed independent third-party verification of self-assessments against the ICMM Mining Principles and associated Performance Expectations. The ICMM Mining Principles require member companies to conduct a prioritisation process to determine which assets will be subject to third-party validation across a three-year cycle.\n\nAll BHP's operated assets have completed their self-assessments and the external validation sequence has been determined in consideration of commitments made by BHP to other standards, such as Copper Mark and the LME Policy on Responsible Sourcing of LME-Listed Brands, to enable operational efficiencies.\n\nWe recognise the importance of engaging in the sustainability standards ecosystem and we support simplification of the standards landscape and convergence of standards.

        "page_content": "specific standards is a complex task and in FY2022 we engaged in a number of forums focused on sustainability standards - through the ICMM, the Minerals Council of Australia and the Mining Association of Canada as well as with standard-setting bodies like the Copper Mark, and the OECD and LME.\n\nIn FY2022, BHP disclosed aspects of our sustainability performance through the LMEpassport, which is the LME's new digital credentials register to enable companies that trade LME-listed brands to disclose their sustainability metrics and certifications at corporate, asset and brand levels. BHP added information related to our copper and nickel LME-registered products from Olympic Dam, Escondida, Pampa Norte and Nickel West.\n\n## Due diligence\n\nIn FY2022, a cross-functional team defined a clear scope and began developing a due diligence management system for our minerals and metals supply chain that aligns with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (OECD Guidance). This means that, for our operated assets and our inbound supply chain of minerals and metals, BHP intends to adopt the OECD Guidance's Annex I five-step, risk-based due diligence framework in the form of a new due diligence management system. The new system will involve updating policies and procedures, and ensuring appropriate resources designed to identify, assess and manage risks in our minerals and metals supply chain where there is any origin, transport or trade association with conflict-affected and/or high-risk areas.\n\nAlignment with the OECD Guidance is a reflection of better practice supply chain due diligence and it is also a requirement under the responsible sourcing standards of leading mining and metals industry bodies, including the LME, the Copper Mark, the ICMM, and TSM. In FY2023, we aim to finalise our OECDaligned due diligence management system and commence implementation of that system for our minerals and metals supply chain.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information about the scope of our OECD-aligned due diligence refer to our Modern Slavery Statement 2022 to be published in September 2022 at bhp.com.\n\n## Emerging sustainability initiatives\n\nWe also continue to identify sustainability-related opportunities in BHP's value chain.\n\nWe see traceability as a key enabler to lifting sustainability standards across the value chain. In FY2022, BHP and leading US copper cable and wire manufacturer, Southwire, completed their first 'carbon neutral' 1 copper transaction, involving delivery from BHP's mines in Chile to Southwire's processing activities in Georgia, United States. The pilot forms part of a collaboration for BHP that reflects our Climate Transition Action Plan commitment to support industry to develop\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntechnologies for improved traceability and the pursuit of carbon-neutral production.\n\nAdditionally, circular economy principles are an increasingly critical consideration for building sustainable supply chains in relation to our commodities that meet growing demand for our products, support goals to reduce GHG emissions and minimise the impact of mining and downstream processing on the environments and communities where we operate. Across the business, we are working to identify opportunities that leverage our capabilities to create solutions that can contribute towards a circular economy.\n\n## 7.10 Community\n\nMaking a positive contribution to the social and economic wellbeing of the communities where we operate requires long-term partnerships based on respect, transparency and trust. Our actions and approach are governed by the Our Requirements for Community standard and Our Code .\n\n## Community understanding\n\nWe understand our activities have the potential to create social, cultural, environmental and human rights impacts, both positive and negative. To analyse the potential risks to communities where we operate, we conduct due diligence to better understand social and human rights contexts, work collaboratively with our community stakeholders, and look for opportunities to create social value.\n\nAs part of our due diligence processes, we conduct community perception research in local host communities for each of our operated assets every two years. In FY2022, quantitative and qualitative surveys at all operated assets provided insights into the public's general concerns and priorities as well as perceptions of mining sector and BHP performance. Globally, community perceptions of our overall performance is positive, being on par or above average when compared to others in the sector in most markets. We tend to be perceived as being safety driven, behaving in a way that promotes diversity and inclusion, having a positive relationship with the community, and providing opportunities for local employment and procurement. The areas where people perceive room for improvement include exceeding regulatory requirements, doing the right thing by the environment, being a leader in water management and taking a more active role in the global response to climate change.\n\nOur operated assets are also required to maintain annual stakeholder engagement plans and conduct regular engagement activities, including one-on-one meetings, multi-stakeholder roundtables, issue-based consultation and written communications. These engagements provide a valuable space for more open and in-depth dialogues with stakeholders on issues such as those raised in our community perception research, exploring mutually beneficial solutions and building trust.\n\n## Community events, complaints and grievances\n\nWith no significant community events recorded as resulting from BHP operated activities in FY2022, our five-year target of no significant community events between FY2018 and FY2022 has been met. 2 There were 50 community concerns and 106 complaints (five of which were classified as grievances) 3 received globally across our operated assets through our local complaints and grievance mechanisms. This represented a total increase of 8 per cent from FY2021 figures. The increase is attributable in large part to an overall rise in the level of community reporting, which we consider to be a positive sign that provides earlier opportunities to seek to address issues and understand sentiment to avoid or reduce the adverse impact and risk of escalation.\n\nThese concerns, complaints and grievances included:\n\n- -  The two most common themes across BHP operated assets were concerns regarding: (i) the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated recovery initiatives; and (ii) local employment.\n- -  In Chile, community concerns focused on environmental impacts and the overall sustainability of the mining industry, the development of local communities and the impacts of automation. Complaints about contractor behaviour included claims that certain commitments were not honoured and some local Indigenous community stakeholders raised concerns about water resources in the high Andean wetlands and greater employment opportunities at Escondida.\n- -  In Canada, community concerns and complaints related to the increase in activity at the Jansen Potash Project, including routes of haul trucks and greater community support and local procurement opportunities.\n- -  In Australia, key community issues centred on local employment and associated skills and labour shortages, the impact on local procurement from supply chain delays, and our COVID-19 vaccination mandate with particular mental health and wellbeing concerns raised by Traditional Owners. Community complaints also related to operational impacts, largely lighting, dust, noise, odour, emissions, blasting overpressure and vibration.\n- -  Following the announcement of the divestment of our interest in BMC, some local stakeholders focused on whether community support would continue under new ownership and the local Traditional Owners sought assurance that the Indigenous Land Use Agreement would be honoured by the new owners.\n- -  The announcement that BHP would retain New South Wales Energy Coal and intends to proceed with a managed process to cease mining at the asset by the end of FY2030 was received in a neutral to positive manner overall, with community stakeholders generally expressing support for BHP retaining the asset to a managed closure rather than selling to new owners.\n- 1 'Carbon neutral' is not intended to imply certification under any standard or application of a particular methodology and includes all those greenhouse gas emissions as defined for BHP reporting purposes.\n- 2 A significant event resulting from BHP operated activities is one with an actual severity rating of four or above, based on our internal severity rating scale (tiered from one to five by increasing severity) as defined in our mandatory minimum performance requirements for risk management.\n- 3 An event or community complaint relating to an adverse impact/event that has escalated to the point where a third-party intervention or adjudication is required to resolve it.",

We intend to also pursue opportunities to improve our overall due diligence process, such as enhancing our external human rights research, better highlighting stakeholder voices throughout our due diligence and better integrating human rights analysis into business planning cycles and our Risk Framework.\n\nOur Modern Slavery Statement 2022, prepared under the Australian Modern Slavery Act (2018) and UK Modern Slavery Act (2015), provides additional information regarding the management of modern slavery risks for our operations and global supply network and will be available in September 2022 at bhp.com.\n\n## Response and remedy\n\nIn FY2022, we continued to evaluate feedback from our stakeholders, external experts and internal teams on how to make our complaints and grievance mechanisms more accessible and our internal culture and processes more effective in identifying concerns that have a human rights connection. We plan to embed this feedback in our approach by the end of FY2023.\n\nWe recognise our business activities create human rights risks and potential impacts across several different areas. In FY2023, we will continue to integrate a human rights perspective when designing, implementing and evaluating our ways of working related to these issues. The human rights signpost table highlights the priority areas identified by our human rights impact assessments and where key updates may be found in this Report.\n\n## Reporting and disclosure\n\nDuring FY2023, we intend to develop a refreshed human rights reporting framework that will:\n\n- -  better align to the UNGP Reporting Framework Index\n- -  include quantitative metrics for our operations and our supply chain, as well as qualitative commentary and the voices of rights holders\n- -  focus on mid- to long-term outcomes in addition to short-term outputs\n\n## 7.12 Security services\n\n## Security risk management\n\nIdentifying, understanding and managing physical security risks is critical to the protection of BHP's people, assets and reputation.\n\nThe security risks we face are complex, constantly evolving and differ across the jurisdictions where we operate. We seek to understand the physical security threats we face, to inform the development of security programs that protect our people within a dynamic and constantly changing external environment. We use security controls and mandatory minimum performance requirements to reduce the likelihood of security risks materialising and mitigate their impact if they do. We support this with external environment monitoring, including through our enterprise emerging risk process, to identify changes in the external environment that could shift our exposure to security threats across the jurisdictions where we operate.\n\nBHP is committed to aligning with the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights and sets mandatory minimum performance requirements for our operated assets, to support implementation of these principles.\n\n## Responding to a rapidly changing external environment\n\nWe are operating in an increasingly volatile, uncertain world, where the physical security risks we face are evolving from local criminal activity and asset protection risks to more complex transnational threats, which transcend traditional asset and jurisdictional boundaries. Key emerging themes include social activism, international criminal enterprise, global terrorism and war. We are also seeing the increasingly integrated nature of physical security with other risk areas, including the physical security threats that stem from cybersecurity risks or climaterelated risks. These threats are developing against a backdrop of increasing antigovernment sentiment, inequality and political polarisation across the globe; challenges that have been exacerbated by COVID-19.\n\nTo respond to this shifting external landscape, in FY2022 we established a new Group Security function, to provide additional expertise and support to the business and conduct assurance over security risk management globally.\n\nPriorities for the function include revising our security framework, to refresh BHP's mandatory minimum global security requirements and developing a consistent taxonomy for defining and categorising security threats. This is designed to support robust security risk identification across our operated assets and functions. The team will also build upon its existing network of intelligence sources in FY2023, by establishing an integrated approach to threat intelligence. This will provide decisionmakers with a tailored and consolidated view of security insights and support riskinformed decisions.\n\nWe are also enhancing BHP's understanding of the key intersecting security risks that could impact us to provide an integrated view of potential vulnerabilities. This will be complemented by the implementation of a structured global assurance program.\n\n## 7.13 Indigenous peoples\n\nWe respect the distinct identities and perspectives of Indigenous peoples and recognise the rights, cultures, insights, aspirations and needs that result from those identities and perspectives. We also recognise our responsibility to develop partnerships based on respect and to pursue mutually beneficial outcomes. These responsibilities are central to BHP's Global Indigenous Peoples Framework.\n\nThe Global Indigenous Peoples Framework consists of three key elements:\n\n- 1   BHP Indigenous Peoples Policy Statement\n- 2 BHP Indigenous Peoples Strategy and Good Practice Guidance\n- 3   Regional Indigenous Peoples Plans\n\nFirst adopted in FY2015, this Framework has played a key part in guiding BHP towards being an organisation that engages meaningfully and respectfully with Indigenous peoples. However, it has been several years since it was developed and during this time the external environment and BHP's own purpose, strategy and operating footprint have significantly evolved. Accordingly, BHP has undertaken a review of the Framework, informed by an extensive process of internal and external research and consultation, including extensive engagement with Traditional Owners and First Nations representative organisations, leading external experts, BHP employees and leaders, and several investors.\n\nThis review has identified a number of opportunities for BHP to further strengthen the Framework, so that it continues to be aligned with our purpose, advances across our mandatory minimum requirements for community and human rights, and our social value framework and new 2030 goals.\n\nBHP agreement-making processes are built on the core principles of good faith negotiation aimed at achieving consent, with a focus on understanding the historical, legal, social, cultural and political contexts relevant to Indigenous peoples in the areas where we operate or seek to operate; and how our activities might impact the rights of potentially affected Indigenous peoples.\n\nThe newly established Global Indigenous Engagement and Community team continues to progress immediate opportunities for alignment and improvement initiatives across our operated assets and functions, globally. New senior Indigenous leaders have been appointed and are actively working with the regional teams to support our approach to cultural heritage management, agreement-making, procurement, employment and social investment - all of which are core components of our Global Indigenous Peoples Framework.",

We seek to ensure our standards are best practice and forward looking. On 18 October 2021, the Commonwealth Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia handed down its report into the destruction of Indigenous heritage sites at Juukan Gorge. While there were no adverse findings or recommendations made specifically in relation to BHP, we are committed to understanding the lessons available from this extensive body of work.\n\nSignificantly, the finalisation of the Committee's Report has coincided with important law reform in Western Australia. The Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2021 (WA) provides a revised framework for the recognition, protection, conservation and preservation of Western Australian Aboriginal cultural heritage. The new Act repeals the outdated Aboriginal Heritage Act 1972 (WA) and removes the former section 18 approvals process.\n\nIn advance of this law reform, in FY2021, BHP confirmed to Traditional Owners that we would not act on existing section 18 approvals from the Western Australian Government without further extensive consultation with the Traditional Owners. In the case of the South Flank project, BHP and the Banjima people established a Heritage Advisory Council. In the period since, the Heritage Advisory Council has met many times to consider appropriate heritage management practices in the Central Pilbara and to record this common understanding in the form of Cultural Heritage Management Plans that will guide BHP's operations at those locations.\n\nWe are committed to the making of land use agreements to formalise relationships in a manner that is responsive to the aspirations of Traditional Owners and in compliance with the law. These agreements create partnerships designed to realise mutually beneficial outcomes.\n\nFurther to the Indigenous Land Use Agreement reached between BMC and the Barada Barna people in FY2021, in April 2022, BMC and the Widi people entered into a native title project agreement for shared country where both the Barada Barna and Widi peoples hold determined\n\nnative title rights in the vicinity of BMC's South Walker Creek Mine. In assuming majority ownership and operational control of BMC, Stanmore Resources will be subject to this agreement and its commitments.\n\nWith our existing Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) having concluded in FY2022, we commenced the development of a new FY2023-FY2027 RAP. In a commitment to moving beyond consultation, BHP has been codeveloping this new RAP with our stakeholders including, Traditional Owners, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations, community partners and our employees across Australia. This process has involved nine separate RAP forums held across Australia. The new RAP will also align to and embed the principles of our Global Indigenous Peoples Framework.\n\nBHP's spend with Indigenous businesses has steadily increased over the past four years. In FY2022, Minerals Australia saw an 75 per cent increase, to US$149.9 million, in our direct spend with Indigenous businesses across our operated assets compared to FY2021 levels. Compared to FY2021 levels, we also increased the number of Indigenous businesses we directly procure from by 53 per cent.\n\nIn May 2022, we announced that WAIO intends to more than double its spend with Indigenous vendors to more than US$300 million by the end of FY2024, as it looks to create more opportunities for Indigenous businesses. We also achieved a significant milestone in FY2022 by reaching our Australian Indigenous employment target of 8 per cent, three years ahead of schedule.\n\nIn FY2022, in support of efforts to ensure COVID-19 vaccination was accessible to Indigenous Australians, BHP provided A$2 million to Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisations (ACCHOs) across Australia. These funds enabled Queensland, Western Australian, New South Wales and South Australian ACCHOs each to receive A$500,000 to distribute to their local Aboriginal Medical Service members or to collective programs that help local medical services accommodate demand. This contribution builds on a donation of A$3.9 million in FY2021, which laid the foundation for partnerships between BHP and organisations in the Indigenous-led health sector as COVID-19 emerged.\n\n## Minerals Americas\n\nIn line with our Indigenous Peoples Plan for South America, we seek to work closely with the communities where we operate to make a positive contribution, including through reaching agreements with local communities.\n\n## In FY2022:\n\n- -  We created and resourced a new Minerals Americas Indigenous Engagement team to centralise accountability for Indigenous engagement. This promotes alignment across our regions of operation and enables us to share standards and processes designed to support Indigenous communities affected by our existing operations.\n- -  We delivered against our commitment to strengthen our cultural heritage practices",

Commencing with a particular emphasis on our operations in Chile, we:\n\n- -  established new critical controls and procedures to manage cultural heritage values within and around our operations\n- -  introduced new information systems and geospatial tools to track and protect cultural heritage sites\n- -  created a dedicated team within our HSE function to administer cultural heritage management activities at the asset level\n- -  reinforced the consideration of cultural heritage management dimensions within our agreement-making practices\n- -  engaged independent experts to analyse existing practice against the emerging Indigenous policy landscape\n\nAt Escondida, we continued to advance the implementation of the agreement concerning the environmental sustainability of the Salar de Punta Negra, signed at the end of FY2021 between Escondida, the Chilean Attorney General's Office, the Peine Atacame\u00f1o Indigenous community and the Council of Atacame\u00f1o Peoples. Key governance mechanisms have been established and the terms of reference for the conduct of technical studies are currently under development.\n\nAt Cerro Colorado, as part of the Indigenous consultation process for operational continuity of this asset, we reached agreement with the San Isidro de Quipisca Indigenous agricultural association. Within the framework provided by the Opportunity Agreement Development Plans, FY2022 saw BHP support the advancement of electrical infrastructure that benefits approximately 80 rural families within the Parca Aymara Indigenous community.\n\nAcross our Chilean assets, FY2022 delivered steady increases in our levels of Indigenous workforce participation - with representation reaching 8.7 per cent at year-end. In total, BHP's regional annual spend with Indigenous business for the period was US$9.2 million.\n\nIn Canada, following the approval of our Jansen Potash Project in Saskatchewan, we continued our commitment to strengthening our Indigenous relationships and engagement practices with those Indigenous communities impacted by the project. There are six primary First Nations in the vicinity of the Jansen Potash Project. BHP has entered into Opportunity Agreements with all\n\nsix. Two of these agreements were targeted for refresh in FY2022. In the period, we finalised the review of our Opportunity Agreement with the Fishing Lake First Nation and reached an agreement in principle with regards to refreshing our Opportunity Agreement with the Beardy's & Okemasis' Cree Nation. The Opportunity Agreements we have entered with our Indigenous partners continue to provide a governance framework and a platform to enable economic participation.\n\nIn support of the Canadian Government Truth and Reconciliation Commission's calls to advance the process of reconciliation in Canada, we plan to develop our first RAP for Canada in FY2023. The RAP will be designed to enable BHP to address the needs and interests of Indigenous communities within our direct area of influence. The RAP is expected to be co-developed with the stakeholders we seek relationships with, using similar principles to the process undertaken in Australia.\n\n## Resolution Copper\n\nResolution Copper Mining is owned by Rio Tinto (55 per cent) and BHP (45 per cent) and managed by Rio Tinto.\n\nWe acknowledge the Resolution Copper project area includes areas of cultural significance for Native American Tribes and their members. Development of the project continues to be studied and remains subject to regulatory reviews by federal, state and local governments. Resolution Copper Mining continues to cooperatively engage in these regulatory processes and has publicly stated its commitment to deepening ongoing engagement with, Native American Tribes and other stakeholders to understand and seek to mitigate potential negative impacts. We are monitoring and supporting Resolution Copper Mining's engagement processes.\n\n## 7.14 Social investment\n\nSocial investment is a further tool to create social value and contribute to the resilience of communities and the environment, in line with our broader business priorities. Our longstanding commitment is to invest not less than 1 per cent of pre-tax profits 1 in voluntary social and environmental initiatives. For FY2023-FY2030, our social investment will be assessed as a total over the seven-year goals period to FY2030, rather than calculated as an average of the previous three years' pre-tax profit.

For more information on our performance against these and other targets refer to OFR 7.3.\n\nIn FY2022, our voluntary social investment totalled US$186.4 million, an increase of 7 per cent compared with FY2021. This investment consisted of US$99.4 million in direct community development and environmental projects and donations, US$14.5 million equity share to non-operated joint venture social investment programs, a US$52.4 million donation to the BHP Foundation and US$1.5 million under the Matched Giving Program. Administrative costs 2 to facilitate direct social investment activities totalled US$16.1 million and US$2.5 million supported the operations of the BHP Foundation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information on social investment, including case studies and other initiatives to support communities where we operate is available at bhp.com.\n\nWith our most recent five-year sustainability targets completing in FY2022, BHP developed new 2030 goals to further lift our ambitions as we look to the end of the decade.\n\nThey represent a shift towards partnership, listening and co-creation, and recognise that addressing challenges like community and environment resilience requires close community and stakeholder collaboration.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our 2030 goals refer to OFR 2.2.\n\nThe 2030 goals are intended to be complemented by a continued commitment to social investment of at least 1 per cent of pretax profit\u00b3 in addition to our direct operational decision-making and financial contributions.\n\nWe intend to continue to report annually our contribution to social value through our social investment.\n\n## The BHP Foundation\n\nThe BHP Foundation is a charitable organisation established and funded by BHP that blends ambition, transformational partnerships and business acumen to catalyse new solutions to some of the world's most complex social and environmental challenges. The BHP Foundation partners with NGOs and international institutions with the goal of driving systemic change. Globally the Foundation focuses on the governance of natural resources, environmental resilience and education equity. These global programs are complemented by the Foundation's country programs in Australia, Canada, Chile and the United States which work towards improving long-term, economic, social and environmental sustainability at a national level.\n\n- 1 To date, our voluntary social investment has been calculated as 1 per cent of the average of the previous three years' pre-tax profit.\n- 2 The direct costs associated with implementing social investment activities, including labour, travel, research and development, communications and costs to facilitate the operation of the BHP Foundation.\n- 3 For FY2023-FY2030, our social investment will be assessed as a total over the seven-year goal period to FY2030, rather than calculated as an average of the previous three-years' pre-tax profit.",

Approximately 10,000 Australian schools and early learning services registered to develop a Reconciliation Action Plan on the Narragunnawali platform.\n\n## 7.15 Environment\n\nWe are committed to preventing or minimising our adverse environmental impacts and contributing to the resilience of the natural environment. Our operations and growth strategy depend on obtaining and maintaining the right to access environmental resources. However, with growing pressure on and competition for these resources, and with climate change amplifying certain sensitivities of our natural systems, our environmental performance and management of our environmental impacts on the communities where we operate is critical to creating social value. This is recognised in our social value framework where the objective under our healthy environment goal is to create nature-positive outcomes by having at least 30 per cent of the land and water we steward under conservation, restoration or regenerative practices by 2030.\n\nAt every stage in the life cycle of our operated assets, we seek to avoid, minimise and mitigate our adverse environmental impacts in line with our defined risk appetite.\n\nWe recognise our activities have an environmental footprint and commit to making voluntary contributions to support environmental resilience across the regions where we operate. Our Group-wide approach to environmental management is set out in the Our Requirements for Environment and Climate Change standard and our mandatory minimum performance requirements for risk management.\n\nThese standards have been designed taking account of the ISO management system requirements, including ISO14001 for Environmental Management Systems, and set the basis for how we manage risk, including realising opportunities, to achieve our environmental objectives.\n\nThe Our Requirements for Environment and Climate Change standard requires us to take an integrated, risk-based approach to managing any actual or reasonably foreseeable adverse and positive impacts (direct, indirect and cumulative) on biodiversity, land, water and air. This includes establishing and implementing environmental risk monitoring and reviewing practices throughout our business planning and project evaluation cycles. In addition to the broader environment-specific components, the standard includes climate change related requirements for our operated assets.\n\nTo support continuous improvement, each of our operated assets is required to have an Environmental Management System (EMS) that aligns with ISO14001 standards and set target environmental outcomes for biodiversity, land, air and water resources that are consistent with the assessed risks and potential impacts. Target environmental outcomes are included in the life-of-asset plan and approved by the relevant Asset President or equivalent. We verify our EMS by ISO14001 certification (for sites currently holding ISO14001 certification) or through our internal assurance processes.\n\nIn FY2022, no significant environmental events resulting from BHP operated activities were recorded, resulting in our five-year public target of no significant environmental events between FY2018 and FY2022 being met.\n\nDuring FY2022, we successfully delivered the full suite of five-year environment-related sustainability targets. We also continued work to:\n\n- -  develop a more integrated nature-positive approach and healthy environment goal as part of our 2030 goals\n- -  refresh our Water Stewardship Strategy and formalise our biodiversity strategy\n- -  invest in voluntary conservation projects as part of BHP's contribution to environmental resilience more broadly\n\nBHP joined the Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosure (TNFD) Forum (a group of organisations that support the TNFD Member Group) in recognition of the increasing awareness and understanding needed on nature-related risk and the implications for the resilience of economies and society.\n\nMore information on our environmental approach, the Our Requirements for Environment and Climate Change standard, and our environmental management and governance processes is available at bhp.com/sustainability.\n\n## Contributing to a resilient environment\n\nBiodiversity is essential to maintain healthy ecosystems and the clean air, water and productive landscapes and seascapes we all need to survive and thrive. We are seeing an increasing societal focus on the urgent need to reverse current trends in biodiversity loss and protect vital ecosystems that are the foundation of the world's economic security. As a global resources company, we acknowledge we have a role to play in contributing to environmental resilience both inside and outside our footprint. We do this through our Group-wide water stewardship and biodiversity strategies, our",

In June 2022, we expressed our aspiration via our 2030 healthy environment goal (described above) to create nature-positive outcomes. 'Nature positive' is a high-level goal and a concept describing a future state of nature (e.g. biodiversity, ecosystem services and natural capital) which is greater than the current state. This definition comes from the TNFD.\n\nOur collaborative work with strategic partners, including Conservation International, and local communities is focused on contributing to enduring environmental and social benefits through biodiversity conservation and ecosystem restoration, water stewardship and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Our preference is to invest our voluntary social investment funds in projects that contribute to cultural, economic and community benefits in addition to environmental resilience.\n\nSince FY2011, we have invested more than US$95 million of our social investment funds in voluntary environmental resilience initiatives outside our operational area. This funding is in addition to our investment in day-to-day environmental management activities relating to our operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information on the environment and our environmental projects is available at bhp.com/environment.\n\nOur focus on environmental resilience is complementary to the work of the BHP Foundation under its Environmental Resilience Global Program.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information is available at bhp.com/foundation.\n\n## 7.16 Water\n\nAccess to safe, clean water is a basic human right and essential to maintaining healthy ecosystems. Water is also integral to what we do and we cannot operate without it. In FY2017, we adopted a Water Stewardship Strategy to improve our management of water, increase transparency and contribute to the resolution of shared water challenges. Our Water Stewardship Position Statement was developed in FY2019 and outlines our 2030 vision. In FY2022, we made minor updates to our Water Stewardship Position Statement and Strategy\n\n- 1 Where 'withdrawal' is defined as water withdrawn and intended for use (in accordance with 'Water Reporting, Good Practice Guide (2nd Ed), ICMM (2021)). 'Fresh water' is defined as waters other than seawater, wastewater from third parties and hypersaline groundwater. Freshwater withdrawal also excludes entrained water that would not be available for other uses. These exclusions have been made to align with the target's intent to reduce the use of freshwater sources of potential value to other users or the environment.\n- 2 The FY2017 baseline data has been adjusted to account for: the materiality of the strike affecting water withdrawals at Escondida in FY2017 and improvements to water balance methodologies at WAIO and BMA, and exclusion of hypersaline, wastewater, entrainment, supplies from desalination and Discontinued operations (Onshore US assets and Petroleum) and the divestment of BMC.\n\nto align with the ambitions of our business and society, and developed our new 2030 healthy environment goal.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## More information is available at bhp.com/water.\n\nWe recognise our responsibility to effectively manage our interactions with and prevent or minimise our adverse impacts on water resources. Effective water stewardship begins within our operations. We use water in many ways, including but not limited to:\n\n- -  extracting it for ore processing and to access ore\n- -  dust suppression\n- -  processing mine tailings\n- -  providing drinking water and sanitation facilities\n- -  using marine water for desalination\n\nWe work to reduce stress on water resources from our operations and to collaborate with others on challenges and opportunities like water scarcity or high variability in water supply.\n\nWe have achieved our public sustainability target to reduce FY2022 freshwater withdrawal 1 by 15 per cent from FY2017 levels 2 across our operated assets. Our FY2022 result demonstrated a 29 per cent reduction on our adjusted FY2017 baseline. Achievement of the target is primarily due to the gradual replacement of groundwater sources with desalinated water for our Escondida operations. This resulted in the cessation of groundwater withdrawal for operational water consumption from the Salar de Punta Negra aquifer in 2017 and from the Monturaqui aquifers in FY2020. This cessation was 10 years ahead of schedule and involved an investment of around US$4 billion in large-scale desalination capability. For more information refer to bhp.com/news/case-studies/2020/09/breakingthe-water-energy-nexus.\n\nOur global freshwater withdrawals from FY2017 to FY2022 are shown in the chart below.\n\nWhile minimisation of freshwater withdrawal will remain important for us, in some of the regions\n\nwhere we operate it may not be the key waterrelated risk. In recognition of the variation of challenges and opportunities across the regions where we operate, we committed in our Water Stewardship Position Statement to developing context-based water targets (CBWTs). These CBWTs are intended to contribute more effectively to addressing the shared water challenges in our operating regions.\n\nDuring FY2022, we engaged third parties to review publicly available information and engage with stakeholders to identify shared water challenges through Water Resource Situation Analyses (WRSAs). We also began development of CBWTs for each of our operated assets, which are informed by BHP's view of water-related risks in the catchments and by the shared water challenges identified in the WRSAs. The WRSAs are expected to be made publicly available to support continued collaboration between stakeholders in the shared water resources of our operating regions.\n\nDuring FY2023, we intend to publicly release CBWTs for our operated assets and from FY2023 we will report publicly on progress against the CBWTs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information on the WRSAs is available at bhp.com/water.\n\n## Water accounting and reporting\n\nWe report on water metrics and on the management of water-related risks on our water webpage, in line with the ICMM's Water Reporting, Good Practice Guide (2 nd Ed) (ICMM guidance) and the Minerals Council of Australia's Water Accounting Framework (WAF).\n\nGenerally, these reporting frameworks align with the reporting requirements of the GRI Standards and the CEO Water Mandate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information on water accounting and reporting of metrics required by the ICMM guidance is available at bhp.com/ water and in our BHP ESG Standards and Databook available at bhp.com/ sustainability.\n\n## Performance against freshwater withdrawal reduction target 1\n\nMegalitres\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Freshwater withdrawal         FY2022 15% reduction target\n- 1 The freshwater withdrawal data includes data from all operated assets under BHP ownership at the end of FY2022. In FY2022, we merged our Petroleum business with Woodside and divested our interest in BMC. Data for the Petroleum business and BMC has been excluded from the FY2017 baseline and annual performance data for our FY2018-FY2022 public sustainability targets for our withdrawal of freshwater (together with our occupational exposures and GHG emissions) to ensure ongoing comparability of performance.",

The disclosure of water data in high-stress areas is required by several reporting frameworks, including the ICMM guidance. In FY2022, freshwater withdrawal from those operating assets in high or extremely high water stress areas made up approximately 15 per cent of our total freshwater withdrawals.\n\nDuring FY2021, BHP contributed to improving mining sector water reporting through participation in the ICMM Water Working Group to strengthen the ICMM guidance and align it with the GRI requirements. The most significant change for BHP of applying the 2021 update of the ICMM guidance was that the guidance recommends (non-mandatory) reporting of the annual change in water storage volumes. We have taken the first step to implement this recommendation by including changes in water storage volumes in our asset water accounts for those operated assets where water storage changes are considered material. In FY2022, we assessed which sites may have changes in water storage volumes that were material to their water management; our coal operated assets (where changes in water storage are the most material within BHP) were a particular focus. In line with our commitment for continuous improvement of our water accounts and data, we continued to review assumptions for accounting for water storage, and other metrics, in asset water models and water balances, recognising that water modelling and balances contains a degree of uncertainty which must be understood. We have now included reporting of material water storage changes across BHP, but note the accuracy of this metric (as for other metrics that we reported for many years) is expected to continue to improve in the forthcoming years as our knowledge and understanding grows.\n\nWe continue to seek to minimise our withdrawal of high-quality water. In FY2022, seawater continued to be our largest source of water withdrawal, representing 61 per cent of total withdrawals, predominantly for desalination at Escondida. Groundwater remained our most significant non-sea water source in FY2022, at close to one-fifth of total water withdrawals. In FY2022, approximately 75 per cent of our water withdrawals consisted of water classified as low quality. The definitions for water quality types is available in section 2.2.4 of the WAF.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement and legal matters\n\nBeyond our operational activities, we have committed to engaging across communities, government, business and civil society with\n\n- 1 The CEO Water Mandate is a UN Global Compact initiative that mobilizes business leaders on water, sanitation and the Sustainable Development Goals. Endorsers of the CEO Water Mandate commit to continuous progress against six core elements of stewardship and in so doing understand and manage their own water risks. Companies that endorse the Mandate agree to continuous improvement in six core areas of their water stewardship practice: Direct Operations, Supply Chain & Watershed Management, Collective Action, Public Policy, Community Engagement and Transparency. BHP is an active signatory of the Mandate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthe aim of catalysing actions to improve water governance, increase recognition of water's diverse values and advance sustainable solutions. We continue to collaborate with the CEO Water Mandate 1 to support the development of catchment-scale resilience as part of our commitment to strengthen transparency and collaboration across all sectors for improved water governance. We also continue our collaboration with the University of Notre Dame (United States of America) to develop an approach to water management that considers the human rights to access water.\n\nAs reported in our Annual Report 2021, in August 2021 an individual commenced an environmental damage action against Cerro Colorado alleging that Cerro Colorado's water extraction from the Lagunillas aquifer has damaged the aquifer and a nearby lagoon and wetlands. Following a series of injunctions in February 2022, new orders were received that permit water extraction, subject to ongoing monitoring of aquifer water levels. If the conditions are complied with, the orders permit four staged and gradual increases through to the expiry of the current environment licence in FY2024. The hearing for the environmental damage action was held in April 2022 with the outcomes still pending.\n\nIn March 2022, the Chilean Environmental Regulator (SMA) sanctioned Escondida, concluding it had breached its environmental permit from 2005 until 2019, causing irreparable environmental damage due to its water extraction from the Monturaqui aquifer. Escondida's infraction was classified as 'very serious', and the SMA imposed a fine of approximately US$8.3 million. Escondida has lodged a reconsideration motion before the SMA. A decision on the reconsideration motion before the SMA is expected in the second half of 2022. Appeal rights remain an option following the decision.\n\nAn environmental damage claim was lodged by the Attorney General's Office (AGO) against Escondida, Albemarle and Compa\u00f1\u00eda Minera Zald\u00edvar (the latter two being other companies that extract water (or previously extracted) from the Monturaqui aquifer) before the First Environmental Court of Antofagasta during FY2022. The AGO alleges the defendants' extraction of water from the Monturaqui aquifer has caused environmental damage. The Peine Community (an Indigenous community) has lodged a claim against Escondida based on the same facts. Both claims have been consolidated into a single proceeding. Escondida filed its answer to the claims on 15 June 2022.\n\nMore information on our approach to water stewardship, progress against our Water Stewardship Strategy, water performance in FY2022 and case studies on activities we are undertaking to progress towards meeting our water stewardship vision is available at bhp.com/water.\n\n## 7.17 Biodiversity and land\n\nThe nature of our activities means we have a significant responsibility for biodiversity and land management. As at 30 June 2022, we owned or managed more than 8 million hectares of land and sea; however, just under 2 per cent is disturbed (physical or chemical alteration that substantially disrupts the pre-existing habitats and land cover) for our operational activities. The area we own or manage has decreased by 8 per cent from FY2021, predominantly due to the merger of our Petroleum business with Woodside.\n\nAt each of our operated assets, we look to manage threats and opportunities to achieve our environmental objectives. We apply the mitigation hierarchy (avoid, mitigate, rehabilitate and, where appropriate, apply compensatory measures) to any potential or residual adverse impacts on marine or terrestrial ecosystems.\n\nWe respect legally designated protected areas and commit to avoiding areas or activities where we consider the environmental risk is outside our risk appetite. As part of our commitments:\n\n- -  We do not explore or extract resources within the boundaries of World Heritage listed properties.\n- -  We do not explore or extract resources adjacent to World Heritage listed properties, unless the proposed activity is compatible with the outstanding universal values for which the World Heritage property is listed.\n- -  We do not explore or extract resources within or adjacent to the boundaries of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Protected Areas Categories I to IV, unless a plan is implemented that meets regulatory requirements, takes into account stakeholder expectations and contributes to the values for which the protected area is listed.\n- -  We do not operate where there is a risk of direct impacts to ecosystems that could result in the extinction of an IUCN Red List Threatened Species in the wild.\n- -  We do not dispose of mined waste rock or tailings into a river or marine environment.\n\nOur operated assets are required to have plans and processes that reflect local biodiversity risks and regulatory requirements. We revised and formalised a global-level biodiversity strategy in FY2022 that outlines our purpose and strategic priorities, and is designed to inform operational decision-making across the full life cycle of mining operations at our operated assets. The global-level strategy provides a clear direction that aligns asset-level biodiversity and land objectives and supports delivery of the new 2030 healthy environment goal.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on our 2030 goals refer to OFR 2.2 and 7.1.\n\nIn FY2022, we delivered our most recent five-year sustainability target related to biodiversity. This was to improve marine and terrestrial biodiversity outcomes by developing a framework to evaluate and verify the benefits",

The application of the biodiversity framework is intended to enable us to monitor the impacts of our activities and the effect of our management responses on biodiversity in a consistent way across BHP's operated assets. The biodiversity framework was developed with the support of Conservation International and Proteus, a cross-sector partnership between the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP WCMC) and business.\n\nFor our 'area conserved' target, the total land set aside for conservation on land where we operate and other land we steward was 65,870 hectares in FY2022. In addition to these conservation areas, we made several voluntary investments over the target period, including to the Terrebonne Biodiversity Resilience Project (a coastal restoration project in Louisiana) and the Martu Living Desert Project in Australia (support for management and conservation activities on Martu Country). Under the Conservation International and BHP alliance, Conservation International supported an assessment of whether these projects could contribute towards achievement of this target and found that the area that could reasonably be claimed was 4,465,260 hectares. Given BHP's FY2022 total disturbed land footprint was 149,312 hectares, our 'area conserved' target has been achieved by our operational and voluntary conservation investments over the target period.\n\nIn addition, we signed a grant agreement in FY2022 with Conservation International to pilot a framework to improve marine and coastal protections and enhance resilience (known as the 'Seascape Approach') in Fiji, with the aim of enhancing resilience of coastal Indigenous communities and Lau's marine and coastal ecosystems. This is expected to be a significant investment in marine biodiversity conservation in Fiji's eastern islands of the Lau Province and its surrounding waters. The agreement is aligned with the longer-term goal released in FY2018 of supporting actions aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals 14 and 15.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information on our approach to biodiversity and land management and current performance is available at bhp.com/biodiversity.\n\n## 7.18  Tailings storage facilities\n\nEnsuring the integrity of our tailings storage facilities (TSFs) is a primary focus across our business. Our aspiration is to achieve zero harm from tailings and we will continue to work with others and share our progress in an effort to make this a reality.\n\nIn 2015, after the tragic failure of the Fund\u00e3o dam at Samarco, BHP initiated a Dam Risk Review to assess the management of major TSFs. The catastrophic failure of the Brumadinho dam at Vale's operation in Brazil in\n\nJanuary 2019 further strengthened our resolve to reduce TSF failure risk.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor information about the Samarco tragedy and our progress with the response refer to OFR 8.\n\n## Governance and the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management\n\nWe are committed to the 2020 Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) and are working to implement the requirements in line with the timelines outlined by the ICMM. Our Tailings Storage Facility Policy Statement has been published on our website, outlining our commitment to the safe management of TSFs, emergency preparedness and response, recovery in the event of a failure and transparency.\n\nDelivery of the GISTM implementation plans was a priority in FY2022 and we made notable progress across our operated assets, which was tracked and reported to the Sustainability Committee. As part of our commitment to GISTM and continuous improvement in tailings management, we conducted a midimplementation review that confirmed we are on track to achieve conformance in line with the ICMM timelines. We also implemented our Accountable Executive (AE) model, whereby AEs are direct reports of the BHP Chief Executive Officer and answerable to the Sustainability Committee as stipulated in GISTM's requirements. The AEs cover both direct operational accountability for BHP's TSFs as well as an AE accountable for oversight of BHP's TSF governance framework. AEs are accountable for the safety, environmental and social impacts of TSFs. Front line employees are the first line (under our three lines risk management model) and manage the day-to-day operations and safety at site, while connected via regular communication to the relevant AE.\n\nWe continued to progress work on TSF failure risk management in FY2022 with a focus on the delivery of the risk remediation plans completed in FY2021. These plans are in addition to the range of ongoing governance activities we have in place to ensure effective management of TSF failure risk, including Dam Safety Reviews, Independent Tailings Review Boards and project-specific Independent Peer Reviews. Key risk indicators (KRIs) set by management help to monitor performance of our TSFs in dam integrity and design, overtopping/ flood management and emergency response planning. These KRIs have been updated to align to the GISTM.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on BHP's approach to risk management including KRIs refer to OFR 9.\n\n## Strategy\n\nOur short-term strategy continues to focus on improving KRI performance in line with defined targets. We are completing studies at our operated assets focused on reducing and mitigating potential downstream impacts particularly to populations at risk (PAR).\n\nThe studies resulted in a diverse range of options to reduce PAR exposure at our TSFs or\n\nmitigate TSF failure risk. With this information our assets optimised the design and execution of their risk remediation plans, which collectively are intended to materially reduce PAR across the portfolio in the short to medium term.\n\nOur medium- and long-term strategies focus on the development of technologies to improve tailings management and storage, which we believe are important in our aspiration of zero harm from tailings. Asset-specific strategies have been developed for all our operated assets (including legacy assets) and seek long-term alternative tailings solutions. In addition, while our non-operated joint ventures (NOJVs) are independently controlled and have their own operating and management standards, we encourage NOJVs to consider long-term alternative tailings solutions as an option in asset planning.\n\n## Industry collaboration\n\nAs part of our commitment to achieving zero harm from tailings, we are accelerating transformative approaches and technologies through a wide range of initiatives in collaboration with external industry partners. In FY2022, Future Tails (which is an initiative focused on training, education, research and best-practice guides in the tailings management space that is supported by BHP, Rio Tinto and the University of Western Australia) established training programs tailored to executives, operators and technical tailings engineers. These have been positively received by the industry.\n\nA consortium of industry peers was formed in FY2022, to jointly conduct focused research on tailings innovation solutions and share results and learnings. Expansion of the program is planned for the coming years to bring in additional industry partners and represents a significant opportunity for industry knowledge and capability uplift.\n\nAs part of this program, we have created partnerships with Rio Tinto and the University of Melbourne designed to both develop novel tailings dewatering technologies and mitigate the risk involved in the large-scale application of known tailings dewatering technologies. Dewatering is a sustainable approach to tailings processing that supports our public commitment to reduce water usage. The BHP Tailings Challenge received over 150 applications from 19 countries in FY2022 and following a rigorous assessment process, two finalists were selected to progress solutions for repurposing tailings into fertiliser and construction material. The program will continue through FY2023 culminating in an on-site pilot ahead of full solution development.\n\n## Transparency\n\nWe fully support the GISTM and are working towards implementation at our sites. We have prioritised and actioned a phased disclosure approach towards conformance, starting with an update to our previously published Church of England Disclosure 1 . We have contributed to improvements in tailings storage management across the mining industry, including through the ICMM Tailings Working Group. We are participants in other tailings working groups globally, including those associated with the",

In addition to our work with industry partners to support the development of credible and meaningful disclosure standards, we have sought to enable the consistent application of these in our own business through the development and rollout of our Sustainability Standards Portal. The portal is a data platform to integrate multiple ESG standards, simplify data management for our assets and further strengthen the process, data quality and governance improvements achieved to date.\n\n## Operated and non-operated tailings portfolio\n\nThe classifications described in this Report align to the Canadian Dam Association (CDA) classification system. The TSF classification is one element of TSF risk management, but does not represent risk itself. It reflects the modelled, hypothetical, most significant possible failure and consequences without controls. It does not reflect the current physical stability of the TSF and it is possible for TSF classifications to change over time, for example, following changes to the operating context of a dam.\n\nThe TSF classification informs the design, surveillance and review components of risk management. Therefore, TSFs with a higher-level\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nclassification will have more rigorous requirements than TSFs that have a lower level of classification.\n\nAs at 30 June 2022, there were 71 TSFs 2 at our operated assets, 28 of which are of upstream design. Of the 71 operated facilities, none are extreme and a further 20 are classified as very high. The three facilities classified as extreme in FY2021 have been reclassified to a lower-consequence classification following the completion of risk mitigation works this year. In FY2022, two TSFs were removed from the operated TSF portfolio following the divestment of our interest in BMC and one new active TSF, a low-consequence, upstream facility at Olympic Dam, has been added. A substantial portion of our inactive portfolio (56) at our assets is due largely to the number of historic tailings facilities associated with our North American legacy assets portfolio.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information on the risk reduction work underway for high-consequence classification facilities is provided earlier in the Governance and Strategy sections and online, including in our case studies.\n\nThere are 10 TSFs at our NOJVs, which are all located in the Americas. The three active TSFs are located at Antamina in Peru, which is of downstream construction, and two TSFs at Samarco in Brazil, Alegria Sul TSF, which is co-mingled dry stack, and Alegria Sul Pit, an in-pit TSF. In addition, there are seven inactive facilities. These include two upstream facilities at Samarco (Germano) in Brazil (that are being decommissioned following the February 2019 rulings by the Brazilian Government on upstream dams); three upstream inactive facilities and one inactive modified centreline facility at Resolution Copper in the United States; and one downstream inactive facility at Bullmoose in Canada. In FY2022, two NOJV TSFs at Cerrej\u00f3n in Colombia were removed from our TSF portfolio following the sale of the asset.\n\n- 1 In April 2019, the Church of England Pensions Board and the Council on Ethics Swedish National Pension Funds wrote to approximately 700 mining firms to request specific disclosures of their tailings facilities.\n- 2 The number of tailings storage facilities (TSFs) is based on the definition agreed to by the ICMM Tailings Advisory Group at the original time of submission and expanded to align with the TSF definition established in the Global Industry Standard for Tailings Management (GISTM). We keep this definition under review. In FY2022, four TSFs were removed from the BHP TSF portfolio following the sale of our interests in two assets: two TSFs at Cerrej\u00f3n (NOJV) in January 2022 and two TSFs at BMC (operated joint venture) in May 2022. One new, active TSF, TSF 6 at Olympic Dam, has been included.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 1 The following classifications aligned to the CDA classification system. It is important to note that the classification is based on the modelled, hypothetical, most significant failure mode and consequences possible without controls, and not on the current physical stability of the dam.\n- 2 For the purposes of this chart, ANCOLD and other classifications have been converted to their CDA equivalent.\n- 3 Hamburgo TSF at Escondida is an inactive facility where tailings were deposited into a natural depression. Hamburgo TSF is not considered a dam and is, therefore, not subject to CDA classification.\n- 4 SP1/2 and SP3 TSF at New South Wales Energy Coal are inactive facilities which have been assessed to have no credible failure modes and are therefore shown as not having a CDA classification.\n- 5 'Other' includes dams with a raising method that combines upstream, downstream and centreline or are of in-pit design.\n- 6 'Inactive' includes facilities not in operational use, under reclamation, reclaimed, closed and/or in post-closure care and maintenance.",

The performance of the year end corporate review procedures at head office was also conducted remotely and was supported through the use of collaboration platforms for discussions and delivery of requested evidence.\n\nThe procedures we performed were based on our professional judgement and included, but were not limited to:\n\n- -  Interviewing select corporate and site personnel to understand the reporting process at group, business, asset and site level, including management's processes to identify BHP's material issues\n- -  Reviewing BHP policies and management standards to determine alignment with the ICMM's 10 Sustainable Development principles and position statements\n- -  Checking BHP's Annual Report 2022 to understand how BHP's identified material issues, risks and opportunities are reflected within the qualitative disclosures\n- -  Evaluating whether the information disclosed in the Subject Matter is consistent with our understanding of sustainability management and performance at BHP\n- -  World Resource Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WRI/WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol\n- -  BHP's Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions calculation methodology 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -  Evaluating the suitability and application of the Criteria and that the Criteria have been applied appropriately to the Subject Matter\n- -  Conducting virtual site procedures at seven BHP locations to evidence site level data collection and reporting to Group as well as to identify completeness of reported water and greenhouse gas emission sources\n- -  Undertaking analytical procedures of the quantitative disclosures in the Subject Matter\n- -  Reviewing data, information or explanation about the sustainability performance data and statements included in the Subject Matter\n- -  Reviewing other information within the BHP Annual Report 2022 for consistency and alignment with the Subject Matter\n- -  On a judgemental sample basis, re-performing calculations to check accuracy of claims in the Subject Matter\n- -  Checking the water balance for each operated asset and judgementally selecting a sample of water streams for further testing\n- -  On a sample basis, based on our professional judgement, agreeing claims and underlying data to source information to check accuracy and completeness of claims, which included invoices, incident reports, meter calibration records, and meter data\n- -  For our reasonable assurance of Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions, selecting key items and representative sampling based on statistical audit sampling tables and agreeing to source information to check accuracy and completeness of performance data, which included invoices, metre calibration records and metre data.\n\nWe believe that the evidence obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable and limited assurance conclusions.\n\n## Other Matters\n\nWe have not performed assurance procedures in respect of any information relating to prior reporting periods, including those presented in the Subject Matter.  Our report does not extend to any disclosures or assertions made by BHP relating to future performance plans and/or strategies disclosed in BHP's Annual Report 2022, ESG Standards and Databook, and supporting disclosures online.\n\nWhile we considered the effectiveness of management's internal controls when determining the nature and extent of our procedures, our assurance engagement was not designed to provide assurance on internal controls. Our procedures did not include testing controls or performing procedures relating to checking aggregation or calculation of data within IT systems.\n\n## Limited and Reasonable Assurance\n\nProcedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.\n\nWhile our procedures performed for our reasonable assurance engagement are of a higher level of assurance, due to the use of sampling techniques, it is not a guarantee that it will always detect material misstatements.\n\n## Use of our Assurance Statement\n\nWe disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this assurance report to any persons other than management and the directors of BHP, or for any purpose other than that for which it was prepared.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nErnst & Young Melbourne, Australia\n\nMathew Nelson Partner\n\n2 September 2022\n\n<!-- image -->",

Samarco is a non-operated joint venture (NOJV) owned by BHP Billiton Brasil Ltda (BHP Brasil) and Vale S.A. (Vale), with each having a 50 per cent shareholding.\n\nA significant volume of tailings (39.2 million cubic metres) resulting from the iron ore beneficiation process was released. Tragically, 19 people died - five community members and 14 people who were working on the dam. The communities of Bento Rodrigues, Paracatu de Baixo and Gesteira were flooded and other communities and the environment downstream in the Rio Doce basin were also affected.\n\nSamarco restarted its operations at a reduced production level in December 2020.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor information on Samarco's operations refer to OFR 5.2.\n\n## Our response and support for Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova\n\nBHP Brasil has been and remains fully committed to supporting the extensive ongoing remediation and compensation efforts of Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova in Brasil.\n\nThe Framework Agreement entered into between Samarco, Vale and BHP Brasil and the relevant Brasilian authorities in March 2016 established Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova, a not-forprofit, private foundation that is implementing 42 remediation and compensatory programs. BHP Brasil provides support to Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova, including through representation on the foundation's governance structures.\n\nTo 30 June 2022, BHP Brasil has provided US$1.8 billion to fund Framework Agreement programs when Samarco has been unable to do so.\n\n## Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova\n\n## Compensation and financial assistance\n\nFunda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova continues to provide fair compensation to people impacted by the dam failure.\n\nCompensation and financial assistance of approximately R$11.2 billion (approximately US$2.3 billion)\u00b9 has been paid to support approximately 388,000 people affected by the dam failure up until 30 June 2022. This includes:\n\n- -  More than 22,000 general damages claims (including loss of life, injury, property damage, business impacts, loss of income and moral damages) have been resolved, and more than 290,000 people have been paid a total of approximately R$305 million (approximately US$69 million) 1 for temporary water interruption as at 30 June 2022.\n- -  Approximately R$7.1 billion (approximately US$1.4 billion)\u00b9 has been paid to more than 66,000 people under the court-mandated simplified indemnity system (known as the 'Novel' system) as at 30 June 2022. The Novel system is designed to provide compensation for informal workers who have had difficulty proving the damages\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthey suffered, such as cart drivers, sand miners, artisanal miners and street vendors. More than 166,000 people have applied to join the Novel system to 30 June 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUpdates on the progress of Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's compensation program are available at fundacaorenova. org/en/repair-data/indemnities-andproductive-resumption\n\n## Resettlement\n\nOne of Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's priorities is the resettlement of the communities of Bento Rodrigues, Paracatu de Baixo and Gesteira. This involves ongoing engagement and consultation with a large number of stakeholders, including the affected community members, their technical advisers, state prosecutors, municipal leaders, regulators and other interested parties.\n\nThe resettlement process for Bento Rodrigues and Paracatu de Baixo involves designing new towns on land chosen by the communities, to be as close as possible to the previous layout, attending to the wishes and needs of the families and communities, while also meeting permitting requirements.\n\nMandated COVID-19 workforce restrictions and suspensions of works on-site, increases to the technical scope for resettlement of the communities and permitting delays have impacted the timeline for completion. Ongoing efforts to accelerate completions continued throughout FY2022.\n\nA total of 48 houses have been completed and 158 are under construction and mobilisation at Bento Rodrigues and Paracatu de Baixo as at 30 June 2022. Plans for families to move into their completed houses are progressing.\n\nInfrastructure at Bento Rodrigues is complete, including roads, power, water and sewer networks. Public services are also complete, including the health and services centres, a municipal school and sewage treatment station. Infrastructure at Paracatu de Baixo is complete, including roads, power, treated water pipeline, storm water and sewer networks. Public services are under construction, including an elementary school, kindergarten, health centre, water treatment station and sewage treatment station.\n\nAt Gesteira, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova offered the families a payment solution in which they would be able to purchase property through a 'letter of credit'. Most families of Gesteira have chosen this option, and the 12 th Federal Court has ratified their agreements.\n\nSome families have chosen not to join the resettlement of their previous community and instead resettle elsewhere. For these families, 88 houses and plots have been purchased, built and/or renovated, and 13 are under construction or renovation as at 30 June 2022. Other families have opted for a cash payment in lieu of any of the other resettlement solutions offered by Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUpdates on the progress of Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's resettlement program are available at fundacaorenova.org/ en/repair-data/resettlement-andinfrastructure\n\n## Other socio-economic programs\n\nFunda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova continues to implement a wide range of socio-economic programs in addition to the compensation and resettlement programs. These programs cover health and infrastructure projects in the Rio Doce basin, promotion of economic development in the impacted communities and sewage treatment facilities to improve the water quality in the Rio Doce.\n\n## Environmental remediation\n\nSince December 2019, the riverbanks and floodplains have been vegetated, river margins stabilised and in general, water quality and sediment qualities have returned to historic levels. Long-term remediation work is continuing to re-establish agriculture and native vegetation.\n\nA ban on fishing activities along the coast of Esp\u00edrito Santo and a precautionary conservation restriction preventing fishing for native fish species in the Rio Doce in Minas Gerais remain in place. Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova continues to support the recovery of habitats and aquatic ecology and engage with the authorities with the goal of lifting the restrictions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nUpdates on the progress of Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's environmental remediation programs are available at fundacaorenova.org/en/repair-data/ socio-environmental-repairs\n\n## Legal proceedings\n\nBHP Group Limited, BHP Group (UK) Ltd (formerly BHP Group Plc) and BHP Brasil are involved in legal proceedings relating to the Samarco dam failure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the significant legal proceedings involving BHP refer to Additional information.",

        "page_content": "## 9  How we manage risk\n\n## Risk management helps us to protect and create value, and is central to achieving our purpose and strategic objectives.\n\n## Our Risk Framework has four pillars: risk strategy, risk governance, risk process and risk intelligence.\n\n## Risk strategy\n\n## Risk classification\n\nWe classify all risks to which BHP is exposed using our Group Risk Architecture. This is a tool designed to identify, analyse, monitor and report risk, which provides a platform to understand and manage risks. Similar risks are considered together in groups and categories. This gives the Board and management visibility over the aggregate exposure to risks on a Group-wide basis and supports performance monitoring and reporting against BHP's risk appetite.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nBHP's Risk Appetite Statement is approved by the Board and is a foundational element of our Risk Framework. It provides guidance to management on the amount and type of risk we seek to take in pursuing our objectives.\n\n## Key risk indicators\n\nKey risk indicators (KRIs) are set by management to help monitor performance against our risk appetite. They also support decision-making by providing management with information about financial and non-financial risk exposure at a Group level. Each KRI has a target, or optimal level of risk we seek to take, as well as upper and lower limits. Where either limit is exceeded, management will review potential causes to understand if BHP may be taking too little or too much risk and to identify whether further action is required.\n\n## Risk culture\n\nOur risk management approach is underpinned by a risk culture that supports decision-making in accordance with BHP's values, objectives and risk appetite. We use a common foundation across BHP to build the tools and capabilities required to enable us to understand, monitor and manage our risk culture. These include tailored second-line cultural reviews, Group-wide risk culture dashboards and the inclusion of risk-culture assessments as part of our internal audit plan.\n\n## Strategic business decisions\n\nStrategic business decisions and the pursuit of our strategic objectives can inform, create or affect risks to which BHP is exposed. These risks may represent opportunities as well as threats. Our Risk Appetite Statement and KRIs assist in determining whether a proposed course of action is within BHP's risk appetite.\n\nOur focus when managing risks associated with strategic business decisions is to enable the pursuit of high-reward strategies.\n\nTherefore, as well as having controls designed to protect BHP from threats, we seek to implement controls to enable and/ or enhance opportunities.\n\n## Risk governance\n\n## Three lines model\n\nBHP uses the 'three lines model' to define the role of different teams across the organisation in managing risk. This approach sets clear accountabilities for risk management and provides appropriate 'checks and balances' to support us in protecting and growing value.\n\nThe first line is provided by our frontline staff, operational management and people in functional roles - anyone who makes decisions, deploys resources or contributes to an outcome is responsible for identifying and managing the associated risks.\n\nThe Risk team and other second-line teams are responsible for providing expertise, support, monitoring and challenge on risk-related matters, including by defining Group-wide minimum standards.\n\nThe third line, our Internal Audit team, is responsible for providing independent and objective assurance over the control environment (governance, risk management and internal controls) to the Board and Executive Leadership Team. Additional assurance may also be provided by external providers, such as our External Auditor.\n\nAs of 1 August 2022, the Risk team and Internal Audit team were combined to form a Risk and Internal Audit sub-function, led by a Chief Risk and Audit Officer. This reflects the maturity of our Risk Framework and risk management capability across the first and second lines. The integration of these areas in one sub-function is designed to improve overall effectiveness of both teams, including through further alignment of second and third line assurance activities across BHP. The Risk team and Internal Audit team will continue to operate in the second and third lines respectively.\n\n## BHP Board and Committees\n\nThe Board reviews and monitors the effectiveness of the Group's systems of financial and non-financial risk management and internal control. The broad range of skills, experience and knowledge of the Board assists in providing a diverse view on risk management. The Risk and Audit Committee (RAC) and Sustainability Committee assist the Board by reviewing and considering BHP's material risk profile (covering operational, strategic and emerging risks) on a biannual basis.\n\nPerformance against risk appetite is monitored and reported to the RAC, as well as the Sustainability Committee for HSEC matters, supporting the Board to challenge and hold management to account.\n\nSecond line risk-based reviews are undertaken to provide greater oversight and enhance our understanding and management of the Group's most significant risks, with outcomes reported to management, the RAC and the Sustainability Committee. These outcomes may be used to develop remediation plans, adjust BHP's Risk Appetite Statement or KRIs, enhance our Risk Framework or inform strategic decisions.\n\nFor information on other Board Committee activities that support risk governance at BHP refer to Corporate Governance Statement 5.\n\n## Risk process\n\nOur Risk Framework requires identification and management of risks (both threats and opportunities) to be embedded in business activities through the following process:\n\n- -  Risk identification - threats and opportunities are identified and each is assigned an owner or accountable individual.\n- -  Risk assessments - risks are assessed using appropriate and internationally recognised techniques to determine their potential impacts and likelihood, prioritise them and inform risk treatment options.\n- -  Risk treatment - controls are implemented to prevent, minimise and/or mitigate threats, and enable and/or enhance opportunities.\n- -  Monitoring and review - risks and controls are reviewed periodically and on an ad hoc basis (including where there are highpotential events or changes in the external environment) to evaluate performance.\n- -  Communication - relevant information is recorded in our enterprise risk management system to support continuous improvement and share risk intelligence across the Group.\n\nOur Risk Framework includes requirements and guidance on the tools and process to manage current and emerging risks.\n\n## Current risks\n\nCurrent risks are risks that could impact BHP today or in the near future and comprise current operational risks (risks that have their origin inside BHP or occur as a result of our activities) and current strategic risks (risks that may enhance or impede the achievement of our strategic objectives).\n\nCurrent risks include material and non-material risks (as defined by our Risk Framework). The materiality of a current risk is determined by estimating the maximum foreseeable loss (MFL) if that risk was to materialise. The MFL is the estimated impact to BHP in a worst-case scenario without regard to probability and",

        "page_content": "assuming all risk controls, including insurance and hedging contracts, are ineffective.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur risk factors are described in OFR 9.1.\n\nOur focus for current risks is to prevent their occurrence or minimise their impact should they occur, but we also consider how to maximise possible benefits that might be associated with strategic risks (as described in the 'Risk strategy' section). Current material risks are required to be evaluated once a year at a minimum to determine whether our exposure to the risk is within our risk appetite.\n\n## Emerging risks\n\nEmerging risks are newly developing or changing risks that are highly uncertain and difficult to quantify. They are generally driven by external influences and often cannot be prevented.\n\nBHP maintains a 'watch list' of emerging themes and monitors associated signals to interpret external events and trends, providing an evolving view of the changing external environment and how it might impact our business. We use the watch list and signal monitoring to support the identification and management of emerging risks, as well as to inform and test our corporate strategy.\n\nOnce identified, our focus for emerging risks is on structured monitoring of the external environment, advocacy efforts to reduce the likelihood of the threats manifesting and identifying options to increase our resilience to these threats.\n\n## Risk intelligence\n\nThe Risk team provides the RAC, Sustainability Committee and senior management with insights on risk management across BHP. Risk reports may include trends and aggregate exposure for our most significant risks, performance against risk appetite, updates on the Risk Framework and risk management priorities, an overview of (and material changes in) BHP's material risk profile and updates on emerging risk themes and signals, and risk culture. In FY2022, risk reports were supported by an opinion from the Chief Risk Officer.\n\nWe maintain a risk insights dashboard designed to provide current, data-driven and actionable risk intelligence to our people at all levels of the business to support decision-making. This tool empowers the business to manage risks more effectively, with increased accuracy and transparency.\n\nThe Board, RAC and Sustainability Committee also receive reports from other teams to support the Board to review and monitor the effectiveness of BHP's systems of financial and non-financial risk management. These include internal audit reports, ethics and investigations reports, compliance reports and the Chief Executive Officer's report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur risk factors are described in OFR 9.1.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 9.1  Risk factors\n\nOur risk factors are described below and may occur as a result of our activities globally, including in connection with our operated and non-operated assets, third parties engaged by BHP or through our value chain.\n\nThese risks, individually or collectively, could threaten our viability, strategy, business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity and reputation. They could also materially and adversely affect the health and safety of our people or members of the public, the environment, the communities where we or our third-party partners operate, or the interests of our stakeholders, which could in each case, lead to litigation, regulatory investigation or enforcement action (including class actions or actions arising from contractual, legacy or other liabilities associated with divested assets), or a loss of stakeholder and/or investor confidence. References to 'financial performance' include our financial condition and liquidity, including due to decreased profitability or increased operating costs, capital spend, remediation costs or contingent liabilities. BHP is also exposed to other risks that are not described in this section.\n\nEach risk factor may present opportunities as well as threats. We take certain risks for strategic reward in the pursuit of our strategy and purpose, including to grow our asset portfolio and develop the right capabilities for the future of our business. Potential threats and opportunities associated with each of our risk factors are described below, along with the key controls to manage them. These controls are not exhaustive and many Group-wide controls (such as Our Code of Conduct , Risk Framework, mandatory minimum performance requirements for risk management, health, safety and other matters, dedicated non-operated joint venture teams and our Contractor Management Framework) help to support effective and efficient management of all risks in line with our risk appetite. While we implement preventative and/or mitigating controls designed to reduce the likelihood of a threat from occurring and minimise the impacts if it does, these may not be effective.\n\n## Operational events\n\nRisks associated with operational events in connection with our activities globally, resulting in significant adverse impacts on our people, communities, the environment or our business.\n\n## Why is this important to BHP?\n\nWe engage in activities that have the potential to cause harm to our people and assets, communities, other stakeholders and/or the environment, including serious injuries, illness and fatalities, loss of infrastructure, amenities and livelihood and damage to sites of cultural significance. An operational event at our operated or non-operated assets or through our value chain could also cause damage or disruptions to our assets and operations, impact our financial performance, result in litigation or class actions and cause long-term damage to our licence to operate and reputation.\n\nThe potential physical impacts of climate change could increase the likelihood and/or severity of risks associated with operational events. Impacts of operational events may also be amplified if we fail to respond in a way that is consistent with our corporate values and stakeholder expectations.\n\n## Examples of potential threats\n\n- -  Failure of a water or tailings storage facility, such as the tragic failure of the Fund\u00e3o dam at Samarco in 2015 or a failure at one of our facilities in Australia, Chile, Peru, the United States, Canada or Brazil.\n- -  Unplanned fire events or explosions (on the surface and underground).\n- -  Geotechnical instability events (such as failure of underground excavations, unexpected large wall instabilities in our open pit mines, or potential interaction between our mining activities and community infrastructure or natural systems), including at our underground or open pit mines in Australia, Chile, Peru, the United States, Canada or Brazil.\n- -  Air, land (road and rail) and marine transportation events (such as aircraft crashes or vessel collisions, groundings or hydrocarbon release) that occur while transporting people, supplies or products to exploration, operation or customer locations, which include remote and environmentally sensitive areas in Australia, South America, Asia, the United States and Canada.\n- -  Critical infrastructure or hazardous materials containment failures, other occupational or process safety events, or workplace exposures.\n- -  Operational events experienced by third parties, which may also result in unavailability of shared critical infrastructure (such as railway lines or ports) or transportation routes (such as the Port Hedland channel in Western Australia).\n\n## Examples of potential opportunities\n\n- -  Our focus on safety and the wellbeing of our people, communities and the environment may increase operational resilience and stakeholder confidence, enhancing our ability to attract and retain talent and access (or lower the cost of) capital.\n- -  Collaborating with industry peers and relevant organisations on minimum standards (such as the internationally recognised Flight Safety Foundation's Basic Aviation Risk Standard, Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management, Large Open Pit Project guidelines on open-pit mining design and management, and the Cave Mining 2040 Consortium on deep mining design and management) supports improvements to wider industry management of operational risks and may also identify opportunities to improve our own practices.",

Otherwise, our exposure to risks associated with operational events remained relatively unchanged.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to:\n\n- \u00b7  OFR 7.18 - Tailings storage facilities\n- \u00b7  OFR 7.4 - Safety\n- \u00b7  OFR 8 - Samarco\n- \u00b7 bhp.com/sustainability\n\n## Accessing key markets\n\nRisks associated with market concentration and our ability to sell and deliver products into existing and future key markets, impacting our economic efficiency.\n\n## Why is this important to BHP?\n\nWe rely on the sale and delivery of the commodities we produce to customers around the world. Changes to laws, international trade arrangements, contractual terms or other requirements and/or geopolitical developments could result in physical, logistical or other disruptions to our operations in, or the sale or delivery of our commodities to, key markets. These disruptions could affect sales volumes or prices obtained for our products, adversely impacting our financial performance, results of operations and growth prospects.\n\n## Examples of potential threats\n\n- -  Government actions, including economic sanctions, tariffs or other trade restrictions, imposed by or on countries where we operate or into which we sell or deliver our products may prevent BHP from trading or make it more difficult for BHP to trade in key markets. For example, the Ukraine conflict and corresponding implementation of economic sanctions, export controls and other restrictive measures by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and other jurisdictions against Russia contributed to increased volatility for some of the commodities we sell and some of the key supplies we buy (including diesel and ammonia).\n- -  Physical disruptions to the delivery of our products to customers in key markets, including due to the disruption of shipping routes, closure or blockage of ports or land logistics (road or rail) or military conflict. In some cases, physical disruptions may be driven or intensified by weather, climate variability or other manifestations of climate change.\n- -  Legal or regulatory changes (such as royalties or taxes, port or import restrictions or customs requirements, shipping/ maritime regulatory changes, restrictions on movements or imposition of quarantines, or changing environmental restrictions or regulations, including measures with respect to carbon-intensive industries or imports) and commercial changes (such as changes to the standards and requirements of customers) may adversely impact our ability to sell, deliver or realise full market value for our products.\n- -  Failure to maintain strong relationships with customers, or changes to customer demands for our products may reduce our market share or adversely impact our financial performance.\n- -  Increasing geopolitical tensions (such as the escalation of events relating to the Ukraine conflict) may adversely affect our strategic and business planning decisions and/or increase the time it takes us to manage our access to key markets, particularly if we fail to detect or anticipate deviations in the geopolitical environment in a timely manner.\n\n## Examples of potential opportunities\n\n- -  Monitoring macroeconomic, societal, geopolitical and policy developments and trends may reveal new markets or commodities, or identify opportunities to strengthen secondary markets for existing products.\n- -  Developing strategic partnerships and strong, mutually beneficial relationships with our customers may enable us to create value.\n- -  Building a deep understanding of geopolitical threats and opportunities and their potential impacts on global trade flows and our business could enhance our strategy, business planning and response, providing a potential competitive advantage.\n- -  Identifying the potential for weather, climate variability or climate change to disrupt delivery of products and implementing management measures may increase the resilience of our operations and value chain.\n- -  Signal monitoring and building relationships with and understanding the perspectives of influential stakeholders may improve our ability to understand and provide input to policy development, and to respond to and manage any impacts from policy changes (such as trade policies).\n\n## Key management actions\n\n- -  Monitoring and assessing our ability to access key markets, and maintaining sales plans, product placement and business resilience strategies and relationships with relevant stakeholders.\n- -  Maintaining response plans for various scenarios (including physical disruptions of logistics) to mitigate disruptions to our ability to access key markets.\n- -  Monitoring geopolitical and macroeconomic developments and trends, including through signal monitoring and our enterprise-level watch list of emerging themes, to provide an early indication of events that could impact our ability to access key markets.\n- -  Identifying weather and/or climate-related vulnerabilities and implementing controls to mitigate disruptions to our ability to physically access key markets.\n- -  Diversifying our asset and commodity portfolio, such as our ongoing investment in potash through the Jansen Potash Project, to reduce exposure to market concentration risks.\n\n## FY2022 insights\n\nExposure to risks associated with our access to key markets increased in FY2022 due to changes in our external environment, over which we have limited influence. The Ukraine conflict and the corresponding international response has significantly increased volatility and uncertainty in the international trading, business and financial environment. Escalation or expansion of the conflict or the international response could cause greater disruption of global supply chains and affect macroeconomic conditions and our ability to sell to particular customers or markets. In addition, strategic competition between the United States and China continued.",

A strategy that does not support BHP's objectives and/or ill-timed execution of our strategy (including as a result of not having sector-leading talent and capabilities) or other circumstances may lead to a loss of value that impacts our ability to deliver returns to shareholders and fund our investment and expansion opportunities. It may also result in our asset portfolio being less resilient to movements in commodity prices, which are determined by or linked to prices in world markets. In the short term, this may reduce our cash flow, ability to access capital and our dividends. A failure to optimise our asset portfolio for structural movements in commodity prices over the long term may result in asset impairments and could adversely affect the results of our operations, financial performance and returns to investors.\n\n## Examples of potential threats\n\n- -  Failure to optimise our portfolio through effective and efficient acquisitions, exploration, large project delivery, mergers, divestments or expansion of existing assets (including due to sub-optimal capital prioritisation) may adversely impact returns to investors. For example, a scarcity of growth options that align with our strategy could require us to mine deeper, lower-grade deposits, which may lead to higher operating and capital costs.\n- -  Failure to identify potential changes in commodity attractiveness and missed entry or commodity exit opportunities may result in decreased return on capital spend for, or overpayment to acquire or invest in, new assets or projects, stranded assets or reduced divestment proceeds.\n- -  Failure to achieve expected commercial objectives from assets or investments, such as cost savings, sales revenues or operational performance (including as a result of inaccurate commodity price assumptions or resources and reserves estimates), may result in returns that are lower than anticipated and loss of value. Impacts could be exacerbated by effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and Ukraine conflict, including supply chain disruptions (for example, disruption in the energy sector impacting our end-user markets), labour shortages, inflationary pressures on raw materials and unfavourable exchange rates, creating operational headwinds and challenging on-time and onbudget project delivery.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -  Renegotiation or nullification of permits, inability to secure new permits or approvals, increased royalties, expropriation or nationalisation of our assets, or other legal, regulatory, political, judicial or fiscal or monetary policy instability or changes (for example, legislation, regulations or government policies implemented in Australia by the new federal government, which may include new rules governing the pay of contractors) may increase our costs or adversely impact our ability to achieve expected commercial objectives from assets or investments, access reserves, develop, maintain or operate our assets, enter new jurisdictions, or otherwise optimise our portfolio.\n- -  Inability to predict long-term trends in the supply, demand and price of commodities and optimise our asset portfolio accordingly may restrict our ability to generate long-term returns from the portfolio. For example, slowing economic growth in China due to factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, political and trade tensions or the market volatility and uncertainty resulting from the Ukraine conflict may result in lower demand and prices for our products, which would adversely impact our portfolio returns.\n- -  Commodity prices have historically been and may continue to be subject to significant volatility, including due to global economic and geopolitical factors, industrial activity, commodity supply and demand (including inventory levels), technological change, product substitution, tariffs, interest rate movements and exchange rate fluctuations. Our usual policy and practice is to sell our products at prevailing market prices and, as such, movements in commodity prices may affect our financial performance. Long-term price volatility or sustained low prices may adversely impact our financial performance as we do not generally have the ability to offset costs through price increases.\n\n## Examples of potential opportunities\n\n- -  Acquisition of new resources or acceleration of organic growth options in future facing commodities may strengthen and diversify our portfolio and protect and grow value over the long term.\n- -  Ability to predict long-term commodity demand, supply and price trends may lead to BHP being able to identify and acquire new future facing commodities and assets ahead of our competitors or exit from declining commodities in a timely manner, strengthening our portfolio and leading to long-term, higher portfolio returns.\n- -  BHP may be perceived as a welcome and valued or preferred partner for the development of new resource opportunities, enabling us to secure new assets or exploration opportunities to create long-term optionality in the portfolio.\n\n## Key management actions\n\n- -  Strategies, processes and frameworks to grow and protect our portfolio and to assist in delivering ongoing returns to shareholders include:\n- -  our exploration and business development programs, which focus on replenishing our resource base and enhancing our portfolio (including creating and securing more options in future facing commodities)\n- -  our long-term strategic outlook and ongoing strategic processes to assess our competitive advantage and enable the identification of threats to, or opportunities for, our portfolio through forecasting and scenario modelling\n- -  monitoring signals to interpret external events and trends, and designing commodity strategies and price protocols that are reviewed by management and the Board\n- -  our Capital Allocation Framework, corporate planning processes, investment approval processes and annual reviews (including resilience testing) of portfolio valuations\n- -  our balance sheet and liquidity framework, which is designed to maintain a robust balance sheet with sufficient liquidity and access to diverse sources of funding\n- -  Pursuing a considered approach to new country entry, including development of capability to operate in higherrisk jurisdictions, in order to support portfolio opportunities.\n- -  Further developing BHP's social value proposition to position BHP as a preferred partner for the development of resource opportunities in line with the expectations of local communities, host governments and other global stakeholders.\n- -  Managing commodity price exposure through the diversity of commodities, markets, geographies and currencies provided by our portfolio, as well as our financial risk management practices in relation to our commercial activities.\n\n## FY2022 insights\n\nOur exposure to risks associated with optimising\n\ngrowth and portfolio returns increased in FY2022 as a result of volatility and uncertainty across global economies, fiscal regimes and industrial relations, licencing-regulatory uncertainty and escalating social value expectations. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has contributed to inflationary pressures for key inputs across our value chain (such as diesel, acid, ammonia and explosives). In FY2022, we completed the divestment of our interests in BMC and Cerrej\u00f3n, and the merger of our Petroleum business with Woodside which are intended to optimise and consolidate our portfolio to align with BHP's long-term strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more Information refer to:\n\n- \u00b7  OFR 10 - Performance by commodity\n- \u00b7  OFR 3 - Positioning for the future\n- \u00b7   Financial Statements note 23 'Financial risk management'",

        "page_content": "## 9  How we manage risk continued\n\n## Significant social or environmental impacts\n\nRisks associated with significant impacts of our operations on and contributions to communities and environments throughout the life cycle of our assets and across our value chain.\n\n## Why is this important to BHP?\n\nThe long-term viability of our business is closely connected to the wellbeing of the communities and environments where we have a presence. At any stage of the asset life cycle, our activities and operations may have or be seen to have significant adverse impacts on communities and environments. In these circumstances, we may fail to meet the evolving expectations of our stakeholders (including investors, governments, employees, suppliers, customers and Indigenous peoples and other community members) whose support is needed to realise our strategy and purpose.\n\nThis could lead to loss of stakeholder support or regulatory approvals, increased taxes and regulation, enforcement action, litigation or class actions, or otherwise impact our licence to operate and adversely affect our reputation, ability to attract and retain talent, ability to access capital, operational continuity and financial performance.\n\n## Examples of potential threats\n\n- -  Engaging in or being associated with activities (including through non-operated joint ventures and our value chain) that have or are perceived to have individual or cumulative adverse impacts on the environment, biodiversity and land management, water access and management, human rights or cultural heritage.\n- -  Failing to meet stakeholder expectations in connection with our legal and regulatory obligations, relationships with Indigenous peoples, community wellbeing and the way we invest in communities or our approach to environment, climate change, biodiversity and land management, water access and management, human rights or cultural heritage priorities.\n- -  Political, regulatory and judicial developments (such as constitutional reform in Chile that could lead to adjustments to water and other resource rights) could increase uncertainty in relation to our operating environment, requiring us to adjust our business plans or strategy. For example, changes to regulations may require us to modify mine plans, limit our access to reserves and resources, delay the timing or increase costs associated with closure and rehabilitation of assets, or expose BHP to unanticipated environmental or other legacy liabilities.\n- -  Failing to identify and manage potential physical climate change risks to communities, biodiversity and ecosystems. For example, changes to species habitat or distribution as a result of sustained higher temperatures could result in land access restrictions or litigation, or limit our access to new opportunities.\n\n## Examples of potential opportunities\n\n- -  Our support for responsible stewardship of natural resources may enhance the resilience of environments and communities to potential threats (including the potential physical impacts of climate change). For example, BHP has commenced a pilot study on developing a Natural Capital Account at a restored mine site to understand how we can better incorporate nature-related threats and opportunities into our strategic planning, risk management and asset allocation decisions.\n- -  Strong social performance, including sustainable mining and a focus on the wellbeing of communities, could generate competitive advantage in the jurisdictions where we operate. For example, BHP was recognised for our contribution to the development of female leaders in the Chilean mining sector (Inspirational Women in Mining Awards), which may enhance our attractiveness as a place to work and support talent retention.\n- -  Our global social value strategy may improve stakeholder relations, enhance community trust and increase investor confidence and demand for our commodities.\n- -  Greater clarity, transparency and standards associated with regulatory regimes that support and protect communities and the environment may increase requirements across our sector, generating competitive advantage for companies that have already invested in social and environmental performance.\n- -  Building our reputation for sustainable and responsible operating practices (such as through the Copper Mark, which was awarded to three of our copper assets in FY2022) may increase demand for some of our commodities and improve our access to talent and capital.\n\n## Key management actions\n\n- -  The Our Requirements for Community and Our Requirements for Environment and Climate Change standards provide requirements and practices that are designed to strengthen our social, human rights and environmental performance. Our Human Rights Policy Statement, Water Stewardship Position Statement, Climate Transition Action Plan 2021 and Indigenous Peoples Policy Statement set out our targets, goals, commitments and/or approach to these matters.\n- -  Engaging in regular, open and transparent dialogue with stakeholders to better understand their expectations, concerns and interests, and undertaking research to better understand stakeholder perceptions.\n- -  Building social value into our decision-making process, along with financial considerations, including through our new social value framework and 2030 People, Planet and Prosperity goals.\n- -  Building stakeholder trust and contributing to environmental and community resilience, including through collaborating on shared challenges (such as climate change and water stewardship), enhanced external reporting of our operated assets' potential impacts on biodiversity and maximising the value of social investments through our social investment strategy.\n- -  Conducting regular research and impact assessments for operated assets to better understand the social, environmental, human rights and economic context. This supports us to identify and analyse stakeholder, community and human rights impacts, including modern slavery risks and emerging issues. We also complete due diligence screening on suppliers through our Ethical Supply Chain and Transparency program.\n- -  Integrating closure into our planning, decisionmaking and other activities through the life cycle of our operated assets, as set out in our mandatory minimum performance requirements for closure.\n\n## FY2022 insights\n\nOur exposure to risks with potentially significant social or environmental impacts increased in FY2022 due to environmental, political and regulatory developments, and increasing societal expectations, including of regulators and other stakeholders on Indigenous peoples' rights, climate change and the potential impacts of our operations throughout the asset life cycle.\n\nWe have continued to focus on improving engagement with Indigenous peoples, including the protection of cultural heritage. The economic importance of biodiversity is increasingly at the forefront of investor considerations (particularly following the Dasgupta Review in the United Kingdom in FY2021) and is expected to be strengthened through the development of institutional frameworks, including the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures. The opportunity for BHP in measuring and ascribing value to natural assets is to gain a better understanding of the value of environmental impacts and dependencies, and the risks they may pose to delivery of our strategy, purpose and public targets, goals and commitments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more Information refer to:\n\n- \u00b7   OFR 7.8 - Climate change\n- \u00b7  OFR 6 - People and culture\n- \u00b7  OFR 7.10 - Community\n- \u00b7  OFR 7.13 - Indigenous peoples\n- \u00b7  OFR 7.11 - Human rights\n- \u00b7  OFR 7.14 - Social investment\n- \u00b7  OFR 7.16 - Water\n- \u00b7  OFR 7.15 - Environment\n- \u00b7  OFR 7.17 - Biodiversity and land\n- \u00b7 bhp.com/sustainability",

        "page_content": "## Inadequate business resilience\n\nRisks associated with unanticipated or unforeseeable adverse events and a failure of planning and preparedness to respond to, manage and recover from adverse events (including potential physical impacts of climate change).\n\n## Why is this important to BHP?\n\nIn addition to the threats described in our other risk factors, our business could experience unanticipated, unforeseeable or other adverse events (internal or external) that could harm our people, disrupt our operations or value chain, or damage our assets or corporate offices, including our non-operated assets in which BHP has a non-controlling interest. A failure to identify or understand exposure, adequately prepare for these events (including maintaining business continuity plans) or build wider organisational resilience may inhibit our (or our third-party partners') ability to respond and recover in an effective and efficient manner. This could cause material adverse impacts on our business, such as reduced ability to access resources, markets and the operational or other inputs required by our business, reduced production or sales of commodities, or increased regulation, which could adversely impact our financial performance, share price or reputation, and could lead to litigation (including class actions).\n\n## Examples of potential threats\n\n- -  Geopolitical, global economic, regional or local developments or adverse events, such as social unrest, strikes, work stoppages, labour disruptions, social activism, terrorism, bomb threats, economic slowdown, acts of war or other significant disruptions in areas where we operate or have interests. For example, production at Escondida in FY2022 was impacted by public road blockades associated with social unrest.\n- -  Natural events, including earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, cyclones, fires, solar flares and pandemics. For example, continued COVID-19 related absences contributed to a fall in production volumes in the March 2022 quarter for copper, iron ore, nickel and energy coal.\n- -  Potential physical impacts of climate change, such as acute risks that are event-driven (including increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events) and chronic risks resulting from longer-term changes in climate patterns. Hazards and impacts may include changes in precipitation patterns, water shortages, rising sea levels, increased storm intensity, prolonged extreme temperatures and increased drought, fire and tidal flooding.\n- -  Failure by suppliers, contractors or joint venture partners to perform existing contracts or obligations (including due to insolvency), such as construction of large projects or supply of key inputs to our business (for example, consumables for our mining equipment).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- -  Failure of our risk management or other processes (including controls) to prepare for or manage any of the risks discussed in this 'Risk factors' section may inhibit our (or our third-party partners') ability to manage any resulting adverse events and may disrupt our operations or adversely impact our financial performance or reputation.\n\n## Examples of potential opportunities\n\n- -  Risk identification and management supports proactive, focused and prioritised deployment of resources to reduce exposure to adverse events. It may be used to inform priorities and strategies across BHP, supporting a proportionate and cost-effective response, which could provide a competitive advantage at a regional or global level.\n- -  Building wider organisational resilience may enable us to maintain dividends to shareholders amid adverse external events and make growth-generating, counter-cyclical investments, as well as to help us mitigate the impacts of unforeseeable adverse events. For example, we have developed new agile and remote ways of working in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may also increase our resilience to other adverse events.\n- -  Adapting to climate change across our operations and value chain could enhance the safety, productivity and climate resilience of our operated assets, position BHP as a supplier of choice and provide competitive advantage (for example, by fulfilling our commitment to security of supply). Support for climate vulnerable communities and ecosystems may also improve our social value proposition.\n\n## Key management actions\n\n- -  Implementing Group-wide controls to enhance business resilience, including BHP's mandatory minimum performance requirements for security, crisis and emergency management and business continuity plans, and seeking to maintain an investment grade credit rating.\n- -  Monitoring our current state of readiness (preparedness, redundancy and resilience), including through scenario analysis and business resilience exercises, supporting organisational capability in our operations, functions and senior management to effectively and efficiently respond to and recover from adverse events should they materialise.\n- -  Monitoring the external environment, including political and economic factors through signal monitoring, our geopolitical monitoring and public policy frameworks and our enterpriselevel watch list of emerging themes, to support early identification of policy changes or adverse events for which we may need to increase preparedness.\n- -  Identifying security threats that could directly or indirectly impact our operations and people in countries of interest to BHP.\n- -  Implementing our Adaptation Strategy with respect to the physical risks of climate change, including requiring operated assets and functions to identify and progressively assess potential physical climate change risks (including to our value chain) and build climate change adaptation into their plans, activities and investments.\n\n- -  Sourcing quality, centralised climate data covering each of our operating locations so that our operated assets and functions have access to appropriate data to support climate studies that will inform investment decisions around enhancing our operational resilience.\n\n## FY2022 insights\n\nOur exposure to risks associated with inadequate business resilience continued to grow in FY2022, with the external environment becoming increasingly volatile. Key emerging themes (including social activism, international criminal enterprise, global terrorism, cyber threats and war) signal heightened levels of global uncertainty and an increased likelihood of unexpected shocks or disruptions. At the same time, crisis events are increasing in frequency and scale. Some of these events directly impacted our business during FY2022, including the emergence of new COVID-19 variants and flooding in eastern and southern Australia (which flooded the road to Olympic Dam and impacted inbound critical consumables). In addition to continuing to build organisational resilience to such threats, adaptation of our business to the potential physical impacts of climate change continues to be at the forefront of our thinking, with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 6th Assessment Report noting the increased frequency and magnitude of climatic events.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to:\n\n- \u00b7   BHP Climate Transition Action Plan 2021\n- \u00b7   BHP Climate Change Report 2020\n- \u00b7  OFR 7.8 - Climate change\n- \u00b7 bhp.com/sustainability/safety-health/safety\n- \u00b7  OFR 7.12 - Security services\n\n## Low-carbon transition\n\nRisks associated with the transition to a lowcarbon economy.\n\n## Why is this important to BHP?\n\nTransition risks arise from policy, regulatory, legal, technological, market and other societal responses to the challenges posed by climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy. As a world-leading resources company, BHP is exposed to a range of transition risks that could affect the execution of our strategy or our operational efficiency, asset values and growth options, resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial performance, share price or reputation, including litigation. The complex and pervasive nature of climate change means transition risks are interconnected with and may amplify our other risk factors. Additionally, the inherent uncertainty of potential societal responses to climate change may create a systemic risk to the global economy.",

        "page_content": "## 9  How we manage risk continued\n\n## Examples of potential threats\n\n- -  Introduction or improvement of low-carbon technologies or changes in customer preference for products that support the transition to a low-carbon economy may decrease demand for some of our products (which may be abrupt or unanticipated), increase our costs or decrease the availability of key inputs to production. For example:\n- -  'Green steel' technologies may reduce demand for our metallurgical coal or iron ore.\n- -  Increased scrap-based steel production may reduce demand for our metallurgical coal and iron ore by limiting production that is required globally.\n- -  New battery technologies that use less nickel could enter the market and reduce demand for our nickel products.\n- -  Failure to address investor concerns on the potential impact of climate change on and from BHP's portfolio and operations may result in reduced investor confidence.\n- -  Social concerns around climate change may result in investors divesting our securities or pressure on financial institutions not to provide financing for our fossil fuel assets, which could limit our ability to access capital markets and potentially result in reduced access to financing or increased financing costs, or otherwise adversely impact our ability to optimise our portfolio.\n- -  Perceived or actual misalignment of BHP's climate actions (goals, targets and performance) with societal and investor expectations, or a failure to deliver our climate actions, may result in damage to our reputation, climate-related litigation (including class actions) or give rise to other adverse regulatory, legal or market responses.\n- -  Sub-optimal selection, implementation or effectiveness of technology that is intended to contribute towards the delivery of our climate targets, goals and strategies, or unavailability of that technology (including due to a failure of external equipment manufacturers to deliver on schedule or competition for limited supply) could delay or increase costs in achieving our plans for operational decarbonisation.\n- -  Changes in laws, regulations, policies, obligations, government actions, and our ability to anticipate and respond to such changes, including GHG emission targets, restrictive licencing, carbon taxes, carbon offset regulations, border adjustments or the addition or removal of subsidies, may give rise to adverse regulatory, legal or market responses. For example, the implementation of regulations intended to reduce GHG emissions in the steel industry in China could adversely impact demand for our metallurgical coal and/or iron ore.\n\n## Examples of potential opportunities\n\n- -  Our copper, nickel, iron ore and metallurgical coal provide essential building blocks for renewable power generation and electric vehicles, and can play an important part in the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n- -  Our potash fertiliser options can promote more efficient and profitable agriculture and alleviate the increased competition for arable land.\n- -  Increased collaboration with customers, suppliers and original equipment manufacturers, such as BHP's partnerships with HBIS Group, China Baowu, JFE, POSCO and Tata Steel to explore technologies to reduce GHG emissions across the steel value chain, can provide opportunities for the development of new products and markets.\n\n## Key management actions\n\n- -  Establishing public positions on, and mandatory minimum performance requirements for managing, climate change threats and opportunities, which are set out in our Climate Change Report 2020, our Climate Transition Action Plan 2021 and the Our Requirements for Environment and Climate Change standard.\n- -  Using climate-related scenarios (including our Paris-aligned 1.5\u00b0C scenario), themes and signposts (such as monitoring policy, regulatory, legal, technological, market and other societal developments) to evaluate the resilience of our portfolio and inform our strategy.\n- -  Considering transition risks (including carbon prices) when making capital expenditure decisions or allocating capital through our Capital Allocation Framework, supporting the prioritisation of capital and investment approval processes.\n- -  Seeking to mitigate our exposure to risks arising from policy and regulation in our operating jurisdictions and markets by reducing our operational GHG emissions and taking a product stewardship approach to GHG emissions in our value chain.\n- -  Advocating for the introduction of an effective, long-term policy framework that can deliver a measured transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n## FY2022 insights\n\nOur exposure to transition risks decreased in FY2022 due to portfolio changes involving the merger of our Petroleum business with Woodside and divestment of our interests in BMC and Cerrej\u00f3n. However, societal pressure for change continued to increase with many governments and organisations making commitments to achieve GHG emissions targets within specified timeframes, including commitments at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 26) in November 2021. Investor and other stakeholder interest in understanding how climate change might impact our strategy and portfolio continued to grow in FY2022, and stakeholder expectations of BHP regarding disclosure of climate-related information have increased accordingly.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to:\n\n- \u00b7   BHP Climate Transition Action Plan 2021\n- \u00b7  BHP Climate Change Report 2020\n- \u00b7  OFR 3 - Positioning for the future\n- \u00b7 bhp.com/sustainability/climate-change\n- \u00b7  OFR 7.8 - Climate change\n\n## Adopting technologies and maintaining digital security\n\nRisks associated with adopting and implementing new technologies, and maintaining the effectiveness of our existing digital landscape (including cyber defences) across our value chain.\n\n## Why is this important to BHP?\n\nOur business and operational processes across our value chain are increasingly dependent on the effective application and adoption of technology, which we use as a lever to deliver on our current and future operational, financial and social objectives. This exposes BHP to risks originating from adopting or implementing new technologies, or failing to take appropriate action to position BHP for the digital future, which may impact the capabilities we require, the effectiveness and efficiency of our operations and our ability to compete effectively. We may also fail to maintain the effectiveness of our existing and future digital landscape, including cyber defences, exposing us to technology availability, reliability and cybersecurity risks.\n\nThese could lead to operational events, commercial disruption (such as an inability to process or ship our products), corruption or loss of system data, misappropriation or loss of funds, unintended loss or disclosure of commercial or personal information, enforcement action or litigation. An inability to adequately maintain existing technology or implement critical new technology, or any sustained disruption to our existing technology may also adversely affect our licence to operate, reputation, results of operations and financial performance.\n\n## Examples of potential threats\n\n- -  Failure to invest in appropriate technologies, or to keep pace with advancements in technology, that support the pursuit of our objectives may adversely impact the effectiveness or efficiency of our business and erode our competitive advantage. For example, a failure to implement appropriate technologies that support our assets to produce higher-grade commodities or less waste from existing resources could limit our ability to sell our commodities or reduce costs.\n- -  Failing to identify, access and secure necessary infrastructure and key inputs (including electricity, internet bandwidth, data, software, licences or other rights in intellectual property, hardware and talent) to support new technology innovations and advanced technologies may adversely affect our ability to adopt, operate or retain access to those technologies. This includes artificial intelligence and machine learning, process automation, robotics, data analytics, cloud computing, smart devices and remote working solutions. For example, adopting new technology to reduce GHG emissions through the use of alternative energy sources may require new infrastructure, while effective implementation of new digital technologies may be heavily dependent on access to relevant data.\n- -  Failure or outage of our information or operational technology systems.",

For example, a cyber attack could result in a failure of businesscritical technology systems at one or more of our assets, which may reduce operational productivity and/or adversely impact safety.\n\n## Examples of potential opportunities\n\n- -  Applying digital solutions across our operations and value chain may unlock greater productivity and safety performance. For example, using predictive analytics to enable operations to identify asset condition and efficiencies may improve safety, production and equipment availability, and reduce maintenance and other costs.\n- -  Technology solutions to reduce GHG emissions may support BHP, our suppliers and customers in achieving climate action targets. For example, BHP has become a founding partner of Komatsu's GHG Alliance in the ongoing development of zero GHG emissions haul trucks.\n- -  Developing and applying artificial intelligence in mine planning, remote operation and advanced robotic technologies may identify or provide access to previously unknown or inaccessible deposits and development of end-to-end autonomous mining systems.\n- -  Using digital simulations and predictive trend modelling may enable us to optimise the deployment of new technologies, such as automation and electrification, support early identification of process variances and faults, and support the marketing of our products to customers.\n\n## Key management actions\n\n- -  Our assets, functions and projects are responsible for managing localised or projectspecific exposure to technology and cyber risks, including risks associated with business- critical technology systems. Enterprise-level risks that are specific to technology, such as those that pose a greater threat to our wider business and strategic opportunities, are generally managed by our global Technology team and other relevant stakeholders to support delivery of our technology strategy.\n- -  We collaborate with industry and research partners to develop technological solutions.\n- -  Our Technology Risk Committee oversees the management and improvement of technology risks and controls, and supports the embedment of a sustainable risk culture in our Technology team.\n- -  We employ a number of measures designed to protect against, detect and respond to cyber events or attacks, including BHP's mandatory minimum performance requirements for technology and cybersecurity, cybersecurity performance requirements for suppliers, cybersecurity resilience programs, an enterprise security framework and cybersecurity standards, cybersecurity risk and control guidance, security awareness programs and training to build capability, security assessments and continuous monitoring, restricted physical access to hardware and crisis management plans.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## FY2022 insights\n\nAs we continued to leverage technology and enable digital transformation in FY2022, our exposure to associated risks increased. In particular, a continued increase in the frequency and sophistication of cyber attacks against companies, as well as on supply chains and critical infrastructure (for example, cyber attacks affecting South Africa Transfer Port Terminals and the Toronto Transit Commission) highlighted the importance of our ongoing focus to strengthen management of cybersecurity risk across the Group. We continued to adopt digital technologies where appropriate, including through the use of greater automation at our operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to  OFR 2.2.\n\n## Ethical misconduct\n\nRisks associated with actual or alleged deviation from societal or business expectations of ethical behaviour (including breaches of laws or regulations) and wider or cumulative organisational cultural failings, resulting in significant reputational impacts.\n\n## Why is this important to BHP?\n\nActual or alleged conduct of BHP or our people or third-party partners that deviates from the standard of ethical behaviour expected of us could result in reputational damage or a breach of law or regulations. Such conduct includes fraud, corruption, anti-competitive behaviour, money laundering, breaching trade or financial sanctions, market manipulation, privacy breaches, ethical misconduct and wider organisational cultural failings. A failure to act ethically or legally may result in negative publicity, investigations, public inquiries, regulatory enforcement action, litigation or other civil or criminal proceedings, or increased regulation. It could also threaten the validity of our tenements or permits, or adversely impact our reputation, results of operations, financial performance or share price. Impacts may be amplified if our senior leaders fail to uphold BHP's values or address actual or alleged misconduct in a way that is consistent with societal and stakeholder expectations. Our workplace culture may also be eroded, adversely affecting our ability to attract and retain talent.

Societal expectations regarding respectful behaviours in the workplace continued to grow. We continued to implement and improve controls designed to create a safe and respectful workplace and prevent sexual harassment from occurring. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine triggered the introduction of trade and financial sanctions by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and other jurisdictions against Russia, underscoring the importance of continued management of associated risks across our global operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to:\n\n- \u00b7  OFR 7.5 - Sexual harassment\n- \u00b7 Our Charter and Our Code of Conduct\n- \u00b7   OFR 7.7 - Ethics and business conduct\n- \u00b7  Corporate Governance Statement\n\n## 10  Performance by commodity\n\nManagement believes the following information presented by commodity provides a meaningful indication of the underlying financial and operating performance of the assets, including equity accounted investments, of each reportable segment.\n\nInformation relating to assets that are accounted for as equity accounted investments is shown to reflect BHP's share, unless otherwise noted, to provide insight into the drivers of these assets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information as to the statutory determination of our reportable segments, refer to Financial Statements note 1 'Segment reporting'.\n\nUnit costs is one of our non-IFRS financial measures used to monitor the performance of our individual assets and is included in the analysis of each reportable segment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor the definition and method of calculation of our non-IFRS financial measures, including Underlying EBITDA and Unit costs, refer to OFR 11.\n\n## 10.1  Copper\n\nDetailed below is financial and operating information for our Copper assets comparing FY2022 to FY2021.\n\n| Year ended 30 June  US$M                | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Revenue                                 | 16,849 | 15,726 |\n| Underlying EBITDA                       | 8,565  | 8,489  |\n| Net operating assets                    | 27,420 | 26,928 |\n| Capital expenditure                     | 2,528  | 2,180  |\n| Total copper production (kt)            | 1,574  | 1,636  |\n| Average realised prices Copper (US$/lb) | 4.16   | 3.81   |\n\n## Key drivers of Copper's financial results\n\n## Price overview\n\nOur average realised sales price for FY2022 was US$4.16 per pound (FY2021: US$3.81 per pound). Copper prices spent much of FY2022 trading around historic highs, buoyed by robust demand, low visible inventories, delays to new copper projects and Russian supply risks. However, prices fell in two stages in the June quarter. The first decline was due to the demand impact of China's COVID-19 lockdowns. The second was due to recession speculation in advanced economies. We believe mine supply and scrap collection will grow in the coming few years, covering near-term demand growth. Longer term, traditional end-use demand is expected to be solid, while broad exposure to the electrification megatrend offers attractive upside.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal Copper production for FY2022 decreased by 4 per cent to 1,574 kt.\n\nEscondida copper production decreased by 6 per cent to 1,004 kt primarily due to concentrator feed grade decline of 4 per cent, public road blockades affecting access to site for both workers and supplies, and the impact of a reduced operational workforce from COVID-19. Despite these challenges, Escondida achieved record material mined for FY2022 and near record concentrator throughput of 367 ktpd.\n\nPampa Norte copper production increased by 29 per cent to 281 kt reflecting the ramp up of the Spence Growth Option (SGO), partially offset by the impact of lower cathode production as a result of a 14 per cent decline in Pampa Norte stacking feed grade.\n\nOlympic Dam copper production decreased by 33 per cent to 138 kt as a result of the major smelter maintenance campaign (SCM21) completed in January 2022 which was delayed due to COVID-19 impacts on the availability of the workforce. Near record production in the June 2022 quarter followed the successful ramp up of the smelter to full capacity in April 2022. Average copper grade of 2.14 per cent was achieved in FY2022 as the majority of material mined is from the Southern Mine Area.\n\nAntamina copper production increased by 4 per cent to 150 kt, reflecting higher copper head grades. Zinc production decreased by 15 per cent to 123 kt reflecting lower zinc head grades.\n\n## Financial results\n\nCopper revenue increased by US$1.1 billion to US$16.8 billion in FY2022 due to higher average realised Copper prices offset by lower production.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA for Copper increased by US$76 million to US$8.6 billion. Price impacts, net of price-linked costs, increased Underlying EBITDA by US$1.0 billion. Lower volumes decreased Underlying EBITDA by US$652 million.",

        "page_content": "Controllable cash costs increased by US$107 million, due to higher costs at Escondida in line with record material mined and workforce bonus payments for renewal of a collective bargaining agreement, and also at Spence from a ramp up of concentrate volumes. In addition, controllable costs increased at both Escondida and Pampa Norte due to costs associated with the implementation of COVID-19 preventative measures (reported as an exceptional item in the prior year). This was partially offset by favourable inventory movements at Escondida and Spence as well as lower costs at Olympic Dam reflecting favourable inventory movements due to reduced operational activity during the major smelter maintenance campaign. In the prior year, costs benefited from a one-off gain from cancelled power contracts at Escondida and Spence.\n\nInflation and higher input prices for diesel, acid and consumables negatively impacted Underlying EBITDA by US$408 million and US$295 million respectively, partially offset by favourable foreign exchange rate movements of US$497 million. Equity accounted investment profits attributable to Antamina increased by US$97 million due to higher realised prices for both copper and zinc.\n\nEscondida unit costs increased by 20 per cent to US$1.20 per pound at realised exchange rates. This reflected strong cost discipline despite higher prices for consumables, workforce bonus payments following renewal of a new collective bargaining agreement and a one-off gain recorded in the prior year due to cancelled power contracts as part of Escondida's transition to renewable electricity. Costs associated with a planned material mined increase of approximately 20 per cent, incremental costs associated with COVID-19 preventative measures and lower by-product credits also contributed to higher unit costs. These increases were partially offset by lower power prices achieved by Escondida's transition towards 100 per cent renewable electricity.\n\nThe calculation of Escondida unit costs is set out in the table below.\n\n| Escondida unit costs   (US$M)   | FY2022   | FY2021   |\n|---------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| Revenue                         | 9,500    | 9,470    |\n| Underlying EBITDA               | 6,198    | 6,483    |\n| Gross costs                     | 3,302    | 2,987    |\n| Less: by-product credits        | 430      | 478      |\n| Less: freight                   | 230      | 162      |\n| Net costs                       | 2,642    | 2,347    |\n| Sales (kt)                      | 1,001    | 1,066    |\n| Sales (Mlb)                     | 2,206    | 2,350    |\n| Cost per pound (US$) 1,2,3      | 1.20     | 1.00     |\n\n- 1 FY2022 based on average exchange rates of USD/ CLP 811.\n- 2   FY2022 includes COVID-19 related costs of US$0.02 per pound, which was reported as an exceptional item in FY2021 (FY2021: US$0.03 per pound).\n- 3 FY2021 includes a one off gain from the optimised outcome from renegotiation of cancelled power contracts of US$0.04 per pound.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Outlook\n\nTotal Copper production of between 1,635 and 1,825 kt is expected in FY2023. Escondida production of between 1,080 and 1,180 kt is expected in FY2023, reflecting an expected increase in concentrator feed grade compared to FY2022. Production at Pampa Norte is expected to be between 240 and 290 kt in FY2023, reflecting a forecast decline in stacking feed grade at Pampa Norte, the commencement of plant design modifications at SGO and the continued transition towards the planned closure of Cerro Colorado at the end of CY2023. At Olympic Dam, production is expected to be between 195 and 215 kt in FY2023.\n\nAntamina Copper production is expected between 120 and 140 kt in FY2023.\n\nEscondida unit costs in FY2023 are expected to be between US$1.25 and US$1.45 per pound (based on an exchange rate of USD/CLP 830). This largely reflects inflationary pressures, including expected further price increases for consumables, and planned higher costs to study the potential to increase optionality at Escondida longer term. In the medium term, unit cost guidance for Escondida has been revised to less than US$1.15 per pound from less than US$1.10 per pound (based on an exchange rate of USD/CLP 830), reflecting inflation, the impact of higher power consumption and increased water costs.\n\nMedium-term production guidance for Escondida of 1.2 Mtpa on average over the next five years remains unchanged.\n\n## 10.2  Iron Ore\n\nDetailed below is financial and operating information for our Iron Ore assets comparing FY2022 to FY2021.\n\n| Year ended 30 June  US$M                        | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Revenue                                         | 30,767 | 34,475 |\n| Underlying EBITDA                               | 21,707 | 26,278 |\n| Net operating assets                            | 16,823 | 18,663 |\n| Capital expenditure                             | 1,848  | 2,188  |\n| Total iron ore production (Mt)                  | 253    | 254    |\n| Average realised prices Iron ore (US$/wmt, FOB) | 113.10 | 130.56 |\n\n## Key drivers of Iron Ore's financial results\n\n## Price overview\n\nIron Ore's average realised sales price for FY2022 was US$113.10 per wet metric tonne (wmt) (FY2021: US$130.56 per wmt). The iron ore market was firm for much of the second half of FY2022, supported by resilient demand, constrained supply of competing scrap in China, and lower than expected seaborne supply from some low cost and swing suppliers. As a result, Chinese port stocks declined steadily for much of the period. Near the close of the year, weakening sentiment within the steel value chain fed back into lower prices for iron ore. Looking ahead, the key near-term uncertainties are the pace of steel end-use sector recovery in China, how the Chinese authorities will administer steel production cuts in the remainder of the CY2022, and the performance of seaborne supply. In the medium term, China's demand for iron ore is expected to be lower than it is today as crude steel production plateaus, and the scrap-to-steel ratio rises. In the long term, prices are expected to be determined by high-cost production, on a value-in-use adjusted basis, from Australia or Brazil. It is imperative that we continue to compete on both quality and operational effectiveness.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal Iron Ore production was in line with the prior period.\n\nWAIO production of 249 Mt (283 Mt on a 100 per cent basis) was in line with the prior period, reflecting continued strong supply chain performance and favourable weather compared to the prior period, offset by the impacts of temporary labour constraints relating to COVID-19, planned major maintenance including the Jimblebar train load out and car dumper one. Our preventative maintenance programs continue to underpin the strength of the WAIO supply chain, delivering increased car dumper, reclaimer and ship loader availability year on year and enabling record sales volumes of 284 Mt (100 per cent basis).\n\nSouth Flank ramp up to full production capacity of 80 Mtpa (100 per cent basis) is ahead of schedule with an average rate of 67Mtpa achieved in the June 2022 quarter contributing to record production from the Mining Area C hub and record lump sales.\n\nSamarco production of 4.1 Mt (BHP share) reflected the ramp up of production to capacity, following the recommencement of iron ore pellet production at one concentrator in December 2020.\n\n## Financial results\n\nTotal Iron Ore revenue decreased by US$3.7 billion to US$30.8 billion in FY2022 reflecting lower average realised prices.",

        "page_content": "## 10  Performance by commodity continued\n\nUnderlying EBITDA for Iron Ore decreased by US$4.6 billion to US$21.7 billion primarily due to lower average realised prices, net of price linked costs, of US$4.0 billion and higher operating cash costs of US$431 million. The higher cash costs are primarily a result of South Flank operational ramp up spend, increased rail maintenance, incremental costs associated with COVID-19 (mainly higher demurrage costs due to delays, reported as an exceptional item in the prior year) and inventory movements to support the supply chain. Other items such as inflation and higher fuel and energy costs negatively impacted Underlying EBITDA by US$392 million. This was partially offset by favourable foreign exchange rate impacts of US$332 million.\n\nWAIO unit costs increased by 13 per cent to US$16.81 per tonne at realised exchange rates. The increase in unit cost was mainly due to higher diesel prices, costs associated with the ramp up of South Flank, higher rail track maintenance costs, and costs associated with COVID-19 of approximately US$0.50 per tonne, which has been taken to unit costs in this period but reported as an exceptional item in the prior period.

FY2021 excluded COVID-19 related costs of US$0.51 per tonne (including US$0.25 per tonne relating to operations and US$0.26 per tonne relating to demurrage) that was reported as an exceptional item. In FY2021 an additional US$0.12 per tonne relating to capital projects was also reported as an exceptional item.\n\n## Outlook\n\nWAIO production for FY2023 is expected to increase to between 246 and 256 Mt (278 and 290 Mt on a 100 per cent basis) reflecting the tie-in of the port debottlenecking project (PDP1) and the continued ramp up of South Flank.\n\nSamarco production of between 3 and 4 Mt (BHP share) is expected in FY2023.\n\nUnit costs in FY2023 are expected to be between US$18 and US$19 per tonne (based on an exchange rate of AUD/USD 0.72). In the medium term, unit costs have been revised to less than US$17 per tonne reflecting updated guidance exchange rates (based on an exchange rate of AUD/USD 0.72) and inflationary pressures, and our plan to creep production to greater than 300 Mtpa.\n\n## 10.3  Coal\n\nDetailed below is financial and operating information for our Coal assets comparing FY2022 to FY2021.\n\n| Year ended 30 June  US$M                  | 2022   | 2021   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Revenue                                   | 15,549 | 5,154  |\n| Underlying EBITDA                         | 9,504  | 288    |\n| Net operating assets                      | 7,650  | 7,512  |\n| Capital expenditure                       | 621    | 579    |\n| Total metallurgical coal  production (Mt) | 37     | 41     |\n| Total energy coal production (Mt)         | 18     | 19     |\n| Average realised prices                   |        |        |\n| Metallurgical coal (US$/t)                | 347.10 | 106.64 |\n| Hard coking coal (HCC)(US$/t)             | 366.82 | 112.72 |\n| Weak coking coal (WCC)(US$/t)             | 296.51 | 89.62  |\n| Thermal coal (US$/t)                      | 216.78 | 58.42  |\n\n## Key drivers of Coal's financial results\n\n## Price overview\n\n## Metallurgical coal\n\nOur average realised sales price for FY2022 was US$366.82 per tonne for hard coking coal (HCC) (FY2021: US$112.72 per tonne) and US$296.51 per tonne for weak coking coal (WCC) (FY2021: US$89.62 per tonne). Metallurgical coal prices surged to record highs in the second half of FY2022 on firm rest of world demand, uncertainty over Russia and multi-regional, multicausal supply disruptions. The deterioration in rest of world steelmaking profitability late in the June quarter saw prices descend from their extreme highs. The industry faces a difficult and uncertain period ahead. Natural trade flows are impaired, including uncertainty around China's import policy and Russian coal supply. The regulatory environment has also become less conducive to long-life capital investment. Long term, we believe that a wholesale shift away from blast furnace steelmaking is still decades in the future. That assessment is based on our bottom-up analysis of likely regional steel decarbonisation pathways, as discussed in our Climate Transition Action Plan. Demand for seaborne Hard Coking Coals (HCC) is expected to expand alongside the growth of the steel industry in HCC importing countries such as India.\n\n## Energy coal\n\nOur average realised sales price for FY2022 was US$216.78 per tonne (FY2021: US$58.42 per tonne). The Newcastle 6,000 kcal/kg price reached a record high in May 2022 due to very strong demand and constrained supply. Trade flow redirection from Asia to Europe due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, gas-tocoal switching as LNG prices spiked upwards, and hot weather in major importing regions, all contributed to the swift run-up in pricing. Longer term, total primary energy derived from coal (power and non-power) is expected to be challenged, particularly under deep decarbonisation scenarios, where demand is expected to decline in absolute terms.\n\n## Production\n\n## Metallurgical coal\n\nMetallurgical coal production consisted of BMA production and BMC production up to 3 May 2022 when the divestment of our interest in BMC completed.\n\nBMA production decreased by 9 per cent to 29 Mt (58 Mt on a 100 per cent basis). Record production at the Broadmeadow mine was more than offset by significant wet weather impacts across most BMA operations and labour constraints, including COVID-19 related absenteeism which impacted stripping and mine productivity.\n\nBMC production decreased by 9 per cent to 8 Mt due to the divestment of our 80 per cent interest in BMC to Stanmore Resources Limited on 3 May 2022.\n\n## Energy coal\n\nEnergy coal production consisted of NSWEC production and Cerrej\u00f3n production up to 11 January 2022 when the divestment of our interest in Cerrej\u00f3n completed.\n\nNSWEC production decreased by 4 per cent to 14 Mt, reflecting lower volumes due to an increased proportion of washed coal to capitalise on higher margins for higher-quality coals, COVID-19 related labour constraints which impacted stripping performance and mine productivity, and wet weather. Higher-quality coals made up almost 90 per cent of sales compared to approximately 60 per cent of sales in the prior year.\n\nCerrej\u00f3n production decreased by 15 per cent to 4 Mt due to the divestment of our interest on 11 January 2022.\n\n## Financial results\n\nCoal revenue increased by US$10.4 billion to US$15.5 billion in FY2022 mainly due to higher average realised prices.\n\nUnderlying EBITDA for Coal increased by US$9.2 billion to US$9.5 billion. Price impacts, net of price-linked costs, increased Underlying EBITDA by US$8.1 billion combined with the higher contribution of BMC of US$1.4 billion, mainly due to higher realised prices, prior to the divestment of our 80 per cent interest.",

This was partially offset by cost reduction initiatives and favourable exchange rate movements.\n\nNSWEC unit costs increased by 10 per cent to US$71 per tonne reflecting lower volumes due to an increased proportion of washed coal to capitalise on higher margins for higher-quality coals and COVID-19 related labour constraints which impacted stripping performance and mine productivity combined with higher diesel and electricity prices. This was partially offset by cost reduction initiatives and favourable exchange rate movements.\n\n## Outlook\n\nBMA coal production for FY2023 is expected to be between 29 and 32 Mt (58 and 64 Mt on a 100 per cent basis).\n\nNSWEC production for FY2023 is expected to be between 13 and 15 Mt reflecting a continued focus on higher-quality coals.\n\nBMA unit costs in FY2023 are expected to be between US$90 and US$100 per tonne (based on an exchange rate of AUD/USD 0.72) as a result of continued higher diesel and electricity prices. We remain focused on cost reduction and productivity initiatives, however given the ongoing uncertainty regarding restrictions on coal imports into China and the announcement of the change to the Queensland royalty regime, we are unable to provide medium-term volume and unit cost guidance. We are seeking to preserve low-cost incremental growth optionality in our portfolio with a focus on higher-quality coking coals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNSWEC unit costs in FY2023 are expected to be between US$76 and US$86 per tonne (based on an exchange rate of AUD/USD 0.72) reflecting inflationary pressures, higher port toll charges at the NCIG coal export terminal and a continued focus on higher-quality coals, offset by mine plan optimisation, productivity improvements and cost reduction initiatives.\n\n## 10.4  Other assets\n\nDetailed below is an analysis of Other assets' financial and operating performance comparing FY2022 to FY2021.\n\n## Nickel West\n\n## Key drivers of Nickel West's financial results\n\n## Price overview\n\nOur average realised sales price for FY2022 was US$23,275 per tonne (FY2021: US$16,250 per tonne). The nickel market was in deficit across the 2021 calendar year and early 2022. Visible inventories were drawn down steeply, putting upward pressure on prices. These tight fundamentals emerged due to a combination of strong demand from conventional end-use sectors, rapid growth in the electric vehicle value chain, uncertainty over the actual and potential loss of supply from Russia, and constrained Class-1 supply in the 2021 calendar year. These forces culminated in a dramatic spike in LME prices in March 2022. Prices have since fallen back to levels before the Russian invasion of Ukraine due to recession fears, alongside other exchange-traded metals. Longer term, we believe nickel will be a core beneficiary of the electrification mega-trend and that nickel sulphides will be particularly attractive.\n\n## Production\n\nNickel West production in FY2022 decreased by 14 per cent to 77 kt due to the significant impacts of COVID-19 related labour absenteeism and workforce shortages, and unplanned downtime at the oxygen plant leading to a 15-day smelter outage in the June 2022 quarter.\n\nThe calculation of BMA and NSWEC unit costs is set out in the table below:\n\n|                          | BMA unit costs 1   | BMA unit costs 1   | NSWEC unit costs   | NSWEC unit costs   |\n|--------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| US$M                     | FY2022             | FY2021             | FY2022             | FY2021             |\n| Revenue                  | 10,254             | 3,537              | 3,034              | 839                |\n| Underlying EBITDA        | 6,335              | 567                | 1,807              | (169)              |\n| Gross costs              | 3,919              | 2,970              | 1,227              | 1,008              |\n| Less: freight            | 50                 | 54                 | -                  | -                  |\n| Less: royalties          | 1,282              | 275                | 227                | 66                 |\n| Net costs                | 2,587              | 2,641              | 1,000              | 942                |\n| Sales (kt, equity share) | 29,049             | 31,958             | 14,124             | 14,626             |\n| Cost per tonne (US$) 2,3 | 89.06              | 82.64              | 70.80              | 64.41              |\n\n## Financial results\n\nHigher average realised sales prices resulted in revenue increasing by US$381 million to US$1.9 billion in FY2022.\n\nNickel West's Underlying EBITDA increased from US$259 million in FY2021 to US$420 million in FY2022, reflecting higher average realised prices and favourable exchange rate movements. This was partially offset by lower volumes mainly due to the significant impacts of COVID-19 related labour absenteeism and workforce shortages, unplanned downtime at the oxygen plant leading to a 15-day smelter outage in the June 2022 quarter, and the adverse impacts of the stronger nickel price on third-party concentrate purchase costs.\n\n## Outlook\n\nNickel West production for FY2023 is expected to be between 80 and 90 kt, weighted to the second half of the year due to planned smelter maintenance in the first half.\n\n## Potash\n\nPotash recorded an Underlying EBITDA loss of US$147 million in FY2022, and a loss of US$167 million in FY2021.\n\n## 10.5  Impact of changes to commodity prices\n\nThe prices we obtain for our products are a key driver of value for BHP. Fluctuations in these commodity prices affect our results, including cash flows and asset values.

Revenue not attributable to reportable segments comprises the sale of freight and fuel to third parties. Exploration and technology activities are recognised within relevant segments.\n- 2 We differentiate sales of our production from sales of third-party products to better measure the operational profitability of our operations as a percentage of revenue. These tables show the breakdown between our production and third-party products, which is necessary for the calculation of the Underlying EBITDA margin and margin on third-party products.\n\nWe engage in third-party trading for the following reasons:\n\n- -  Production variability and occasional shortfalls from our assets means that we sometimes source third-party materials to ensure a steady supply of product to our customers.\n- -  To optimise our supply chain outcomes, we may buy physical product from third parties.\n- -  To support the development of liquid markets, we will sometimes source third-party physical products and manage risk through both the physical and financial markets.\n- 3 Percentage contribution to Group Underlying EBITDA, excluding Group and unallocated items.\n- 4 Underlying EBITDA margin excludes third-party products.\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\n|                              |                               |                           |      | 2021  Restated                | 2021  Restated            | 2021  Restated   | 2020  Restated                | 2020  Restated            | 2020  Restated   |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|\n| Year ended 30 June           | Profit before  taxation  US$M | Income  tax expense  US$M | %    | Profit before  taxation  US$M | Income  tax expense  US$M | %                | Profit before  taxation  US$M | Income  tax expense  US$M | %                |\n| Statutory effective tax rate | 33,137                        | (10,737)                  | 32.4 | 24,292                        | (10,616)                  | 43.7             | 12,825                        | (4,197)                   | 32.7             |\n| Adjusted for:                |                               |                           |      |                               |                           |                  |                               |                           |                  |\n| Exchange rate movements      | -                             | (233)                     |      | -                             | (33)                      |                  | -                             | 41                        |                  |\n| Exceptional items 1          | 620                           | 454                       |      | 4,423                         | 1,057                     |                  | 1,540                         | (239)                     |                  |\n| Adjusted effective tax rate  | 33,757                        | (10,516)                  | 31.2 | 28,715                        | (9,592)                   | 33.4             | 14,365                        | (4,395)                   | 30.6             |\n\n- 1 For more information refer to Financial Statements note 3 'Exceptional items'.",

costs and change in exploration and business development as Change in controllable cash costs. Operating cash costs by definition do not include non-cash costs. The change in operating cash costs also excludes the impact of exchange rates and inflation, changes in fuel, energy costs and consumable costs, changes in exploration and business development costs and one-off items. These items are excluded so as to provide a consistent measurement of changes in costs across all segments, based on the factors that are within the control and responsibility of the segment.",

'BHP', the 'Company', the 'Group', 'our business', 'organisation', 'we', 'us', 'our' and 'ourselves' refer to BHP Group Limited, and except where the context otherwise requires, our subsidiaries. Refer to Financial Statements note 28 'Subsidiaries' for a list of our significant subsidiaries. Those terms do not include nonoperated assets.\n\nThis Report covers functions and assets (including those under exploration, projects in development or execution phases, sites and closed operations) that have been wholly owned and/or operated by BHP or that have been owned as a BHP-operated joint venture 1 operated by BHP (referred to in this Report as 'operated assets' or 'operations') from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022. BHP also holds interests in assets that are owned as a joint venture but not operated by BHP (referred to in this Report as 'non-operated joint ventures' or 'non-operated assets'). Notwithstanding that this Report may include production, financial and other information from non-operated assets, non-operated assets are not included in the BHP Group and, as a result, statements regarding our operations, assets and values apply only to our operated assets unless stated otherwise.\n\nOn 31 January 2022, we unified our company structure under BHP Group Limited, with a primary listing on the Australian Securities Exchange. BHP holds a standard listing on the London Stock Exchange, a secondary listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and an ADR program listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\n## 12.2 Forward looking statements\n\nThis Report contains forward-looking statements, including: statements regarding trends in commodity prices and currency exchange rates; demand for commodities; reserves and resources and production forecasts; expectations, plans, strategies and objectives of management; climate scenarios; approval of certain projects and consummation of certain transactions; closure or divestment of certain assets, operations or facilities (including associated costs); anticipated production or construction commencement dates; capital costs and scheduling; operating costs and supply of materials and skilled employees; anticipated productive lives of projects, mines and facilities; provisions and contingent liabilities; and tax and regulatory developments.\n\nForward-looking statements may be identified by the use of terminology including, but not limited to, 'intend', 'aim', 'ambition', 'aspiration', 'goal', 'target', 'project', 'see', 'anticipate', 'estimate', 'plan', 'objective', 'believe', 'expect', 'commit', 'may', 'should', 'need', 'must', 'will', 'would', 'continue', 'forecast', 'guidance', 'trend' or similar words. These statements discuss future expectations concerning the results of assets or\n\n1\n\nfinancial conditions, or provide other forwardlooking information.\n\nExamples of forward-looking statements contained in this Report include, without limitation, statements describing (i) our strategy, our values and how we define our success; (ii) our expectations regarding future demand for certain commodities, in particular copper, nickel, iron ore, metallurgical coal, steel and potash, and our intentions, commitments or expectations with respect to our supply of certain commodities, including copper, nickel, iron ore and potash; (iii) our future exploration and partnership plans and perceived benefits and opportunities, including our focus to grow our copper and nickel assets; (iv) the structure of our organisation and portfolio and perceived benefits and opportunities; (v) our outlook for long-term economic growth and other macroeconomic and industry trends; (vi) our projected and expected production and performance levels and development projects; (vii) our expectations regarding our investments, including in potential growth options and technology and innovation, and perceived benefits and opportunities; (viii) our reserves and resources; (ix) our plans for our major projects and related budget allocations; (x) our expectations, commitments and objectives with respect to sustainability, decarbonisation, natural resource management, climate change and portfolio resilience and timelines and plans to seek to achieve or implement such objectives, including our new 2030 'People, Planet and Prosperity' goals, our approach to equitable change and transitions, our Climate Transition Action Plan, Climate Change Adaptation Strategy and goals, targets and strategies to seek to reduce or support the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and related perceived costs, benefits and opportunities for BHP; (xi) the assumptions, beliefs and conclusions in our climate change related statements and strategies, including in our Climate Change Report 2020, for example, in respect of future temperatures, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, and climate-related impacts; (xii) our commitment to social value; (xiii) our commitments to sustainability reporting, frameworks, standards and initiatives; (xiv) our commitments to improve or maintain safe tailings storage management; (xv) our commitments to achieve certain inclusion and diversity targets, aspirations and outcomes; (xvi) our commitments to achieve certain targets and outcomes with respect to Indigenous peoples and the communities in which we operate; and (xvii) our commitments to achieve certain health and safety targets and outcomes.\n\nForward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and reflect judgments, assumptions, estimates and other information available as at the date of this Report and/or the date of BHP's planning or scenario analysis processes. These statements do not represent guarantees or predictions of future financial or operational performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control and which may cause actual results to differ materially\n\nReferences in this Annual Report to a 'joint venture' are used for convenience to collectively describe assets that are not wholly owned by BHP. Such references are not intended to characterise the legal relationship between the owners of the asset.\n\nfrom those expressed in the statements contained in this Report. BHP cautions against reliance on any forward-looking statements or guidance, including in light of the current economic climate and the significant volatility, uncertainty and disruption arising in connection with the Ukrainian conflict and COVID-19. For example, our future revenues from our assets, projects or mines described in this Report will be based, in part, on the market price of the minerals or metals produced, which may vary significantly from current levels. These variations, if materially adverse, may affect the timing or the feasibility of the development of a particular project, the expansion of certain facilities or mines, or the continuation of existing assets.\n\nOther factors that may affect the actual construction or production commencement dates, revenues, costs or production output and anticipated lives of assets, mines or facilities include: (i) our ability to profitably produce and transport the minerals and/or metals extracted to applicable markets; (ii) the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on the market prices of the minerals or metals we produce; (iii) activities of government authorities in the countries where we sell our products and in the countries where we are exploring or developing projects, facilities or mines, including increases in taxes; (iv) changes in environmental and other regulations; (v) the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business; (vi) political or geopolitical uncertainty; (viii) labour unrest; and (viii) other factors identified in the risk factors set out in Operating and Financial Review 9.1.\n\nExcept as required by applicable regulations or by law, BHP does not undertake to publicly update or review any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information or future events. Past performance cannot be relied on as a guide to future performance.\n\n## Emissions and energy consumption data\n\nDue to the inherent uncertainty and limitations in measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and operational energy consumption under the calculation methodologies used in the preparation of such data, all GHG emissions and operational energy consumption data or references to GHG emissions and operational energy consumption volumes (including ratios or percentages) in this Report are estimates. There may also be differences in the manner that third parties calculate or report GHG emissions or operational energy consumption data compared to BHP, which means that thirdparty data may not be comparable to our data. For information on how we calculate our GHG emissions and operational energy consumption data, see our Methodology tab in our ESG Standards and Databook.\n\nThis Report is made in accordance with a resolution of the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKen MacKenzie\n\nChair\n\n16 August 2022",

Corporate governance at BHP\n\nGood corporate governance underpins the way we conduct business.\n\nWe are committed to the highest level of governance and strive to foster a culture that values and rewards exemplary ethical standards, personal and corporate integrity and respect for others.\n\nThis Corporate Governance Statement sets out the corporate governance framework currently in place for the Group, including the key policies and practices.\n\nThese arrangements are consistent with:\n\n- -  the fourth edition of the ASX Corporate Governance Council's Principles and Recommendations (ASX Fourth Edition); and\n- -  the governance requirements that apply to us as a result of our London Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listings and our registration with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States.\n\nThe ASX Fourth Edition (available at asx.com.au) requires the Board to consider the application of the relevant corporate governance principles, while\n\n## 2.  FY2022 corporate governance highlights\n\n## Key highlights\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Board composition and succession\n\nWe continued to apply a robust approach to Board renewal and focus on succession planning. As part of this process, we are delighted to have appointed Michelle Hinchliffe and Catherine Tanna to our Board during FY2022. Malcolm Broomhead and John Mogford have announced their retirement at the conclusion of the 2022 Annual General Meeting (AGM) and we thank both Malcolm and John for their commitment to our ongoing success.\n\n## Unification\n\nWe unified our Dual Listed Company structure to make us more agile and efficient. Following unification, we have reviewed and updated key corporate governance policies including the Board Governance Document and Committee Terms of Reference, Independence of Directors Policy, Market Disclosure and Communications Policy and Securities Dealing Policy to reflect our new corporate structure and current best governance practice.\n\n## 3.  BHP's governance structure\n\nThe Board has ultimate responsibility for overseeing BHP's governance. The role of the Board, as set out in the Board Governance Document, is to represent shareholders and promote and protect the interests of BHP in the short and long term. The Board considers the interests of the Group's shareholders as a whole and the interests of other relevant stakeholders where appropriate.\n\nThe Chair is responsible for leading the Board and ensuring it operates to high governance standards. In particular, the Chair facilitates constructive Board relations and the effective contribution of all Non-executive Directors.\n\n## Governance structure\n\n## Diversity\n\nOur aspiration is to achieve gender balance (which we define as a minimum 40 per cent women and 40 per cent men in line with the definition used by entities such as the International Labour Organization) on our Board. Currently 33 per cent of our Directors are female and following Malcolm Broomhead and John Mogford's retirement from the Board after the 2022 AGM, this will be 40 per cent. We continue to consider other aspects of diversity as part of our ongoing Board succession planning.\n\n## Update of Board skills matrix\n\nWe refreshed our Board skills matrix to reflect our current purpose and strategy. An external expert completed an assessment of each Director against the updated matrix.\n\nThe Group Company Secretary is accountable to the Board and advises the Chair, the Board and individual Directors on all matters of governance process.\n\nThe Board has established Committees to assist it in exercising its authority, including monitoring the performance of BHP to gain assurance that progress is being made towards our purpose within the limits imposed by the Board. These Committees include the Nomination and Governance Committee, Risk and Audit Committee, Sustainability Committee and the Remuneration Committee. Each of these permanent Committees has a Terms of Reference under which authority is delegated by the Board. These are available at bhp.com/governance.\n\nThe Board has extensive access to members of senior management who frequently attend Board and Committee meetings. Management make presentations and engage in discussions with Directors, answer questions and provide input and perspective on their areas of responsibility.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is accountable to the Board for the authority that is delegated to the CEO and for the performance of the Group. The CEO works in a constructive partnership with the Board and is required to report regularly to the Board on progress.\n\nThe Board also holds discussions in the absence of management at each Board meeting.\n\nThe diagram below illustrates BHP's governance structure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrecognising departures from those principles are appropriate in some circumstances.\n\nThe Board considers that during FY2022, it complied with the ASX Fourth Edition, with no exceptions.\n\nThis Corporate Governance Statement is current as at 2 September 2022 and has been approved by the Board.\n\nMore information about our corporate governance framework and practices can be accessed on our website at bhp.com/governance, which includes links to our Appendix 4G and each of the publicly available documents referenced in this Corporate Governance Statement.",

At the end of BHP's 2022 Annual General Meeting (AGM), Malcolm Broomhead and John Mogford will be stepping down from the Board.\n\nThe Directors' qualifications, experience and special responsibilities are listed in Directors' Report 2.1.\n\nThe Board Governance Document outlines the processes relating to the Board's tasks and activities, the matters specifically reserved for Board decision-making, the authority delegated to the CEO and the accountability of the CEO for that authority, guidance on the management of the relationship between the Board and the CEO, and the boundaries on CEO action.\n\nThe matters reserved for the Board include:\n\n- -  CEO appointment and determination of the terms of the appointment\n- -  approval of the appointment of Executive Leadership Team (ELT) members, and material changes to the organisational structure involving direct reports to the CEO\n- -  strategy, annual budgets, balance sheet management and funding strategy\n- -  determination of commitments, capital and non-capital items, acquisitions and divestments above specified limits\n- -  performance assessment of the CEO and the Group\n- -  approving the Group's values, Our Code of Conduct , purpose and risk appetite\n- -  management of Board composition, processes and performance\n- -  determination and adoption of documents (including the publication of reports and statements to shareholders) that are required by the Group's constitutional documents, statute or by other external regulation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board Governance Document is available at bhp.com/governance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 4.2  Director independence\n\nThe Board is committed to ensuring that a majority of Directors are independent.\n\nThe Board has adopted a policy that it uses to determine the independence of its Directors. During FY2022, as part of the unification of our Dual Listed Company structure, the Board amended the policy for changes arising from unification that were in line with the ASX Fourth Edition and current best governance practice.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Independence of Directors Policy is available at bhp.com/governance.\n\n## Determination of Director independence\n\nThe Board confirms that it considers all of the current Non-executive Directors, including the Chair, to be independent of management and any business, interest or other relationship that could or could be perceived to materially interfere with the exercise of objective, unfettered or independent judgement by the Director or the Director's ability to act in the best interests of the BHP Group rather than an individual shareholder or other group.\n\nA determination of independence is carried out upon a Director's appointment, annually and at any other time where the change in circumstances of a Director warrant reconsideration. Some Directors hold, or have previously held, positions in companies with which BHP has commercial relationships. The Board has assessed the relationships between BHP and the companies in which Directors hold or held positions and has concluded that the relationships do not interfere with the Directors' exercise of objective, unfettered or independent judgement, or their ability to act in the best interests of BHP.\n\nFor example, the Chair, Mr Ken MacKenzie, is a Strategic Advisor at Barrenjoey Capital Partners. Barrenjoey was established as a financial services firm in September 2020 and provides strategic advisory and corporate finance services.\n\nIn 2020, the Board considered Mr MacKenzie's proposed appointment and it was approved on the basis that Barrenjoey would not advise BHP and that Mr MacKenzie himself would not advise on transactions or advise BHP competitors or our significant customers or suppliers.\n\nDuring FY2022, at the request of the CEO, the Board reconsidered these conditions without Mr MacKenzie present. The Board considered that there may be circumstances where it would be in the best interests of shareholders to permit Barrenjoey to advise the Group. For example, where other advisers were conflicted or where Barrenjoey had specifically relevant expertise. The Board approved, without Mr MacKenzie present, the removal of the restriction on Barrenjoey advising BHP, subject to the requirement that the CEO and the Senior Independent Director consult on any engagement on a case by case basis and where appropriate they will seek approval from the independent directors of the engagement and the arrangements to manage conflicts of interest. The other condition will continue and Mr MacKenzie himself will not advise on transactions or advise BHP competitors or our significant customers or suppliers.\n\nAccordingly, the Board is satisfied that Mr MacKenzie is able to continue to apply objective, unfettered and independent judgement and to act in the best interests of BHP. The Board does not consider that Mr MacKenzie's involvement with Barrenjoey to adversely impact his role or commitment to BHP. In particular, Mr MacKenzie has committed to the Board that BHP would remain his priority.\n\nMr Broomhead is and was throughout FY2022, a Director and the Chair of Orica Limited (a company BHP has commercial dealings with). The BHP Board assessed the relationship between BHP and Orica and remains satisfied that Mr Broomhead was and remained during FY2022 able to apply objective, unfettered and independent judgement and to act in the best interests of BHP.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nIn accordance with Australian law, if a situation arises for consideration where a Director has a material personal interest, the affected Director takes no part in decision making unless approval is provided by the non-interested Directors. Provisions for Directors' interests are set out in the Constitution of BHP Group Limited.\n\n## 4.3  Board appointments and succession planning\n\nBHP adopts a structured and rigorous approach to Board succession planning to guard against unforeseen departures and facilitate the orderly replacement of current Directors, and oversees the development of a diverse pipeline. This process is continuous, allowing the Board to ensure there is a right balance on the Board between experience and fresh perspectives, and the Board continues to be fit for purpose.\n\nAs part of this process, we are delighted to have appointed Michelle Hinchliffe and Catherine Tanna to our Board during FY2022. Malcolm Broomhead and John Mogford will retire at the conclusion of the 2022 AGM, and we thank both Malcolm and John for their commitment to our ongoing success.\n\nBefore the Board formally appoints a person or puts a person forward for election, the Board, with the assistance of external consultants, will conduct appropriate background and reference checks as to that person's character, experience, education, criminal and bankruptcy history.\n\nThe Board has adopted a letter of appointment that contains the terms on which Non-executive Directors will be appointed, including the basis upon which they will be indemnified by the Group. The letter of appointment defines the role of Directors, including the expectations in terms of independence, participation, time commitment and continuous improvement. Written agreements are in place for all Nonexecutive Directors.\n\n## 4.4  Director induction, training and development\n\nUpon appointment, each new Non-executive Director undertakes an induction program tailored to their needs.\n\nFollowing the induction program, Non-executive Directors participate in continuous improvement activities through a training and development program, which is overseen by the Nomination and Governance Committee to help ensure that Directors, individually and collectively develop and maintain the skills and knowledge to assist them in performing their role effectively. The training and development program is periodically reviewed to maximise effectiveness and to ensure it is tailored to Directors' needs and the Board's areas of focus.\n\nThroughout the year, the Chair discusses development areas with each Director. Board Committees review and agree their needs for more briefings. The benefit of this approach is that induction and learning opportunities can be tailored to Directors' Committee memberships, as well as the Board's specific areas of focus. This approach is also intended to ensure a coordinated process on succession planning, Board renewal, training and development and Committee composition. In turn, these processes are relevant to the Nomination and Governance Committee's role in identifying appropriate Non-executive Director candidates.",

        "page_content": "Examples of activities in the training and development program include:\n\n- -  briefings and development sessions to provide each Director with a deeper understanding of the activities, environment, key issues and direction of the assets, along with broader sustainability and geopolitical considerations\n- -  site visits to provide insights into key issues at the site and to provide an opportunity for direct engagement with stakeholders\n- -  engagement with the Forum on Corporate Responsibility (FCR), which comprises civil society leaders in various fields of sustainability, to discuss FCR members' views on current and emerging trends and risks\n\n## 4.5  Director skills, experience and attributes\n\n## Overarching statement of Board requirements\n\nAt BHP, we know that inclusive and diverse teams are safer and more productive. This is because people in these teams feel safe to speak up, share their ideas and different points of view, and work together to solve problems and make better decisions.\n\nThe BHP Board is no different and believes that its membership should comprise Directors with a broad range of skills and diversity in order for the Board to:\n\n- -  provide the breadth and depth of understanding necessary to effectively create long-term shareholder value\n- -  protect and promote the interests of BHP and the creation of social value\n- -  ensure the talent, capability and culture of BHP to support the long-term delivery of our strategy\n\n## Attributes and commitment to role\n\nAll Directors are expected to comply with Our Code of Conduct , act with integrity, lead by example and promote the desired culture.\n\nThe Board believes each Non-executive Director has demonstrated the attributes of sufficient time to undertake the responsibilities of the role, honesty and integrity, and a preparedness to question, challenge and critique throughout the year through their participation in Board meetings, and the other activities that they have undertaken in their roles.\n\n## Skills matrix\n\nThe Board, supported by the Nomination and Governance Committee, reviews the skills and diversity represented by the Directors on the Board and determines whether the composition and mix of those skills remains appropriate to achieve BHP's purpose and strategy.\n\nThe Board maintains a skills matrix which identifies the skills and experience the Board needs for the next period of BHP's development, considering BHP's circumstances and the changing external environment.\n\nThe Board has redesigned its Board skills matrix to identify the future facing skills that the Board intends to build, acquire and retain over the medium term in anticipation of its needs as it pursues its strategy of\n\nsecuring growth options in future facing commodities. The new Board skills matrix not only indicates the skills that the Board currently possesses, but also provides an illustration of the new skills that the Board intends to acquire, and indicates the preferred manner in which it intends to acquire them.\n\nThe Board collectively possesses all the skills and experience set out in the skills matrix, and each Director satisfies the Board requirements and attributes discussed above.\n\n| Skills and attributes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Number of  Directors   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Mining                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 4                      |\n| Senior executive who has deep operating or technical mining experience with a large company operating  in multiple countries; successfully optimised and led a suite of large, global, complex operating assets that  have delivered consistent and sustaining levels of high performance (related to cost, returns and throughput);  successfully led exploration projects with proven results and performance; delivered large capital projects that  have been successful in terms of performance and returns; and a proven record in terms of health, safety  and environmental performance and results.

The Board conducts regular evaluations of its performance, the performance of its Committees, the Group Chair, Directors and the governance processes that support the Board's work.\n\nThe evaluation considers the balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of the Group and the Board, its diversity, including gender diversity, and how the Board works together as a unit.\n\nInternal evaluations of the Board, its Committees and Directors were conducted in FY2022. An external board review is conducted approximately every three years and was not conducted in FY2022 and is scheduled for CY2023.\n\n## Review of individual Director performance\n\nIn FY2022, an assessment was conducted of each Director's performance with the assistance of external service provider, Lintstock. Lintstock does not have any other connection with the Group or individual Directors.\n\nThe assessment of Directors focused on the contribution of each Director to the work of the Board and its Committees, and the expectations of Directors as set out in BHP's governance framework. In addition, the assessment focused on how each Director contributes to Board cohesion and effective relationships with fellow Directors, commits the time required to fulfil their role and effectively performs their responsibilities. Directors were asked to comment on areas where their fellow Directors contribute the greatest value and on potential areas for development.\n\nLintstock provided feedback received to the Chair, which was then discussed with Directors. Feedback relating to the Chair was discussed with the Chair by the Senior Independent Director. As a result of these outcomes, the review supported the Board's decision to endorse those Directors standing for re-election.\n\n## Committee assessments\n\nFollowing an assessment of its work, each Committee concluded that it had met the requirements under its Terms of Reference in FY2022.",

        "page_content": "## 6.2  Senior management succession\n\nA senior management succession process is conducted to support pipeline stability for critical roles. A talent deep dive is conducted by the Board at least once a year to evaluate these pipelines, including the diversity of the pipeline.\n\nSenior management succession is viewed from a five-year perspective that considers the readiness of successors across time horizons, contexts and future capability demands. Select Board members are involved in the interview process for executive-level appointments one level below the CEO and occasionally for roles two levels below the CEO. Appropriate checks are undertaken before appointing a member of the ELT. BHP has a written agreement with each ELT member setting out the terms of their appointment.\n\nIn May 2022, the Board approved the appointment of Jad Vodopija as the Chief People Officer, effective 1 July 2022 and replacing Athalie Williams.\n\n## 6.3  Performance evaluation of executives\n\nThe performance of executives and other senior employees is reviewed on an annual basis. The annual performance review process considers the performance of executives against criteria designed to capture 'what' is achieved and 'how' it is achieved. All performance assessments of executives include how effective they have been in undertaking their role and what they have achieved against their specified key performance indicators.\n\nA performance evaluation was conducted for all members of the ELT during FY2022. For the CEO, the performance evaluation was led by the Chair of the Board on behalf of all the Nonexecutive Directors and was discussed with the Remuneration Committee.\n\n## 7.  Risk management and assurance\n\n## 7.1  Risk management governance structure\n\n## Risk governance\n\nThe RAC assists the Board with the oversight of risk management and the Board retains accountability for BHP's risk profile. The Board requires the CEO to implement a system of control for identifying and managing risk. The Risk team is accountable for this system, known as BHP's Risk Framework, and also supports, challenges and verifies risk management activities to give assurance to management and the Board. The Directors, through the RAC, monitor our Risk Framework and review it at least annually to satisfy themselves that the Risk Framework continues to be sound and that BHP is operating with regard to the risk appetite set by the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information refer to OFR 9\n\n## Internal Audit\n\nThe Internal Audit team provides assurance to the Board, CEO and Executive Leadership Team on whether risk management, internal control and governance processes are adequate and functioning. The Internal Audit team is independent of the External Auditor. The RAC evaluates and, if thought fit, approves the Terms of Reference of the Internal Audit team and the annual internal audit plan and monitors the effectiveness of the internal audit activities.\n\nAs of 1 August 2022, the Risk team and Internal Audit team were combined to form a Risk and Internal Audit sub-function, led by a Chief Risk and Audit Officer. The Risk team and Internal Audit team will continue to operate in the second and third lines respectively. Refer to OFR 9 for more information.\n\nThe RAC approves the appointment and dismissal of the Chief Audit Officer and assesses their performance, independence and objectivity. During FY2022, the Group Audit Officer reported directly to the RAC and functional oversight of the Internal Audit team was provided by the Chief Legal, Governance and External Affairs Officer. As of 1 August 2022, functional oversight of the Risk and Internal Audit sub-function is provided by the Chief Financial Officer.\n\n## Effectiveness of systems of internal control and risk management\n\nIn delegating authority to the CEO, the Board has established CEO limits, outlined in the Board Governance Document and these require the CEO to ensure there is a system of control in place for identifying and managing risk in BHP. Through the RAC, the Directors regularly review these systems for their effectiveness. These reviews include assessing whether processes continue to meet evolving external governance requirements.\n\nThe RAC oversees and reviews the internal controls and risk management systems (including procedures, processes and systems for, among other things, budgeting and forecasting, provisions, financial controls, financial reporting and reporting of reserves and resources, compliance, preventing fraud and serious breaches of business conduct, speak-up procedures and protecting information and data systems). Any material breaches of Our Code of Conduct, including breaches of our antibribery and corruption requirements and any material incidents reported under our speak-up procedures are reported quarterly to the RAC by the Chief Compliance Officer. These reports are then communicated to the Board through the report-out process.\n\nDuring FY2022, management presented an assessment of the material risks facing BHP and the effectiveness of the Group's systems of risk management. The reviews were overseen by the RAC, with findings and recommendations reported to the Board. In addition to considering key risks facing BHP, the Board assessed the effectiveness of internal controls over key risks identified through the work of the Board Committees.\n\nHaving carried out a review during FY2022, the Board is satisfied with the effectiveness of BHP's risk management and internal control systems.\n\n## Environmental and social risks\n\nBHP's risk factors (including material exposure to environmental and social risks) and how we manage these risks are described in OFR 9 and 9.1.\n\n## 7.2  External audit and financial reporting\n\n## Integrity of Financial Statements\n\nThe RAC assists the Board in assuring the integrity of the Financial Statements. The RAC evaluates and makes recommendations to the Board about the appropriateness of accounting policies and practices, areas of judgement, compliance with accounting standards, stock exchange and legal requirements and the results of the external audit.\n\n## CEO and CFO assurance\n\nFor the FY2022 full year and half year, the CEO and CFO have certified that in their opinion, BHP's financial records have been properly maintained and the FY2022 Financial Statements present a true and fair view of our financial condition and operating results and are in accordance with accounting standards and applicable regulatory requirements.\n\nThe CEO and CFO have also certified to the Board that this opinion was formed on the basis of a sound system of risk management and internal control and the system is operating efficiently and effectively. The RAC considered these certifications when recommending the Financial Statements to the Board for approval.\n\n## External Auditor\n\nThe RAC manages the relationship with the External Auditor on behalf of the Board. It considers the independence and reappointment of the External Auditor each year, as well as remuneration and other terms of engagement and makes a recommendation to the Board.\n\n## Evaluation of External Auditor and external audit process\n\nThe RAC evaluates the objectivity and independence of the External Auditor and the quality and effectiveness of the external audit arrangements, including through:\n\n- -  reviewing the terms of engagement of the External Auditor\n- -  considering the external audit plan, in particular to gain assurance that it is tailored to reflect changes in circumstances from the prior year\n- -  meeting with the audit partners, particularly the lead audit engagement partners, throughout the year and without management present\n- -  discussing with the audit engagement partners the skills and experience of the broader audit team\n- -  considering the quality of the External Auditor's performance following the completion of the audit",

        "page_content": "## Corporate Governance Statement continued\n\nIn addition, the RAC reviews the integrity, independence and objectivity of the External Auditor and assesses whether there is any element of the relationship that impairs or appears to impair the External Auditor's judgement or independence. The External Auditor also certifies its independence to the RAC.\n\n## Non-audit services\n\nAlthough the External Auditor provides some non-audit services to the Group, the objectivity and independence of the External Auditor are safeguarded through restrictions on the provision of these services with some services prohibited from being undertaken.\n\n## Pre-approved services\n\nThe RAC has adopted a policy entitled Provision of Audit and Other Services by the External Auditor covering the RAC's pre-approval policies and procedures to maintain the independence of the External Auditor.\n\nThe categories of 'pre-approved' services are:\n\n- -  Audit services - work that constitutes the agreed scope of the statutory audit and includes the statutory audits of BHP and its entities (including interim reviews). The RAC monitors the audit services engagements and if necessary, approves any changes in terms and conditions resulting from changes in audit scope, Group structure or other relevant events.\n- -  Audit-related and other assurance services work that is outside the scope of the statutory audit but is consistent with the role of the external statutory auditor. This category includes work that is reasonably related to the performance of an audit or review and is a logical extension of the audit or review scope, is of an assurance or compliance nature and is work that the external auditors must or are best placed to undertake and is permissible under the relevant applicable standard.\n\nActivities outside the scope of the above categories are not 'pre-approved' and must be approved by the RAC prior to engagement, regardless of the dollar value involved. In addition, any engagement for other services with a value over US$250,000, even if listed as a 'pre-approved' service, requires the approval of the RAC.\n\nAll engagements for non-audit services, whether 'pre-approved' or not and regardless of the dollar value involved, are reported quarterly to the RAC. While not prohibited by BHP's policy, any proposed engagement of the External Auditor that contains an internal control element requires specific prior approval from the RAC. In addition, while the categories of 'pre-approved' services include a list of certain pre-approved services, the use of the External Auditor to perform these services will always be subject to our overriding governance practices as articulated in the policy.\n\nIn addition, the RAC did not approve any services during the year ended 30 June 2022 pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of SEC Regulation S-X (provision of services other than audit).\n\nFees paid to BHP's External Auditor during FY2022 for audit and other services were US$20.3 million, of which 51 per cent comprised audit fees (including in relation to SOX matters), 10 per cent for audit-related fees and 39 per cent for all other fees. No fees were paid in relation to tax services. Details of the fees paid are set out in Financial Statements note 34 'Auditor's remuneration'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur policy on Provision of Audit and Other Services by the External Auditor is available at bhp.com/governance.\n\n## Management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting\n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act).\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and, even when determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, the effectiveness of BHP's internal control over financial reporting was evaluated based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Controls - Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of the Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as at 30 June 2022. There were no material weaknesses in BHP's internal controls over financial reporting identified by management as at 30 June 2022.\n\nBHP has engaged our independent registered public accounting firm, EY, to issue an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting for inclusion in the Financial Statements of the Annual Report and the Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during FY2022 that materially affected or were reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nDuring FY2022, the RAC reviewed our compliance with the obligations imposed by SOX, including evaluating and documenting internal controls as required by section 404 of SOX.\n\n## Management's assessment of disclosure controls and procedures\n\nManagement, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as at 30 June 2022. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the material financial and nonfinancial information required to be disclosed by BHP, including in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarised and reported on a timely basis. This information is accumulated and communicated to BHP's management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation, management (including the CEO and CFO) concluded that, as at 30 June 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in providing that reasonable assurance.\n\nThere are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.\n\nIn the design and evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, management was required to apply its judgement in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\n\n## 8. Culture and conduct\n\nSuccessful delivery of our strategy relies on workforce capability and a strong culture, and the Board, together with management plays a critical role in setting the culture of the Group. Supporting our people's wellbeing, creating and promoting an inclusive and diverse environment for our people to work, and keeping them safe in the workplace are critically important and core to our values.\n\n## 8.1 Our Code of Conduct and Our Charter\n\nOur Code of Conduct ( Our Code ) is approved by the Board and is based on Our Charter values. Our Code includes our policies on speaking up and anti-bribery and corruption, sets out standards of behaviour for our people and is an important statement of the culture at BHP.\n\nDuring FY2022, we began work to refresh Our Code to align it with global best practice and to provide an effective basis for standard setting and enforcement. We expect to launch the refreshed version of Our Code in FY2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur Code and Our Charter are accessible at bhp.com.",

        "page_content": "## 8.2 Culture\n\nThe Board, supported by the Committees, considers a range of qualitative and quantitative information in relation to culture at BHP and monitors and assesses culture on an ongoing basis for alignment with our strategy, purpose and values. Board and Committee papers include workforce planning in the context of COVID-19, Employee Perception Survey results, updates on sexual harassment controls, inclusion and diversity updates, RAC report-outs on Our Code investigations, the culture and capability required to execute our strategy, and culture as a part of asset reviews. Recognising our culture cannot be measured using a single number or index, a culture dashboard is used to provide the Board with a tool to monitor our culture. The dashboard includes simple measures to provide key signposts on the health of our culture. This data, combined with the Employee Perception Survey results, provides the Board with insight on safety, engagement and enablement.\n\nDirectors also gain insights into culture through direct engagement with a cross-section of the workforce where they can gain direct feedback on a range of issues, including sexual harassment, ongoing COVID-19 impacts, diversity, HSEC topics and social value.\n\n## 8.3 BHP's EthicsPoint\n\nWe have mechanisms in place for anyone to raise a query about Our Code or make a report if they feel Our Code has been breached.\n\nEthicsPoint is our 24-hour confidential reporting tool for reporting misconduct and can be used by employees, contractors and external stakeholders, including members of the public to raise concerns about misconduct that has either happened to them or they have witnessed.\n\nAll reports received in EthicsPoint are reviewed and categorised by the Ethics team. Once categorised, reports are assigned in accordance with internal policy and processes to an investigator, line leader or appropriate team for resolution.\n\nAll significant Our Code matters and key trends from investigations are reported to the RAC. These are then reported to the Board as part of its report-out process.\n\n## 8.4 Diversity\n\nThe Board and management believe diversity is required to meet our purpose and strategy. Diversity is key to supporting the Board and its Committees to have the right blend of perspectives so that the Board oversees BHP effectively for shareholders.\n\nWe have adopted an Inclusion and Diversity Position Statement, which sets out our diversity policy in relation to the Board, senior management and our workforce, and our priorities to accelerate the development of a more inclusive work environment and enhanced overall workplace diversity. BHP's Inclusion and Diversity Position Statement is available at bhp.com/careers/inclusion-diversity and is summarised in OFR 6. As described in our Inclusion and Diversity Position Statement, our\n\naspiration is to achieve gender balance (which we define as a minimum 40 per cent women and 40 per cent men, in line with the definition used by entities such as the International Labour Organization) on our Board, among our senior executives and across our workforce by FY2025.\n\nCurrently 33 per cent of Directors are female and we therefore satisfy the guidance of having at least 30 per cent of Directors of each gender in accordance with the ASX Fourth Edition. When Mr Broomhead and Mr Mogford retire from the Board at the conclusion of the 2022 AGM, 40 per cent of Directors will be female. We also continue to seek additional ethnic diversity on our Board and throughout BHP.\n\nPart of the Board's role continues to be to consider and approve BHP's measurable objectives for diversity on its Board, among its senior executives and general workforce each financial year and to oversee our progress in achieving those objectives. For more information, including our progress against our FY2022 measurable objectives and our employee profile more generally, refer to OFR 6.\n\nThe diagram below illustrates the diversity that is currently represented on the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 9.  Shareholder and stakeholder engagement\n\n## Shareholder engagement\n\nPart of the Board's commitment to high-quality governance is expressed through the approach BHP takes to engaging and communicating with our shareholders. As part of our investor relations program to facilitate effective two-way communication with investors, the Board uses formal and informal communication channels to understand and take into account the views of shareholders. BHP provides information about itself and its governance to investors via its website at bhp.com.\n\nWe encourage shareholders to make their views known to us.

For example, site visits (physical and virtual where necessary) involving engagement with the workforce, community members and government, Employee Perception Survey findings, gender pay gap reports, updates from the CEO and Chief People Officer and engagement with the Forum on Corporate Responsibility. In addition, the RAC and Sustainability Committee receive reports on engagement with regulators. They also receive reports on material litigation and disputes with third parties and complaints raised through the speak-up hotline, EthicsPoint, which allows our workforce to raise concerns in confidence.\n\nThe strategic framework, focus on social value, our purpose and Risk Appetite Statement reflect the significance of external stakeholders in decision making.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 10.  Market disclosure\n\nWe have disclosure controls in place for periodic disclosures, including the Operational Review, our results announcements, debt investor documents (such as the prospectus for the Euro or Australian Medium Term Notes) and Annual Report documents, which must comply with relevant regulatory requirements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information about these verification processes can be found in the Periodic Disclosure - Disclosure Controls document available at bhp.com/governance.\n\nTo safeguard the effective dissemination of information, we have developed mandatory minimum performance requirements for market disclosure, which outline how we identify and distribute information to shareholders and market participants and sets out the role of the Disclosure Committee in managing compliance with market disclosure obligations. In addition, where an announcement is determined to be material by the Disclosure Committee, the Board receives a copy promptly after it has been made. Where BHP gives a new and substantive investor or analyst presentation, it releases a copy of the presentation materials on the ASX Market Announcements Platform ahead of the presentation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA copy of the Market Disclosure and Communications Policy is available at bhp.com/governance.\n\nCopies of announcements to the stock exchanges on which BHP is listed, investor briefings, Financial Statements, the Annual Report and other relevant information can be found at bhp.com.

It is classified as a foreign private issuer and has American Depositary Shares listed on the NYSE.\n\nWe have reviewed the governance requirements applicable to foreign private issuers under SOX, including the rules promulgated by the SEC and the rules of the NYSE, and are satisfied that we comply with those requirements.\n\nUnder NYSE rules, foreign private issuers such as BHP are required to disclose any significant ways our corporate governance practices differ from those followed by US companies under the NYSE corporate governance standards. After a comparison of our corporate governance practices with the requirements of Section 303A of the NYSE-Listed Company Manual followed by US companies, a significant difference was identified:\n\n- -  Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act requires NYSE-listed companies to ensure their audit committees are directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of the External Auditor unless the company's governing law or documents or other home country legal requirements require or permit shareholders to ultimately vote on or approve these matters. Prior to unification, the ultimate responsibility for the appointment and retention of the External Auditor rested with our shareholders in accordance with UK law (and our constitutional documents reflected this legal requirement). The RAC was then directly responsible for the compensation and oversight of the work of the External Auditor throughout the year. Following the unification of our corporate structure, BHP is no longer subject to the UK requirement to re-appoint the External Auditor by shareholder vote annually and our constitution has been amended to remove this requirement. From January 2022 our shareholders remain ultimately responsible for the appointment and retention of the External Auditor and are required to vote on the appointment of the External Auditor from time to time (as required under Australian law), and the RAC remains directly responsible for the compensation and oversight of the work of the External Auditor.",

The Operating and Financial Review (OFR), the Remuneration Report, and the 'Lead Auditor's Independence Declaration' are incorporated by reference into, and form part of, this Directors' Report.\n\n## 1.  Review of operations, principal activities and state of affairs\n\nA review of the operations of BHP during FY2022, the results of those operations during FY2022 and the expected results of those operations in future financial years are set out in the OFR. Information on the development of BHP and likely developments in future years also appears in this section. We have excluded certain information from the OFR, to the extent permitted by Australian law, on the basis that such information relates to impending developments or matters in the course of negotiation and disclosure would be seriously prejudicial to the interests of BHP. This is because such disclosure could be misleading due to the fact it is premature or preliminary in nature, relates to commercially sensitive contracts, would undermine confidentiality between BHP and our suppliers and clients, or would otherwise unreasonably damage BHP. The categories of information omitted include forward-looking estimates and projections prepared for internal management purposes, information regarding BHP's assets and projects, which is developing and susceptible to change, and information relating to commercial contracts and pricing modules.\n\nOur principal activities, including significant changes in the nature of BHP's principal activities during FY2022, are disclosed in the OFR.\n\nThere were no significant changes in BHP's state of affairs that occurred during FY2022 and no significant post balance date events other than as disclosed in the OFR and Financial Statements note 33 'Subsequent events'.\n\nNo other matter or circumstance has arisen since the end of FY2022 that has significantly affected or is expected to significantly affect the operations, the results of operations or state of affairs of BHP in future years.\n\nOperating and Financial Review\n\n## 2.

Indemnities and insurance\n\nRule 146 of the BHP Group Limited Constitution requires the company to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each Officer of BHP Group Limited against liability incurred in, or arising out of, the conduct of the business of BHP or the discharge of the duties of the Officer. The Directors named in 2.1 of the Directors' Report, the Company Secretaries and other Officers of BHP Group Limited have the benefit of this requirement, as do individuals who formerly held one of those positions.\n\nIn accordance with this requirement, BHP Group Limited has entered into Deeds of Indemnity, Access and Insurance (Deeds of Indemnity) with its Directors.\n\nWe have a policy that BHP will, as a general rule, support and hold harmless an employee, including an employee appointed as a Director of a subsidiary who, while acting in good faith, incurs personal liability to others as a result of working for BHP.\n\nIn addition, as part of the arrangements to effect the demerger of South32, we agreed to indemnify certain former Officers of BHP who transitioned to South32 from certain claims and liabilities incurred in their capacity as Directors or Officers of South32.\n\nThe terms of engagement for certain services include that we must compensate and reimburse EY for, and protect EY against, any loss, damage, expense, or liability incurred by EY\n\nin respect of third-party claims arising from a breach by BHP of any obligation under the engagement terms.\n\nWe have insured against amounts that we may be liable to pay to Directors, Company Secretaries or certain employees (including former Officers) pursuant to Rule 146 of the Constitution of BHP Group Limited or that we otherwise agree to pay by way of indemnity. The insurance policy also insures Directors, Company Secretaries and some employees (including former Officers) against certain liabilities (including legal costs) they may incur in carrying out their duties. For this Directors' and Officers' insurance, we paid premiums of US$21,772,900 excluding taxes during FY2022.\n\nNo indemnity in favour of a current or former officer of BHP Group Limited, or in favour of the External Auditor, was called on during FY2022.\n\n## 7.

Auditors\n\nA copy of the declaration given by our External Auditor to the Directors in relation to the auditors' compliance with the independence requirements of the Australian Corporations Act 2001 and the Professional Code of Conduct for External Auditors is set out in Financial Statements 3.\n\nNo current officer of BHP has held the role of director or partner of the Group's current external auditor.\n\n## 9.  Non-audit services\n\nFor information on the non-audit services undertaken by BHP's External Auditor, including the amounts paid for non-audit services, refer to Financial Statements note 34 'Auditor's remuneration'. All non-audit services were approved in accordance with the process set out in the Policy on Provision of Audit and Other Services by the External Auditor. No non-audit services were carried out that were specifically excluded by the Policy on Provision of Audit and Other Services by the External Auditor. Based on advice provided by the Risk and Audit Committee, the Directors have formed the view that the provision of non-audit services is compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors, and that the nature of non-audit services means that auditor independence was not compromised.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report\n\n## Remuneration Committee Chair Letter to Shareholders\n\n## Christine O'Reilly\n\nChair, Remuneration Committee\n\n## Dear Shareholders,\n\nI am pleased to introduce BHP's Remuneration Report for the financial year to 30 June 2022. During FY2022, the Remuneration Committee ( Committee ) continued its focus on achieving remuneration outcomes that fairly reflect the performance of BHP and the contribution of our employees, and which are aligned to the interests of shareholders and other key stakeholders.\n\n## Our approach and framework\n\nOur Charter sets out our values upon which the Committee places great weight in the determination of performance-based remuneration outcomes for BHP executives. Our Charter places health and safety at the forefront of our values while setting out our purpose, our strategy and how we measure success. The Committee aims to support our executives to take a long-term approach to decision-making in order to build a sustainable and value-adding business.\n\nThe Committee is focused on a remuneration framework and approach that supports the Group's strategy and enables us to attract, retain and motivate our executives located in different geographies. This is critical to delivering the best outcomes for all BHP stakeholders. As BHP is a global organisation, the Committee is also mindful of navigating the priorities and expectations of multiple jurisdictions.\n\nAt the 2021 AGMs, we received strong support for our remuneration framework and outcomes, with over 97 per cent voting in favour of the Remuneration Report. This means that over the past five years we have received an average of approximately 96 per cent support. The Committee and the Board continue to incorporate shareholder feedback into their approach to remuneration.\n\nFY2022 represents the third year of operation of our revised remuneration framework and we believe the framework is continuing to serve stakeholders well. The key changes to variable remuneration that took effect from 1 July 2019 for the CEO were to significantly reduce the LTIP grant size from 400 per cent of base salary (on a face value basis) to 200 per cent, and a rebalancing to a CDP award with a long-term focus. The CDP outcome is delivered one-third as a cash award, with two-thirds delivered in equity that is deferred equally for two-year and five-year periods. This structure aligns participants' incentive remuneration with performance over the short, medium and long term.\n\nWe continue to benchmark the CEO and other executives' remuneration against CEO and executive roles in other global companies of similar complexity, size, reach and industry. This detailed benchmarking ensures BHP's executive remuneration framework remains\n\ncompetitive to attract, motivate and retain key talented executives and is consistent with the global market.\n\nThe majority of the CEO's remuneration package continues to be delivered in BHP equity, not in cash, and the CEO's remuneration is deliberately tied to the performance of the business. In addition, the CEO is required to meet a MSR of five times pre-tax base salary and this applies for two years post-retirement. This ensures that the CEO's remuneration is aligned to the experience of BHP's shareholders. As at the date of this Report, the CEO's BHP shareholding is in excess of his MSR.\n\n## Business performance\n\nI am pleased to say BHP's performance for FY2022 has been underpinned by safe, reliable operations and firm demand for our commodities. We completed another year fatality free and we are unwavering in our effort to improve safety, including the elimination of sexual harassment, racism and bullying.\n\nWe delivered reliable operational performance at Western Australia Iron Ore, with record sales for a third consecutive year and the South Flank project ramp up ahead of schedule. In copper, Escondida in Chile achieved record material mined and near-record concentrator throughput, while Olympic Dam in South Australia performed strongly in the fourth quarter after planned smelter maintenance. Queensland metallurgical coal ended the year with strong underlying performance in the face of significant wet weather.\n\nWe have made strong progress on actions required to meet our commitments to reduce operational GHG emissions, which are down by 15 per cent since FY2017. We have further progressed our emission reduction partnerships with three major steelmakers in China and Japan and we also entered a new partnership with a fourth steelmaker in South Korea. The combined output of these four steelmakers equates to around 12 per cent of global steel production.\n\nOur US$5.7 billion Jansen potash project in Canada is tracking to plan and opportunities to bring forward first potash production at Jansen continue to be assessed. In addition, during FY2022, we merged our Petroleum business with Woodside, completed the sales of our interests in BMC and Cerrej\u00f3n, and following a strategic review decided to retain New South Wales Energy Coal. As a consequence, we will seek approvals to continue mining until 2030. We also unified our corporate structure, and added to our global options in copper and nickel.\n\nCOVID-19 continued to impact in FY2022, particularly in the areas of labour and supply chain constraints. We remain vigilant with continued social distancing and hygiene practices, and other additional protocols as appropriate to protect our workforce and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncommunities. Despite the challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to present, in FY2022 BHP continued its approach to not furlough any employees, did not seek any government assistance, and did not raise additional equity. In addition, BHP's safe and reliable operational performance through this year, together with strong profitability, enabled the Board to announce record dividends for FY2022. This continues the delivery of strong and consistent returns to shareholders.\n\n## FY2022 CDP\n\nThe CDP scorecard used to assess Mike Henry's annual performance comprises stretching performance measures, including HSEC, financial and individual performance elements. For FY2022, the Committee has assessed the CEO's performance and determined a CDP outcome of 96 per cent against a target of 100 per cent (and 64 per cent of the maximum).\n\nFor the HSEC element, the outcome took into account BHP's strong HSEC performance during the year, with no fatalities recorded, the strong progress against our Fatality Elimination Program and delivery of our cultural heritage commitments. This year we have also made progress on the implementation of controls for sexual harassment, although there remains more to be done. We also saw strong progress against our climate change targets, and our progress in the management of priority tailings storage facilities was pleasing. The CDP outcome for the HSEC measures was 31 per cent out of a target of 25 per cent.\n\nOur financial performance was strong, and during FY2022 shareholders have again benefitted through record dividends. However, after fully eliminating the positive impacts of commodity prices during the year, operating performance at our assets was below the challenging internal targets set at the commencement of the year. This is in part due to higher than expected unplanned costs and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which flowed through into CDP outcomes without moderation for FY2022. This is a similar approach that was applied in FY2021 and FY2020 and has the effect of reducing the remuneration outcomes for executives. The CDP outcomes for the financial measure was 40 per cent out of a target of 50 per cent.\n\nFinally, from a personal performance perspective, the Committee considered Mike Henry's performance against his individual measures. These included projects and initiatives in respect of social value (long term growth in value and returns for all stakeholders), people (right people, right skills, coming together in the right way to support exceptional performance), performance (material improvement in the system that supports exceptional performance) and portfolio (material",

The Committee considered Mike's performance against his individual objectives met expectations and warranted an outcome aligned with the target of 25 per cent.\n\nThe CDP scorecard outcomes for other Executive KMP and the short-term incentive pool applicable to the majority of BHP employees below the ELT level, were, like the CEO, slightly below the 100 per cent target.\n\n## 2017 LTIP award\n\nThe vesting outcome for the 2017 LTIP award was 100 per cent. The LTIP performance condition is relative TSR and BHP outperformed both the sector peer group and the MSCI World Index. This level of vesting is aligned with the projected vesting outcome that was communicated to shareholders in the Remuneration Report at the time the changes to our remuneration framework were approved by shareholders at the 2019 AGMs.\n\nThe table below outlines the level of vesting each year from 2009 to 2022, together with the vesting outcomes projected in 2019.\n\n## LTIP vesting\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nActual vesting           Discretion used           Projected vesting\n\n## FY2023 remuneration\n\nFor FY2023, the Committee determined that the CEO's base salary would increase by 3 per cent, effective 1 September 2022. This was assessed as appropriate having conducted updated benchmarking and considered the\n\n## Fixed remuneration\n\n## CDP\n\n## LTIP\n\n- -  Base salary US$1.750 million per annum, an increase of 3% from 1 September 2022.\n- -  Pension contribution 10% of base salary.\n\n- -  Target cash award of 80% of base salary (maximum 120%).\n- -  Plus two awards of deferred shares each of equivalent value to the cash award, vesting in two and five years, respectively.\n- -  Three performance categories:\n- -  HSEC - 25%\n- -  Financial - 50%\n- -  Individual - 25%\n- -  The LTIP grant is based on a face value of 200% of base salary.\n- -  Our LTIP awards have rigorous relative TSR performance hurdles measured over five years.\n\nexternal market demand for senior executive talent. The Committee considers the increase modest in this context, as well as being below the median salary increase applied for other BHP employees of approximately 4 per cent. Other components of the CEO's total target\n\nremuneration (pension contributions, benefits, CDP and LTIP) remain unchanged and, where relevant, as percentages of base salary. A summary of the CEO's arrangements for FY2023 is set out below.\n\nAs shareholders will recall, one of the key elements of our revised remuneration framework was to reduce the weighting of future LTIP grants in the overall CEO remuneration package from FY2020. Pre-existing grants remained on foot and their vesting would be determined on the basis of existing service and performance conditions.\n\nThe value of the vested 2017 LTIP award is higher than the value of the award at the time it was granted due to the increase in share price during the five-year vesting period and strong dividends. In terms of value realised, 44 per cent is due to the value at the time the awards were granted and 56 per cent is due to share price appreciation and dividends. This reflects the experience of shareholders over the period.\n\nConsistent with its normal practice, in considering vesting, the Board and Committee have also conducted a holistic review of business performance over the five years since the award was granted to ensure this level of vesting was appropriate.\n\nMore information on the 2017 LTIP vesting outcome, including the five-year holistic business review covering HSEC performance, profitability, cash flow, balance sheet health, returns to shareholders, corporate governance and conduct, is included in 3.3 LTIP performance outcomes and 3.4 Overarching discretion and vesting underpin.\n\nMore information on the overall remuneration outcomes for the CEO for the year, and how the outcomes are aligned to performance during FY2022, is provided in 3.1 FY2022 Remuneration received by the CEO. Having considered the overall remuneration outcomes for the CEO carefully, as set out above and in 3.1, the Committee concluded it was a fair reflection of performance and the experience of shareholders, and the application of any downwards discretion was not warranted.",

        "page_content": "The Committee has also reviewed the base salaries and total target remuneration packages for other Executive KMP. The Committee determined they would also increase by 3 per cent, effective 1 September 2022. An additional increase has been determined for Ragnar Udd reflecting his performance and development in role (for more information regarding base salaries for FY2023 refer to 3.7 FY2023 remuneration for the CEO and other Executive KMP). Other aspects of other Executive KMP remuneration arrangements remain unchanged.\n\n## Remuneration outcomes for the Chair and Non-executive Directors\n\nFees for the Chair and Non-executive Directors are reviewed annually and are benchmarked against peer companies. No changes to the Chair's fee will be made for FY2023. The Chair fee has remained unchanged since 1 July 2017. In 2017, a decision was made to reduce the Chair's annual fee by approximately 8 per cent from US$0.960 million to US$0.880 million with effect from 1 July 2017. This followed an earlier reduction on 1 July 2015 of approximately 13 per cent from US$1.100 million to US$0.960 million.\n\nBase fee levels for Non-executive Directors will also remain unchanged. The fees of Non-executive Directors were also reduced on 1 July 2015 by approximately 6 per cent, from US$0.170 million to US$0.160 million per annum.\n\nIn FY2022, BHP undertook a series of major transactions. As a consequence, modest fees were paid to certain Non-executive Directors for additional or extra services performed in FY2022 in connection with major transactions undertaken by the Group.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis year the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact not only BHP, but our customers, suppliers, governments, employees, families and communities across the world. On behalf of the Committee, I would like to recognise the continued hard work, dedication and sacrifices of our employees. Through their steadfast commitment, they have enabled BHP to generate strong results for all stakeholders and continued to support their communities.\n\n## 1  Remuneration governance\n\n## Board oversight\n\nThe Board is responsible for ensuring the Group's remuneration arrangements are equitable and aligned with the long-term interests of BHP and its shareholders. In performing this function, it is critical the Board is independent of management when making decisions affecting remuneration of the CEO, other Executive KMP and the Group's employees.\n\nThe Board has established the Committee to assist it in making such decisions. The Committee is comprised solely of Non-executive Directors, all of whom are independent. The Committee has extensive access to members of senior management and regularly invites them to attend meetings to provide reports and updates. However, members of management are not present when decisions are considered or taken concerning their own remuneration. The Committee can also draw on services from a range of external sources, including independent remuneration advisers.\n\n## Remuneration Committee\n\nThe activities of the Committee are governed by its Terms of Reference which is available at bhp.com. The current members of the Committee are: Christine O'Reilly (Chair), Catherine Tanna (member from 4 April 2022) and Dion Weisler. The following present and former Non-executive Directors served as members of the Committee during the year: Gary Goldberg (member to 17 June 2022), Anita Frew (member to 11 November 2021) and Susan Kilsby (member to 11 November 2021). The role and focus of the Committee and details of meeting attendances can be found in 2.2 Directors' Report.\n\nKey decisions and activities of the Committee during FY2022 included:\n\n- -  considering and approving remuneration for members of the ELT\n- -  setting targets for and reviewing outcomes against performance measures and conditions of relevant incentive plans, including the Committee considering its discretion over FY2022 plan outcomes\n- -  reviewing the fee for the BHP Chair, which remains unchanged\n- -  considering remuneration and remuneration reporting implications of unification and the merger of the Petroleum business and Woodside\n- -  reviewing and adopting changes and improvements flowing from regulatory requirements and guidance, which in turn helps us improve our processes and approaches\n- -  engaging with shareholders and other key stakeholders\n- -  undertaking reviews of remuneration by gender and the annual Shareplus enrolment\n\nWe deliberately align our executive remuneration with performance, with a significant component of possible remuneration structured as variable pay. We are confident that the outcomes this year are consistent with our long held approach of remuneration outcomes reflecting the performance of BHP and the experience of our shareholders. Given our critical need to attract, motivate and retain our executives in order to progress our strategic objectives and deliver the best outcomes for all BHP stakeholders, this is a pleasing result for all concerned.\n\nWe look forward to ongoing dialogue with and the support of BHP's shareholders. As always, we welcome your feedback and comments on any aspect of this Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChristine O'Reilly\n\nChair, Remuneration Committee\n\n16 August 2022",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report continued\n\n## Engagement of independent remuneration advisers\n\nThe Committee seeks and considers advice from independent remuneration advisers where appropriate. Remuneration consultants are engaged by and report directly to the Committee. Potential conflicts of interest are taken into account when remuneration consultants are selected and their terms of engagement regulate their level of access to, and require their independence from, BHP's management.\n\nPwC has been appointed to act as an independent remuneration adviser and is currently the only remuneration adviser appointed by the Committee. In that capacity, they may provide remuneration recommendations in relation to KMP, however, they did not provide any remuneration recommendations in FY2022.\n\n## KMP for FY2022\n\nThis Remuneration Report describes the remuneration policies, practices, outcomes and governance for the KMP of BHP. At BHP, KMP consists of our Board (including the CEO), as well as certain members of our ELT who have authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group directly or indirectly. After due consideration, the Committee determined the KMP for FY2022 comprised all Non-executive Directors and the following Executive KMP: the CEO, the Chief Financial Officer, the President Minerals Australia, the President Minerals Americas and the Senior Executive Officer (i.e. the President Petroleum until 31 May 2022).\n\nThe following individuals have held their positions and were KMP for the whole of FY2022, unless stated otherwise:\n\n- -  Mike Henry, CEO and Executive Director\n- -  Edgar Basto, President Minerals Australia\n- -  David Lamont, Chief Financial Officer\n- -  Geraldine Slattery, President Petroleum from 1 July 2021 to 31 May 2022 and Senior Executive Officer from 1 June to 30 June 2022\n- -  Ragnar Udd, President Minerals Americas\n- -  Non-executive Directors - for details of Non-executive Directors, including dates of appointment or cessation (where relevant), refer to 2.2 Directors' Report.\n\n## 2  Remuneration framework\n\nBHP has an overarching remuneration framework that guides the Committee's decisions and is designed to support our strategy and reinforce our culture and values.\n\n## 2.1  How the remuneration framework is set\n\nThe Committee sets the remuneration framework for the Executive KMP, including the CEO. The Committee is briefed on and considers prevailing market conditions, the competitive environment and the positioning and relativities of pay and employment conditions across the wider BHP workforce. The Committee takes into account the annual base salary increases for our employee population when determining any change in the Executive KMP's base salary. The salary increases in locations where our Executive KMP are based are particularly relevant when reviewing their remuneration to ensure that their remuneration also reflects the local economic conditions.\n\nThe principles that underpin the remuneration framework for Executives are the same as those that apply to other employees, however Executive KMP arrangements have a greater emphasis on and a higher proportion of remuneration that is at risk as performance-related variable pay. The performance measures used to determine variable pay outcomes for the Executive KMP and all other employees are linked to the delivery of our strategy and behaviours that are aligned to Our Charter values.\n\nAs part of the Board's commitment to good governance, the Committee considers shareholder views and those of the wider community when setting the remuneration framework for the Executive KMP. We are committed to engaging and communicating with shareholders regularly and, as our shareholders are spread across the globe, we are proactive with our engagement on remuneration and governance matters with institutional shareholders and investor representative organisations. Feedback from shareholders and investors is used as input into decision-making by the Board and the Committee in relation to our remuneration framework and its application. The Committee considers that this approach provides a robust mechanism to ensure Directors are aware of matters raised, have a deep understanding of current shareholder views and can formulate frameworks and make decisions as appropriate. We encourage shareholders to make their views known to us by directly contacting our Investor Relations team (contact details available at bhp.com).\n\n## 2.2  Remuneration framework operation\n\nOur approved remuneration policy was adopted by shareholders in 2019 for a three-year period in accordance with UK requirements and following the unification of our corporate structure in early 2022 BHP is no longer required to have our policy approved by shareholders every three years. However, the following table shows the current components of our remuneration framework, which is consistent with the prior approved remuneration policy.\n\n|                               | Fixed remuneration                                                                                                                                                                                                | CDP                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | LTIP                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Purpose and  link to strategy | Market competitive fixed remuneration  is paid in order to attract, motivate and  retain high-quality and experienced  executives, and provide appropriate  remuneration for these important roles  in the Group. | The CDP encourages and focuses  executives' efforts for the relevant  financial year on the delivery of the  Group's strategic priorities, balancing  financial and non-financial performance,  to deliver short, medium and long- term success aligned to our purpose  and  Our Charter , and to motivate  executives to strive to achieve stretch | The purpose of the LTIP is to focus  executive's efforts on the achievement of  sustainable long-term value creation and  success of the Group (including appropriate  management of business risks). |",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report continued\n\n## Malus and clawback\n\nAs has been set out in prior Remuneration Reports, for many years we have had malus and clawback provisions in place. During FY2022, we enhanced our malus and clawback policy covering awards made from 2021 under the CDP and LTIP. This enhanced policy further clarified the circumstances in which the Committee is able to reduce or clawback awards, which include:\n\n- -  an error in the Group's Financial Statements that requires a material downward restatement\n- -  performance of a participant, or of the business or of the Group does not justify vesting or where the participant's conduct or performance has been in breach of their employment contract, any laws, rules, codes of conduct or policies applicable to them or the standards reasonably expected of a person in their position\n- -  misstatement or misrepresentation of the performance of the company\n- -  where any team, business area, member of the Group or profit centre in which the participant works or worked has been found guilty in connection with any regulatory investigation or has been in breach of any laws, rules, codes of conduct or policies applicable to it or the standards reasonably expected of it\n- -  an event that has had, or may have a material adverse effect on the value or reputation of any member of the Group\n- -  where the Committee determines there has been material damage to the Group's social licence to operate\n- -  a catastrophic health, safety, environment or community event or events occurring in any part of the Group\n- -  an act, omission or event occurs which constitutes a material failure of risk management or of other operational systems and controls\n- -  a participant is found to have contributed to circumstances that give rise to a material loss for any Group Company\n\nThese malus and clawback provisions apply whether or not awards are made in the form of cash or equity, whether or not the equity has vested, and whether or not employment is ongoing.\n\n## Service contracts\n\nThe terms of employment for the CEO and Executive KMP are formalised in their employment contracts. The current contracts of the CEO and Executive KMP are not fixed term. BHP may choose to terminate a contract on up to 12 months' notice. BHP can require an executive to work through the notice period or may terminate the individual's contract immediately by paying base salary plus pension contributions in lieu of the notice period. The CEO and Executive KMP must provide up to 12 months' notice for voluntary resignation.\n\n## Approach to recruitment and promotion\n\nFor external candidates that are appointed Executive KMP, the Committee may determine that it is appropriate to provide additional cash and/or equity components to replace any remuneration forfeited or not received from a former employer. It is anticipated any foregone equity awards would be replaced by equity. The value of the replacement remuneration would not be any greater than the fair value of the awards foregone or not received (as determined by the Committee's independent adviser). The Committee would determine appropriate service conditions and performance conditions within BHP's remuneration framework, taking into account the conditions attached to the foregone awards. The Committee is mindful of limiting such payments and not providing any more compensation than is necessary. For any internal Executive KMP appointment, any entitlements provided under former arrangements will be honoured and remain on foot according to their existing terms.\n\n## 2.3  Potential remuneration outcomes\n\nThe Committee recognises market forces influence remuneration practices and it strongly believes the fundamental driver of remuneration outcomes should be performance. It also believes that overall remuneration should be fair to the individual, and remuneration levels should accurately reflect the CEO's and other Executive KMP's responsibilities and contributions, while aligning with the expectations of our shareholders and considering the positioning and relativities of pay and employment conditions across the wider BHP workforce.\n\nThe amount of remuneration actually received each year depends on the achievement of business and individual performance that generate sustained shareholder value. Before deciding on the final incentive outcomes for the CEO and other Executive KMP, the Committee first considers the achievement of pre-determined performance conditions. The Committee then applies its overarching discretion to determine what it considers to be a fair and commensurate remuneration level in order to decide if the outcome should be reduced. In this way, the Committee believes it can set a remuneration level for the CEO and other Executive KMP that is sufficient to incentivise and is also fair and commensurate with shareholder expectations and prevailing market conditions.\n\nThe diagram below provides the scenarios for the potential total remuneration of the CEO and other Executive KMP at different levels of performance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFixed remuneration\n\nCDP (cash)\n\nCDP (deferred shares)\n\nLTIP\n\n% of total remuneration",

The LTIP target value in the chart above is based on the fair value of the award, which is 41 per cent of the face value of 200 per cent of base salary for the CEO and 175 per cent for other Executive KMP. The potential impact of future share price movements is not included in the value of deferred CDP awards or LTIP awards.\n\nMaximum: consists of fixed remuneration, maximum CDP (a cash award of 120 per cent of base salary plus two awards of deferred shares each of equivalent value to the cash award, vesting in two and five years respectively), and maximum LTIP (in the chart above based on the face value of 200 per cent of base salary for the CEO and 175 per cent for other Executive KMP). The potential impact of future share price movements is not included in the value of deferred CDP awards or LTIP awards.\n\nThe maximum opportunity represented above is the most that could potentially be paid for each remuneration component. It does not reflect any intention by the Group to award that amount. In determining the maximum remuneration opportunity, the Committee reviews relevant benchmarking data and industry practices and believes the maximum remuneration opportunity is appropriate.\n\n## 3  Remuneration for the CEO and other Executive KMP\n\n## 3.1  FY2022 remuneration received by the CEO\n\nThe table below is a voluntary non-statutory disclosure of the remuneration received by the CEO during FY2022 and FY2021. This table is unaudited and differs from the audited remuneration calculated in accordance with the Australian Accounting Standards (refer to 5.1 KMP remuneration table and in Financial Statements note 25 Employee share ownership plans).\n\nThe difference between the disclosure in the table below and remuneration calculated in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards relates to the CDP and LTIP. The remuneration calculated in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards require the fair value of the CDP and LTIP to be calculated at the time of grant and to be amortised over the relevant vesting periods regardless of the performance outcome. This may not reflect what the executive receives. In the table below, the CDP and LTIP values relate to the performance outcomes and actual amount received each year under the CDP (i.e. against the CDP scorecard) and the LTIP (i.e. the LTIP vesting outcome).\n\nThis table is designed to provide greater transparency for shareholders on the remuneration for the CEO during FY2022 and FY2021 as it has a stronger link to performance, with the CDP and LTIP included below representing those amounts that have been received as a consequence of satisfying performance conditions in the relevant financial year.\n\nDetails of the components of remuneration are contained in 2.2 Remuneration framework operation and the values in the table are explained further in the notes below.\n\n| US$('000)   |        | Base salary   |   Benefits |   Pension 2 | CDP   | LTIP 4   | Total   |\n|-------------|--------|---------------|------------|-------------|-------|----------|---------|\n| Mike Henry  | FY2022 | 1,700         |        168 |         170 | 3,917 | 8,712    | 14,667  |\n|             | FY2021 | 1,700         |        120 |         170 | 4,692 | 7,939    | 14,621  |\n\n- 2 Mike Henry's FY2022 and FY2021 pension contributions were provided based on 10 per cent of base salary.\n- 3 The values shown are the full CDP value (cash and deferred equity) earned as a consequence of performance during FY2022 and FY2021. The FY2022 CDP award will be provided one-third in cash in September 2022 and two-thirds in deferred equity, with one-third due to vest in FY2025 and one-third due to vest in FY2027 (on the terms of the CDP). The FY2021 CDP award was provided one-third in cash in September 2021 and two-thirds in deferred equity, with one-third due to vest in FY2024 and one-third due to vest in FY2026 (on the terms of the CDP).\n- 4   Mike Henry's LTIP award values for FY2022 and FY2021 (refer below) are based on the full awards he received in 2017 and 2016 respectively when he was President Operations, Minerals Australia (prior to becoming and with no proration applied for time as CEO), and 100 per cent of the awards vesting. For FY2022 the LTIP award value is calculated on the average share price for the month of July 2022 (which will be updated for the actual share price on the vesting date in the 2023 Remuneration Report); whereas the LTIP award value for FY2021 was calculated on the actual share price on the vesting date.\n\nA revised remuneration framework took effect from 1 July 2019 and significantly reduced the LTIP grant size for the CEO from 400 per cent of base salary (on a face value basis) to 200 per cent and a rebalancing to a CDP award with a long-term focus. As a result, the remuneration for Mike Henry reported above reflects the transition to this structure and includes the full amounts of the CDP award earned during FY2022 and FY2021 (i.e. irrespective that some elements of the CDP award are deferred) together with the full amounts of the pre-existing LTIP awards vesting at the end of FY2022 and FY2021 which were granted in 2017 and 2016, respectively (i.e. when the LTIP award size was double the current grant size).\n\nHad the current remuneration framework been in place when Mike's 2017 and 2016 LTIP awards were granted and a reduced size awarded, the reported LTIP values would have been US$4.356 million for FY2022 and US$3.970 million for FY2021 (instead of US$8.712 million and US$7.939 million in the table above). The reported total remuneration would have therefore been US$10.311 million for FY2022 and US$10.652 million for FY2021 (instead of US$14.667 million and US$14.621 million in the table above).\n\n## CEO pay ratio\n\nThe FY2022 CEO pay ratio, calculated using the reported total fixed and variable remuneration above for the CEO, and compared to the median remuneration for all of our employees worldwide, was 123:1 (FY2021 - 130:1). The remuneration calculation for all employees is based on actual earnings for the 12 months to 31 March 2022, including annual incentive payments for employees calculated using the Group performance outcome, and vested equity received if applicable. Pension contributions are calculated as the total cost of contributions made by the Group over the 12-month period. Employees on international assignments have been excluded from the analysis as their remuneration structures are generally not consistent with the remuneration received by the CEO as noted in the table above.\n\nThe FY2022 ratio of 123:1 at the median compared to the FY2021 ratio of 130:1 reflects the proportion of the CEO's pay being more heavily weighted to variable pay, including share-based long-term incentives, than for other employees. The change from FY2021 to FY2022 is driven by a lower FY2022 CDP outcome of 96 per cent (FY2021: 115 per cent) for the CEO, a higher value of the CEO's vested LTIP award in FY2022 compared to FY2021 and an increase in the median remuneration for all of our employees worldwide.\n\nThe Group believes the median pay ratio reflects the diversity of our global business footprint and employee population. BHP's remuneration policies and practices are based on a high degree of alignment and consistency, with total remuneration at all levels providing a competitive package that enables the attraction and retention of talent while also providing at-risk remuneration based on performance.",

For the CEO, the Board and the Committee determined a CDP outcome for FY2022 at 96 per cent against the target of 100 per cent (which represents an outcome of 64 per cent against maximum). The Board and Committee believe this outcome is appropriately aligned with the shareholder experience and the interests of the Group's other stakeholders.\n\nThe CEO's CDP scorecard outcome for FY2022 is summarised in the following tables, including a narrative description of each performance measure and the CEO's level of achievement, as determined by the Committee and approved by the Board. The level of performance for each measure is determined based on a range of threshold (the minimum necessary to qualify for any reward outcome), target (where the performance requirements are met), and maximum (where the performance requirements are significantly exceeded).\n\n## Summary of outcomes for the CEO\n\n| Performance measure   | Weighting   for FY2022   | Threshold   | Target   | Maximum   | Percentage outcome Mike Henry   |\n|-----------------------|--------------------------|-------------|----------|-----------|---------------------------------|\n| HSEC                  | 25%                      |             |          |           | 31%                             |\n| Financial             | 50%                      |             |          |           | 40%                             |\n| Individual            | 25%                      |             |          |           | 25%                             |\n| Total                 | 100%                     |             |          |           | 96%                             |\n\n## HSEC\n\nThe HSEC targets for the CEO are aligned to the Group's 2030 public sustainability goals.

ROCE is the key financial measure against which CDP outcomes for our senior executives are measured and is, in our view, a relevant measure to assess the financial performance of the Group for this purpose. While ROCE excludes exceptional items, the Committee reviews each exceptional item to assess if it should be included in the result when determining the ROCE CDP outcome.\n\nWhen we are assessing management's performance, we make adjustments to the ROCE result to allow for changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange movements and other material items (from the levels assumed in setting the targets) to ensure the assessment appropriately measures outcomes that are within the control and influence of the Group and its executives. Of these, changes in commodity prices have historically been the most material due to volatility in prices and the impact on Group revenue and ROCE.

Vesting is subject to achievement of the relative TSR performance conditions and any discretion applied by the Committee (refer to 3.4 Overarching discretion and vesting underpin).\n\nFor the 2017 LTIP award to vest in full, BHP's TSR over the performance period from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2022 must be at or exceed the 80th percentile of the Sector Group TSR and the World TSR. TSR includes returns to BHP shareholders in the form of share price movements along with dividends paid and reinvested in BHP (including cash and in-specie dividends).\n\nBHP's TSR performance was positive 181.7 per cent over the five-year period from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2022. This is above the 80th percentile of the Sector Group TSR of positive 168.7 per cent and above the 80th percentile of the World TSR of positive 128.8 per cent over the same period. This level of performance results in 100 per cent vesting for the 2017 LTIP award. The value of the CEO's vested 2017 LTIP award has been reported in 3.1 FY2022 remuneration received by the CEO.\n\nThe graph below shows BHP's performance relative to comparator groups.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe value of the vested 2017 LTIP award is higher than the value of the award at the time it was granted. With the share price having risen appreciably during the five-year period and strong dividends, 44 per cent of the value realised is due to the value at the time the awards were granted and 56 per cent is due to share price appreciation and dividends. This value increment due to share price appreciation and dividends is consistent with the experience of shareholders over the period.\n\n## 3.4  Overarching discretion and vesting underpin\n\nThe rules of the CDP and LTIP and the terms and conditions of the awards provide the Committee with an overarching discretion to reduce the number of awards that will vest, notwithstanding that the performance condition or the relevant service conditions have been met.\n\nThis overarching discretion is a holistic, qualitative judgement and is applied as an underpin test before final vesting is confirmed. It is an important risk management tool to ensure vesting is not simply driven by a formula or the passage of time that may give unexpected or unintended remuneration outcomes.\n\nThe Committee considers its discretion carefully each year ahead of the scheduled vesting of CDP and LTIP equity awards in August. It considers performance holistically over the five-year period, including a five-year 'look back' on HSEC performance, profitability, cash flow, balance sheet health, returns to shareholders, corporate governance and conduct. For the five years from FY2018 to FY2022, the Committee noted BHP's continued improvement in HSEC outcomes, strong operational performance with improving production and cost performance, and significant returns to shareholders, together with no governance or conduct issues of note.\n\nFirstly, in respect of the vesting of CDP two-year deferred shares (granted in November 2020 in respect of performance in FY2020), the Committee chose not to exercise its discretion and allowed the CDP awards to vest in full.\n\nSecondly, in respect of the vesting of the 2017 LTIP five-year performance shares, the formulaic outcome of the 2017 LTIP was 100 per cent vesting. Having undertaken the 'look back' review described above, the Committee concluded the vesting outcome was appropriate given Group and individual performance, and chose not to exercise its discretion and allowed 100 per cent of the LTIP awards to vest. There is no upwards discretion available to the Committee in respect of the LTIP and the overarching discretion may only reduce the number of awards that may vest.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration Report continued\n\n## 3.5  Sign-on performance shares\n\nDavid Lamont joined BHP as Chief Financial Officer on 1 December 2020. David left his former employer, CSL Limited (CSL), a major Australian company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, on 30 October 2020. As a consequence of his resignation, certain CSL incentive awards, which were expected to have been paid or vested in 2021 and beyond, were foregone. Replacement BHP awards were provided in accordance with BHP's remuneration framework. In accordance with that policy, remuneration that David forfeited or did not receive as a consequence of leaving CSL to join BHP was partly replaced with 86,279 performance shares (i.e. 77,000 awards granted plus 9,279 additional uplift awards allocated as part of the merger of the Petroleum business with Woodside) and the Committee determined appropriate service and performance conditions.\n\nThe performance conditions were a holistic assessment of underlying financial performance of BHP and personal performance of David during the vesting period. At the time of grant, the target was 80 per cent vesting of awards, with a maximum of 100 per cent and a minimum of zero.\n\nThe service condition was satisfied and the Committee assessed the performance condition over the relevant performance period (1 December 2020 to 30 June 2022). The Committee considered BHP's TSR, the CDP finance measure outcomes and David's personal performance (with guidance on this assessment from the CEO).\n\nIn particular, the Committee considered the following information over the relevant period:\n\n- -  BHP's relative TSR performance was slightly above the weighted median of BHP's sector peers\n- -  BHP's financial performance, as measured by the CDP finance measure outcomes, was slightly below target\n- -  the CEO's view that David had performed in line with expectations in his role\n\nThe Committee exercised its discretion and determined to vest 80 per cent or 69,023 of the performance shares. The awards which will not vest will instead lapse. A holding lock will apply to the vested shares until August 2023, at which time they will be released to David. Should David voluntarily resign or retire during the holding lock period, or be terminated for cause, the shares subject to the holding lock will be forfeited.\n\n## 3.6  LTIP allocated during FY2022\n\nFollowing shareholder approval at the 2021 AGMs, 107,183 LTIP awards (in the form of performance rights) were granted to the CEO on 23 November 2021. The face value of the CEO's award was 200 per cent of his base salary of US$1.700 million at the time of grant. The fair value of the awards is ordinarily calculated by multiplying the face value of the award by the fair value factor of 41 per cent (for the current plan design, as determined by the independent adviser to the Committee). The 107,183 LTIP awards for the CEO was determined based on the US$ face value of the LTIP awards of US$3.400 million and calculated using the average share price and US$/A$ exchange rate over the 12 months up to and including 30 June 2021. LTIP awards granted to other Executive KMP during FY2022 were calculated on the same basis as described above for the CEO, except that awards for other Executive KMP had a face value of 175 per cent of base salary.\n\nIn addition to the LTIP terms set out in 2.2 Remuneration framework operation, the Committee has determined the following terms for the 2021 LTIP:\n\n| Performance period              | -  1 July 2021 to 30 June 2026                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Performance conditions          | -  An averaging period of six months will be used in the TSR calculations. -  BHP's TSR relative to the weighted median TSR of sector peer companies selected by the Committee (Sector Group  TSR) and the MSCI World Index (World TSR) will determine the vesting of 67% and 33% of the award, respectively.  -  Each company in the sector peer group is weighted by market capitalisation.

Threshold vesting (25% of each portion of the award) occurs  where BHP's TSR equals the weighted 50th percentile (i.e. the median) of the Sector Group TSR or the World TSR  (as applicable). Vesting occurs on a sliding scale between the weighted 50th and 80th percentiles. |\n| Sector peer group   companies 1 | -  Resources (85%): Anglo American, Fortescue Metals, Freeport-McMoRan, Glencore, Rio Tinto, Southern Copper,  Teck Resources, Vale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n\n- 1 From November 2018, CONSOL Energy was removed from the sector comparator group, as due to its internal restructuring it had become a less comparable peer.\n\n## 3.7  FY2023 remuneration for the CEO and other Executive KMP\n\nThe remuneration for the CEO and other Executive KMP in FY2023 will be in accordance with 2.2 Remuneration framework operation.\n\n## Base salary review\n\nBase salaries are reviewed annually and increases are applicable from 1 September. The CEO commenced in the role on 1 January 2020 and did not receive a base salary increase in FY2021 or FY2022. The Board and the Committee have assessed the CEO and other Executive KMP's performance and determined that, as of 1 September 2022:\n\n- -  The CEO's and other Executive KMP's base salaries will increase by 3 per cent following a review by the Committee of the external market demand for senior executive talent and updated benchmarking. The Committee considers the increases modest in this context, as well as being below the median salary increase applied for other BHP employees of approximately 4 per cent.\n- -  In addition, having reviewed Ragnar Udd's performance and development in role since appointment in November 2020, including the dynamic context and growing importance of the Americas region to the Group, the Committee provided an additional increase of 6 per cent increase in base salary (i.e. 9 per cent in total).\n\nThe CEO's and other Executive KMP's base salaries will be kept under review in future years to ensure they remain competitive.",

The number of LTIP awards in FY2023 has been determined using the share price and US$/A$ exchange rate over the 12 months up to and including 30 June 2022 (adjusted to eliminate the value of the in-specie dividend distributed in connection with the merger of BHP's Petroleum business with Woodside from the daily BHP Group Limited share prices between 1 July 2021 to 31 May 2022). Based on this, a FY2023 grant of 118,853 LTIP awards is proposed and approval for this LTIP grant will be sought from shareholders at the 2022 AGM. If approved, the award will be granted following the AGM (i.e. in or around November 2022, subject to securities dealing considerations). The FY2023 LTIP award will use the same performance and service conditions as the FY2022 LTIP award, except that the MSCI World Metals and Mining Index will replace the sector group companies comparator group, due to the merger of the Petroleum business with Woodside. Accordingly, the FY2023 LTIP award will use the following comparator groups: the new MSCI World Metals and Mining Index and the existing MSCI World Index, which will determine the vesting of 67 per cent and 33 per cent of the award, respectively.\n\nLTIP awards granted to other Executive KMP during FY2023 will be calculated on the same basis as described above for the CEO, except that awards for other Executive KMP will have a maximum face value of 175 per cent of base salary.\n\n## 4  Remuneration for Non-executive Directors\n\nOur remuneration framework for Non-executive Directors aligns with the Australian Securities Exchange Corporate Governance Council's Principles and Recommendations (4 th Edition).\n\n## 4.1  Remuneration framework\n\nThe following table shows the components for Non-executive Directors' remuneration.

Non-executive Directors are paid a base fee and relevant  committee membership fees. Committee Chairs and the Senior  Independent Director are paid an additional fee to reflect their  extra responsibilities.  All fee levels are reviewed annually and any changes are  ordinarily effective from 1 July.  Fee levels reflect the size and complexity of the Group and  the geographies in which the Group operates. The economic  environment and the financial performance of the Group are | Travel allowances are paid on a per-trip basis reflecting  the considerable travel burden imposed on members of  the Board as a consequence of the global nature of the  organisation and apply when a Director needs to travel  internationally to attend a Board meeting or site visits at  our multiple geographic locations. As a consequence of our prior dual listed company  structure, Non-executive Directors are required to prepare  personal tax returns in Australia and the UK, regardless of  whether they reside in one or neither of those countries.  They are accordingly reimbursed for the costs of personal |\n\n## Letters of appointment\n\nThe Board has adopted a letter of appointment that contains the terms on which Non-executive Directors will be appointed, including the basis upon which they will be indemnified by the Group. The Board has adopted a policy under which all Non-executive Directors must seek re-election at the AGM each year. As a result of requiring re-election each year, Non-executive Directors do not have a fixed term in their letter of appointment.\n\nThe maximum aggregate fees payable to Non-executive Directors (including the Chair) were approved by shareholders at the 2008 AGMs at US$3.800 million per annum. This sum includes base fees, Committee fees and pension contributions. Travel allowances and non-monetary benefits are not included in this limit.\n\n## Payments on early termination or loss of office\n\nThere are no provisions in any of the Non-executive Directors' appointment arrangements for compensation payable on early termination of their directorship. A Non-executive Director may resign on reasonable notice. No payments are made to Non-executive Directors on loss of office.\n\n## 4.2  Non-executive Directors' remuneration in FY2023\n\nIn FY2023, the remuneration for the Non-executive Directors will be paid in accordance with the remuneration framework set out above. Fee levels for the Non-executive Directors and the Chair are reviewed annually. The review includes benchmarking against peer companies, with the assistance of external advisers.\n\nFrom 1 July 2017, the Chair's annual fee was reduced by approximately 8 per cent from US$0.960 million to US$0.880 million and will remain at that level for FY2023. This fee reduction was in addition to the reduction of approximately 13 per cent from US$1.100 million to US$0.960 million effective 1 July 2015. Base fee levels for Non-executive Directors will remain at the reduced levels that took effect from 1 July 2015, at which time they were reduced by approximately 6 per cent from US$0.170 million to US$0.160 million per annum.\n\nThe below table sets out the annualised total remuneration and total fixed fees for FY2023, which are unchanged from FY2022.\n\n| Levels of fees and travel allowances for Non-executive Directors (in US$)   | From 1 July 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Base annual fee                                                             | 160,000            |\n| Plus additional fees for:                                                   |                    |\n| Senior Independent Director                                                 | 48,000             |\n| Committee Chair:                                                            |                    |\n| Risk and Audit                                                              | 60,000             |\n| Remuneration                                                                | 45,000             |\n| Sustainability                                                              | 45,000             |\n| Nomination and Governance                                                   | No additional fee  |\n| Committee membership:                                                       |                    |\n| Risk and Audit                                                              | 32,500             |\n| Remuneration                                                                | 27,500             |\n| Sustainability                                                              | 27,500             |\n| Nomination and Governance                                                   | 18,000             |\n| Travel allowance: 1                                                         |                    |\n| Greater than 3 but less than 10 hours                                       | 7,000              |\n| 10 hours or more                                                            | 15,000             |\n| Chair's fee                                                                 | 880,000            |\n\n- 1 In relation to travel for Board business, the time thresholds relate to the flight time to travel to the meeting location (i.e. one way flight time).

For the CEO shareholder approval for these awards will be sought at the 2022 AGM and following approval these would be granted in or around November 2022. Uplift awards for other Executive KMP were granted on 17 June 2022.\n- 2 Where the vesting date is not yet known, the estimated vesting month is shown. Where awards lapse, the lapse date is shown. If the vesting conditions are met, awards will vest on or as soon as practicable after the first non-prohibited period date occurring after 30 June of the preceding year of vest. The year of vesting is the second (STIP and CDP two-year awards), third (MAP), fourth (MAP) or fifth (MAP, CDP five-year awards and LTIP) financial year after grant. All awards are conditional awards and have no exercise period, exercise price or expiry date; instead ordinary fully paid shares are automatically delivered upon the vesting conditions being met. Where vesting conditions are not met, the conditional awards will immediately lapse.\n- 3 The market price shown is the closing price of BHP shares on the relevant date of grant. No price is payable by the individual to receive a grant of awards. The IFRS fair value of the CDP and LTIP awards granted in FY2022 at the grant date of 23 November 2021 are as follows: CDP - A$38.05 and LTIP - A$18.92.\n- 4 The market price shown is the closing price of BHP shares on the relevant date of vest.\n- 5 The gain on awards is calculated using the market price on date of vesting or exercise (as applicable) less any exercise price payable. The amounts that vested and were lapsed for the awards during FY2022 are as follows: CDP - 100 per cent vested; LTIP - 100 per cent vested; MAP - 100 per cent vested.\n\n## 5.3  Estimated value range of equity awards\n\nThe current face value (and estimate of the maximum possible total value) of equity awards allocated during FY2022 and yet to vest are the awards as set out in the previous table multiplied by the current share price of BHP Group Limited. The minimum possible total value of the awards is nil. The actual value that may be received by participants in the future cannot be determined as it is dependent on and therefore fluctuates with the share prices of BHP Group Limited at the date that any particular award vests or is exercised.\n\n## Five-year share price, dividend and earnings history\n\nThe table below provides the five-year share price history for BHP Group Limited, history of dividends paid and the Group's earnings.\n\n| BHP Group Limited                              | FY2022    | FY2021   | FY2020   | FY2019   | FY2018   |\n|------------------------------------------------|-----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Share price at beginning of year               | A$48.22   | A$35.82  | A$41.68  | A$33.60  | A$23.23  |\n| Share price at end of year                     | A$41.25   | A$48.57  | A$35.82  | A$41.16  | A$33.91  |\n| Dividends paid                                 | A$10.18 1 | A$2.07   | A$2.13   | A$3.08 2 | A$1.24   |\n| Attributable profit (US$ million, as reported) | 30,900    | 11,304   | 7,956    | 8,306    | 3,705    |\n\n- 1 The FY2022 dividends paid includes A$5.38 in respect of the in-specie dividend associated with the merger of the Petroleum business with Woodside.\n- 2 The FY2019 dividends paid includes A$1.41 in respect of the special dividend associated with the divestment of Onshore US.\n\nThe highest and lowest closing share price during FY2022 were A$54.06 and A$35.56 respectively.\n\n## 5.4  Ordinary share holdings and transactions\n\nThe number of ordinary shares in BHP Group Limited held directly, indirectly or beneficially, by each individual (including shares held in the name of all close members of the Director's or Executive KMP's family and entities over which either the Director or Executive KMP or the family member has, directly or indirectly, control, joint control or significant influence) are shown below. No shares are held nominally by any KMP or their related parties. These are ordinary shares held without performance conditions or restrictions and are included in MSR calculations for each individual.\n\n|                        | Held at 1 July 2021 1   | Purchased   | Received as  remuneration 2   | Sold    | Held at  30 June 2022   |\n|------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|-------------------------------|---------|-------------------------|\n| Mike Henry             | 395,241                 | -           | 245,423                       | 119,072 | 521,592                 |\n| Edgar Basto            | 134,889                 | -           | 27,651                        | 32,502  | 130,038                 |\n| David Lamont           | 6,345                   | -           | -                             | -       | 6,345                   |\n| Geraldine Slattery 3,4 | 100,917                 | -           | 35,681                        | 9,366   | 127,232                 |\n| Ragnar Udd 3           | 105,816                 | -           | 25,565                        | 12,426  | 118,955                 |\n| Terry Bowen            | 11,000                  | -           | -                             | -       | 11,000                  |\n| Malcolm Broomhead      | 19,000                  | -           | -                             | -       | 19,000                  |\n| Xiaoqun Clever         | 7,000                   | 1,000       | -                             | -       | 8,000                   |\n| Ian Cockerill 3        | 13,188                  | 1,111       | -                             | -       | 14,299                  |\n| Anita Frew 6           | 15,000                  | -           | -                             | -       | 15,000                  |\n| Gary Goldberg 4        | 10,000                  | 2,000       | -                             | -       | 12,000                  |\n| Michelle Hinchliffe 5  | -                       | 8,508       | -                             | -       | 8,508                   |\n| Susan Kilsby 6         | 6,900                   | -           | -                             | -       | 6,900                   |\n| Ken MacKenzie          | 52,351                  | -           | -                             | -       | 52,351                  |\n| John Mogford           | 13,938                  | -           | -                             | -       | 13,938                  |\n| Christine O'Reilly 3   | 7,420                   | 2,000       | -                             | -       | 9,420                   |\n| Catherine Tanna 5      | 10,400                  | -           | -                             | -       | 10,400                  |\n| Dion Weisler           | 1,544                   | 6,000       | -                             | -       | 7,544                   |\n\n- 1 Includes shares in BHP Group Plc held directly, indirectly or beneficially, by each individual (including shares held in the name of all close members of the Director's or Executive KMP's family and entities over which either the Director or Executive KMP or the family member has, directly or indirectly, control, joint control or significant influence) prior to unification.\n- 2 Includes DEP in the form of shares on equity awards vesting, where applicable, as disclosed in 5.2 Equity awards.",

The MSR is tested at the time that shares are to be sold. Shares may be sold to satisfy tax obligations arising from the granting, holding, vesting, exercise or sale of the employee awards or the underlying shares whether the MSR is satisfied at that time or not.\n\n## For FY2022:\n\n- -  The MSR for the CEO was five times annual pre-tax base salary. At the end of FY2022, the CEO met the MSR.\n- -  The MSR for other Executive KMP was three times annual pre-tax base salary. At the end of FY2022, the other Executive KMP met the MSR, except for David Lamont, as he was appointed as Executive KMP on 1 December 2020.\n- -  No Executive KMP sold or purchased shares during FY2022, other than sales to satisfy taxation obligations, apart from Edgar Basto, who sold shares in order to fund the purchase of a residential dwelling.\n\nEffective 1 July 2020, a two-year post-retirement shareholding requirement for the CEO applies from the date of retirement, which will be the lower of the CEO's MSR or the CEO's actual shareholding at the date of retirement.\n\nSubject to securities dealing constraints, Non-executive Directors have agreed to apply at least 25 per cent of their remuneration (base fees plus Committee fees) to the purchase of BHP shares until they achieve an MSR equivalent in value to one year of remuneration (base fees plus Committee fees). Thereafter, they must maintain at least that level of shareholding throughout their tenure. At the end of FY2022, each Non-executive Director met the MSR.\n\n## 5.7  Transactions with KMP\n\nDuring the financial year, there were no transactions between the Group and its subsidiaries and KMP (including their related parties) (2021: US$ nil; 2020: US$ nil). There were no amounts payable by or loans with KMP (including their related parties) at 30 June 2022 (2021: US$ nil).\n\nA number of KMP hold or have held positions in other companies (i.e. personally related entities) where it is considered they control or significantly influence the financial or operating policies of those entities. There have been no transactions with those entities and no amounts were owed by the Group to personally related entities or any other related parties (2021: US$ nil; 2020: US$ nil).\n\nThis Remuneration Report was approved by the Board on 16 August 2022 and signed on its behalf by:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChristine O'Reilly\n\nChair, Remuneration Committee\n\n16 August 2022",

Under the DLC structure BHP Group Limited, BHP Group Plc and their subsidiaries operated together as a single for-profit economic entity with a common Board of Directors, unified management structure and joint objectives. On 31 January 2022, BHP unified its corporate structure under BHP Group Limited, and subsequently BHP Group Plc changed its name to BHP Group (UK) Ltd. Throughout the Consolidated Financial Statements (the Financial Statements), the collective contributions of the aforementioned entities are referred to as 'BHP' or 'the Group', regardless of the DLC or unified corporate structure.\n\nGroup and related party information is presented in note 31 'Related party transactions' to the Financial Statements. This details transactions between the Group's subsidiaries, associates, joint arrangements and other related parties. The nature of the operations and principal activities of the Group are described in the segment information (refer to note 1 'Segment reporting' to the Financial Statements).\n\n## Presentation of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nDirectors of BHP have included information in this report they deem to be material and relevant to the understanding of the Financial Statements. Disclosure may be considered material and relevant if the dollar amount is significant due to its size or nature, or the information is important to understand the:\n\n- -  Group's current year results\n- -  impact of significant changes in the Group's business or\n- -  aspects of the Group's operations that are important to future performance\n\nOn 22 November 2021, the Group and Woodside Energy Group Limited ('Woodside') signed a binding Share Sale Agreement ('SSA') for the merger of the Group's oil and gas portfolio with Woodside. While the merger had an economic effective date of 1 July 2021, the Group continued to control the Petroleum assets and carry on business in the normal course for 11 months until 1 June 2022 (Completion Date). As such, the Group recognises its share of revenue, expenses, net finance costs and associated income tax expense related to the Discontinued operation until the Completion Date. Comparative periods have been adjusted for the effects of applying IFRS 5/AASB 5 'Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations' to disclose the Group's Petroleum business on the same basis as the current period.\n\nThese Financial Statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 16 August 2022.\n\nAnnual Report 2022\n\n125",

Amounts are rounded to the nearest million dollars, unless otherwise stated, in accordance with ASIC (Rounding in Financial/Directors' Reports) Instrument 2016/191\n- -  present reclassified comparative information where required for consistency with the current year's presentation\n- -  adopt all new and amended standards and interpretations under IFRS, that are mandatory for application in periods beginning on 1 July 2021. None had a significant impact on the Financial Statements. Refer note 37 'New and amended accounting standards and interpretations and changes to accounting policies' for details\n- -  have not early adopted any standards and interpretations that have been issued or amended but are not yet effective. Refer note 37 'New and amended accounting standards and interpretations and changes to accounting policies' for details\n\nThe accounting policies are consistently applied by all entities included in the Financial Statements.\n\nFollowing unification of the Group's corporate structure under BHP Group Limited, which was completed in January 2022, the Group Financial Statements are no longer required to be prepared in accordance with:\n\n- -  the UK Companies Act 2006\n- -  International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006 and International Financial Reporting Standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union (EU)\n- -  International Accounting Standards adopted for use within the UK\n\nIn assessing the appropriateness of the going concern assumption over the going concern period, management have stress tested BHP's most recent financial projections to incorporate a range of potential future outcomes by considering BHP's principal risks. The Group's financial forecasts, including downside commodity price and production scenarios, demonstrate that the Group believes that it has sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations as they fall due throughout the going concern period. As such, the Financial Statements continue to be prepared on the going concern basis.\n\n## Principles of consolidation\n\nIn preparing the Financial Statements, the effects of all intragroup balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nA list of significant entities in the Group, including subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates at year-end is contained in note 28 'Subsidiaries', note 29 'Investments accounted for using the equity method' and note 30 'Interests in joint operations'.\n\nSubsidiaries: The Financial Statements of the Group include the consolidation of BHP Group Limited (the Company or parent entity) and its subsidiaries, being the entities controlled by the parent entity during the year and BHP Group Plc and its subsidiaries whilst the DLC was in effect. Control exists where the Group:\n\n- -  has power over the investee\n- -  is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity\n- -  has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity\n\nThe ability to approve the operating and capital budget of a subsidiary and the ability to appoint key management personnel are decisions that demonstrate that the Group has the existing rights to direct the relevant activities of a subsidiary.\n\nConsolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Company loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in profit or loss from the date the Company gains control until the date when the Company ceases to control the subsidiary.\n\nWhere the Group's interest is less than 100 per cent, the interest attributable to outside shareholders is reflected in non-controlling interests.\n\nChanges in the Group's interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amount of the Group's interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Company.\n\nWhen the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the gain or loss on disposal is recognised in profit or loss.\n\nThe Financial Statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the Group's business combinations.\n\nJoint arrangements: The Group undertakes a number of business activities through joint arrangements, which exist when two or more parties have joint control. Joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures, based on the contractual rights and obligations between the parties to the arrangement:\n\n- -Joint operations: A joint operation is an arrangement in which the Group shares joint control, primarily via contractual arrangements with other parties. In a joint operation, the Group has rights to the underlying assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. This includes situations where the parties benefit from the joint activity through a share of the output, rather than by receiving a share of the results of trading. In relation to the Group's interest in a joint operation, the Group recognises: its assets and liabilities, including its share of any assets and liabilities held or incurred jointly; revenue from the sale of its share of the output and its share of any revenue generated from the sale of the output by the joint operation; and its expenses including its share of expenses incurred jointly. All such amounts are allocated in accordance with the terms of the arrangement, which is usually in proportion to the Group's interest in the joint operation.\n\nThe Group accounts for the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses relating to its interest in a joint operation in accordance with the IFRS Standards applicable to the particular assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses.",

        "page_content": "- -Joint ventures: A joint venture is a joint arrangement in which the parties that share joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. A separate vehicle, not the parties, will have the rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. More than an insignificant share of output from a joint venture is sold to third parties, which indicates the joint venture is not dependent on the parties to the arrangement for funding, nor do the parties have an obligation for the liabilities of the arrangement. Joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method as outlined below.\n\nAssociates: The Group accounts for investments in associates using the equity method as outlined below. An entity is considered an associate where the Group is deemed to have significant influence but not control or joint control. Significant influence is presumed to exist where the Group:\n\n- -  has over 20 per cent but less than 50 per cent of the voting rights of an entity, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that this is not the case or\n- -  holds less than 20 per cent of the voting rights of an entity; however, has the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions affecting the entity\n\nThe Group uses the term 'equity accounted investments' to refer to joint ventures and associates collectively.\n\nUnder the equity method, an investment in an associate or a joint venture is recognised initially at cost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group's share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture. When the Group's share of losses of an associate or a joint venture exceeds the Group's interest in that associate or joint venture, the Group discontinues recognising its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.\n\n## Significant accounting policies, judgements and estimates\n\nThe Group's accounting policies require the use of judgement, estimates and assumptions. All judgements, estimates and assumptions are based on the most current facts and circumstances and are reassessed on an ongoing basis. Actual results in future reporting periods may differ for these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.\n\nFurther information regarding the Group's significant judgements and key estimates and assumptions, being those where changes may materially affect financial results and the carrying amount of assets and liabilities to be reported in the next reporting period, are embedded within the following notes:\n\n|   Note |                                               |\n|--------|-----------------------------------------------|\n|      4 | Significant events - Samarco dam failure      |\n|      6 | Taxation                                      |\n|     11 | Overburden removal costs                      |\n|     11 | Depreciation of property, plant and equipment |\n|     13 | Impairments of non-current assets             |\n|     15 | Closure and rehabilitation provisions         |\n|     21 | Leases                                        |\n\nAdditional information including sensitivity analysis, where appropriate, has been provided in the relevant notes to enhance an understanding of the impact of key estimates and assumptions on the Group's financial position and performance.\n\n## Reserve estimates\n\nReserves are estimates of the amount of product that can be demonstrated to be able to be economically and legally extracted from the Group's properties. In order to estimate reserves, assumptions are required about a range of technical and economic factors, including quantities, qualities, production techniques, recovery efficiency, production and transport costs, commodity supply and demand, commodity and carbon prices and exchange rates.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nTransactions related to the Group's worldwide operations are conducted in a number of foreign currencies. The majority of the subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates within each of the operations have assessed US dollars as the functional currency, however, some subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates have functional currencies other than US dollars.\n\nTransactions and monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated into US dollars as follows:\n\n| Foreign currency item           | Applicable exchange rate       |\n|---------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Transactions                    | Date of underlying transaction |\n| Monetary assets and liabilities | Period-end rate                |\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses resulting from translation are recognised in the income statement, except for qualifying cash flow hedges (which are deferred to equity) and foreign exchange gains or losses on foreign currency provisions for site closure and rehabilitation costs (which are capitalised in property, plant and equipment for operating sites).\n\nOn consolidation, the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of foreign operations with non-US dollar functional currencies are translated into US dollars using the following applicable exchange rates:\n\n| Foreign currency amount   | Applicable exchange rate       |\n|---------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Income and expenses       | Date of underlying transaction |\n| Assets and liabilities    | Period-end rate                |\n| Equity                    | Historical rate                |\n| Reserves                  | Historical rate                |\n\nForeign exchange differences resulting from translation are initially recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve and subsequently transferred to the income statement on disposal of a foreign operation.\n\nEstimating the quantity and/or quality of reserves requires the size, shape and depth of ore bodies to be determined by analysing geological data, such as drilling samples and geophysical survey interpretations. Economic assumptions used to estimate reserves change from periodto-period as additional technical and operational data is generated. This process may require complex and difficult geological judgements to interpret the data.\n\n## Reserve impact on financial reporting\n\nEstimates of reserves may change from period-to-period as the economic assumptions used to estimate reserves change and additional geological data is generated during the course of operations. Changes in reserves may affect the Group's financial results and financial position in a number of ways, including:\n\n- -  asset carrying values may be affected due to changes in estimated future production levels\n- -  depreciation, depletion and amortisation charged to the income statement may change where such charges are determined on the units of production basis, or where the useful economic lives of assets change\n- -  overburden removal costs recorded on the balance sheet or charged to the income statement may change due to changes in stripping ratios or the units of production basis of depreciation\n- -  closure and rehabilitation provisions may change where changes in estimated reserves affect expectations about the timing or cost of these activities\n- -  the carrying amount of deferred tax assets may change due to changes in estimates of the likely recovery of the tax benefits",

        "page_content": "## Climate change\n\nThe Group continues to develop its assessment of the potential impacts of climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy. The Group's current climate change strategy focuses on reducing operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, investing in low emissions technologies, supporting emissions reductions in our value chain and promoting product stewardship, managing climate-related risk and opportunity, and working with others to enhance the global policy and market response. Future changes to the Group's climate change strategy or global decarbonisation signposts may impact the Group's significant judgements and key estimates and result in material changes to financial results and the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities in future reporting periods.\n\nDuring FY2022, the Group completed the merger of the Group's Petroleum business with Woodside and the divestments of the Group's interests in BHP Mitsui Coal Pty Ltd (BMC) and the Cerrej\u00f3n non-operated energy coal joint venture. In addition, the Group announced that it will retain New South Wales Energy Coal (NSWEC) in its portfolio, seek approvals to continue mining at NSWEC beyond its current mining consent that expires in 2026, and intends to proceed with a managed process to cease mining at the asset by the end of FY2030. While climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy remain key considerations in the Group's significant judgements and estimates, the portfolio updates during FY2022 have reduced the Group's exposure to fossil fuels. Following the updates, the potential risk to the carrying value of the Group's assets and liabilities from long-term price estimates for oil, gas and energy coal is largely limited to the impact of those commodities on the Group's supply chain.\n\nThe Group's current climate change strategy is reflected in the Group's significant judgements and key estimates, and therefore the Financial Statements, as follows:\n\n## Transition risks\n\n## The Group's targets and goals\n\nAs part of its response to the Paris Agreement goals, the Group has set a target to reduce its operational GHG emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2 from our operated assets) by at least 30 per cent from FY2020 levels by FY2030 and a goal to achieve net zero operational GHG emissions by 2050. For the FY2030 target, the FY2020 baseline has been adjusted to reflect the divestment of the Group's Petroleum and BMC operations and will be adjusted for any material future acquisitions and divestments. Approved emissions reduction projects aimed at contributing to the achievement of the Group's operational GHG emissions target and goal have been incorporated into the forecast cash flows of the Group's assets. The use of carbon offsets will be governed by the Group's approach to carbon offsetting, with the Group's offset strategy currently being managed at a consolidated Group level and therefore not currently incorporated into the forecast cash flows of individual assets. Any change to the Group's climate change strategy could impact these forecasts and the Group's significant judgements and key estimates.\n\nThe Group continues to invest, including in partnership with others, in emissions reduction projects and technology innovation and development in its value chain to support reductions to its total reported Scope 3 GHG emissions inventory, with a particular focus on steelmaking and maritime emissions. However, while we seek to influence, Scope 3 emissions occur outside of our direct control. Reduction pathways are dependent on the development, and upstream or downstream deployment of solutions and/ or supportive policy. Where possible, the financial impact of the Group's activities in support of Scope 3 reduction pathways is reflected in the financial statements, for example the Group's chartering of LNG-fuelled vessels. It is however currently not possible to reliably estimate or measure the full potential financial statement impacts of the Group's pursuit of its Scope 3 goals and targets.\n\nThe Climate Investment Program (CIP), as announced by the Group in July 2019, aims to invest at least US$400 million over the CIP's five-year life in emissions reduction projects across the Group's operated assets and value chain. Spend under the CIP, along with capital expenditure in support of operational decarbonisation at our operated assets, is recognised in the relevant year of spend.\n\n## Global transition signposts\n\nIn addition to the Group's targets and goals, significant judgements and key estimates are also impacted by the Group's current assessment of the range of economic and climate related conditions that could exist in transitioning to a low carbon economy, considering the current trajectory of society and the global economy as a whole. Signposts do not yet indicate that the appropriate measures are in place to drive decarbonisation at the pace or scale required for the Group to assess achieving the aims of the Paris Agreement as the most likely future outcome. However, as governments, institutions, companies and society increasingly focus on addressing climate change, the potential for a non-linear and/ or more rapid transition and the subsequent impact on threats and opportunities increases.\n\nThe BHP Climate Transition Action Plan 2021 references the Group's divergent climate scenarios across a range of temperature outcomes. The Group currently uses two of those scenarios, being the Central Energy View and Lower Carbon View 1 as inputs to the Group's operational planning cases. The use of these two scenarios reflects the Group's current estimates of the most likely range of future states for the global economy and associated sub-systems. These operational planning cases inform updates to the Group's supply, demand and price outlooks, capital allocation and portfolio decisions.\n\nGiven the complexity of climate modelling, these scenarios are reviewed periodically to reflect new information, with developments in the periods between scenario updates being reflected in updated internal long-term price outlooks.\n\nInvestment decisions and asset valuations also incorporate carbon price assumptions for major Group operational, competitor and customer countries. In determining the Group's forecast, factors such as a country's current and announced climate policies and targets and societal factors such as public acceptance and demographics are considered, with the Group forecasting the global range of regional carbon prices to reach between US$0-175/tCO2-e in FY2030 and US$10-250/tCO2-e in FY2050, and US$10-175/tCO2-e in FY2030 and US$100-250/tCO2-e in FY2050 in BHP's current major operational and market countries.\n\nThe operational planning cases, price outlooks and cost of carbon assumptions, impact certain significant judgements and key estimates, including the determination of the valuation of assets and potential impairment charges (notes 11 'Property, plant and equipment' and 13 'Impairment of non-current assets'), the estimation of the remaining useful economic life of assets for depreciation purposes (note 11 'Property, plant and equipment') and the timing of closure and rehabilitation activities (note 15 'Closure and rehabilitation provisions').\n\nIn addition to the operational planning cases, the Group utilises a range of scenarios, including its 1.5\u00b0C Paris-aligned scenario 2 , when testing the resilience of its portfolio, forming strategy and making investment decisions. While a 1.5\u00baC Paris-aligned scenario does not currently represent one of the inputs to the Group's operational planning cases, the Group has, during FY2022, systematically integrated the Group's 1.5\u00baC Paris-aligned scenario into the Group's strategy and capital allocation process to test the extent to which its capital allocation is aligned with a rapidly decarbonising global economy. Specifically, the Group applies the Group's 1.5\u00b0C Paris-aligned scenario to assess whether future demand for the Group's products under that scenario supports ongoing capital investment. The internal allocation of capital under the Group's Capital Allocation Framework and all major investment decisions now require an assessment of investment viability under the Group's 1.5\u00b0C Parisaligned scenario.\n\n- 1 Central Energy View reflects, and is periodically updated to respond to, existing policy trends and commitments. Lower Carbon View accelerates decarbonisation trends and policies, particularly in easier-to-abate sectors such as power generation and light duty vehicles. BHP's Climate Change Report 2020 describes these scenarios in more detail.\n- 2 This scenario aligns with the aims of the Paris Agreement and requires steep global annual emissions reduction, sustained for decades, to stay within a 1.5\u00b0C carbon budget. 1.5\u00b0C is above pre-industrial levels. BHP's Climate Change Report 2020 describes this scenario, including its assumptions, outputs and limitations, in more detail.",

        "page_content": "The Group continues to monitor global decarbonisation signposts and update its operational planning cases, price outlooks, and cost of carbon assumptions and assessments relating to strategy and capital allocation accordingly. Where such signposts indicate the appropriate measures are in place for achievement of a 1.5\u00baC Paris-aligned scenario, this will be reflected in the Group's operational planning cases.\n\n## Sensitivity to demand for the Group's commodities\n\nThe Group acknowledges that there are a range of possible energy transition scenarios, including those that are aligned with the aims of the Paris Agreement, that may indicate different outcomes for individual commodities. The resilience of the Group's portfolio to a 1.5\u00b0C Parisaligned scenario (the Group's 1.5\u00b0C Paris-aligned scenario) continues to be considered, including the impact of Paris-aligned commodity price estimates under that scenario on the Group's latest asset plans.\n\nThere are inherent limitations with scenario analysis and it is difficult to predict which, if any, of the scenarios might eventuate and none of the scenarios considered constitutes a definitive outcome for the Group.\n\nHowever, the long-term commodity price estimates under the Group's 1.5\u00b0C Paris-aligned scenario reflect the world needing around twice as much steel, copper and potash and four times as much nickel in the next 30 years as in the last 30. In addition, the Group's portfolio is transitioning towards higher quality iron ore and metallurgical coal that enable steelmakers to be more efficient and operate with a lower emissions intensity.\n\nAs such, although all potential financial reporting consequences under the Group's 1.5\u00b0C Paris-aligned scenario are currently impracticable to fully assess, the long-term commodity price outlooks under this scenario for iron ore, copper, metallurgical coal, nickel and potash are either largely consistent with or favourable to the price outlooks in the Group's current operational planning cases.\n\nGiven the positive long-term price outlooks for these commodities, the Group currently considers that a material adverse change is not expected to the valuation, and remaining useful life, of assets and discounting of closure and rehabilitation provisions for assets relating to these commodities under its 1.5\u00b0C Paris-aligned scenario.\n\nWhile energy coal long-term commodity price outlooks under the Group's 1.5\u00b0C Paris-aligned scenario are unfavourable when compared to the price outlooks in the Group's current operational planning cases, following impairments recognised in FY2021, the carrying value of assets at the Group's remaining energy coal operations at NSWEC is no longer material.\n\nFurther, the Group's closure provision for NSWEC reflects the announcement in FY2022 of the Group's plans to seek approvals to continue mining at NSWEC beyond its current mining consent that expires in 2026 and intention to proceed with a managed process to cease mining at NSWEC by the end of FY2030. While the closure provision remains subject to estimation and assumptions, the timing of closure is no longer considered materially susceptible to the long-term impacts of climate change.\n\n## Physical risks\n\nThe Group is progressing work to assess the potential impact of physical risks of climate change in line with the Group's Risk Management Framework. In FY2022, the Group conducted a physical risk identification process that prioritised key potential climate hazards for more detailed analysis including, for example, risks associated with higher sea levels disrupting port operations and extreme rainfall impacting the stability of tailings storage facilities. Given the ongoing nature of the Group's physical risk assessment process, inclusion of adaptation risk in the Group's operating plans, and associated asset valuations, is currently limited. As the Group progresses its adaptation strategy, including risk evaluations planned for FY2023, the identification of additional risks or the detailed development of the Group's response may result in material changes to financial results and the carrying values of assets and liabilities in future reporting periods.\n\nOperating and Financial Review\n\n<!-- image -->",

Following that announcement, the Group's Petroleum business no longer meets the reporting segment recognition criteria as outlined in IFRS 8/AASB 8 'Operating segments' and therefore does not form part of the reportable segments. Comparative periods have been adjusted for the effects of applying IFRS 5/AASB 5 'Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations' to disclose the Group's Petroleum business on the same basis as the current period.\n\nGroup and unallocated items includes functions, other unallocated operations including Potash, Nickel West and legacy assets, and consolidation adjustments.

Revenue is recognised when or as control of the promised goods or services passes to the customer. In most instances, control passes when the goods are delivered to a destination specified by the customer, typically on board the customer's appointed vessel. Revenue from the provision of services is recognised over time as the services are provided, but does not represent a significant proportion of total revenue and is aggregated with the respective asset and product revenue for disclosure purposes.\n\nThe amount of revenue recognised reflects the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services.\n\nWhere the Group's sales are provisionally priced, the final price depends on future index prices. The amount of revenue initially recognised is based on the relevant forward market price. Adjustments between the provisional and final price are accounted for under IFRS 9/AASB 9 'Financial Instruments' (IFRS 9), separately recorded as other revenue and presented as part of the total revenue of each asset. The period between provisional pricing and final invoicing is typically between 60 and 120 days.\n\nRevenue from the sale of significant by-products is included within revenue. Where a by-product is not significant, revenue is credited against costs.\n\nThe Group applies the practical expedient to not adjust the expected consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the period between the delivery and when the customer pays for the promised good or service is one year or less.\n\nThe Group applies the practical expedient not to disclose information relating to unfulfilled performance obligations, either due to the expected duration of the contract term being one year or less, or for longer term contracts, because the entity has a right to consideration (and can recognise revenue) for goods delivered.",

While these tax assets remained with the Group following the merger of the Group's oil and gas portfolio with Woodside, the impairment charge reflects the extent of other currently forecast future earnings against which the assets can be recovered.\n\n## Corporate structure unification costs\n\nThe Group incurred transaction costs associated with the unification of the Group corporate structure under its existing Australian parent company, BHP Group Limited, which was completed on 31 January 2022. Refer note 16 'Share capital' for further information.\n\n## BHP Mitsui Coal (BMC) gain on disposal\n\nOn 3 May 2022 the Group sold its 80 per cent interest in BHP Mitsui Coal Pty Ltd (BMC) to Stanmore SMC Holdings Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Stanmore Resources Limited (Stanmore Resources).\n\nStanmore Resources paid US$1.1 billion cash consideration at completion plus a preliminary completion adjustment of US$218 million for working capital. US$100 million in cash remains payable in six months on 3 November 2022 with potential for an additional amount of up to US$150 million (US$122 million discounted) in a price-linked earnout payable in the 2024 calendar year.",

In addition, the Group recognised an impairment charge of US$470 million (after tax) for Cerrej\u00f3n, reflecting the expected net sales proceeds.",

This reflects the decision taken by the Group to reduce Cerro Colorado's throughput for the remaining period of its current environmental licence, which expires at the end of CY2023.\n\n## 4  Significant events - Samarco dam failure\n\nOn 5 November 2015, the Samarco Minera\u00e7\u00e3o S.A. (Samarco) iron ore operation in Minas Gerais, Brazil, experienced a tailings dam failure that resulted in a release of mine tailings, flooding the communities of Bento Rodrigues, Gesteira and Paracatu and impacting other communities downstream (the Samarco dam failure). Refer to section on 'Samarco' in the Operating and Financial Review.\n\nSamarco is jointly owned by BHP Billiton Brasil Ltda (BHP Brasil) and Vale S.A. (Vale). BHP Brasil's 50 per cent interest is accounted for as an equity accounted joint venture investment. BHP Brasil does not separately recognise its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of Samarco, but instead records the investment as one line on the balance sheet. Each period, BHP Brasil recognised its 50 per cent share of Samarco's profit or loss and adjusted the carrying value of the investment in Samarco accordingly. Such adjustment continued until the investment carrying value was reduced to US$ nil, with any additional share of Samarco losses only recognised to the extent that BHP Brasil has an obligation to fund the losses. After applying equity accounting, any remaining carrying value of the investment is tested for impairment.\n\nAny charges relating to the Samarco dam failure incurred directly by BHP Brasil or other BHP entities are recognised 100 per cent in the Group's results.\n\nOperating and Financial Review\n\n<!-- image -->",

Key Programs include those for financial assistance and compensation of impacted persons, including fisherfolk impacted by the dam failure, and those for remediation of impacted areas and resettlement of impacted communities. A committee (Interfederative Committee) comprising representatives from the Brazilian Federal and State Governments, local municipalities, environmental agencies, impacted communities and Public Defence Office oversees the activities of the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova in order to monitor, guide and assess the progress of actions agreed in the Framework Agreement. In addition, the 12th Federal Court is supervising the work of the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova and the Court's decisions, including decisions relating to the scope of individuals eligible for compensation and the amount of damages to which they are entitled, have been considered in the Samarco dam failure provision change in estimate. Any future decisions will be analysed for impacts on the provision at the time of any decision and the provision may be impacted in future reporting periods as a result of appeals and motions for clarification on certain Court decisions that remain outstanding.\n\nThe term of the Framework Agreement is 15 years, renewable for periods of one year successively until all obligations under the Framework Agreement have been performed. Under the Framework Agreement, Samarco has primary responsibility for funding Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's annual calendar year budget for the duration of the Framework Agreement. The funding amounts for each calendar year will be dependent on the remediation and compensation projects to be undertaken in a particular year. Annual contributions may be reviewed under the Framework Agreement. To the extent that Samarco does not meet its funding obligations, each of BHP Brasil and Vale have secondary funding obligations under the Framework Agreement in proportion to their 50 per cent shareholding in Samarco.\n\nSamarco began to gradually recommence operations in December 2020, however, there remains significant uncertainty regarding Samarco's long-term cash flow generation and the outcome of the Judicial Reorganisation (outlined below). In light of these uncertainties and based on currently available information, BHP Brasil's provision for its obligations under the Framework Agreement Programs is US$3.2 billion before tax and after discounting at 30 June 2022 (30 June 2021: US$2.6 billion). The dam failure provision at 30 June 2022 reflects only the Group's estimate of the costs to be incurred in completing those Programs, as the Group is unable to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of other existing or potential future claims (refer to contingent liabilities below).\n\nUnder a Governance Agreement ratified on 8 August 2018, BHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale were to establish a process to renegotiate the Programs over two years to progress settlement of the R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) Federal Public Prosecution Office claim (described below). Pre-requisites established in the Governance Agreement, for re-negotiation of the Framework Agreement, were not implemented during the two year period and on 30 September 2020, Brazilian Federal and State prosecutors and public defenders filed a request for the immediate resumption of the R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) claim, which was suspended from the date of ratification of the Governance Agreement. Formal suspension of the claim ceased on 10 December 2021, however no further rulings have been made.\n\nBHP Brasil, Samarco, Vale and Federal and State prosecutors have been engaging in negotiations to seek a definitive and substantive settlement of the obligations under the Framework Agreement and the R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) Federal Public Prosecution Office claim. The negotiations are overseen by the President of the National Council of Justice, as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in Brazil and are expected to continue until at least the expected end of the term of the current President on 31 August 2022. Outcomes of the negotiations are highly uncertain and, until any revisions to the Programs are agreed, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova will continue to implement the Programs in accordance with the terms of the Framework Agreement and the Governance Agreement.\n\nBHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale are required to maintain security of an amount equal to the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's annual budget up to a limit of R$2.2 billion (approximately US$420 million). The security currently comprises R$1.3 billion (approximately US$250 million) in insurance bonds and a charge of R$800 million (approximately US$150 million) over Samarco's assets. A further R$100 million (approximately US$20 million) in liquid assets previously maintained as security was released for COVID-19 related response efforts in Brazil.\n\n## Samarco Germano dam decommissioning\n\nSamarco is currently progressing plans for the accelerated decommissioning of its upstream tailings dams (the Germano dam complex). Given the uncertainties surrounding Samarco's long-term cash flow generation, BHP Brasil's provision for a 50 per cent share of the expected Germano decommissioning costs is US$184 million (30 June 2021: US$232 million). The decommissioning is progressing, however further engineering work and required validation by Brazilian authorities could lead to changes to estimates in future reporting periods.\n\nOperating and Financial Review",

        "page_content": "## 4  Significant events - Samarco dam failure continued\n\n## Key judgements and estimates\n\nJudgements: The outcomes of litigation are inherently difficult to predict and significant judgement has been applied in assessing the likely outcome of legal claims and determining which legal claims require recognition of a provision or disclosure of a contingent liability. The facts and circumstances relating to these cases are regularly evaluated in determining whether a provision for any specific claim is required.\n\nManagement has determined that a provision can only be recognised for obligations under the Framework Agreement and Samarco Germano dam decommissioning as at 30 June 2022. It is not yet possible to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential future exposures to BHP in connection to the contingent liabilities noted below, given their status.\n\nEstimates: The provision for the Samarco dam failure currently only reflects the Group's estimate of the remaining costs to complete Programs under the Framework Agreement and requires the use of significant judgements, estimates and assumptions. Based on current estimates, it is expected that approximately 95 per cent of remaining costs for Programs under the Framework Agreement will be incurred by December 2024.\n\nWhile the provision has been measured based on the latest information available, changes in facts and circumstances are likely in future reporting periods and may lead to material revisions to these estimates. However, it is currently not possible to determine what facts and circumstances may change, therefore revisions in future reporting periods due to the key estimates and factors outlined below cannot be reliably measured.\n\nThe key estimates that may have a material impact on the provision in the next and future reporting periods include the:\n\n- -  number of people eligible for financial assistance and compensation and the corresponding amount of expected compensation\n- -  costs to complete key infrastructure programs\n\nThe provision may also be affected by factors including but not limited to:\n\n- -  potential changes in scope of work and funding amounts required under the Framework Agreement including the impact of the decisions of the Interfederative Committee along with further technical analysis, community participation required under the Governance Agreement and rulings made by the 12th Federal Court\n- -  the outcome of ongoing negotiations with State and Federal Prosecutors, including review of Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's Programs as provided in the Governance Agreement\n- -  actual costs incurred\n- -  resolution of uncertainty in respect of the nature and extent of Samarco's long-term cash generation\n- -  updates to discount and foreign exchange rates\n- -  the outcomes of Samarco's judicial reorganisation\n\nIn addition, the provision may be impacted by decisions in, or resolution of, existing and potential legal claims in Brazil and other jurisdictions, including the outcome of the United Kingdom group action complaint and the negotiations seeking a definitive and substantive settlement of the obligations under the Framework Agreement and the R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) Federal Public Prosecution Office claim.\n\nOutcomes of the negotiations are highly uncertain and it is therefore not possible to provide a reliable estimate of potential outcomes.\n\nGiven these factors, future actual cash outflows may differ from the amounts currently provided and changes to any of the key assumptions and estimates outlined above could result in a material impact to the provision in the next and future reporting periods.\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nThe following matters are disclosed as contingent liabilities and given the status of these matters it is not possible to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential future exposures for BHP, unless otherwise stated. A number of the claims below have not specified the amount of damages sought and, where this is specified, amounts could change as the matter progresses. Ultimately, all the legal matters disclosed as contingent liabilities could have a material adverse impact on BHP's business, competitive position, cash flows, prospects, liquidity and shareholder returns.\n\n## Federal Public Prosecution Office claim\n\nBHP Brasil is among the defendants named in a claim brought by the Federal Public Prosecution Office on 3 May 2016, seeking R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) for reparation, compensation and moral damages in relation to the Samarco dam failure.\n\nThe 12th Federal Court previously suspended the Federal Public Prosecution Office claim, including a R$7.7 billion (approximately US$1.5 billion) injunction request. On 30 September 2020, Brazilian Federal and State prosecutors and public defenders filed a request for the immediate resumption of the R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) claim, which was suspended since the date of ratification of the Governance Agreement. Formal suspension of the claim ceased on 10 December 2021, however no further rulings have been made.\n\nBHP Brasil, Samarco, Vale and Federal and State prosecutors have been engaging in negotiations to seek a definitive and substantive settlement of the obligations under the Framework Agreement and the R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) Federal Public Prosecution Office claim. The negotiations are overseen by the President of the National Council of Justice, as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in Brazil and are expected to continue until at least the expected end of the term of the current President on 31 August 2022. Outcomes of the negotiations are highly uncertain and it is therefore not possible to provide a reliable estimate of potential outcomes and there is a risk that a negotiated outcome may be materially higher than amounts currently reflected in the Samarco dam failure provision.\n\n## Australian class action complaint\n\nBHP Group Ltd is named as a defendant in a shareholder class action filed in the Federal Court of Australia on behalf of persons who acquired shares in BHP Group Ltd on the Australian Securities Exchange or shares in BHP Group Plc on the London Stock Exchange and Johannesburg Stock Exchange in periods prior to the Samarco dam failure. The amount of damages sought is unspecified.\n\n## United Kingdom group action complaint\n\nBHP Group Plc and BHP Group Ltd were named as defendants in group action claims for damages filed in the courts of England. These claims were filed on behalf of certain individuals, governments, businesses and communities in Brazil allegedly impacted by the Samarco dam failure. The amount of damages sought in these claims is unspecified. In August 2019, the BHP parties filed a preliminary application to strike out or stay this action on jurisdictional and other procedural grounds. That application was successful before the High Court and the action was dismissed. However, on 8 July 2022, the Court of Appeal reversed the dismissal decision and allowed the action to proceed in England. BHP Group Ltd and BHP Group (UK) Ltd (formerly BHP Group Plc) will seek permission to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.\n\n## Criminal charges\n\nThe Federal Prosecutors' Office has filed criminal charges against BHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale and certain employees and former employees of BHP Brasil (Affected Individuals) in the Federal Court of Ponte Nova, Minas Gerais. On 3 March 2017, BHP Brasil filed its preliminary defences. The Federal Court terminated the charges against eight of the Affected Individuals. The Federal Prosecutors' Office has appealed seven of those decisions with hearings of the appeals still pending. BHP Brasil rejects outright the charges against the company and the Affected Individuals and is defending itself from all charges while fully supporting each of the Affected Individuals in their defence of the charges.",

        "page_content": "## 4  Significant events - Samarco dam failure continued\n\n## Civil public action commenced by Associations concerning the use of Tanfloc for water treatment\n\nThe Vila Lenira Residents Association, State of Esp\u00edrito Santo Rural Producers and Artisans Association, Colatina Velha Neighborhood Residents Association, and United for the Progress of Palmeiras Neighborhood Association have filed a lawsuit against Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale and others, including the State of Minas Gerais, the State of Espirito Santo and the Federal Government. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants carried out a clandestine study on the citizens of the locations affected by the Fund\u00e3o's Dam Failure, using TANFLOC - a tannin-based flocculant/coagulant - that is currently used for wastewater treatment applications. The plaintiffs claim that this product allegedly put the population at risk due to its alleged experimental qualities.\n\nThe plaintiffs are seeking multiple kinds of relief - material damage, moral damages, loss of profits - and that the defendants should pay for water supply in all locations where there is no water source other than the Doce River.\n\nOn 25 July 2022, Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale presented their defences individually, as well as the State of Minas Gerais, the State of Esp\u00edrito Santo and the Federal Government. The Court's decision is still pending.\n\n## Other claims\n\nBHP Brasil is among the companies named as defendants in a number of legal proceedings initiated by individuals, non-governmental organisations, corporations and governmental entities in Brazilian Federal and State courts following the Samarco dam failure. The other defendants include Vale, Samarco and Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova. The lawsuits include claims for compensation, environmental reparation and violations of Brazilian environmental and other laws, among other matters. The lawsuits seek various remedies including reparation costs, compensation to injured individuals and families of the deceased, recovery of personal and property losses, moral damages and injunctive relief. In addition, government inquiries and investigations relating to the Samarco dam failure have been commenced by numerous agencies of the Brazilian government and are ongoing.\n\nAdditional lawsuits and government investigations relating to the Samarco dam failure could be brought against BHP Brasil and possibly other BHP entities in Brazil or other jurisdictions.\n\n## BHP insurance\n\nBHP has various third party general liability and directors and officers insurances for claims related to the Samarco dam failure made directly against BHP Brasil or other BHP entities, their directors and officers, including class actions. External insurers have been notified of the Samarco dam failure along with the third party claims and class actions referred to above. In the period since the dam failure, the Group has recognised US$573 million other income from general liability insurance proceeds related to the dam failure. Recoveries related to general liability insurance are now considered complete.\n\nAs at 30 June 2022, an insurance receivable has not been recognised for any potential recoveries in respect of ongoing matters.\n\n## Commitments\n\nUnder the terms of the Samarco joint venture agreement, BHP Brasil does not have an existing obligation to fund Samarco.\n\nBHP has agreed to fund a total of up to US$1,350 million for the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova programs and Samarco's working capital during calendar year 2022. Samarco's cash flow generation in the period was sufficient to fund its working capital and the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova programs, as such no funding was provided by the Group in the six months to 30 June 2022. Any additional requests for funding or future investment provided would be subject to a future decision by BHP, accounted for at that time.\n\nOperating and Financial Review\n\n## Samarco judicial reorganisation\n\nSamarco filed for Judicial Reorganisation (JR) in April 2021, with the Commercial Courts of Belo Horizonte, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil (JR Court), after multiple enforcement actions taken by certain financial creditors of Samarco which threatened Samarco's operations. The JR Court granted a stay of the enforcement actions in Brazil until 15 October 2022.\n\nThe JR is an insolvency proceeding that provides a means for Samarco to seek to restructure its financial debts and establish a sustainable financial position that allows Samarco to, among other things, continue to rebuild its operations and strengthen its ability to meet its Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova funding obligations. Samarco's operations have continued during the JR proceeding.\n\nAccording to the list of creditors filed with the JR Court by the Judicial Administrators (who are in charge of a first review of the list of creditors filed by Samarco), Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's funding obligations undertaken by Samarco are not subject to the JR, although some financial creditors of Samarco have objected to this position. Some such creditors filed challenges to the list of creditors filed by the Judicial Administrators, in order to, among other things, prevent Samarco from funding Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova. In December 2021, the 12th Federal Court granted BHP Brasil's request that Samarco be able to fund Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova obligations, overturning a temporary injunction against such funding previously granted by the State Court in October 2021. BHP Brasil also obtained a preliminary injunction from the Superior Court supporting the jurisdiction of the 12th Federal Court, and not the State Court, in this matter. An appeal against this ruling by certain financial creditors is still to be ruled upon. Samarco has, with the support of BHP Brasil and Vale, continued to meet its Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova funding obligations.\n\nIn April 2022, Samarco presented a restructure proposal for voting at a meeting of its creditors under the JR proceeding, which was rejected by certain of the Samarco financial creditors. Certain Samarco creditors, including a group of financial creditors and Samarco's employee unions then proposed alternative restructure proposals. Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale subsequently each filed objections with the JR Court to both the voting process regarding the rejection of the Samarco proposal and the restructure proposal filed by a group of financial creditors. These legal disputes, and others in the JR process, have yet to be ruled on by the JR Court.\n\nIt is expected that there will be continuing litigation from creditors against Samarco and its shareholders over the course of the JR proceeding, including with respect to the treatment of Samarco's Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renovarelated obligations and attempts to pierce Samarco's corporate veil to hold BHP Brasil and Vale liable for Samarco's debts. The duration and outcome of the JR remains uncertain with the potential for protracted litigation and appeals because, among other things, the Samarco JR is occurring under new and untested Brazilian bankruptcy legislation.\n\nWhile the JR is not expected to affect Samarco's obligation or commitment to make full redress for the 2015 Fund\u00e3o dam failure, and is not expected to impact Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's ability to undertake that remediation and compensation, it is not possible to determine the outcomes of the JR or reliably estimate any impact that the reorganisation may have for BHP Brasil, including its share of the Samarco dam failure provisions.",

        "page_content": "## 4  Significant events - Samarco dam failure continued\n\nThe following section includes disclosure required by IFRS of Samarco's provisions, contingencies and other matters arising from the dam failure for matters in addition to the above-mentioned claims to which Samarco is a party.\n\n## Samarco\n\n## Dam failure related provisions and contingencies\n\nIn addition to its obligations under the Framework Agreement as at 30 June 2022, Samarco has recognised provisions of US$0.3 billion (30 June 2021: US$0.2 billion), based on currently available information. The magnitude, scope and timing of these additional costs are subject to a high degree of uncertainty and Samarco has indicated that it anticipates that it will incur future costs beyond those provided. These uncertainties are likely to continue for a significant period and changes to key assumptions could result in a material change to the amount of the provision in future reporting periods. Any such unrecognised obligations are therefore contingent liabilities and, at present, it is not practicable to estimate their magnitude or possible timing of payment. Accordingly, it is also not possible to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of total potential future exposures at this time.\n\nSamarco is also named as a defendant in a number of other legal proceedings initiated by individuals, non-governmental organisations, corporations and governmental entities in Brazilian Federal and State courts following the Samarco dam failure. The lawsuits include claims for compensation, environmental rehabilitation and violations of Brazilian environmental and other laws, among other matters. The lawsuits seek various remedies including rehabilitation costs, compensation to injured individuals and families of the deceased, recovery of personal and property losses, moral damages and injunctive relief. In addition, government inquiries and investigations relating to the Samarco dam failure have been commenced by numerous agencies of the Brazilian government and are ongoing. Given the status of proceedings it is not possible to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of total potential future exposures to Samarco.\n\nAdditional lawsuits and government investigations relating to the Samarco dam failure could be brought against Samarco.\n\n## Samarco insurance\n\nSamarco has standalone insurance policies in place with Brazilian and global insurers. Insurers' loss adjusters or claims representatives continue to investigate and assist with the claims process for matters not yet settled. As at 30 June 2022, an insurance receivable has not been recognised by Samarco in respect of ongoing matters.\n\n## Samarco commitments\n\nAt 30 June 2022, Samarco has commitments of US$0.7 billion (30 June 2021: US$0.7 billion). Following the dam failure Samarco invoked force majeure clauses in a number of long-term contracts with suppliers and service providers to suspend contractual obligations.\n\n## Samarco non-dam failure related contingent liabilities\n\nThe following non-dam failure related contingent liabilities pre-date and are unrelated to the Samarco dam failure. Samarco is currently contesting both of these matters in the Brazilian courts. Given the status of these tax matters, the timing of resolution and potential economic outflow for Samarco is uncertain.\n\n## Brazilian Social Contribution Levy\n\nSamarco has received tax assessments for the alleged non-payment of Brazilian Social Contribution Levy for the calendar years 2007-2014 totalling approximately R$6.2 billion (approximately US$1.2 billion).\n\n## Brazilian corporate income tax rate\n\nSamarco has received tax assessments for alleged incorrect calculation of Corporate Income Tax (IRPJ) in respect of the 2000-2003 and 20072014 income years totalling approximately R$4.8 billion (approximately US$0.9 billion).",

Refer to note 3 'Exceptional items' for further information.\n- 4 During FY2022, the Group received dividends of US$238 million from Cerrej\u00f3n, which reduced completion proceeds net of transaction costs to US$50 million. Refer to note 29 'Investments accounted for using the equity method' for details.\n- 5 Other income is generally income earned from transactions outside the course of the Group's ordinary activities and may include certain management fees from noncontrolling interests and joint arrangements, royalties and commission income.\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nOther income is recognised when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with a transaction will flow to the Group and can be reliably measured. Dividend income is recognised upon declaration.",

Application of tax law can be complex and requires judgement to assess risk and estimate outcomes, particularly in relation to the Group's cross-border operations and transactions. These judgements are subject to risk and uncertainty, hence there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will alter expectations, which may impact the amount of tax assets and tax liabilities, including deferred tax, recognised on the balance sheet and the amount of other tax losses and temporary differences not yet recognised. The evaluation of tax risks considers both amended assessments received and potential sources of challenge from tax authorities. The status of proceedings for these matters will impact the ability to determine the potential exposure and in some cases, it may not be possible to determine a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of the potential exposure.\n\nThe Group has unresolved tax and royalty matters for which the timing of resolution and potential economic outflow are uncertain. Tax and royalty matters with uncertain outcomes arise in the normal course of business and occur due to changes in tax law, changes in interpretation of tax law, periodic challenges and disagreements with tax authorities and legal proceedings.\n\nTax and royalty obligations assessed as having probable future economic outflows capable of reliable measurement are provided for as at 30 June 2022. Matters with a possible economic outflow and/or presently incapable of being measured reliably are contingent liabilities and disclosed in note 32 'Contingent liabilities'. Details of uncertain tax and royalty matters relating to Samarco are disclosed in note 4 'Significant events - Samarco dam failure'.\n\n## Key judgements and estimates\n\n## Income tax classification\n\nJudgements: The Group's accounting policy for taxation, including royalty-related taxation, requires management's judgement as to the types of arrangements considered to be a tax on income in contrast to an operating cost.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nJudgements: Judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are recognised based on the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits. Judgement is applied in recognising deferred tax liabilities arising from temporary differences in investments. These deferred tax liabilities caused principally by retained earnings held in foreign tax jurisdictions are recognised unless repatriation of retained earnings can be controlled and is not expected to occur in the foreseeable future.\n\nEstimates: The Group assesses the recoverability of recognised and unrecognised deferred taxes, including losses in Australia, the United States and Canada on a consistent basis. Estimates and assumptions relating to projected earnings and cash flows as applied in the Group impairment process are used for operating assets.\n\nOperating and Financial Review\n\n<!-- image -->",

Effective from 31 January 2022, the aggregate of the weighted average number of ordinary shares of only BHP Group Limited is considered in the computation of basic earnings per share. Refer to note 16 'Share capital' for details on unification.\n\nFor the purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, the effect of 10 million dilutive shares has been taken into account for the year ended 30 June 2022 (2021: 11 million shares; 2020: 12 million shares). The Group's only potential dilutive ordinary shares are share awards granted under the employee share ownership plans for which terms and conditions are described in note 25 'Employee share ownership plans'. Diluted earnings per share calculation excludes instruments which are considered antidilutive.\n\nAt 30 June 2022, there are no instruments which are considered antidilutive (2021: nil; 2020: nil).",

Trade receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less an allowance for impairment, except for provisionally priced receivables which are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss under IFRS 9.\n\nThe collectability of trade and other receivables is assessed continuously. At the reporting date, specific allowances are made for any expected credit losses based on a review of all outstanding amounts at reporting period-end. Individual receivables are written off when management deems them unrecoverable. The net carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair values.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nTrade receivables generally have terms of less than 30 days. The Group has no material concentration of credit risk with any single counterparty and is not dominantly exposed to any individual industry.\n\nCredit risk can arise from the non-performance by counterparties of their contractual financial obligations towards the Group. To manage credit risk, the Group maintains Group-wide procedures covering the application for credit approvals, granting and renewal of counterparty limits, proactive monitoring of exposures against these limits and requirements triggering secured payment terms. As part of these processes, the credit exposures with all counterparties are regularly monitored and assessed on a timely basis. The credit quality of the Group's customers is reviewed and the solvency of each debtor and their ability to pay the receivable is considered in assessing receivables for impairment.\n\nThe 10 largest customers represented 34 per cent (2021: 31 per cent) of total credit risk exposures managed by the Group.\n\nReceivables are deemed to be past due or impaired in accordance with the Group's terms and conditions. These terms and conditions are determined on a case-by-case basis with reference to the customer's credit quality, payment performance and prevailing market conditions. As at 30 June 2022, trade receivables of US$103 million (2021: US$68 million) were past due but not impaired. The majority of these receivables were less than 30 days overdue.\n\nAt 30 June 2022, trade receivables are stated net of provisions for expected credit losses of US$3 million (2021: US$3 million).\n\n## 9  Trade and other payables\n\n|                | 2022   US$M   | 2021   US$M   |\n|----------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Trade payables | 5,360         | 5,079         |\n| Other payables | 1,327         | 1,948         |\n| Total          | 6,687         | 7,027         |\n| Comprising:    |               |               |\n| Current        | 6,687         | 7,027         |\n| Non-current    | -             | -             |\n\n## 10 Inventories\n\n|                               | 2022   US$M   | 2021   US$M   | Definitions                                                                                                                                                             |\n|-------------------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Raw materials and consumables | 1,713         | 1,904         | Spares, consumables and other supplies yet to be utilised in the production process or  in the rendering of services.                                                   |\n| Work in progress              | 3,827         | 3,046         | Commodities currently in the production process that require further processing by the  Group to a saleable form.                                                       |\n| Finished goods                | 710           | 834           | Commodities ready-for-sale and not requiring further processing by the Group.                                                                                           |\n| Total 1                       | 6,250         | 5,784         |                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Comprising:                   |               |               | Inventories classified as non-current are not expected to be utilised or sold within 12  months after the reporting date or within the operating cycle of the business. |\n| Current                       | 4,935         | 4,426         | Inventories classified as non-current are not expected to be utilised or sold within 12  months after the reporting date or within the operating cycle of the business. |\n| Non-current                   | 1,315         | 1,358         | Inventories classified as non-current are not expected to be utilised or sold within 12  months after the reporting date or within the operating cycle of the business. |\n\nOperating and Financial Review\n\n<!-- image -->",

Cost is determined primarily on the basis of average costs and involves estimates of expected metal recoveries and work in progress volumes, calculated using available industry, engineering and scientific data. These estimates are periodically reassessed by the Group taking into account technical analysis and historical performance.\n\nFor processed inventories, cost is derived on an absorption costing basis. Cost comprises costs of purchasing raw materials and costs of production, including attributable mining and manufacturing overheads taking into consideration normal operating capacity.\n\nInventory quantities are assessed primarily through surveys and assays.\n\n## Resource assets\n\n## 11  Property, plant and equipment\n\n|                                                          | Land and  buildings  US$M   | Plant and  equipment  US$M   | Other mineral  assets   US$M   | Assets under  construction  US$M   | Exploration  and evaluation  US$M   | Total   US$M   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|\n| Net book value -

Cost is the fair value of consideration given to acquire the asset at the time of its acquisition or construction and includes the direct costs of bringing the asset to the location and the condition necessary for operation and the estimated future costs of closure and rehabilitation of the facility.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. Refer to note 21 'Leases' for further details. Right-of-use assets are presented within the category of property, plant and equipment according to the nature of the underlying asset leased.\n\n## Exploration and evaluation\n\nExploration costs are incurred to discover mineral resources. Evaluation costs are incurred to assess the technical feasibility and commercial viability of resources found.\n\nExploration and evaluation expenditure is charged to the income statement as incurred, except in the following circumstances in which case the expenditure may be capitalised:\n\n- -  the exploration and evaluation activity is within an area of interest that was previously acquired as an asset acquisition or in a business combination and measured at fair value on acquisition or\n- -  the existence of a commercially viable mineral deposit has been established",

Capitalised costs are only carried forward to the extent that they are expected to be recovered through the successful exploitation of the area of interest or alternatively by its sale. To the extent that capitalised expenditure is no longer expected to be recovered, it is charged to the income statement.\n\n## Development expenditure\n\nWhen proven mineral reserves are determined and development is sanctioned, capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is reclassified as assets under construction within property, plant and equipment. All subsequent development expenditure is capitalised and classified as assets under construction, provided commercial viability conditions continue to be satisfied.\n\nThe Group may use funds sourced from external parties to finance the acquisition and development of assets and operations. Finance costs are expensed as incurred, except where they relate to the financing of construction or development of qualifying assets. Borrowing costs directly attributable to acquiring or constructing a qualifying asset are capitalised during the development phase. Development expenditure is net of proceeds from the saleable material extracted during the development phase. On completion of development, all assets included in assets under construction are reclassified as either plant and equipment or other mineral assets and depreciation commences.\n\n## Other mineral assets\n\nOther mineral assets comprise:\n\n- -  capitalised exploration, evaluation and development expenditure for assets in production\n- -  mineral rights acquired\n- -  capitalised development and production stripping costs\n\n## Overburden removal costs\n\nThe process of removing overburden and other waste materials to access mineral deposits is referred to as stripping. Stripping is necessary to obtain access to mineral deposits and occurs throughout the life of an open-pit mine. Development and production stripping costs are classified as other mineral assets in property, plant and equipment.\n\nStripping costs are accounted for separately for individual components of an ore body. The determination of components is dependent on the mine plan and other factors, including the size, shape and geotechnical aspects of an ore body. The Group accounts for stripping activities as follows:\n\n## Development stripping costs\n\nThese are initial overburden removal costs incurred to obtain access to mineral deposits that will be commercially produced. These costs are capitalised when it is probable that future economic benefits (access to mineral ores) will flow to the Group and costs can be measured reliably.\n\nOnce the production phase begins, capitalised development stripping costs are depreciated using the units of production method based on the proven and probable reserves of the relevant identified component of the ore body which the initial stripping activity benefits.\n\n## Production stripping costs\n\nThese are post initial overburden removal costs incurred during the normal course of production activity, which commences after the first saleable minerals have been extracted from the component.

The depreciation method and rates applied to specific assets reflect the pattern in which the asset's benefits are expected to be used by the Group. The Group's proved reserves for petroleum assets and proved and probable reserves for minerals assets are used to determine UoP depreciation unless doing so results in depreciation charges that do not reflect the asset's useful life. Where this occurs, alternative approaches to determining reserves are applied, such as using management's expectations of future oil and gas prices rather than yearly average prices, to provide a phasing of periodic depreciation charges that better reflects the asset's expected useful life.\n\nWhere assets are dedicated to a mine or petroleum lease, the useful lives below are subject to the lesser of the asset category's useful life and the life of the mine or petroleum lease, unless those assets are readily transferable to another productive mine or lease.\n\nAssets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell and therefore not depreciated. BMC and Petroleum were classified as held for sale since November 2021 and December 2021 respectively.\n\n## Key estimates\n\nThe determination of useful lives, residual values and depreciation methods involves estimates and assumptions and is reviewed annually. Any changes to useful lives or any other estimates or assumptions, including the expected impact of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon economy, may affect prospective depreciation rates and asset carrying values. The table below summarises the principal depreciation methods and rates applied to major asset categories by the Group.\n\n| Category                         | Buildings   | Plant and  equipment   | Mineral rights and   petroleum interests     | Capitalised exploration, evaluation and  development expenditure   |\n|----------------------------------|-------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Typical depreciation methodology | SL          | SL                     | UoP                                          | UoP                                                                |\n| Depreciation rate                | 25-50 years | 3-30 years             | Based on the rate of   depletion of reserves | Based on the rate of   depletion of reserves                       |\n\n## Commitments\n\nThe Group's commitments for capital expenditure were US$2,820 million as at 30 June 2022 (2021: US$2,469 million).

Refer to note 27 'Discontinued operations' for more information.\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\n## Goodwill\n\nWhere the fair value of the consideration paid for a business acquisition exceeds the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, the difference is treated as goodwill. Where consideration is less than the fair value of acquired net assets, the difference is recognised immediately in the income statement. Goodwill is not amortised and is measured at cost less any impairment losses.\n\n## Other intangibles\n\nThe Group capitalises amounts paid for the acquisition of identifiable intangible assets, such as software, licences and initial payments for the acquisition of mineral lease assets, where it is considered that they will contribute to future periods through revenue generation or reductions in cost. These assets, classified as finite life intangible assets, are carried in the balance sheet at the fair value of consideration paid (cost) less accumulated amortisation and impairment charges. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. The estimated useful lives are generally no greater than eight years.\n\nInitial payments for the acquisition of intangible mineral lease assets are capitalised and amortised over the term of the permit. A regular review is undertaken of each area of interest to determine the appropriateness of continuing to carry forward costs in relation to that area. Capitalised costs are only carried forward to the extent that they are expected to be recovered through the successful exploitation of the area of interest or alternatively by its sale. To the extent that capitalised expenditure is no longer expected to be recovered, it is charged to the income statement.\n\nAssets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell and therefore not amortised.",

Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs, being the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. If the carrying amount of the asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset or CGU is impaired and an impairment loss is charged to the income statement so as to reduce the carrying amount in the balance sheet to its recoverable amount.\n\nPreviously impaired assets (excluding goodwill as impairment losses are not reversed in subsequent periods) are reviewed for possible reversal of previous impairment at each reporting date. Impairment reversal cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or CGU. Such reversal is recognised in the income statement. There were no reversals of impairment in the current or prior year.\n\n## How recoverable amount is calculated\n\nThe recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or CGU's fair value less cost of disposal (FVLCD) and its value in use (VIU).\n\n## Fair value less cost of disposal\n\nFVLCD is an estimate of the amount that a market participant would pay for an asset or CGU, less the cost of disposal. FVLCD for mineral assets is generally determined using independent market assumptions to calculate the present value of the estimated future post-tax cash flows expected to arise from the continued use of the asset, including the anticipated cash flow effects of any capital expenditure to enhance production or reduce cost, and its eventual disposal where a market participant may take a consistent view. Cash flows are discounted using an appropriate post-tax market discount rate to arrive at a net present value of the asset, which is compared against the asset's carrying value. FVLCD may also take into consideration other marketbased indicators of fair value. FVLCD are based primarily on Level 3 inputs as defined in note 23 'Financial risk management' unless otherwise noted.\n\n## Value in use\n\nVIU is determined as the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continued use of the asset in its present form and its eventual disposal or closure. VIU is determined by applying assumptions specific to the Group's continued use and cannot take into account future development. These assumptions are different to those used in calculating FVLCD and consequently the VIU calculation is likely to give a different result (usually lower) to a FVLCD calculation.",

The impairment charge primarily relates to an increase in closure and rehabilitation provision at Cerro Colorado due to additional work required to re-profile waste dumps for closure and an increase in scope for the closure activities.\n\nImpairments of non-current assets relating to the year ended 30 June 2021 are detailed below.\n\n## Impairment of New South Wales Energy Coal\n\nThe Group recognised pre-tax impairment charges of US$1,057 million. The recoverable amount of negative US$300 million as at 30 June 2021 was determined using VIU methodology, applying discounted cash flow (DCF) techniques. The valuation for NSWEC was most sensitive to changes in energy coal prices, estimated future production volumes and discount rates. The valuation applied a post-tax real discount rate of 6.5 per cent.\n\n## Impairment of Cerrej\u03ccn\n\nThe Group recognised a pre-tax impairment charge of US$466 million. The recoverable amount of US$284 million as at 30 June 2021 represented a FVLCD based on the expected net sale proceeds.\n\n## Impairment of Potash assets\n\nThe Group recognised a pre-tax impairment charge of US$1,314 million. The recoverable amount of US$3.3 billion as at 30 June 2021 was determined using FVLCD methodology, applying DCF techniques.

        "page_content": "## 13  Impairment of non-current assets continued\n\n## Key judgements and estimates\n\nJudgements: Assessment of indicators of impairment or impairment reversal and the determination of CGUs for impairment purposes require significant management judgement.\n\nIndicators of impairment may include changes in the Group's operating and economic assumptions, including those arising from changes in reserves or mine planning, updates to the Group's commodity supply, demand and price forecasts, or the possible additional impacts from emerging risks including those related to climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy.\n\n## Climate change\n\nImpacts related to climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy may include:\n\n- -  demand for the Group's commodities decreasing, due to policy, regulatory (including carbon pricing mechanisms), legal, technological, market or societal responses to climate change, resulting in a proportion of a CGU's reserves becoming incapable of extraction in an economically viable fashion\n- -  physical impacts related to acute risks resulting from increased frequency or severity of extreme weather events, and those related to chronic risks resulting from longer-term changes in climate patterns\n\nThe Group's assessment of the potential impacts of climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy continues to mature. As outlined in the Basis of Preparation, where sufficiently developed, the potential financial impacts on the Group of climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy have been considered in the assessment of indicators of impairment, including:\n\n- -  the Group's current assumptions relating to demand for commodities and carbon pricing, including their impact on the Group's long-term price forecasts\n- -  the Group's operational emissions reduction strategy\n\nEstimates: The Group performs a recoverable amount determination for an asset or CGU when there is an indication of impairment or impairment reversal.\n\nWhen the recoverable amount is measured by reference to FVLCD, in the absence of quoted market prices or binding sale agreement, estimates are made regarding the present value of future post-tax cash flows. These estimates are made from the perspective of a market participant and include prices, future production volumes, operating costs, capital expenditure, closure and rehabilitation costs, taxes, risking factors applied to cash flows and discount rates. The cash flow forecasts may include net cash flows expected from the extraction, processing and sale of material that does not currently qualify for inclusion in ore reserves. Reserves and resources are included in the assessment of FVLCD to the extent that it is considered probable that a market participant would attribute value to them.\n\nWhen recoverable amount is measured using VIU, estimates are made regarding the present value of future cash flows based on internal budgets and forecasts and life of asset plans. Key estimates are similar to those identified for FVLCD, although some assumptions and values may differ as they reflect the perspective of management rather than a market participant.\n\nOperating and Financial Review\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll estimates require management judgements and assumptions and are subject to risk and uncertainty that may be beyond the control of the Group; hence, there is a possibility that changes in circumstances will materially alter projections, which may impact the recoverable amount of assets/CGUs at each reporting date. While no indicators of impairment, or impairment reversal, were identified across the Group's CGUs at 30 June 2022, with the exception of the Cerro Colorado CGU, the carrying value of the Spence CGU is the most susceptible to changes in the significant estimates outlined below in the next reporting period.\n\nThe significant estimates impacting the Group's recoverable amount determinations are:\n\n## Commodity prices\n\nCommodity prices were based on latest internal forecasts which assume short-term market prices will revert to the Group's assessment of long-term price. These price forecasts reflect management's long-term views of global supply and demand, built upon past experience of the commodity markets and are benchmarked with external sources of information such as analyst forecasts. Prices are adjusted based upon premiums or discounts applied to global price markers to reflect the location, nature and quality of the Group's production, or to take into account contracted prices.\n\n## Future production volumes\n\nEstimated production volumes were based on detailed data and took into account development plans established by management as part of the Group's long-term planning process. When estimating FVLCD, assumptions reflect all reserves and resources that a market participant would consider when valuing the respective CGU, which in some cases are broader in scope than the reserves that would be used in a VIU test. In determining FVLCD, risk factors may be applied to reserves and resources which do not meet the criteria to be treated as proved.\n\n## Cash outflows (including operating costs, capital expenditure, closure and rehabilitation costs and taxes)\n\nCash outflows are based on internal budgets and forecasts and life of asset plans. Cost assumptions reflect management experience and expectations. Tax assumptions reflect existing tax and royalty regimes and rates applicable in the jurisdiction of the CGU. In the case of FVLCD, cash flow projections include the anticipated cash flow effects of any capital expenditure to enhance production or reduce cost where a market participant may take a consistent view. VIU does not take into account future development.\n\n## Discount rates\n\nThe Group uses real post-tax discount rates applied to real post-tax cash flows. The discount rates are derived using the weighted average cost of capital methodology. Adjustments to the rates are made for any risks that are not reflected in the underlying cash flows, including country risk.",

The decrease from FY2021 is primarily attributable to the disposal of assets giving rise to these deferred tax assets as part of the merger of Petroleum with Woodside. For operating assets, the group assesses the recoverability of these deferred tax assets using estimates and assumptions relating to projected earnings and cash flows as applied in the Group impairment process for associated operations. Further information on the key judgements and estimates relating to the recognition of deferred tax assets is provided in note 6 'Income tax expense'.",

Where the Group has undistributed earnings held by associates and joint interests, the deferred tax liability will be recognised as there is no ability to control the timing of the potential distributions.\n\n- 4 The Group had deductible temporary differences relating to mineral rights for which deferred tax assets had not been recognised because it is not probable that future capital gains will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits. The deductible temporary differences do not expire under current tax legislation.\n- 5 The Group had other deductible temporary differences for which deferred tax assets had not been recognised because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits.

As such, the recognition and measurement of closure and rehabilitation provisions requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to:\n\n- -  the extent (due to legal or constructive obligations) of potential activities required for the removal of infrastructure, decharacterisation of tailings storage facilities and rehabilitation activities\n- -  costs associated with future closure activities\n- -  the extent and period of post-closure monitoring and maintenance, including water management\n- -  applicable discount rates\n- -  the timing of cash flows and ultimate closure of operations\n\nThe extent, cost and timing of future closure activities may also be impacted by the potential physical impacts of climate change. In estimating the potential cost of closure activities, the Group considers factors such as long-term weather outlooks, for example forecast changes in rainfall patterns. Closure cost estimates also consider the impact of the Group's energy transition strategy on the costs and timing of performing closure activities and the impact of new technology when appropriately developed and tested. For example, closure cost estimates largely continue to reflect the use of existing fuel sources for the Group's equipment while the Group continues to invest in the development of alternative fuel sources and fleet electrification.\n\nEstimates for post-closure monitoring and maintenance reflect the Group's strategies for individual sites, which may include possible relinquishment. The period of monitoring and maintenance included in the provision requires judgement and considers regulatory and licencing requirements, the outcomes of studies and management's current assessment of stakeholder expectations. As post-closure monitoring and maintenance may be required for significant periods beyond the completion of other closure activities, it is exposed to the potential longterm impacts of climate change, particularly changes in rainfall patterns. While reflecting management's current best estimate, the cost of postclosure monitoring and maintenance may change in future reporting periods as the understanding of, and potential long-term impacts from, climate change continue to evolve.\n\nWhile progressive closure is performed across a number of operations, significant activities are generally undertaken at the end of the production life at the individual sites, the estimated timing of which is informed by the Group's current assumptions relating to demand for commodities and carbon pricing, and their impact on the Group's long-term price forecasts.\n\nRemaining production lives range from 2-104 years (2021: 3-91 years). Given the generally shorter remaining operational lives of the Group's previously held Petroleum assets, the average remaining production life for all operating sites, weighted by current closure provision, has increased to approximately 29 years (2021: 27 years). The discount rates applied to the Group's closure and rehabilitation provisions are determined by reference to the currency of the closure cash flows, the period over which the cash flows will be incurred and prevailing market interest rates (where available). The Group continues to monitor current market conditions with no change made to the Group's discount rates in the current year.\n\nThe increase in closure and rehabilitation provisions relating to continuing operating sites reflects updates to the expected cost and timing of closure activities across the Group's portfolio, with the most significant increases in the year ended 30 June 2022 being at BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA) and Cerro Colorado.\n\nOperating and Financial Review\n\nFor BMA, the increase largely reflects a preliminary assessment of the potential impacts on BMA mine lives resulting from:\n\n- -  the significant increase in coal royalties applicable in Queensland from 1 July 2022\n- -  consideration of the Group's long-term outlook for metallurgical coal commodity prices, which reflects a range of drivers of commodity demand and supply, for example, the latest climate-related announcements from key market countries\n\nThese factors have resulted in the Group recognising that the end of operations at BMA sites may be earlier than previously anticipated. The best estimate of the impact on the estimated closure cash flows and their timing, and therefore the discounting of the provision, contributed to an increase in the provision, and associated rehabilitation asset, of approximately US$750 million. Given the timing of the announcement of the change to the Queensland coal royalty regime and the preliminary nature of the assessment, further changes to the provision may arise in future reporting periods.\n\nAt Cerro Colorado, additional work required to re-profile waste dumps for closure and an increase in scope for other closure activities have contributed to an increase in the closure provision of approximately US$400 million. As operations are ongoing at Cerro Colorado the increase has initially been capitalised. However, given the proximity to closure and the estimated future cash flows of Cerro Colorado the resulting rehabilitation asset has been impaired as outlined in note 13 'Impairment of non-current assets'.\n\nWhile the closure and rehabilitation provisions reflect management's best estimates based on current knowledge and information, further studies, trials and detailed analysis of relevant knowledge and resultant closure activities for individual assets continue to be performed throughout the life of asset. Such studies and analysis can impact the estimated costs of closure activities. Estimates can also be impacted by the emergence of new closure and rehabilitation techniques, changes in regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations for closure (including costs associated with equitable transition), development of new technologies, risks relating to climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy, and experience at other operations. These uncertainties may result in future actual expenditure differing from the amounts currently provided for in the balance sheet.\n\n## Sensitivity\n\nA 0.5 per cent increase in the discount rates applied at 30 June 2022 would result in a decrease to the closure and rehabilitation provision of approximately US$675 million, a decrease in property, plant and equipment of approximately US$490 million in relation to operating sites and an income statement credit of approximately US$185 million in respect of closed sites. In addition, the change would result in a decrease of approximately US$70 million to depreciation expense and a US$25 million increment in net finance costs for the year ending 30 June 2023.\n\nGiven the long-lived nature of the majority of the Group's assets, the majority of final closure activities are generally not expected to occur for a significant period of time.\n\nHowever, a one-year acceleration in forecast cash flows of the Group's closure and rehabilitation provisions, in isolation, would result in an increase to the provision of approximately US$185 million, an increase in property, plant and equipment of US$125 million in relation to operating sites and an income statement charge of US$60 million in respect of closed sites.",

While these liabilities are included in the Group interest bearing liabilities, they are excluded from the net debt calculation as they do not align with how the Group assesses net debt for decision making in relation to the Capital Allocation Framework. In addition, the freight index has historically been volatile which creates significant short-term fluctuation in these liabilities.\n\n|                                                                      | 2022    | 2022        | 2021    | 2021        |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-------------|---------|-------------|\n| US$M                                                                 | Current | Non-current | Current | Non-current |\n| Interest bearing liabilities                                         |         |             |         |             |\n| Bank loans                                                           | 397     | 2,075       | 437     | 1,823       |\n| Notes and debentures                                                 | 1,690   | 9,673       | 1,244   | 13,525      |\n| Lease liabilities                                                    | 519     | 2,057       | 889     | 3,007       |\n| Bank overdraft and short-term borrowings                             | -       | -           | -       | -           |\n| Other                                                                | 16      | 1           | 58      | -           |\n| Total interest bearing liabilities                                   | 2,622   | 13,806      | 2,628   | 18,355      |\n| Less: Lease liability associated with index-linked freight contracts | 113     | 161         | 346     | 679         |\n| Less: Cash and cash equivalents                                      |         |             |         |             |\n| Cash                                                                 | 5,728   | -           | 4,408   | -           |\n| Short-term deposits                                                  | 11,508  | -           | 10,838  | -           |\n| Less: Total cash and cash equivalents                                | 17,236  | -           | 15,246  | -           |\n| Less: Derivatives included in net debt                               |         |             |         |             |\n| Net debt management related instruments 1                            | (358)   | (1,330)     | 20      | 537         |\n| Net cash management related instruments 2                            | 273     | -           | 34      | -           |\n| Less: Total derivatives included in net debt                         | (85)    | (1,330)     | 54      | 537         |\n| Net debt                                                             |         | 333         |         | 4,121       |\n| Net assets                                                           |         | 48,766      |         | 55,605      |\n| Gearing                                                              |         | 0.7%        |         | 6.9%        |\n\nCash and short-term deposits are disclosed in the cash flow statement net of bank overdrafts and interest bearing liabilities at call.\n\n|                                                    | 2022   US$M   | 2021   US$M   | 2020   US$M   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| Total cash and cash equivalents                    | 17,236        | 15,246        | 13,426        |\n| Bank overdrafts and short-term borrowings          | -             | -             | -             |\n| Total cash and cash equivalents, net of overdrafts | 17,236        | 15,246        | 13,426        |\n\nCash and cash equivalents includes US$127 million (2021: US$159 million) restricted by legal or contractual arrangements.\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nCash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and on hand and highly liquid cash deposits with short-term maturities that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with insignificant risk of change in value.

Further information on the Group's risk management activities relating to these balances is provided in note 23 'Financial risk management'.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nThe Group's liquidity risk arises from the possibility that it may not be able to settle or meet its obligations as they fall due and is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy. Operational, capital and regulatory requirements are considered in the management of liquidity risk, in conjunction with short-term and long-term forecast information.\n\nOperating and Financial Review\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## 20  Net debt continued\n\nRecognising the cyclical volatility of operating cash flows, the Group has defined minimum target cash and liquidity buffers to be maintained to mitigate liquidity risk and support operations through the cycle.\n\nThe Group's strong credit profile, diversified funding sources, its minimum cash buffer and its committed credit facilities ensure that sufficient liquid funds are maintained to meet its daily cash requirements.\n\nThe Group's Moody's credit rating has remained at A2/P-1 outlook stable (long-term/short-term) throughout FY2022 and Moody's affirmed its credit rating on 2 June 2022. The Group's Standard & Poor's rating changed from A/A-1 outlook stable (long-term/short-term) to A/A-1 CreditWatch negative (longterm/short-term) on 23 August 2021 following the announcement of the proposed merger of our petroleum business with Woodside. Upon completion of the merger, on 1 June 2022 Standard & Poor's lowered the Group's long-term credit rating by one notch, removed the credit rating from CreditWatch, and confirmed a credit rating of A-/A-1 outlook stable (long-term/short-term).\n\nThere were no defaults on the Group's liabilities during the period.\n\n## Counterparty risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to credit risk from its financing activities, including short-term cash investments such as deposits with banks and derivative contracts. This risk is managed by Group Treasury in line with the counterparty risk framework, which aims to minimise the exposure to a counterparty and mitigate the risk of financial loss through counterparty failure.\n\nExposure to counterparties is monitored at a Group level across all products and includes exposure with derivatives and cash investments.\n\nInvestments and derivatives are only transacted with approved counterparties who have been assigned specific limits based on a quantitative credit risk model. These limits are updated at least bi-annually. Additionally, derivatives are subject to tenor limits and investments are subject to concentration limits by rating.\n\nDerivative fair values are inclusive of valuation adjustments that take into account both the counterparty and the Group's risk of default.\n\n## Standby arrangements and unused credit facilities\n\nThe Group's committed revolving credit facility operates as a back-stop to the Group's uncommitted commercial paper program. The combined amount drawn under the facility or as commercial paper will not exceed US$5.5 billion. As at 30 June 2022, US$ nil commercial paper was drawn (2021: US$ nil). The facility was amended in November 2021 for IBOR transition and is due to mature on 10 October 2026. A commitment fee is payable on the undrawn balance and interest is payable on any drawn balance comprising a reference rate plus a margin. The agreed margins are typical for a credit facility extended to a company with the Group's credit rating.\n\n## Maturity profile of financial liabilities\n\nThe maturity profile of the Group's financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual amounts, taking into account the derivatives related to debt, is as follows:\n\n| 2022 US$M                                           | Bank loans,  debentures and  other loans   | Expected  future interest  payments   | Derivatives  related to  debentures   | Other  derivatives   | Obligations  under lease  liabilities   | Trade   and other  payables 1   | Total   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------|\n| Due for payment:                                    |                                            |                                       |                                       |                      |                                         |                                 |         |\n| In one year or less or on demand                    | 2,109                                      | 492                                   | 525                                   | 221                  | 579                                     | 6,608                           | 10,534  |\n| In more than one year but not more than two years   | 1,634                                      | 427                                   | 300                                   | 112                  | 443                                     | -

Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments from the lease commencement date and are subsequently adjusted to reflect the interest on lease liabilities, lease payments and any remeasurements due to, for example, lease modifications or a change to future lease payments linked to an index or rate. Lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, where this is readily determinable. Where the implicit interest rate is not readily determinable, the interest payments are discounted at the Group's incremental borrowing rate, adjusted to reflect factors specific to the lease, including where relevant the currency, tenor and location of the lease.\n\nIn addition to containing a lease, the Group's contractual arrangements may include non-lease components. For example, certain mining services arrangements involve the provision of additional services, including maintenance, drilling activities and the supply of personnel. The Group has elected to separate these non-lease components from the lease components in measuring lease liabilities. Non-lease components are accounted for in accordance with the accounting policies applied to each underlying good or service received.\n\nLow-value and short-term leases continue to be expensed to the income statement. Variable lease payments not dependent on an index or rate are excluded from lease liabilities, and expensed to the income statement.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost will initially correspond to the lease liability, adjusted for initial direct costs, lease payments made prior to lease commencement, capitalised provisions for closure and rehabilitation and any lease incentives received.\n\nThe lease asset and liability associated with all index-linked freight contracts, including continuous voyage charters (CVCs), are measured at each reporting date based on the prevailing freight index (generally the Baltic C5 index).\n\nLease costs are recognised in the income statement over the lease term in the form of depreciation on the right-of-use asset and the unwinding of finance charges on the lease liability.\n\nWhere the Group is the operator of an unincorporated joint operation and all investors are parties to a lease, the Group recognises its proportionate share of the lease liability and associated right-of-use asset. In the event the Group is the sole signatory to a lease, and therefore has the sole legal obligation to make lease payments, the lease liability is recognised in full. Where the associated right-of-use asset is sub-leased (under a finance sub-lease) to a joint operation, for instance where it is dedicated to a single operation and the joint operation has the right to direct the use of the asset, the Group (as lessor) recognises its proportionate share of the right-of-use asset and a net investment in the lease, representing amounts to be recovered from the other parties to the joint operation. If the Group is not party to the head lease contract but sub-leases the associated right-of-use asset (as lessee), it recognises its proportionate share of the right-of-use asset and a lease liability which is payable to the operator.\n\n## Key judgements and estimates\n\nJudgements: Certain contractual arrangements not in the form of a lease require the Group to apply significant judgement in evaluating whether the Group controls the right to direct the use of assets and therefore whether the contract contains a lease. Management considers all facts and circumstances in determining whether the Group or the supplier has the rights to direct how, and for what purpose, the underlying assets are used in certain mining contracts and other arrangements, including outsourcing and shipping arrangements. Judgement is used to assess which decision-making rights mostly affect the benefits of use of the assets for each arrangement.\n\nWhere a contract includes the provision of non-lease services, judgement is required to identify the lease and non-lease components.\n\nEstimates: Where the Group cannot readily determine the interest rate implicit in the lease, estimation is involved in the determination of the weighted average incremental borrowing rate to measure lease liabilities.\n\nThe incremental borrowing rate reflects the rates of interest a lessee would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, with similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. Under the Group's portfolio approach to debt management, the Group does not specifically borrow for asset purchases. Therefore, the incremental borrowing rate is estimated referencing the Group's corporate borrowing portfolio and other similar rated entities, adjusted to reflect the terms and conditions of the lease (including the impact of currency, credit rating of subsidiary entering into the lease and the term of the lease), at the inception of the lease arrangement or the time of lease modification.\n\nThe Group estimates stand-alone prices, where such prices are not readily observable, in order to allocate the contractual payments between lease and non-lease components.",

Finance costs are expensed as incurred, except where they relate to the financing of construction or development of qualifying assets.\n\n## 23  Financial risk management\n\n## 23.1  Financial risks\n\n## Financial and capital risk management strategy\n\nThe financial risks arising from the Group's operations comprise market, liquidity and credit risk. These risks arise in the normal course of business and the Group manages its exposure to them in accordance with the Group's portfolio risk management strategy. The objective of the strategy is to support the delivery of the Group's financial targets, while protecting its future financial security and flexibility by taking advantage of the natural diversification provided by the scale, diversity and flexibility of the Group's operations and activities.\n\nAs part of the risk management strategy, the Group monitors target gearing levels and credit rating metrics under a range of different stress test scenarios incorporating operational and macroeconomic factors.\n\n## Market risk management\n\nThe Group's activities expose it to market risks associated with movements in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodity prices. Under the strategy outlined above, the Group seeks to achieve financing costs, currency impacts, input costs and commodity prices on a floating or index basis.\n\nIn executing the strategy, financial instruments are potentially employed in three distinct but related activities. The following table summarises these activities and the key risk management processes:\n\n| Activity                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Key risk management processes                                                                       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1 Risk mitigation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |                                                                                                     |\n| On an exception basis, hedging for the purposes of mitigating risk related to specific and significant  expenditure on investments or capital projects will be executed if necessary to support the Group's  strategic objectives.                                                                         | Execution of transactions within  approved mandates.                                                |\n| 2 Economic hedging of commodity sales, operating costs, short-term cash deposits,  other monetary items and debt instruments                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                     |\n| Where Group commodity production is sold to customers on pricing terms that deviate from the  relevant index target and where a relevant derivatives market exists, financial instruments may  be executed as an economic hedge to align the revenue price exposure with the index target and  US dollars. | Measuring and reporting the exposure in  customer commodity contracts and issued  debt instruments. |\n| Where debt is issued in a currency other than the US dollar and/or at a fixed interest rate, fair value  and cash flow hedges may be executed to align the debt exposure with the Group's functional  currency of US dollars and/or to swap to a floating interest rate.                                   | Executing hedging derivatives to align the  total group exposure to the index target.               |\n| US dollars, derivative financial instruments may be executed to align the foreign exchange exposure to                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Execution of transactions within  approved mandates.                                                |\n| Where short-term cash deposits and other monetary items are denominated in a currency other than  the Group's functional currency of US dollars.                                                                                                                                                           |                                                                                                     |\n| 3 Strategic financial transactions  Opportunistic transactions may be executed with financial instruments to capture value from perceived  market over/under valuations.                                                                                                                                   | Execution of transactions within  approved mandates.                                                |\n\nPrimary responsibility for the identification and control of financial risks, including authorising and monitoring the use of financial instruments for the above activities and stipulating policy thereon, rests with the Financial Risk Management Committee under authority delegated by the Chief Executive Officer.",

        "page_content": "## 23  Financial risk management continued\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its outstanding borrowings and short-term cash deposits from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair value of fixed interest rate financial instruments. Interest rate risk is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.\n\nThe majority of the Group's debt is issued at fixed interest rates. The Group has entered into interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps to convert most of its fixed interest rate exposure to floating US dollar interest rate exposure. As at 30 June 2022, 80 per cent of the Group's borrowings were exposed to floating interest rates inclusive of the effect of swaps (2021: 82 per cent).\n\nThe fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps in hedge relationships used to hedge both interest rate and foreign currency risks are shown in the valuation hierarchy in section 23.4 'Derivatives and hedge accounting'.\n\nBased on the net debt position as at 30 June 2022, taking into account interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps, it is estimated that a one percentage point increase in the US LIBOR interest rate will increase the Group's equity and profit after taxation by US$29 million (2021: increase of US$7 million). This assumes the change in interest rates is effective from the beginning of the financial year and the fixed/floating mix and balances are constant over the year.\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other benchmark interest rates are being replaced by alternative risk-free rates (ARR) as part of interbank offer rate (IBOR) reform. Sterling LIBOR ceased to be published on 1 January 2022 and USD LIBOR will no longer be published after 30 June 2023. The Group has assessed the implication of IBOR reform and has updated various policies, systems and processes including the adoption of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) IBOR Fallbacks Protocol. In November 2021, the Group amended its US$5.5 billion revolving credit facility to reference ARRs. Furthermore, in March 2022 Escondida executed the Group's first Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) linked loans.\n\nThe amendments to IFRS 9/AASB 9 'Financial Instruments', IFRS 7/AASB 7 'Financial Instruments (IFRS 7): Disclosures' and IFRS 16/AASB 16 'Leases' in relation to IBOR reform early adopted by the Group in previous periods impact the Group's cross currency and interest rate swaps, which reference US LIBOR, and the associated hedge accounting. Refer to section 23.4 'Derivatives and hedge accounting' for further information.\n\n## Currency risk\n\nThe US dollar is the predominant functional currency within the Group and as a result, currency exposures arise from transactions and balances in currencies other than the US dollar. The Group's potential currency exposures comprise:\n\n- -  translational exposure in respect of non-functional currency monetary items\n- -  transactional exposure in respect of non-functional currency expenditure and revenues\n\nThe Group's foreign currency risk is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy.\n\n## Translational exposure in respect of non-functional currency monetary items\n\nMonetary items, including financial assets and liabilities, denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of an operation are restated at the end of each reporting period to US dollar equivalents and the associated gain or loss is taken to the income statement. The exception is foreign exchange gains or losses on foreign currency denominated provisions for closure and rehabilitation at operating sites, which are capitalised in property, plant and equipment.\n\nThe Group has entered into cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forwards to convert its significant foreign currency exposures in respect of monetary items into US dollars. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates are therefore not expected to have a significant impact on equity and profit after tax.\n\nThe following table shows the carrying values of financial assets and liabilities at the end of the reporting period denominated in currencies other than the US dollar that are exposed to foreign currency risk:\n\n| Net financial (liabilities)/assets - by currency of denomination   | 2022   US$M   | 2021   US$M   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| AUD                                                                | (3,649)       | (4,421)       |\n| CLP                                                                | (602)         | (649)         |\n| GBP                                                                | 388           | 535           |\n| EUR                                                                | 280           | 366           |\n| Other                                                              | 187           | 128           |\n| Total                                                              | (3,396)       | (4,041)       |\n\nThe principal non-functional currencies to which the Group is exposed are the Australian dollar, the Chilean peso, the Pound sterling and the Euro. Based on the Group's net financial assets and liabilities as at 30 June 2022, a weakening of the US dollar against these currencies (one cent strengthening in Australian dollar, 10 pesos strengthening in Chilean peso, one penny strengthening in Pound sterling and one cent strengthening in Euro), with all other variables held constant, would decrease the Group's equity and profit after taxation by US$16 million (2021: decrease of US$21 million).\n\n## Transactional exposure in respect of non-functional currency expenditure and revenues\n\nCertain operating and capital expenditure is incurred in currencies other than an operation's functional currency. To a lesser extent, certain sales revenue is earned in currencies other than the functional currency of operations and certain exchange control restrictions may require that funds be maintained in currencies other than the functional currency of the operation. These currency risks are managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy. The Group may enter into forward exchange contracts when required under this strategy.\n\n## Commodity price risk\n\nThe risk associated with commodity prices is managed as part of the portfolio risk management strategy. Substantially all of the Group's commodity production is sold on market-based index pricing terms, with derivatives used from time to time to achieve a specific outcome.\n\nFinancial instruments with commodity price risk comprise forward commodity and other derivative contracts with net liabilities at fair value of US$56 million (2021: net assets of US$138 million).",

        "page_content": "## 23  Financial risk management continued\n\n## Provisionally priced commodity sales and purchases contracts\n\nProvisionally priced sales or purchases volumes are those for which price finalisation, referenced to the relevant index, is outstanding at the reporting date. Provisional pricing mechanisms within these sales and purchases arrangements have the character of a commodity derivative. Trade receivables or payables under these contracts are carried at fair value through profit or loss using Level 2 valuation inputs based on forecast selling prices in the quotation period. The Group's exposure at 30 June 2022 to the impact of movements in commodity prices upon provisionally invoiced sales and purchases volumes was predominately around copper.\n\nThe Group had 289 thousand tonnes of copper exposure as at 30 June 2022 (2021: 254 thousand tonnes) that was provisionally priced. The final price of these sales and purchases volumes will be determined during the first half of FY2023. A 10 per cent change in the price of copper realised on the provisionally priced sales, with all other factors held constant, would increase or decrease profit after taxation by US$162 million (2021: US$166 million).\n\nThe relationship between commodity prices and foreign currencies is complex and movements in foreign exchange rates can impact commodity prices.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nRefer to note 20 'Net debt' for details on the Group's liquidity risk.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily from customer receivables) and from its financing activities, including deposits with banks and financial institutions, other short-term investments, interest rate and currency derivative contracts and other financial instruments.\n\nRefer to note 8 'Trade and other receivables' and note 20 'Net debt' for details on the Group credit risk.\n\n## 23.2  Recognition and measurement\n\nAll financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives and trade receivables, are initially recognised at the fair value of consideration paid or received, net of transaction costs as appropriate. Financial assets are initially recognised on their trade date.\n\nFinancial assets are subsequently carried at fair value or amortised cost based on:\n\n- -  the Group's purpose, or business model, for holding the financial asset\n- -  whether the financial asset's contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest\n\nThe resulting Financial Statements classifications of financial assets can be summarised as follows:\n\n| Contractual cash flows        | Business model                                           | Category                                      |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| Solely principal and interest | Hold in order to collect contractual cash flows          | Amortised cost                                |\n| Solely principal and interest | Hold in order to collect contractual cash flows and sell | Fair value through other comprehensive income |\n| Solely principal and interest | Hold in order to sell                                    | Fair value through profit or loss             |\n| Other                         | Any of those mentioned above                             | Fair value through profit or loss             |\n\nSolely principal and interest refers to the Group receiving returns only for the time value of money and the credit risk of the counterparty for financial assets held. The main exceptions for the Group are provisionally priced receivables and derivatives which are measured at fair value through profit or loss under IFRS 9.\n\nThe Group has the intention of collecting payment directly from its customers in most cases, however the Group also participates in receivables financing programs in respect of selected customers. Receivables in these portfolios which are classified as 'hold in order to sell', are provisionally priced receivables and are therefore held at fair value through profit or loss prior to sale to the financial institution.\n\nWith the exception of derivative contracts and provisionally priced trade payables which are carried at fair value through profit or loss, the Group's financial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost.\n\nThe Group may in addition elect to designate certain financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or to apply hedge accounting where they are not mandatorily held at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Fair value measurement\n\nThe carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value is principally calculated based on inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for these financial assets or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as unquoted prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Where no price information is available from a quoted market source, alternative market mechanisms or recent comparable transactions, fair value is estimated based on the Group's views on relevant future prices, net of valuation allowances to accommodate liquidity, modelling and other risks implicit in such estimates.\n\nThe inputs used in fair value calculations are determined by the relevant segment or function. The functions support the assets and operate under a defined set of accountabilities authorised by the Executive Leadership Team. Movements in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities may be recognised through the income statement or in other comprehensive income according to the designation of the underlying instrument.\n\nFor financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value, the Group uses the following to categorise the inputs to the valuation method used based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\n\n| IFRS 13 Fair value hierarchy   | Level 1                                                                                                 | Level 2                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Level 3                                                                                                                      |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Valuation inputs               | Based on quoted prices (unadjusted)  in active markets for identical  financial assets and liabilities. | Based on inputs other than quoted prices  included within Level 1 that are observable  for the financial asset or liability, either  directly (i.e. as unquoted prices) or  indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). | Based on inputs not observable in the market  using appropriate valuation models, including  discounted cash flow modelling. |\n\nOperating and Financial Review\n\n<!-- image -->",

A discounted cash flow approach is used to derive the fair value of cross currency and interest rate swaps at the reporting date.\n- 3 Includes other derivative contracts of US$ nil (2021: US$121 million) categorised as Level 3. Significant items in FY2021 were derivatives embedded in physical commodity purchase and sales contracts of gas in Trinidad and Tobago which were disposed as part of the merger of the Petroleum business during the period.\n- 4 Includes receivables contingent on outcome of future events relating to mining, and regulatory approvals of US$233 million (2021: US$ nil).\n- 5 Includes investments held by BHP Billiton Foundation which are restricted and not available for general use by the Group of US$252 million (2021: US$260 million) of which other investment (mainly US Treasury Notes) of US$119 million categorised as Level 1 (2021: US$72 million).\n- 6 Excludes input taxes of US$427 million (2021: US$486 million) included in other receivables.\n- 7 Includes the discounted settlement liability in relation to the cancellation of power contracts at the Group's Escondida operations.\n- 8 Excludes input taxes of US$79 million (2021: US$176 million) included in other payables.\n- 9 All interest bearing liabilities, excluding lease liabilities, are unsecured.\n\nThe carrying amounts in the table above generally approximate to fair value. In the case of US$3,018 million (2021: US$3,018 million) of fixed rate debt not swapped to floating rate, the fair value at 30 June 2022 was US$3,126 million (2021: US$4,052 million). The fair value is determined using a method that can be categorised as Level 2 and uses inputs based on benchmark interest rates, alternative market mechanisms or recent comparable transactions.\n\nFor financial instruments that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation at the end of each reporting period. There were no transfers between categories during the period.\n\n## Offsetting financial assets and liabilities\n\nThe Group enters into money market deposits and derivative transactions under International Swaps and Derivatives Association master netting agreements that do not meet the criteria in IAS 32 'Financial Instruments: Presentation' for offsetting, but allow for the related amounts to be set-off in certain circumstances. The amounts set out as cross currency and interest rate swaps in the table above represent the derivative financial assets and liabilities of the Group that may be subject to the above arrangements and are presented on a gross basis.\n\n## 23.4  Derivatives and hedge accounting\n\nThe Group uses derivatives to hedge its exposure to certain market risks and may elect to apply hedge accounting.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nDerivatives are included within financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments. Financial instruments in this category are classified as current if they are due or expected to be settled within 12 months otherwise they are classified as non-current.",

        "page_content": "Operating and Financial Review\n\n## 23  Financial risk management continued\n\nWhere hedge accounting is applied, at the start of the transaction, the Group documents the type of hedge, the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged items and its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The documentation also demonstrates that the hedge is expected to be effective.\n\nThe Group applies the following types of hedge accounting to its derivatives hedging the interest rate and currency risks of its notes and debentures:\n\n- -  Fair value hedges - the fair value gain or loss on interest rate and cross currency swaps relating to interest rate risk, together with the change in the fair value of the hedged fixed rate borrowings attributable to interest rate risk are recognised immediately in the income statement. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the fair value adjustment on the note or debenture is amortised to the income statement over the period to maturity using a recalculated effective interest rate.\n- -  Cash flow hedges - changes in the fair value of cross currency interest rate swaps which hedge foreign currency cash flows on the notes and debentures are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve. To the extent a hedge is ineffective, changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement.\n- When a hedging instrument expires, or is sold, terminated or exercised, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is amortised to the income statement over the period to the hedged item's maturity.\n\nWhen hedged, the Group hedges the full notional value of notes or debentures. However, certain components of the fair value of derivatives are not permitted under IFRS 9 to be included in the hedge accounting above. Certain costs of hedging are permitted to be recognised in other comprehensive income. Any change in the fair value of a derivative that does not qualify for hedge accounting, or is ineffective in hedging the designated risk due to contractual differences between the hedged item and hedging instrument, is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nThe table below shows the carrying amounts of the Group's notes and debentures by currency and the derivatives which hedge them:\n\n- -  The carrying amount of the notes and debentures includes foreign exchange remeasurement to period-end rates and fair value adjustments when included in a fair value hedge.\n- -  The breakdown of the hedging derivatives includes remeasurement of foreign currency notional values at period-end rates, fair value movements due to interest rate risk, foreign currency cash flows designated into cash flow hedges, costs of hedging recognised in other comprehensive income, ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement and accruals or prepayments.\n- -  The hedged value of notes and debentures includes their carrying amounts adjusted for the offsetting derivative fair value movements due to foreign currency and interest rate risk remeasurement.\n\n|             |                                            | Fair value of derivatives                  | Fair value of derivatives   | Fair value of derivatives                  | Fair value of derivatives                 | Fair value of derivatives               | Fair value of derivatives   | Fair value of derivatives   |                                          |\n|-------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| 2022   US$M | Carrying  amount of  notes and  debentures | Foreign  exchange  notional at  spot rates | Interest   rate risk        | Recognised  in cash flow  hedging  reserve | Recognised   in cost of  hedging  reserve | Recognised in   the income  statement 1 | Accrued   cash flows        | Total                       | Hedged value  of notes and  debentures 2 |\n|             | A                                          | B                                          | C                           | D                                          | E                                         | F                                       | G                           | B to G                      | A + B + C                                |\n| USD         | 4,740                                      | -

Refer to note 22 'Net finance costs' for details of net finance costs for the year.\n\n## Interest Rate Benchmark Reform\n\nIBOR reform impacts the Group's cross currency and interest rate swaps, which reference 3-month US LIBOR, and the associated hedge accounting. At 30 June 2022, the notional value of hedging instruments that reference 3-month US LIBOR is US$ 15.6 billion (2021: US$16.8 billion). The SOFR benchmark rate is being widely adopted by market participants as the replacement for US LIBOR in new contracts. However, a number of US LIBOR settings, including 3-month US LIBOR, will continue to be published until 30 June 2023. Accordingly, absent of any agreement with counterparties to transition to an alternative risk-free rate before this date, the Group's existing cross currency and interest rate swaps with maturity dates beyond 30 June 2023 will only transition to ARR once US LIBOR publication ceases. As at 30 June 2022, the Group has not transitioned any of its existing cross currency and interest rate swaps to alternative risk-free rates, however it is expecting to commence active transition of the existing cross currency and interest rate swaps portfolio to alternative benchmark rates during FY2023.",

These include USD bank loans of US$1.6 billion (2021: US$2.3 billion). Refer to note 20 'Net debt'.\n\nThe Group has previously adopted amendments to IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 in relation to IBOR Reform. These amendments provide reliefs from applying specific hedge accounting requirements to hedging arrangements directly impacted by these reforms. In particular, where changes to the Group's instruments arise solely as a result of IBOR reform and do not change the economic substance of the Group's arrangements, the Group is able to maintain its existing hedge relationships and accounting. The Group has continued to apply these reliefs, resulting in no impact on the Group's hedge accounting. Upon transition to alternative risk-free rates, the Group will seek to apply further reliefs in IFRS 9 and continue to apply hedge accounting to its hedging arrangements.\n\n## Movements in reserves relating to hedge accounting\n\nThe following table shows a reconciliation of the components of equity and an analysis of the movements in reserves for all hedges.

Following unification of our dual listed company structure in January 2022, employees holding unvested BHP Group Plc awards received one BHP Group Limited award per BHP Group Plc award held at the time of unification. Vesting of awards will stay on the original timeframes. Employees holding BHP Group Plc acquired shares under Shareplus received one BHP Group Limited share for each BHP Group Plc share owned.\n\nSome awards are eligible to receive a cash payment, or the equivalent value in shares, equal to the dividend amount that would have been earned on the underlying shares awarded to those participants (the Dividend Equivalent Payment, or DEP). The DEP is provided to the participants once the underlying shares are allocated or transferred to them. Awards under the plans do not confer any rights to participate in a share issue; however, there is discretion under each of the plans to adjust the awards in response to a variation in the share capital of BHP Group Limited.\n\nOn completion of the merger between BHP Petroleum and Woodside on 1 June 2022, adjustments were made to unvested awards held under the above mentioned employee share ownership plans to ensure participants continue to be appropriately treated. The number of 'Uplift' awards granted of 1,574,034 shares was calculated based on the number of unvested awards held prior to the merger multiplied by 1.1205 being the USD value of the in specie dividend divided by the closing BHP Group Limited share price on 31 May 2022 (converted into USD on the same date) plus one.",

The fair values of awards granted were estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation methodology and Black-Scholes option pricing technique and consider the following factors:\n\n- -  exercise price\n- -  expected life of the award\n- -  current market price of the underlying shares\n- -  expected volatility using an analysis of historic volatility over different rolling periods. For the LTIP, it is calculated for all sector comparators and the published MSCI World index\n- -  expected dividends\n- -  risk-free interest rate, which is an applicable government bond rate\n- -  market-based performance hurdles\n- -  non-vesting conditions\n\nWhere awards are forfeited because non-market-based vesting conditions are not satisfied, the expense previously recognised is proportionately reversed.\n\nThe tax effect of awards granted is recognised in income tax expense, except to the extent that the total tax deductions are expected to exceed the cumulative remuneration expense. In this situation, the excess of the associated current or deferred tax is recognised in equity and forms part of the employee share awards reserve. The fair value of awards as presented in the tables above represents the fair value at grant date.\n\nIn respect of employee share awards, the Group utilises the BHP Billiton Limited Employee Equity Trust. The trustee of this trust is an independent company, resident in Jersey. The trust uses funds provided by the Group to acquire ordinary shares to enable awards to be made or satisfied. The ordinary shares may be acquired by purchase in the market or by subscription at not less than nominal value.\n\nOperating and Financial Review",

Woodside has subsequently acquired the entire share capital of BHP Petroleum International Pty Ltd ('BHP Petroleum') in exchange for new Woodside ordinary shares.\n\nWhile the merger had an economic effective date of 1 July 2021, the Group continued to control the Petroleum assets and carry on business in the normal course for 11 months until 1 June 2022 (Completion Date). As such, the Group recognises its share of revenue, expenses, net finance costs and associated income tax expense related to the Discontinued operation until the Completion Date.\n\nAs consideration for the sale of BHP Petroleum, the Group received 914,768,948 newly issued Woodside ordinary shares at Completion Date. On the Completion Date, the Group paid a fully franked in specie dividend in the form of Woodside shares to eligible BHP shareholders. Eligible BHP shareholders received one Woodside share for every 5.5340 BHP shares they held on the Group's register at the record date of 26 May 2022.\n\nAs part of completion and in order to reflect the economic effective date, the Group made a net cash payment of US$0.7 billion to Woodside in addition to US$0.4 billion in cash that was left in the BHP Petroleum bank accounts to fund ongoing operations. The total cash transfer of US$1.1 billion reflects the net cash flows generated by BHP Petroleum between 1 July 2021 and Completion Date adjusted for dividends Woodside would have paid on the newly issued Woodside ordinary shares, had the Merger completed on 1 July 2021. The net cash completion payment to Woodside is subject to a customary post-completion review, which may result in an adjustment to the amount paid.\n\nBHP Mitsui Coal Pty Ltd (BMC), while being divested on 3 May 2022, is not considered to meet the criteria for classification as a Discontinued operation given its relative size to the Group and the Coal segment.

The Group's ownership interest in equity accounted investments results are listed in the table below.\n\n|                                             |                                                        |                             |                         |                | Ownership interest   | Ownership interest   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|----------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Significant associates   and joint ventures | Country of incorporation/  principal place of business | Associate or  joint venture | Principal activity      | Reporting date | 2022   %             | 2021   %             |\n| Cerrej\u00f3n 1                                  | Anguilla/Colombia/Ireland                              | Associate                   | Coal mining in Colombia | 31 December    | -                    | 33.33                |\n| Compa\u00f1\u00eda Minera Antamina S.A.

Instead, because the Group has the power to participate in the financial and operating policies of the investee, this investment is accounted for as an associate.\n\nSamarco is jointly owned by BHP Billiton Brasil Ltda (BHP Brasil) and Vale S.A. (Vale). As the Samarco entity has the rights to the assets and obligations to the liabilities relating to the joint arrangement and not its owners, this investment is accounted for as a joint venture.\n\nThe Group is restricted in its ability to make dividend payments from its investments in associates and joint ventures as any such payments require the approval of all investors in the associates and joint ventures. The ownership interest at the Group's and the associates' or joint ventures' reporting dates are the same. When the annual financial reporting date is different to the Group's, financial information is obtained as at 30 June in order to report on an annual basis consistent with the Group's reporting date.\n\nThe movement for the year in the Group's investments accounted for using the equity method is as follows:\n\n| Year ended 30 June 2022   US$M                                               | Investment in  associates   | Investment in  joint ventures   | Total equity  accounted  investments   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| At the beginning of the financial year                                       | 1,742                       | -                               | 1,742                                  |\n| Loss from equity accounted investments, related impairments and expenses 1,2 | 653                         | (676)                           | (23)                                   |\n| Investment in equity accounted investments                                   | 52                          | -                               | 52                                     |\n| Dividends received from equity accounted investments 3                       | (787)                       | -                               | (787)                                  |\n| Divestment and demerger of equity accounted investments                      | (240)                       | -                               | (240)                                  |\n| Other                                                                        | -                           | 676                             | 676                                    |\n| At the end of the financial year                                             | 1,420                       | -                               | 1,420                                  |\n\nThe following table summarises the financial information relating to each of the Group's significant equity accounted investments.

A contingent liability may also be a present obligation arising from past events but is not recognised on the basis that an outflow of economic resources to settle the obligation is not viewed as probable, or the amount of the obligation cannot be reliably measured.\n\nWhen the Group has a present obligation, an outflow of economic resources is assessed as probable and the Group can reliably measure the obligation, a provision is recognised.\n\nThe Group has entered into various counter-indemnities of bank and performance guarantees related to its own future performance, which are in the normal course of business. The likelihood of these guarantees being called upon is considered remote.\n\nThe Group presently has tax matters, litigation and other claims, for which the timing of resolution and potential economic outflow are uncertain. Obligations assessed as having probable future economic outflows capable of reliable measurement are provided at reporting date and matters assessed as having possible future economic outflows capable of reliable measurement are included in the total amount of contingent liabilities above. Individually significant matters, including narrative on potential future exposures incapable of reliable measurement, are disclosed below, to the extent that disclosure does not prejudice the Group.\n\n| Uncertain tax and  royalty matters   | The Group is subject to a range of taxes and royalties across many jurisdictions, the application of which is uncertain  in some regards. Changes in tax law, changes in interpretation of tax law, periodic challenges and disagreements with  tax authorities, and legal proceedings result in uncertainty of the outcome of the application of taxes and royalties to the  Group's business. Areas of uncertainty at reporting date include the application of taxes and royalties to the Group's   cross-border operations and transactions.   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                      | To the extent uncertain tax and royalty matters give rise to a contingent liability, an estimate of the potential liability   is included within the table above, where it is capable of reliable measurement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Samarco  contingent liabilities      | The table above includes contingent liabilities related to the Group's equity accounted investment in Samarco to the extent  they are capable of reliable measurement.

Such indemnities include those provided as part of the demerger of South 32 Ltd in May 2015, divestment  of Group's Onshore US assets in September 2018 and October 2018 divestment of BMC in May 2022 and the merger  of the Group's Petroleum business with Woodside in June 2022.

While these remain subject to ongoing assessment, no significant impacts have been identified to date.\n\nThese pronouncements have not been applied in the preparation of these Financial Statements.",

Giving a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 30 June 2022 and of its consolidated financial performance for the year ended on that date; and\n- b.   Complying with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Regulations 2001 .\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board's APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the Code.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Our consideration of climate change related risks\n\nThe Group continues to develop its assessment of the potential impacts of climate change, including considering divergent climate scenarios across a range of temperature outcomes, with two scenarios; the Central Energy View and the Lower Carbon View, currently being used as inputs to the Group's operational planning cases as explained in the Climate change section within the financial report.\n\nThe financial impacts of climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy (climate change) on the Group were considered in our audit where they have the potential to materially impact the basis of preparation, including the key judgements and estimates exercised by the Group in the preparation of the financial report, particularly in relation to the assessment of the carrying value of property, plant and equipment and the determination of closure and rehabilitation provisions.\n\nThe key judgements and estimates disclosed in the financial report, incorporate assumptions that are directly and/or indirectly impacted by climate change, including Board approved climate related commitments and strategies, to the extent they can be reliably estimated, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the IASB and Australian Accounting Standards.\n\nThe key audit matters section of this report address how we have assessed the Group's climate related assumptions to the extent they impact each key audit matter.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial report of the current year. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.\n\nWe have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial report.\n\n<!-- image -->",

With the assistance of our rehabilitation subject matter specialists, we assessed the qualifications, competence and objectivity of the internal and external experts and that the information provided by the Group's internal and external experts has been appropriately reflected in the calculation of the closure and rehabilitation provisions.\n- -  We assessed the discount rates adopted to calculate the closure and rehabilitation provisions, including benchmarking to comparable market data.\n- -  With the assistance of our climate change and other subject matter specialists, we evaluated how the Group's response to climate change had been considered in the determination of closure and rehabilitation provision estimates, such as physical risks created by changes to longterm weather outlooks, estimates related to post closure monitoring and maintenance and the timing of closure activities impacted by mine operating lives.\n- -  We assessed the adequacy of the disclosures included in Note 15 of the financial report.\n\nOperating and Financial Review\n\n<!-- image -->",

The other information comprises the information included in the Company's 2022 annual report other than the financial report and our auditor's report thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon, with the exception of the Remuneration Report and our related assurance opinion.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report, or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf, based on the work we have performed on the other information obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of the directors for the financial report\n\nThe directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the IASB, Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial report, the directors are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters relating to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- -  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal control.\n- -  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOperating and Financial Review\n\n- -  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors.\n- -  Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- -  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial report, including the disclosures, and whether the financial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- -  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the financial report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated to the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial report of the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on the audit of the Remuneration Report\n\n## Opinion on the Remuneration Report\n\nWe have audited the Remuneration Report included in the Directors' Report for the year ended 30 June 2022.\n\nIn our opinion, the Remuneration Report of BHP Group Limited for the year ended 30 June 2022, complies with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001 .\n\n## Responsibilities\n\nThe directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the Remuneration Report in accordance with section 300A of the Corporations Act 2001 . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Remuneration Report, based on our audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRodney Piltz Partner Melbourne\n\n16 August 2022\n\nA member firm of Ernst & Young Global Limited Liability limited by a scheme approved under Professional Standards Legislation",

Reserves are a subset of resources that can be demonstrated to be able to be economically and legally extracted. In order to estimate reserves, assumptions are required about a range of technical and economic factors, including quantities, qualities, production techniques, recovery efficiency, production and transport costs, commodity supply and demand, commodity prices and exchange rates.\n\nThe statement of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves presented in this Annual Report has been produced in accordance with the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) Listing Rules Chapter 5, December 2019 and the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, December 2012 (JORC Code).\n\nPredicted sales prices, based on supply and demand forecast and current and long-term historical average price trends, have been used. The Ore Reserves tabulated are held within existing, permitted mining tenements. Mineral leases are of sufficient duration (or convey a legal right to renew for sufficient duration) to enable all reserves on the leased properties to be mined in accordance with current production schedules. Ore Reserves may include areas where some additional approvals remain outstanding, however it is anticipated such approvals will be obtained within the timeframe required by the current life-of-mine schedule.",

        "page_content": "## 5  Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves continued\n\n## Declaration tables\n\n- -  All Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves presented are reported in 100 per cent terms (unless otherwise stated) and represent estimates as at 30 June 2022.\n- -  Tonnes are reported as dry metric tonnes (unless otherwise stated). All tonnes and grade/ quality information have been rounded, so small differences may be present in the totals.\n- -  The Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources are inclusive of those Mineral Resources modified to produce the Ore Reserves.\n\n## Competent Persons\n\nThis statement is based on and fairly represents information and supporting documentation compiled by Competent Persons (as defined in the JORC Code). All Competent Persons have, at the time of reporting, sufficient experience relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity they are undertaking to qualify as a Competent Person.\n\nEach Competent Person listed is an employee of BHP or a company in which BHP has a controlling interest (unless otherwise stated) and declares they have no issues that could be perceived by investors as a material conflict of interest in preparing the reported information. All Competent Persons are a Member or Fellow of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (AusIMM) or the Australian Institute of Geoscientists (AIG) or a Recognised Professional Organisation. Each Competent Person consents to the inclusion in this Annual Report of the matters based on his or her information in the form and context in which it appears.\n\n## Other reporting jurisdictions\n\nThe information contained in this document is expected to differ from that reported to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in our annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended 30 June 2022. Historically, reserve reporting requirements for SEC filings in the United States, such as those on Form 20-F, were set forth in SEC Industry Guide 7, with economic assumptions based on current economic conditions that may differ to the JORC Code's reasonable investment assumptions. On 31 October 2018, the SEC amended the property disclosure requirements for SEC-registered mining companies, such as BHP, requiring such companies to comply with the new rules for their first fiscal year beginning on or after 1 January 2021. These amendments replaced the previous requirements that were included in Industry Guide 7.\n\nMineral resources and mineral reserves reporting requirements for SEC filings in the United States are set forth in S-K 1300. S-K 1300 requires resources estimates to be reported exclusive of reserves estimates and both reported only for the portion attributable to our interest in such resources or reserves. In addition, specific disclosure requirements pertaining to economic assumptions and interpretation of reasonable prospects of economic extraction are expected to result in further differences between the resources and reserves estimates presented in this document and those to be reported in in our annual report on Form 20-F.\n\nA key difference in the estimation of our resources and reserves pursuant to the ASX Listing Rules and S-K 1300 are the economic inputs, commodity prices and costs. Estimates we report in accordance with the ASX Listing Rules and JORC Code (2012) are based on cost forecasts and internally generated projected long-term commodity prices. S-K 1300 requires mineral resources and mineral reserves estimates to be based on a reasonable and justifiable commodity price selected by a qualified person. Since S-K 1300 requires the disclosure of the prices used in the estimation of mineral resources and mineral reserves, due to commercial sensitivity regarding the disclosure of BHP's internally generated projected long-term commodity prices used in the estimation of our Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves reported in accordance with the ASX Listing Rules and JORC Code (2012), the estimates reported in accordance with S-K 1300 are expected to be based on the historical commodity prices over a timeframe relevant for the commodity (generally three years). In addition, the estimates reported in accordance with S-K 1300 are expected to be based on the historical average costs over a timeframe of three years for production stage properties or, for development stage properties, costs determined from first principles.\n\nOur resources and reserves estimates to be reported in our annual report on Form 20-F are therefore not directly comparable to those presented in this document and should be considered in relation to the differing reporting and disclosure requirements of the jurisdiction under which they are presented.\n\n## Assurance and verification\n\nBHP has internal controls over our Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves estimation efforts that are designed to produce reasonable and reliable estimates aligned with industry practice and our regulatory reporting requirements. The governance for our estimation efforts is located at both the asset and the BHP Group level within our Resource Centre of Excellence, an internal assurance team independent of our Competent Persons and BHP employees who are responsible for the estimations. The assets provide first-line assurance on estimates through peer review and validation processes. The Resource Centre of Excellence is responsible for assurance over the processes implemented by the assets as they relate to Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves estimations and the compiling of the estimates to be reported in accordance with the ASX Listing Rules and JORC Code (2012).\n\nOur internal controls utilise management systems, including, but not limited to, formal quality assurance and quality control processes, standardised procedures, workflow processes, data security covering record keeping, chain of custody and data storage, supervision and management approval, reconciliations, internal and external reviews and audits.\n\nOur internal requirements and standards provide the basis for the governance over the estimation and reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves and provide technical guidance to all reporting assets. These internal requirements and standards are periodically reviewed and updated for alignment with industry practice and reporting regulations.\n\nOur internal controls for exploration data, as they relate to Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves estimations, are managed by our operating assets with assurance provided by the Resource Centre of Excellence. These include procedures and standards defining minimum requirements of critical aspects to support exploration and resource development programs, spatial quality control checks on measurement points (e.g. collar, downhole survey), quality control checks on samples including laboratory data quality checks, geological database audits and back-up routines and technical peer review across the data gathering, integration and estimation processes.\n\nOur internal controls for Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves estimations include, but are not limited to:\n\n- -  source data review from database extracts, using exploratory data statistical analysis prior to use in the estimation of mineral resources. Identification of data to exclude, outliers and visual checks against estimation domains\n- -  peer reviews of the estimation inputs based on statistical studies and estimation parameters as applied in industry standard estimation software\n- -  visual and statistical validation of the estimates against source data and where available reconciliation to previous models, operational models and production data\n- -  peer review of the classification applied, considering quantitative measures and qualitative considerations\n- -  peer review of assumptions applied that convert resources to reserves\n- -  independent audits or reviews for new or materially changed Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves\n\nOperating assets manage internal risk registers relating to uncertainties in the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves estimates to direct future work programs or estimation updates. These may include but are not limited to:\n\n- -  areas of uncertainty in the estimates impacting local interpretations\n- -  bulk density assumptions, based on sample test work or operational results\n- -  metallurgical recovery assumptions, based on test work or plant performance\n- -  changes in commodity prices, costs and exchange rate assumptions\n- -  geotechnical and hydrogeological considerations impacting on underground or open-cut mining assumptions\n- -  ore loss and dilution, mining selectivity and production rate assumptions\n- -  cut-off value changes to meet product specifications\n- -  changes in environmental, permitting and social license to operate assumptions\n\nFurther to assurance activities by the assets specifically relating to the estimation of resources and reserves, the Resource Centre of Excellence with subject matter experts have developed standards and guidelines across BHP for reviewing and documenting the information supporting our Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves estimates, describing the",

These activities are supported by the following controls:\n\n- -  The reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves estimates are required to follow BHP's standard procedures for public reporting in accordance with current regulatory requirements.\n- -  Annual risk reviews are conducted with Competent Persons and BHP employees on all Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves to be reported, including year on year change impact assessment, reconciliation performance metrics for the operating mines and control assessment for the estimation inputs. The information and supporting documentation are prepared by the Competent Persons relating to the estimates and evaluated for compliance with BHP's internal controls. Based on these reviews, recommendations of endorsement are provided to our senior management for the use and reporting of the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves.\n- -  Periodic internal technical 'deep dive' assessments of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves are conducted on a frequency that is informed by asset materiality and outcomes of the annual risk reviews.\n- -  Management and closure reviews of actions assigned to Competent Persons and BHP employees resulting from the annual risk reviews and technical 'deep dive' assessments are conducted.\n- -  Assurance is undertaken over the reporting documentation provided by Competent Persons for public release and management and verification of inputs into BHP Resources and Reserves reporting database.\n\nThe Resource Centre of Excellence also provides an annual update on assurance activities and changes relating to our resources and reserves estimation efforts to the Risk and Audit Committee (RAC) in connection with the RAC's responsibility over the effectiveness of systems of internal control and risk management of BHP.\n\n## Inherent risks in the estimation of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves\n\nEstimated annual cash flows from our future operations, estimated production schedules, estimated capital expenditure and operating costs, estimated site closure costs, estimated royalty and tax costs, valuation assumptions and interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques, all of which may not necessarily be indicative of future results. The assumptions and interpretations used to estimate our Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves may change from period to period, and, because additional geological data generated during the course of our operations may not be consistent with the data on which we based our Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves, such estimates may change from period to period or may need to be revised. No assurance can be given that our Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves presented in this Report will be recovered at the grade, quality or quantities presented or at all.\n\nOperating and Financial Review\n\nThere are numerous uncertainties inherent in the estimation of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves. Areas of uncertainty that may materially impact our Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves estimates may include, but are not limited to: (i) changes to longterm commodity prices and costs, external market factors, foreign exchange rates and other economic assumptions; (ii) changes in geological interpretations of mineral deposits and geological modelling, including estimation input parameters and techniques; (iii) changes to metallurgical or process recovery assumptions which adversely affect the volume, grade or qualities of our commodities produced (for example, processing that results in higher deleterious elements that result in penalties) or other changes to mining method assumptions; (iv) changes to input assumptions used to derive the potentially mineable shapes applicable to the assumed underground or open-pit mining methods used to constrain the estimates; (v) changes to life of mine or production rate assumptions; (vi) changes to dilution and mining recovery assumptions; (vii) changes to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncut-off grades applied to the estimates; (viii) changes to geotechnical (including seismicity), structures, rock mass strength, stress regime, hydrogeological, hydrothermal or geothermal factors; (ix) changes to infrastructure supporting the operations of or access to the applicable mine site; (x) changes to mineral, surface, water or other natural resources rights; (xi) changes to royalty, taxes, environmental, permitting and social license assumptions in the jurisdictions in which we operate; and (xii) changes in capital or operating costs.\n\nEstimates of Mineral Resources are subject to further exploration and evaluation of development and operating costs, grades, recoveries and other material factors, and, therefore, are subject to uncertainty. Mineral resources do not meet the threshold for Ore Reserve modifying factors, such as engineering, legal or economic feasibility, that would allow for the conversion to Ore Reserves. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that our Mineral Resources not included in Ore Reserves will become recoverable Proved and Probable Ore Reserves.\n\n## Competent Persons\n\n| Copper

The decrease in Oxide and Sulphide ore types was mainly due to depletion. Oxide and Sulphide Leach ore types contribute 12 years and 29 years respectively to the reported reserve life.\n- 13  Cerro Colorado - The decrease in Ore Reserves was mainly due to depletion. Reserve life is constrained by mining permit expiry in 2023.\n- 14  Spence - The decrease in Oxide and Transitional Sulphide ore types was mainly due to depletion. The increase in Hypogene Sulphide ore type was mainly due to an update in the resource estimate supported by additional drilling, resulting with an increase in reserve life.\n- 15  Olympic Dam - The increase in UG Sulphide and Low-grade ore types and reserve life were due to a reduction in cut-off grade supported by mine planning studies.\n- 16  Antamina - The decrease in Ore Reserves and reduction in reserve life was mainly due to depletion.",

Wet tonnes are reported for WAIO deposits and Samarco, including moisture contents for WAIO: BKM - Brockman 3%, CID - Channel Iron Deposits 8%, DID - Detrital Iron Deposits 4%, MM - Marra Mamba 4%, NIM - Nimingarra 3.5% and Samarco: ROM - 6.5%.\n- 2   A single cut-off grade was applied in WAIO per deposit ranging from 50-58%Fe with an additional threshold of <6%Al 2 0 3 applied to the DID ore type. For Samarco the cut-off grade was 22%Fe.\n- 3   WAIO - Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves are reported on a Pilbara basis by ore type to align with our production of blended lump products which comprises BKM and MM ore types and blended fines products including CID. This also reflects our single logistics chain and associated management system.\n- 4   WAIO - BHP interest is reported as Pilbara Ore Reserves tonnes weighted average across all joint ventures which can vary from year to year. BHP ownership varies between 85% and 100%.\n- 5   WAIO - The increase in DID ore type was due to updated resource estimates supported by additional drilling.\n- 6   WAIO - Mineral Resources are restricted to areas which have been identified for inclusion based on a risk assessment, including heritage sites.\n- 7   Samarco - The decrease in Mineral Resources is due to changes in geotechnical parameters partially offset by economic assumptions.\n- 8   Approximate drill hole spacings used to classify the reserves were:\n\n| Deposit   | Proved Reserves   | Probable Reserves   |\n|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|\n| WAIO      | 50m \u00d7 50m         | 150m \u00d7 50m          |\n\n- 9   WAIO - Recovery was 100% for all ore types (tonnage basis).\n- 10  WAIO - Iron ore is marketed for WAIO as Lump (direct blast furnace feed) and Fines (sinter plant feed).\n- 11  WAIO - Cut-off grades used to estimate Ore Reserves range from 50-62%Fe for all material types. Ore delivered to process facility.\n- 12  WAIO - Ore Reserves are all located on State Agreement mining leases that guarantee the right to mine. Across WAIO, State Government approvals (including environmental and heritage clearances) are required before commencing mining operations in a particular area. Included in the Ore Reserves are select areas where one or more approvals remain outstanding, but where, based on the technical investigations carried out as part of the mine planning process and company knowledge and experience of the approvals process, it is expected that such approvals will be obtained as part of the normal course of business and within the time frame required by the current mine schedule.\n- 13  WAIO - The increase in BKM ore type and reserve life was due to an updated resource estimate and updated geotechnical parameters partially offset by depletion. BKM Bene ore type is included in the BKM ore type.",

The decrease in Coal Reserves and reserve life was mainly due to changes in the mine plan and changes in modifying factors.\n- 13  Percentage of secondary thermal products for Reserves with coal type Met/Th are: Peak Downs 6%; Saraji 1%; Blackwater 2%; Daunia 3%. Contributions may vary year on year based on market demand.\n- 14  Peak Downs - The increase in reserve life was due to a reduction in the nominated production rate.\n- 15  Caval Ridge - The increase in reserve life was due to a reduction in the nominated production rate.\n- 16  Saraji South - Norwich Park has been renamed to Saraji South and remained on care and maintenance. The decrease of Coal Reserves and reserve life was mainly due to changes in modifying factors.\n- 17  Daunia - The increase in reserve life was due to a reduction in the nominated production rate.",

We are working to bring forward Jansen Stage 1 first production to 2026 and assessing options to accelerate Jansen Stage 2. Approximately US$740 million in capital expenditure is planned for work at Jansen Stage 1 in FY2023, which is expected to continue to focus on civil and mechanical construction on the surface and underground, as well as equipment procurement and port construction.\n\nTable 3 - Employees by category and diversity for FY2022\n\n| Commodity                             | Project and   ownership                | Project scope/  capacity 1                                                                                                                                                 | Capital expenditure 1 US$M            | Date of initial   production          | Progress/  comments                                       |\n|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                       |                                        |                                                                                                                                                                            | Budget                                | Target                                |                                                           |\n| Projects completed during FY2022      | Projects completed during FY2022       | Projects completed during FY2022                                                                                                                                           | Projects completed during FY2022      | Projects completed during FY2022      | Projects completed during FY2022                          |\n| Potash                                | Jansen Potash Project   (Canada)  100% | Investment to finish the excavation and lining  of the production and service shafts, and to  continue the installation of essential surface  infrastructure and utilities | 2,972                                 | CY2027                                | Completed in   June 2022                                  |\n| Projects in execution at 30 June 2022 | Projects in execution at 30 June 2022  | Projects in execution at 30 June 2022                                                                                                                                      | Projects in execution at 30 June 2022 | Projects in execution at 30 June 2022 | Projects in execution at 30 June 2022                     |\n| Potash                                | Jansen Stage 1  (Canada)  100%         | Design, engineering and construction of  an underground potash mine and surface  infrastructure, with capacity to produce  4.35 Mtpa                                       | 5,723                                 | CY2027                                | Approved in   August 2021.

This included maintenance expenditure of US$2.8 billion and exploration of US$256 million.\n\nCapital and exploration expenditure of approximately US$7.6 billion and US$9.0 billion are expected for the 2023 and 2024 financial years, including a US$0.4 billion exploration program planned in the 2023 financial year. In the medium term, capital and exploration expenditure of approximately US$10 billion per annum on average is expected.

        "page_content": "## 8  Legal proceedings\n\nThe Group is involved from time to time in legal proceedings and governmental investigations of a character normally incidental to our business, including claims and pending actions against it seeking damages, or clarification or prosecution of legal rights and regulatory inquiries regarding business practices. Insurance or other indemnification protection may offset the financial impact on the Group of a successful claim.\n\nThis section summarises the significant legal proceedings and investigations and associated matters in which the Group is currently involved or has finalised since our last Annual Report. The timing of many of the legal proceedings and investigations continue to be delayed or uncertain as a result of court closures or delays in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n## Legal proceedings relating to the failure of the Fund\u00e3o tailings dam at the Samarco iron ore operations in Minas Gerais and Esp\u00edrito Santo (Samarco dam failure)\n\nThe Group is engaged in numerous legal proceedings relating to the Samarco dam failure. While there has been progress in priority areas, such as individual compensation and indemnification for the damage caused by the dam failure, it is not possible at this time to provide a range of possible outcomes for all proceedings or a reliable estimate of potential future exposures. There are numerous additional lawsuits against Samarco relating to the dam failure to which the Group is not party. Currently, there are approximately 54 ongoing public civil claims and 36 that are suspended. The most significant of these proceedings are summarised below.\n\n## R$20 billion public civil claim commenced by the Federal Government of Brazil, states of Esp\u00edrito Santo and Minas Gerais and other authorities (R$20 billion Public Civil claim)\n\nOn 30 November 2015, the Federal Government of Brazil, states of Esp\u00edrito Santo and Minas Gerais and other public authorities collectively filed a public civil claim before the 12 th Federal Court of Belo Horizonte against Samarco and its shareholders, BHP Billiton Brasil Ltda. (BHP Brasil) and Vale S.A. (Vale), seeking the establishment of a fund of up to R$20 billion (approximately US$4 billion) in aggregate for clean-up costs and damages.\n\nOn 2 March 2016, Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale, entered into a Framework Agreement with the states of Esp\u00edrito Santo and Minas Gerais and other public authorities to establish a foundation (Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova) to develop and execute environmental and socioeconomic programs (Programs) to remediate and provide compensation for damage caused by the Samarco dam failure.\n\nThe term of the Framework Agreement is 15 years, renewable for periods of one year successively until all obligations under the Framework Agreement have been performed.\n\nOperating and Financial Review\n\nUnder the Framework Agreement, Samarco is responsible, as a primary obligor, for funding Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's annual calendar year budget for the duration of the Framework Agreement. The amount of funding for each calendar year will be dependent on the remediation and compensation projects to be undertaken in a particular year. To the extent that Samarco does not meet its funding obligations under the Framework Agreement, each of BHP Brasil and Vale has funding obligations under the Framework Agreement, as secondary obligors, in proportion to its 50 per cent shareholding in Samarco.\n\n## R$155 billion public civil claim commenced by the Federal Public Prosecutors' Office (R$155 billion Federal Public Prosecutors' Office claim)\n\nOn 3 May 2016, the Brazilian Federal Public Prosecutors' Office filed a public civil claim before the 12 th Federal Court of Belo Horizonte against Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale - as well as 18 other public entities (which has since been reduced to five defendants 1 by the 12 th Federal Court) - seeking R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) for reparation, compensation and collective moral damages in relation to the Samarco dam failure.\n\nThis public civil claim and the R$20 billion Public Civil claim are broad claims that encompass the majority of the public civil claims filed against Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale. For this reason, the 12 th Federal Court has suspended other public civil claims while negotiations continue in relation to the settlement of the R$155 billion Federal Public Prosecutors' Office claim.\n\nThis public civil claim was suspended for a period of two years from the date of ratification of the Governance Agreement (described below) on 8 August 2018.\n\nOn 19 March 2021, the parties to the case agreed to extend the suspension of this case until 27 April 2021. Although the stay period has formally elapsed, neither party has made any filings to date, and the parties are engaged in negotiations to seek a definitive settlement (summarised below).\n\n## Governance Agreement\n\nOn 25 June 2018, Samarco, BHP Brasil, Vale, the other parties to the Framework Agreement, the Public Prosecutors' Office 2 and the Public Defense Office 3 entered into a Governance Agreement, which settled the R$20 billion Public Civil claim and established a process to renegotiate the Programs over two years to progress settlement of the R$155 billion Federal Public Prosecutors' Office claim.\n\nUnder the Governance Agreement, renegotiation of the Programs will be based on certain agreed principles, including full reparation consistent with Brazilian law, the requirement for a technical basis for any proposed changes, consideration of findings from experts appointed by Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale, consideration\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nof findings from experts appointed by prosecutors and consideration of feedback from impacted communities.\n\nSince early CY2021, the parties have been engaging in negotiations to seek a definitive and substantive settlement of claims relating to the dam failure. The negotiations are overseen by the President of the National Council of Justice, as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in Brazil, and are expected to continue until at least the expected end of the term of the current President on 31 August 2022. Outcomes of the negotiations are highly uncertain, and it is therefore not possible to provide a reliable estimate of potential outcomes and there is a risk that a negotiated outcome may be materially higher than amounts currently reflected in the Samarco dam failure provision. Until revisions to the Programs are agreed, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova will continue to implement the Programs in accordance with the terms of the Framework Agreement and the Governance Agreement.\n\n## Enforcement Proceedings\n\nSince 7 January 2020, the 12 th Federal Court of Belo Horizonte has issued several decisions creating 13 enforcement proceedings (Enforcement Proceedings) linked to the R$20 billion Public Civil claim and R$155 billion Federal Public Prosecutors' Office claim described above.\n\nIssues covered by these Enforcement Proceedings include environmental recovery, human health risk and ecological risk, resettlement of affected communities, infrastructure and development, registration of certain impacted individuals under the Programs and indemnities for people impacted by the dam failure, resumption of economic activities, water supply for human consumption and hiring of technical advisers to impacted people, and restructuring Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's management system, among other key delivery areas.\n\nIn the context of these Enforcement Proceedings, Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale are seeking determinations, including, among other things, the repealing of fishing bans ordered by the courts or administration entities, set-off of compensation paid against future damages that may need to be paid, and regarding the hiring and supervision of technical assistants to impacted people.\n\nIn August 2020, a Simplified Indemnification System (the Novel System) was created by the 12 th Federal Court of Belo Horizonte with specific rules designed for those who could not easily demonstrate their status as an impacted person based on 'rough justice' principles. Led by Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova, the Novel System has, as at the date of this Report, settled with more than 68,000 claimants who were able to prove their damages, with approximately 66,500 claims already having been paid.\n\n- 1 Currently, solely BHP Brasil, Vale and Samarco, the Federal Government and the state of Minas Gerais are defendants.\n- 2 The Public Prosecutors' Office includes the Federal, State of Minas Gerais and State of Esp\u00edrito Santo public prosecutors' offices.\n- 3 The Public Defense Office includes the Federal, State of Minas Gerais and State of Esp\u00edrito Santo public defense offices.",

        "page_content": "## 8  Legal proceedings continued\n\nOn 26 June 2022, the President of the Federal Court of Appeals issued a preliminary ruling applying to impacted persons from Naque (a city in Minas Gerais) regarding the Novel System, determining that its terms do not provide a full release from damages. The amounts paid under the Novel System should therefore be considered as a 'minimum indemnification' granting a partial release from damages. For the same reasons, it was also determined that impacted persons should have the option to seek legal representation when settling claims under the Novel System, and that the Novel System settlement agreement does not prevent impacted persons from pursuing lawsuits in foreign jurisdictions. On 1 July 2022, the Federal Prosecutors filed a motion requesting the extension of the decision to all affected areas, as well as any settlements which have already been paid. On 6 July 2022, BHP Brasil filed its appeal and, as at the date of this Report, no decision has been made.\n\nOn 30 June 2022, the 12 th Federal Court of Belo Horizonte extended the deadline for claim applications under the Novel System from 30 June 2022 to 31 August 2022.\n\n## Samarco's judicial reorganisation\n\nOn 9 April 2021, Samarco filed for judicial reorganisation (JR) with the Second Business State Court for the Belo Horizonte District of Minas Gerais (JR Court). The JR proceeding seeks to enable Samarco to negotiate and implement an orderly restructuring of its financial indebtedness in order to establish a sustainable financial position for Samarco, among other things, to continue to rebuild its operations and meet its Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova obligations. Samarco filed for JR following multiple enforcement actions filed by some of Samarco's creditors that threatened its operations. The JR Court granted Samarco's JR motion on 12 April 2021 and granted a stay of the enforcement actions.\n\nOn 10 June 2021, Samarco submitted its first proposed Plan of Reorganisation (Plan) to the JR Court. Certain of Samarco's creditors have submitted formal objections to the Plan.\n\nOn 18 August 2021, the State Prosecutor's Office filed an application to hold BHP Brasil and Vale responsible for Samarco's debt. On 18 October 2021, certain creditors of Samarco filed a similar application with the same purpose. Neither application has been decided yet.\n\nPursuant to the list of creditors produced by Judicial Administrators appointed by the JR Court, Samarco's obligation to fund Renova is not subject to the JR. Certain creditors of Samarco have challenged the Judicial Administrators' list of creditors. Among other things, such creditors are seeking to disallow shareholders' claims against Samarco and impair Samarco's obligation to fund Renova. No final decision has been rendered on these issues yet.\n\nCertain creditors of Samarco have also requested that the JR Court appoint an examiner and a judicial manager for Samarco. The JR Court has not ruled on that request yet.\n\nOn 18 April 2022, certain creditors of Samarco voted to reject the Plan in a General Meeting of Creditors (GMC). Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale have challenged the votes of such creditors and the JR Court has not ruled on such challenge yet.\n\nOn 18 May 2022, certain creditors of Samarco submitted an alternative plan of reorganisation (Lenders Plan), which, among other things, caps Samarco's Renova funding obligations and contemplates a change in Samarco's control. On the same date, the local labour unions also filed an alternative plan with the support of Samarco's shareholders. Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale filed objections to the Lenders Plan, which are pending. No plan of reorganisation has been approved or confirmed.\n\nNo BHP entity is a debtor in Samarco's JR case. BHP Brasil is participating in Samarco's JR proceeding in its capacities as a shareholder and creditor of Samarco.\n\n## United States Chapter 15 case\n\nOn 19 April 2021, Samarco filed a petition with the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York seeking recognition of the JR proceeding under Chapter 15 of the US Bankruptcy Code. On 13 May 2021, the US Bankruptcy Court granted recognition of the JR proceeding as a 'foreign main proceeding' and accordingly stayed enforcement actions against Samarco in US territory. No BHP entity is a debtor in Samarco's Chapter 15 case. BHP Brasil is participating in Samarco's Chapter 15 proceeding in its capacities as a shareholder and creditor of Samarco.\n\n## Civil public actions commenced by the State Prosecutors' Office in the state of Minas Gerais (Mariana CPA cases)\n\nThe State Prosecutors of Mariana have commenced several civil public actions (CPA) against Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale.\n\nOn 10 December 2015, the State Prosecutors' Office in the state of Minas Gerais filed a CPA against Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale before the State Court in Mariana claiming indemnification (amount not specified) for moral and material damages to an unspecified group of individuals affected by the Samarco dam failure, including the payment of costs for housing and social and economic assistance (CPA Mariana I).\n\nOn 2 October 2018, the parties reached a settlement dismissing the claim, which was ratified by the Court. Under this settlement, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova has reached more than 100 individual agreements with impacted families in Mariana for the payment of damages.\n\nIn connection with CPA Mariana I, the State Prosecutors (Minas Gerais) started enforcement proceedings against Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale. There are seven enforcement proceedings under way seeking (i) to set a deadline for completion of resettlement of the residents of Mariana's districts and for fines to be imposed for delays to resettlement; (ii) to set the final term that will allow new households to join the resettlement; (iii) payment of compensation to affected individuals for delivery of houses below standard; (iv) to guarantee access to water sources for the families of the collective resettlements; (v) payment of fines for alleged delays in presenting proposals and making payments to affected individuals; and (vi) payment of compensation to impacted individuals who allege that they have not yet received compensation and a penalty for the alleged delays in making such payments.\n\nIn addition to CPA Mariana I, the State Prosecutors (Minas Gerais) commenced nine other CPAs in Mariana against Samarco, BHP Brasil, Vale and, in some cases, Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova. The claims presented in those CPAs are related to damages that, according to the State Prosecutors, are not covered by CPA Mariana I.\n\nThe remaining CPAs have either been settled by the parties, including BHP Brasil, or the claims to which the CPAs relate have been dismissed (though the decisions are not yet final). Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova is responsible for any pending obligations set forth in the settlement agreements relating to the CPAs.\n\n## Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova dissolution lawsuit\n\nOn 24 February 2021, the Minas Gerais State Prosecutor filed a CPA against Samarco, BHP Brasil, Vale and Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova seeking the dissolution of Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova. The plaintiffs are seeking R$10 billion (approximately US$2 billion) for moral damages and an injunction for the immediate intervention of Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova was also made, alleging the need to preserve information and documents produced by Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova to evaluate criminal and civil responsibilities. On 25 May 2021, the Superior Court of Justice granted urgent relief to suspend the lawsuit. As at the date of this Report, the Court's decision regarding the merits remains pending.\n\n## Civil public action commenced by the State Prosecutors' Office in the state of Esp\u00edrito Santo and Minas Gerais (CPA Advertising)\n\nOn 11 May 2021, Federal and State Prosecutors (Minas Gerais and Esp\u00edrito Santo) filed a CPA against Samarco, BHP Brasil, Vale and Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova, challenging Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's advertising expenditures. The plaintiffs requested injunctive relief for Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova to cease advertisements and stop incurring new expenses on advertising. The plaintiffs requested approximately R$56 million (approximately US$11 million) to be paid as compensation to the communities and approximately R$28 million (approximately US$5 million) to be spent on execution of Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova's socioeconomic and socio-environmental programs. A ruling is still pending.",

        "page_content": "## Civil public action commenced by Associations concerning the use of tanfloc for water treatment (R$120 billion Associations claim)\n\nOn 28 October 2021, Vila Lenira Residents Association, State of Esp\u00edrito Santo Rural Producers and Artisans Association, Colatina Velha Neighborhood Residents Association, and United for the Progress of Palmeiras Neighborhood Association filed a lawsuit against Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale and others, including the State of Minas Gerais, the State of Espirito Santo and the Federal Government. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants carried out a clandestine study on the citizens of the locations affected by the Fund\u00e3o's Dam Failure, using tanfloc - a tannin-based flocculant/ coagulant - that is currently used for wastewater treatment applications. The plaintiffs claim that this product allegedly put the population at risk due to its alleged experimental qualities.\n\nThe plaintiffs are seeking multiple kinds of relief - material damage, moral damages, loss of profits - and that the defendants should pay for water supply in all locations where there is no water source other than the Doce River.\n\nOn 25 July 2022, Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale presented their defences individually, as well as the State of Minas Gerais, the State of Esp\u00edrito Santo and the Federal Government. The Court's decision is still pending.\n\n## Public civil claims currently suspended\n\nApproximately 20 of the proceedings to which BHP Brasil is a party are currently suspended due to their connection with R$20 billion Public Civil claim and R$155 billion Federal Public Prosecutors' Office claim. There has not yet been a ruling in these cases.\n\nThe suspended proceedings include proceedings commenced by the State Prosecutors (Minas Gerais and Esp\u00edrito Santo), Public Defenders (Minas Gerais and Esp\u00edrito Santo), and the states of Minas Gerais and Esp\u00edrito Santo against Samarco, BHP Brasil, Vale and Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Renova. The claims relate to environmental remediation measures, compensation for the impacts of the dam failure, including moral damages, reconstruction of properties and populations, including historical, religious, cultural, social, environmental and intangible heritages affected by the dam failure, and suspension of public water supply, among others.\n\n## Other civil proceedings in Brazil\n\nAs noted above, BHP Brasil has been named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits relating to the Samarco dam failure. In addition, government inquiries and investigations relating to the Samarco dam failure have been commenced by numerous agencies of the Brazilian Government and are ongoing, including criminal investigations by the federal and state police, and by federal prosecutors.\n\nOperating and Financial Review\n\nBHP Brasil's potential liabilities, if any, resulting from other pending and future claims, lawsuits and enforcement actions relating to the Samarco dam failure, together with the potential cost of implementing remedies sought in the various proceedings, cannot be reliably estimated at this time and therefore a provision has not been recognised and nor has any contingent liability been quantified for these matters. Ultimately, these could have a material adverse impact on BHP's business, competitive position, cash flows, prospects, liquidity and shareholder returns. For more information on the Samarco dam failure refer to OFR 8.\n\nAs at June 2022, Samarco had been named as a defendant in more than 57,000 small claims for moral damages in which people argue their public water service was interrupted for between five and 10 days. BHP Brasil is a co-defendant in more than 24,000 of these cases.\n\nThe Brazilian Code of Civil Procedure provides that repetitive claims can be settled through a system known as the Resolution of Repetitive Demands Procedure (IRDR). Under the IRDR, a court will hear a 'pilot case' representative of such recurring legal matters and the judgment in that decision will set a precedent for the resolution of similar cases in that jurisdiction. An IRDR has been established in Minas Gerais and the court in the pilot case has ruled that the mandatory parameter for resolution of claims will be the payment of R$2,000 (approximately US$400) per individual claim for moral damages due to the suspension of public water supply. Appeals before higher courts are pending judgment. Meanwhile, Samarco has reached settlement in more than 9,900 individual cases.\n\n## Criminal charges\n\nOn 20 October 2016, the Federal Prosecutors' Office in Brazil filed criminal charges against Samarco, BHP Brasil, Vale and certain of their employees and former employees in the Federal Court of Ponte Nova, Minas Gerais. On 3 March 2017, BHP Brasil and the charged employees and former employees of BHP Brasil (Affected Individuals) filed their preliminary defences. The Federal Court granted Habeas Corpus petitions in favour of all eight Affected Individuals terminating the charges against those individuals. The Federal Prosecutors' Office appealed seven of the decisions with hearings of the appeals still pending. BHP Brasil rejects outright the charges against BHP Brasil and the Affected Individuals and will defend the charges and fully support each of the Affected Individuals in their defences of the charges.\n\n## Australian class action claim\n\nBHP Group Limited is named as a defendant in a shareholder class action in the Federal Court of Australia on behalf of persons who acquired shares in BHP Group Limited on the Australian Securities Exchange or shares in BHP Group Plc (now known as BHP Group (UK) Ltd) on the London Stock Exchange and Johannesburg Stock Exchange in periods prior to the Samarco dam failure. The amount of damages sought in the class action is unspecified.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOn 12 May 2020, BHP Group Limited filed an application seeking declaratory relief which, if successful, would narrow the group of claimants in the class action. BHP Group Limited was unsuccessful at first instance and on appeal to the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia. The High Court of Australia heard an appeal from the Full Court's decision on 9 August 2022 and a decision is pending.\n\n## United Kingdom group action claim\n\nBHP Group (UK) Ltd (formerly BHP Group Plc) and BHP Group Limited are named as defendants in group action claims for damages that have been filed in the courts of England. These claims have been filed on behalf of certain individuals, governments, businesses and communities in Brazil allegedly impacted by the Samarco dam failure.\n\nOn 7 August 2019, the BHP parties filed a preliminary application to strike out or stay this action on jurisdictional and other procedural grounds. That application was successful before the High Court and the action was dismissed. However, on 8 July 2022, the Court of Appeal reversed the dismissal decision and allowed the action to proceed in England. The BHP parties will now seek leave to appeal the Court of Appeal judgment to the Supreme Court.\n\n## 9 Shareholder information\n\n## 9.1  History and development\n\nBHP Group Limited (formerly BHP Billiton Limited, then BHP Limited and, before that, The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited) was incorporated in 1885 and is registered in Australia with ABN 49 004 028 077.

BHP Group Limited is now the ultimate BHP parent company of all subsidiaries within the BHP Group.\n\n## 9.4 Constitution\n\nThis section sets out a summary of BHP Group Limited's Constitution, as well as other related arrangements under applicable laws and regulations.\n\nProvisions of the Constitution of BHP Group Limited can be amended only where such amendment is approved by special resolution. A 'special resolution' is a resolution that is passed by 75 per cent (i.e. at least three quarters) of the votes cast by BHP shareholders entitled to vote being in favour of the resolution.\n\n## Directors\n\nThe Board may exercise all powers of BHP, other than those that are reserved for BHP shareholders to exercise in a general meeting.\n\n## Power to issue securities\n\nUnder the Constitution, the Board of Directors has the power to issue any BHP shares or other securities (including redeemable shares) with preferred, deferred or other special rights, obligations or restrictions. The Board may issue shares on any terms it considers appropriate, provided that:\n\n- -  the issue does not affect any special rights of shareholders\n- -  if required, the issue is approved by shareholders\n- -  if the issue is of a class other than ordinary shares, the rights attaching to the class are expressed at the date of issue\n\n## Restrictions on voting by Directors\n\nA Director may not vote in respect of any contract or arrangement or any other proposal in which they have a material personal interest except in certain prescribed circumstances, including (subject to applicable laws) where the material personal interest:\n\n- -  arises because the Director is a shareholder of BHP and is held in common with the other shareholders of BHP\n\n- -  arises in relation to the Director's remuneration as a Director of BHP\n- -  relates to a contract BHP is proposing to enter into that is subject to approval by the shareholders and will not impose any obligation on BHP if it is not approved by the shareholders\n- -  arises merely because the Director is a guarantor or has given an indemnity or security for all or part of a loan, or proposed loan, to BHP\n- -  arises merely because the Director has a right of subrogation in relation to a guarantee or indemnity referred to above\n- -  relates to a contract that insures, or would insure, the Director against liabilities the Director incurs as an officer of BHP, but only if the contract does not make BHP or a related body corporate the insurer\n- -  relates to any payment by BHP or a related body corporate in respect of an indemnity permitted by law, or any contract relating to such an indemnity, or\n- -  is in a contract, or proposed contract with, or for the benefit of, or on behalf of, a related body corporate and arises merely because the Director is a director of a related body corporate\n\nIf a Director has a material personal interest and is not entitled to vote on a proposal, they will not be counted in the quorum for any vote on a resolution concerning the material personal interest.\n\n## Loans by Directors\n\nAny Director may lend money to BHP at interest with or without security or may, for a commission or profit, guarantee the repayment of any money borrowed by BHP and underwrite or guarantee the subscription of shares or securities of BHP or of any corporation in which BHP may be interested without being disqualified as a Director and without being liable to account to BHP for any commission or profit.\n\n## Appointment and retirement of Directors\n\n## Appointment of Directors\n\nThe Constitution provides that a person may be appointed as a Director of BHP by the existing Directors of BHP or may be elected by the shareholders in a general meeting.\n\nAny person appointed as a Director of BHP by the existing Directors will hold office only until the next general meeting that includes an election of Directors.\n\nA person may be nominated by shareholders as a Director of BHP if:\n\n- -  a shareholder provides a valid written notice of the nomination; and\n- -  the person nominated by the shareholder satisfies candidature for the office and consents in writing to his or her nomination as a Director,\n\nand the nomination is provided at least 40 business days before the date of the general meeting. The person nominated as a Director\n\nmay be elected to the Board by ordinary resolution passed in a general meeting.\n\n## Retirement of Directors\n\nThe Board has a policy under which all Nonexecutive Directors must, if they wish to remain on the Board, seek re-election by shareholders annually. This policy took effect from the 2011 Annual General Meetings (AGMs) and replaced the previous system that required Non-executive Directors to submit themselves to shareholders for re-election at least every three years.\n\nA Director may be removed by BHP in accordance with applicable law and must vacate his or her office as a Director in certain circumstances set out in the Constitution. There is no requirement for a Director to retire on reaching a certain age.\n\n## Rights attaching to shares\n\n## Dividend rights\n\nUnder Australian law, dividends on shares may be paid only if the company's assets exceed its liabilities immediately before the dividend is determined and the excess is sufficient for payment of the dividend, the payment of the dividend is fair and reasonable to the company's shareholders as a whole and the payment of the dividend does not materially prejudice the company's ability to pay its creditors.\n\nThe Constitution provides that payment of any dividend may be made in any manner, by any means and in any currency determined by the Board.\n\nAll unclaimed dividends may be invested or otherwise used by the Board for the benefit of BHP Group Limited until claimed or otherwise disposed of according to law. BHP Group Limited is governed by the Victorian unclaimed monies legislation, which requires BHP Group Limited to pay to the State Revenue Office any unclaimed dividend payments of A$20 or more that have remained unclaimed for over 12 months.\n\n## Voting rights\n\nFor the purposes of determining which shareholders are entitled to attend or vote at a meeting of BHP Group Limited, and how many votes such shareholder may cast, the Notice of Meeting will specify when a shareholder must be entered on the Register of Shareholders in order to have the right to attend or vote at the meeting. The specified time must be not more than 48 hours before the time of the meeting.\n\nShareholders who wish to appoint a proxy to attend, vote or speak at a meeting of BHP Group Limited on their behalf must deposit the form appointing a proxy so that it is received not less than 48 hours before the time of the meeting.",

The meeting provides an update for shareholders on our performance and offers an opportunity for shareholders to ask questions and vote.

No shareholder may convene a general meeting of BHP except where entitled under law to do so. Any Director may convene a general meeting whenever the Director thinks fit.

For information on Underlying attributable profit (Continuing operations) for FY2022 refer to OFR 4.2 and OFR 11.\n\nThe Board will assess, at each reporting period, the ability to pay amounts additional to the minimum payment, in accordance with the Capital Allocation Framework, as described in OFR 2.2.\n\nIn FY2022, we determined our dividends and other distributions in US dollars as it is our main functional currency.\n\n## Payments\n\nBHP Group Limited shareholders may have their cash dividends paid directly into their bank account in Australian dollars, UK pounds sterling, New Zealand dollars, or US dollars, provided they have submitted direct credit details and if required, a valid currency election nominating a financial institution to the BHP Share Registrar in Australia no later than close of business on the dividend reinvestment plan election date. BHP Group Limited shareholders who do not provide their direct credit details will receive dividend payments by way of a cheque in Australian dollars.\n\n## Dividend reinvestment plan\n\nBHP offers a dividend reinvestment plan to registered shareholders, which provides the opportunity to use cash dividends to purchase BHP shares in the market. Following the unification of BHP's DLC structure, BHP made amendments to its dividend reinvestment programme to provide former shareholders of BHP Group Plc (now known as BHP Group (UK) Ltd) with an ongoing opportunity to participate in the BHP Group Limited dividend reinvestment plan.",

ADR program-related expenses include legal and accounting fees, listing fees, expenses related to investor relations in the United States, fees payable to service providers for the distribution of material to ADR holders, expenses of Citibank as administrator of the ADS Direct Plan and expenses to remain in compliance with applicable laws.\n\nCitibank has further agreed to waive other ADR program-related expenses for FY2022, amounting to US$18,195.03 which are associated with the administration of the ADR program (FY2021: US$24,189.85).\n\nThe ADSs issued under our ADR program trade on the NYSE under the stock ticker BHP. As of 4 August 2022, there were 142,540,203 ADSs on issue and outstanding in the BHP Group Limited ADR program.\n\n## Charges\n\nHolders are also required to pay the following charges in connection with depositing of ordinary shares and surrendering ADSs for cancellation and for the purpose of withdrawing deposited securities: taxes and other governmental charges, registration fees, transmission and delivery expenses, expenses and charges incurred by the depositary in the conversion of foreign currency, fees and expenses of the depositary in connection with compliance with exchange control regulations and other regulatory requirements and fees and expenses incurred by the depositary or other nominee in connection with servicing or delivery of deposit securities.\n\n## 9.8 Government regulations\n\nOur assets are subject to a broad range of laws and regulations imposed by governments and regulatory bodies. These regulations touch all aspects of our assets, including how we extract, process and explore for minerals and how we conduct our business, including regulations governing matters such as environmental protection, land rehabilitation, occupational health and safety, human rights, the rights and interests of Indigenous peoples, competition, foreign investment, export, marketing of minerals, and taxes.\n\nThe ability to extract and process minerals is fundamental to BHP. In most jurisdictions, the rights to extract mineral deposits are owned by the government. We obtain the right to access the land and extract the product by entering into licences or leases with the government that owns the mineral deposit. We also rely on governments to grant the rights necessary to transport and treat the extracted material to prepare it for sale. The terms of the lease or licence, including the time period of the lease or licence, vary depending on the laws of the relevant government or terms negotiated with the relevant government. Generally, we own the product we extract and we are required to pay royalties or other taxes to the government. The Queensland Government recently announced that a 10-year\n\nfreeze on coal royalties would expire on 30 June 2022, with a new progressive royalty system to apply from 1 July 2022. The revised system replaced the fixed royalty amount of 15 per cent on any amounts above A$150 per tonne with a tiered approach, which increases the royalty amount payable as the price of coal passes certain monetary thresholds. The royalty rates for amounts up to and including A$150 will not change despite the expiry of the royalty freeze. For more information refer to OFR 5.1.\n\nThe rights to explore for minerals are granted to us by the government that owns the natural resources we wish to explore. Usually, the right to explore carries with it the obligation to spend a defined amount of money on the exploration, or to undertake particular exploration activities.\n\nEnvironmental protection, mine closure and land rehabilitation, and occupational health and safety are principally regulated by governments and to a lesser degree, if applicable, by leases. These obligations often require us to make substantial expenditures to minimise or remediate the environmental impact of our assets and to ensure the safety of our employees and contractors and the communities where we operate. Regulations setting emissions standards for fuels used to power vehicles and equipment at our assets and the modes of transport used in our supply chains can also have a substantial impact, both directly and indirectly, on the markets\n\nfor these products, with flow-on impacts on our costs. For more information on these types of obligations refer to OFR 7.\n\nThe Parliament of Western Australia recently passed the Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 2021 (WA) (ACH Act). The ACH Act, which received assent on 22 December 2021, will replace the Aboriginal Cultural Heritage Act 1972 (WA), concluding more than three years of consultation with Indigenous Australians, industry representatives, heritage professionals and the Western Australian community. The ACH Act will strengthen the Western Australian government's authority to regulate land use including mining activities, and the consultation process in relation to Aboriginal cultural heritage sites in Western Australia. Before the ACH Act comes into operation, there will be a transitional period of at least 12 months during which subordinate legislation, statutory guidelines and operational policies will be developed to ensure the ACH Act will achieve its intended effects. There is potential for the ACH Act to impact BHP's mining operations or future access to mining areas. For more information refer to OFR 7.13.\n\nFrom time to time, certain trade sanctions are adopted by the United Nations (UN) Security Council and/or various governments, including in the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Union (EU), China and Australia against certain countries, entities or individuals,",

If applicable, disclosure is required even where the activities, transactions or dealings are conducted outside the United States by non-US persons in compliance with applicable law, and whether or not the activities are sanctionable under US law. Provided in this section is certain information concerning activities of certain affiliates of BHP that took place in FY2022. BHP believes that these activities are not sanctionable either as\n\nbeing outside the scope of US sanctions, or within the scope of a specific licence issued by the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).\n\nOn 30 November 2018, BHP Billiton Petroleum Great Britain Ltd (BHP GB), a wholly owned subsidiary of BHP, and its co-venturers in the Bruce and Keith gas and oil fields offshore United Kingdom (BP Exploration Operating Company (BP), Marubeni Oil & Gas (UK) Limited (Marubeni) and Total E&P UK Limited (Total)) completed the sale of their interests in the Bruce and Keith gas and oil fields to Serica Energy (UK) Limited (Serica) (the Bruce and Keith Transaction). BHP divested its entire licence interests in Bruce and Keith but retained the obligation to fund decommissioning in accordance with its previous licence interest.\n\nThe transfer of licence interests and retention of decommissioning liabilities for the Bruce and Keith co-venturers in the respective gas and oil fields is described below:\n\n|          | Bruce                   | Bruce                             | Bruce                            | Keith                   | Keith                             | Keith                            |\n|----------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n|          | Pre-sale   interest   % | Post-sale  licence   interest   % | Post-sale  decom.   interest   % | Pre-sale   interest   % | Post-sale  licence   interest   % | Post-sale  decom.   interest   % |\n| BP       | 37                      | 1                                 | 37                               | 34.83                   | 0                                 | 34.83                            |\n| Total    | 43.25                   | 1                                 | 43.25                            | 25                      | 0                                 | 25                               |\n| BHP GB   | 16                      | 0                                 | 16                               | 31.83                   | 0                                 | 31.83                            |\n| Marubeni | 3.65                    | 0                                 | 0                                | 8.33                    | 0                                 | 0                                |\n| Serica   | 0                       | 98                                | 3.75                             | 0                       | 100                               | 8.33                             |\n\nWhile the sale closed on 30 November 2018, it was effective in economic terms as of 1 January 2018. In addition to initial cash consideration received from Serica at completion, BHP:\n\n- -  subsequently received a share of pre-tax net cash flow attributable to its historic interest in the Bruce and Keith gas and oil fields of 60 per cent during December 2018, 50 per cent in CY2019 and 40 per cent in each of CY2020 and CY2021 under a Net Cash Flow Sharing Deed; and\n- -  will continue to receive a share of projected decommissioning costs up to a specified cap.\n\nThe Bruce platform provides transportation and processing services to the nearby Rhum gas field pursuant to a contract between the Bruce owners and Rhum owners (the Bruce-Rhum Agreement). At the same time as the Bruce and Keith Transaction, Serica acquired from BP its 50 per cent interest and operatorship of the Rhum gas field. The Rhum gas field is now owned by a 50:50 unincorporated joint venture arrangement between Serica and Iranian Oil Company (UK) Limited (IOC). IOC is an indirect subsidiary of the National Iranian Oil Company, which is a corporation owned by the Government of Iran.\n\nOFAC issued licence No. IA-2018-352294-2 (the OFAC Licence) authorising BP, Serica and all US persons and US-owned or controlled foreign entities identified in the licence application to provide goods, services and support for the operation, maintenance and production of the Rhum gas field, and goods, services and support to the Bruce platform for a period from 2 November 2018 through 31 October 2019. On 22 October 2019, OFAC renewed this licence through to 28 February 2021, and on 19 January 2021, OFAC renewed the license through to 31 January 2023. OFAC also provided\n\nan assurance that non-US persons would not be exposed to US secondary sanctions for engaging in these activities and transactions involving Rhum or the Bruce platform, namely providing goods, services, and support to the Rhum field.\n\nBHP continues to monitor developments concerning US sanctions with respect to Iran to maintain compliance with applicable sanctions laws and requirements. Although BHP has no ongoing direct dealings with any Iranian party, because BHP received ongoing consideration from Serica related to the sale of its interest in the Bruce-Rhum Agreement, BHP has included this disclosure.\n\nBHP recognised the following transactions in FY2022 related to the Bruce-Rhum Agreement. For the period 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022, BHP received US$6.5 million from Serica under the Net Cash Flow Sharing Deed.\n\n## Shareholding limits\n\nUnder current Australian legislation, the payment of any dividends, interest or other payments by BHP Group Limited to non-resident holders of BHP Group Limited's shares is not restricted by exchange controls or other limitations, except that, in certain circumstances, BHP Group Limited may be required to withhold Australian taxes.\n\nFrom time to time, certain sanctions are adopted by the UN Security Council and/ or various governments, including in the United Kingdom, the United States, the EU and Australia. Those sanctions prohibit or, in some cases, impose certain approval and reporting requirements on transactions involving sanctioned countries, entities and individuals and/or assets controlled or owned by them. Certain transfers into or out of Australia of amounts greater than A$10,000 in any currency may also be subject to reporting requirements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Australian Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (the FATA) restricts certain acquisitions of interests in securities in Australian companies, including BHP Group Limited. Generally, under the FATA, the prior approval of the Australian Treasurer must be obtained for proposals by a foreign person (either alone or together with its associates) to acquire 20 per cent or more of the voting power or issued securities in an Australian company. Lower approval thresholds apply in certain circumstances, including for acquisitions of interests in entities that operate a 'national security business', and acquisitions of interests by foreign government investors of voting power or issued securities in an Australian company.\n\nThe FATA also empowers the Treasurer to make certain orders prohibiting acquisitions by foreign persons in Australian companies, including BHP Group Limited (and requiring divestiture if the acquisition has occurred) where the Treasurer considers the acquisition to be contrary to national security or the national interest.\n\nExcept for the restrictions under the FATA, there are no limitations, either under Australian law or under the Constitution of BHP Group Limited, on the right of non-residents to hold or vote BHP Group Limited ordinary shares.\n\n## Post-unification requirements under FATA\n\nThe Treasurer gave approval under the FATA for the actions taken as part of implementation of the unification of BHP's DLC structure on the conditions set out below:\n\n- -  BHP Group Limited remains an Australian resident company, incorporated under the Corporations Act, that is listed on the ASX under the name 'BHP Group Limited' and trades under that name.\n- -  BHP Group Limited remains the ultimate holding company of, and continues to ultimately manage and control the companies conducting the businesses which are presently conducted by the subsidiaries of BHP Group Limited, including the Minerals and Services businesses, for so long as those businesses form part of the BHP Group.\n- -  The headquarters of BHP Group Limited (including the BHP Group's corporate head offices) are to be in Australia.\n- -  The Chief Executive Officer of BHP Group Limited has their principal office in Australia.\n- -  The centre of administrative and practical management of BHP Group Limited is in Australia and BHP Group Limited's corporate head office activities, of the kind presently carried on in Australia, continue to be managed in Australia.\n- -  The headquarters of BHP Group Limited is publicly acknowledged as being in Australia in significant public announcements and in all public documents.\n- -  The Chief Executive Officer of BHP Group Limited has their principal place of residence in Australia.\n- -  The majority of all regularly scheduled Board meetings of BHP Group Limited in any calendar year occurs in Australia.",

        "page_content": "## Nominated production rate\n\nThe approved average production rate for the remainder of the life-of-asset plan or five-year plan production rate if significantly different to life-of-asset production rate.\n\n## Open-cut (OC)\n\nSurface working in which the working area is kept open to the sky.\n\n## Ore Reserves\n\nThe economically mineable part of a Measured and/or Indicated Mineral Resource. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses, which may occur when the material is mined or extracted and is defined by studies at PreFeasibility or Feasibility level as appropriate that include application of Modifying Factors. Such studies demonstrate that, at the time of reporting, extraction could reasonably be justified (JORC Code, 2012 Edition).\n\n## PCI\n\nPulverised coal injection.\n\n## PEGBC\n\nAssociation of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of the Province of British Columbia.\n\n## Probable (Ore) Reserves\n\nThe economically mineable part of an Indicated and, in some circumstances, a Measured Mineral Resource. The confidence in the Modifying Factors applying to a Probable Ore Reserve is lower than that applying to a Proved Ore Reserve. Consideration of the confidence level of the Modifying Factors is important in conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves. A Probable Ore Reserve has a lower level of confidence than a Proved Ore Reserve but is of sufficient quality to serve as the basis for a decision on the development of the deposit (JORC Code, 2012 Edition).\n\n## Proved (Ore) Reserves\n\nThe economically mineable part of a Measured Mineral Resource. A Proved Ore Reserve implies a high degree of confidence in the Modifying Factors. A Proved Ore Reserve represents the highest confidence category of reserve estimate and implies a high degree of confidence in geological and grade continuity, and the consideration of the Modifying Factors. The style of mineralisation or other factors could mean that Proved Ore Reserves are not achievable in some deposits (JORC Code, 2012 Edition).\n\n## Reserve Life\n\nCurrent stated Ore Reserves estimate divided by the current approved nominated production rate as at the end of the financial year.\n\n## ROM (run of mine)\n\nRun of mine product mined in the course of regular mining activities. Tonnes include allowances for diluting materials and for losses that occur when the material is mined.\n\n## Slag\n\nA by-product of smelting after the desired metal has been extracted from its ore.\n\n## Smelting\n\nThe process of extracting metal from its ore by heating and melting.\n\n## Solvent extraction\n\nA method of separating one or more metals from a leach solution by treating with a solvent that will extract the required metal, leaving the others. The metal is recovered from the solvent by further treatment.\n\n## Stockpile\n\nAn accumulation of ore or mineral built up when demand slackens or when the treatment plant or beneficiation equipment is incomplete or temporarily unable to process the mine output; any heap of material formed to create a buffer for loading or other purposes or material dug and piled for future use.\n\n## Sub-level cave\n\nAn area within an underground mine which uses the sub-level cave method. This is where an ore body is extracted from the upper horizons first and mining progresses downwards level by level.\n\n## Supergene Sulphide\n\nSupergene is a term used to describe nearsurface processes and their products, formed at low temperature and pressure by the activity of meteoric or surface water. Copper in Supergene Sulphide is mainly provident from the copper bearing minerals chalcocite and covellite and is amenable to both grinding/flotation concentration and leaching processes.\n\n## Tailings\n\nThose portions of washed or milled ore that are too poor to be treated further or remain after the required metals and minerals have been extracted.\n\n## Total (Mineral) Resources\n\nThe sum of Inferred, Indicated and Measured Mineral Resources.\n\n## Total (Ore) Reserves\n\nThe sum of Proved and Probable Ore Reserves.\n\n## Transitional Sulphide\n\nTransitional Sulphide is a term used to describe the zone of mineralisation that is a gradation between Supergene Sulphide and Hypogene Sulphide resulting from the incomplete development of the former as it overprints the latter. This results in a more irregular distribution of the three main copper bearing minerals and is amenable to both grinding/flotation concentration and leaching processes.\n\n## Underground (UG)\n\nBelow the surface mining activities.\n\n## Wet tonnes\n\nProduction is usually quoted in terms of wet metric tonnes (wmt). To adjust from wmt to dry metric tonnes (dmt) a factor is applied based on moisture content.\n\nOperating and Financial Review\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 10.2  Terms used in reserves and resources\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAg\n\nsilver\n\nAI 2 O 3\n\nalumina\n\n## Anth\n\nanthracite\n\n## Ash\n\ninorganic material remaining after combustion\n\nAu\n\ngold\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCu\n\ncopper\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCV\n\ncalorific value\n\nFe\n\niron\n\n## Insol.\n\ninsolubles\n\n<!-- image -->\n\npotassium oxide\n\nK 2 O\n\nKCl\n\npotassium chloride\n\nLOI\n\nloss on ignition\n\nLPL\n\nLower Patience Lake (stratigraphic unit)\n\n## Met\n\nmetallurgical coal\n\n## MgO\n\nmagnesium oxide\n\nMo\n\nmolybdenum\n\nNi\n\nnickel\n\n## NiSO 4\n\nnickel sulphate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nP\n\nphosphorous\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPc\n\nphosphorous in concentrate\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPCI\n\npulverised coal injection\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nS\n\nsulphur\n\n## SCu\n\nsoluble copper\n\nSiO\n\nsilica\n\n2\n\nTCu\n\ntotal copper\n\nTh\n\nthermal coal",

It is used to evaluate releasing (or avoiding releasing) different greenhouse gases against a common basis.\n\n## Carbon neutral\n\nCarbon neutral includes all those greenhouse gas emissions as defined for BHP reporting purposes.\n\n## Carbon offsets\n\nThe central purpose of a carbon offset for an organisation is to substitute for internal GHG emission reductions. Offsets may be generated through projects in which GHG emissions are avoided, reduced, removed from the atmosphere or permanently stored (sequestration). Carbon offsets are generally created and independently verified in accordance with either a voluntary program or under a regulatory program. The purchaser of a carbon offset can 'retire' or 'surrender' it to claim",
