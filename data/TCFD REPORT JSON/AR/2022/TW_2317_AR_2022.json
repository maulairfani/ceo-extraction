Although the impact of the pandemic has gradually abated, the monetary expansion policies adopted by various countries to boost the economy during the pandemic have brought about inflation. Subsequently in 2022, the global economy has entered a cycle of interest rate hikes. Although interest rate increases play a pivotal role in controlling inflation and stabilizing economic development, these policies contain a certain degree of negative effects on the economic outlook. The technology industry in which the Company operates is also affected. With many of the 2022 challenges in mind, the efforts of all employees were able to deliver a record high revenue and the best earnings per share performance in 15 years for the Company (Group).\n\nAs the world's leading technology manufacturing service company, Hon Hai is also focused on the development direction of the global economy and market in the post-COVID-19 era. In 2023, the performance of the ICT industry will be relatively flat. With the goal of strengthening the resilience of the supply chain, it is expected to be more beneficial to large manufacturers with  scale  advantages,  including  Hon  Hai.  The  global  trend  of  emphasizing  sustainable development, the Company has strengthened ESG goals and implementation on one hand; on the other we also actively develop \"3+3\" sustainable business opportunities including three key industries: electric vehicles, digital health, and robotics industries. With another growth axis besides the ICT foundation, Hon Hai's new business has progressed rapidly in the past three years, and execution has been according to plan. In the future, we will use our global niche, sound technology, vertical integration, and execution efficiency to work with world-class customers to truly take hold of the ICT competitive advantages in the post-pandemic era and the green energy opportunities brought about by the electric vehicle industry.\n\n## Financial Performance\n\nIn 2022, we successfully overcame the disruptions and performed above expectations despite disruptions caused by the pandemic and rising inflation. The annual consolidated revenue reached NT$6.627 trillion, an increase of NT$632.8 billion over the previous year, an increase of approximately 11%, and a new record high; the net profit attributable to the parent company was NT$141.5 billion, and the earnings per share was NT$10.21, an increase of about 2% over the previous year, and earnings per share is also a new high since 2008.\n\n| Financial and Profitability Analysis   | Financial and Profitability Analysis   | Financial and Profitability Analysis   | Financial and Profitability Analysis   | Financial and Profitability Analysis   | Financial and Profitability Analysis   |\n|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Unit: Million NTD                      | 2018                                   | 2019                                   | 2020                                   | 2021                                   | 2022                                   |\n| Revenue                                | 5,293,803                              | 5,342,811                              | 5,358,023                              | 5,994,174                              | 6,626,997                              |\n| Gross Profit                           | 332,030                                | 315,868                                | 302,919                                | 362,127                                | 400,085                                |\n| Operating Income                       | 136,147                                | 114,897                                | 110,827                                | 148,959                                | 173,788                                |\n| Net Profit                             | 129,065                                | 115,309                                | 101,795                                | 139,320                                | 141,483                                |\n| EPS (Unit: NTD)                        | 8.03                                   | 8.32                                   | 7.34                                   | 10.05                                  | 10.21                                  |\n| Gross Profit Margin                    | 6.27%  5.91%                           |                                        | 5.65%                                  | 6.04%                                  | 6.04%                                  |\n| Operating Profit Margin  2.57%         |                                        | 2.15%                                  | 2.07%                                  | 2.49%                                  | 2.62%                                  |\n|                                        | 2.44%                                  | 2.16%                                  | 1.90%                                  | 2.32%                                  | Net Profit Margin  2.13%               |\n| Debt Ratio                             | 60.59%                                 | 57.85%                                 | 59.88%                                 | 59.75%                                 | 60.07%                                 |",

        "page_content": "## Solid Niche in the Information and Communications Industry\n\nIn 2022, Hon Hai's four major product lines all maintained growth despite the backdrop of persistent pandemics, high inflation, and slowing economic growth. Among them, cloud network products benefited from strong demand in the server market, bringing strong doubledigit growth. Computer terminal products also experienced significant growth due to improved material conditions. In terms of smart consumer products with strong demand for new models, despite the negative impacts of the pandemic for the Zhengzhou plant in the fourth quarter, still managed to quickly return to normal operations through the efforts of all employees; the overall performance of this category continued to grow last year. Finally, components and other product categories, benefiting from the sales of acoustic products and smart consumer products, driving component shipments, maintained growth in performance.\n\nAlthough there is visible easing of the pandemic and material shortages, the visibility of this year is relatively conservative as the central banks of various countries grapple inflation by raising interest rates, and the overall sentiment is concern for the impact on the global economy. However, according to estimates by DIGITIMES Research, global server shipments will increase by more than 5% this year and exceed 19 million units, mainly attributed to the trend of cloud services in overall business activities that have been established during the pandemic. In terms of industrial applications, in addition to the accelerated growth of AI and the Metaverse, and the rise of electric vehicles, a large number of stable high-speed computing and data centers are required. DIGITIMES Research predicts that global server shipments will have an annual growth rate of 5-7% from 2022 to 2027. Hon Hai's server revenue reached the trillion NTD mark as early as two years ago and is simultaneously the world's largest server manufacturer. All in all, Hon Hai has obtained a leading position, and CSP products will be an important growth driver for our ICT category.\n\nComputer terminal products and smart consumer products have grown considerably in the past year, and their performance will stabilize this year. We will continue to focus on high-end and niche products, use leading R&D technology, production capacity scale and mass production capacity, and continue to maintain a leading position to further solidify our market position and continuously improve profitability, so as to achieve the goal of maximizing EPS.\n\n## New Business Finds Solid Footing\n\nTo reach the 2025 goal of electric vehicle market share of 5%, related revenue exceeding 1 trillion NTD and electric vehicle volume of 500,000 to 750,000; the Company continue to leverage Hon Hai's vehicle design, vehicle manufacturing and supply chain capabilities to create Time to Cost and Time to Market competitive advantages.

Evaluation of the performance of the Board of Directors by an external professional independent organization\n\nThe Company has established the \"Rules Governing the Performance of the Board of Directors\" during the Board of Directors meeting on November 12, 2020, and an external performance evaluation of the Board of Directors shall be conducted at least once every three years. In November 2022, the Company appointed the Chinese Corporate Governance Association to conduct the 2022 external performance evaluation of the Board of Directors (period: 2021/12/01-2022/11/30). The institution and its executive experts have no business relationship with the Company and are independent. The Company adopted questionnaires and online video interviews on eight aspects including composition, direction, authority, supervision, communication, internal control, risk management, selfdiscipline, and others of the Board of Directors. The Chinese Corporate Governance Association has issued an evaluation report on the performance of the board of directors on 2023/01/12. The above suggestions and expected actions have been submitted to the Board of Directors' Report on 2023/03/15. The related general evaluation and measures are as follows:\n\n## (1). Overview of the evaluation report\n\n- (i) The atmosphere of the Company's board meetings is becoming more and more open. The chairman values a transparent discussion culture, fully respects the opinions of the board members, provides directors with sufficient time and information on the proceedings, and increases the frequency of board meetings, as well as more pre-meeting communications, project reports, etc. to build consensus and improve the efficiency of decision making. Independent directors can make professional contributions and express opinions through various meetings, and play the role of guidance and supervision as directors.\n- (ii) 2 new independent directors were added to the current Board of Directors meeting, for a total of 5 independent directors, accounting for more than half of the total seats on the Board, and all of them were filled by people with professionalism and rich management practices. Independent directors actively participate in and contribute their strengths to the operation of the Board of Directors, thereby enhancing the independence and diversity of the Board of Directors, and enabling the Board of Directors to guide and supervise the management team to play more effectively.\n- (iii) In order to improve the transparency of corporate information, the Company actively discloses ESGrelated activities.

In terms of cloud network products, the server market grew by more than 60% year-on-year in 2022 due to the relief of material shortage and the demand for servers from large cloud data center operators in North America. According to the statistics of DIGITIMES  Research,  representing  approximately 18 million units. In the field of computer terminal products, in terms of tablet PC, according to IDC statistics, the total global shipment of tablet PC in 2022 was 162.8 million units, a year-on-year decrease of 3.3%. In terms of PC, according to Gartner's analysis report, PC shipments in 2022 decreased  by  16.2%  year-on-year  to  286.2  million  units.  This  is  mainly  because consumers have already purchased laptops during the pandemic. In anticipation of global economic recession, intensified inflation, and rising interest rates, consumers are less motivated to buy new laptops, and the upgrade boom in the commercial PC market has passed. For components and other products, the demand fluctuated depending on the sales of the end products.\n\nThe EV industry has continued to grow significantly in 2022. According to the statistics",

        "page_content": "of DIGITIMES Research Center, the total sales volume of global EVs increased by 49% year-on-year to 9.78 million units. The top three markets are China, Europe, and the United States, while China officially accounts for more than 60%. The outstanding performance of China's electric vehicle market is mainly due to a series of incentive policies offered by the local government, which resulted in a 79% annual sales growth; the second largest market, Europe, was only affected by geopolitics and the annual sales growth rate was only 5%; The annual growth rate of the largest market in the United States was 48%. This is mainly due to the fact that car manufacturers have introduced SUV and electric pickup models that consumers prefer, and car owners are entitled to car purchase subsidies.\n\n## Future Developments\n\nIn 2023, the performance of the ICT industry is expected to remain flat. This is mainly due to the fact that the high growth stage created by the pandemic has passed and the central banks around the world tighten monetary policy, which may slow down the global economic growth.\n\nAccording to IDC's analysis, the global smartphone shipment in 2023 will be revised down to 1.19 billion units, a year-on-year decrease of about 1.1%. The overall market is showing signs of stabilizing, and it will be about flat this year.\n\nIn the field of cloud network products, DIGITIMES Research believes that due to the impact of the weak global economy in 2023, the growth in shipments of server brands and mid-tier players will be limited, and the growth rate of cloud companies building data centers will be smaller than that in 2022. Global server shipments are expected to grow by 6.8% in 2023. However, due to the increase in demand for AI servers and the gradual depletion of inventory, the long-term growth trend of servers is clear.\n\nIn the field of computer terminal products, MIC analyzed that the overall economy is still in the correction cycle and the suppliers in the supply chain are actively destocking. It is estimated that the global laptops market will decrease by 8.4% annually in 2023, with a market size of only 177 million units. In terms of desktop computers, MIC expects that the overall economic situation will not improve in the first half of 2023, and corporate spending is relatively conservative. It is estimated that the global desktop market will be about 75 million units in 2023, with an annual decrease of 2.9%. Although the overall PC performance has declined, it is still higher than the level before the pandemic.\n\nIn terms of components and other products, the conservative outlook of the ICT industry in 2023 will inevitably affect the demand for related components. In the emerging electronics industry, such as, electric vehicles, robots, and the Internet of Things, each industry player is deploying from different angles, developing their own advantages, and gradually commercializing them.\n\nIn 2023, DIGITIMES Research estimates that the sales volume of the global EV market will exceed 14 million units. Among them, the Chinese and US markets will still exhibit high growth. This is mainly due to the increasing the product line of electric vehicles and",

However, the cash flow of accounts receivable generated from external sales is still sufficient to pay. Therefore, the cash flow ratio increased in 2022.\n- 2. Cash flow adequacy ratio: The increase in external investment due to the development of the 3+3 strategy and the increase in the aforementioned inventory level resulted in higher cash outflow in 2022. However, due to the robustness of business activities of the Company in 2022, the cash inflow from operating activities also increased significantly compared with that in 2021, so the cash flow allowance ratio increased.\n- 3. Cash reinvestment ratio: Due to the robustness of the Company's business operations in 2022, the cash inflow from operating activities increased significantly compared to 2021, so the cash reinvestment ratio increased in 2022.\n\n## (2) Cash Flow Forecast for the Coming Year\n\nUnit:  NT$  Thousand\n\n| Cash beginning  balance  (1)   | Cash flow from  operating  activities (2)   | Cash flow  in/(out) (3)   | Cash ending  balance/(shortage)  (1)+(2)-(3)   | Plan for cash ending  balance shortage   | Plan for cash ending  balance shortage   |\n|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n|                                |                                             |                           |                                                | Investment  activities                   | Financing  activities                    |\n| 42,059,158                     | 4,129,239,705                               | 3,946,417,336             | 224,881,527                                    | -                                        | -                                        |\n\nCash flow variance analysis for year 2023:\n\n- 1.

Risk Assessment\n\n## (1) Effect of Changes in Interest Rate, Foreign Exchange and Inflation on Corporate Finance, and our Countermeasures.\n\n## (a) Interest Rates\n\n## Interest Rate Changes 2022\n\nUSD:\n\nThe  outbreak  of  the  Russo-Ukrainian  war  in  2022,  embargoes  on Russian oil in Europe and the United States caused oil prices to rise, and the lockdown in China and the interruption of the supply chain in the United States exacerbated the inflation in the United States. Fed started raising interest rates that year and raised them a total of 17 yards to 4.5% during the year. The yield rate of 10-year US Treasury bond continued to rise from 1.72% at the beginning of the year, and reached 3.87% at the end of the year.\n\nJPY: In 2022, Japan's domestic and foreign demand was weak. In order to boost the economy, the Bank of Japan maintained loose monetary policy. However, as the Fed continued to raise interest rates, the yen depreciated against the US dollar sharply, and Japanese bonds continued to be sold. The Japanese 10-year JGB yield continued to rise from a low of 0.078% in January to 0.250% in early December (previously the YCC upper limit). In order to reduce the distortion of the yield curve, BOJ relaxed the upper limit of YCC to 0.500% in December, pushing the 10-year JGB yield to around 0.500%.\n\n- NTD: In 2022, the Central Bank of Taiwan followed the Fed in raising interest rates, but not as aggressively as the Fed. The rediscount rate was raised by a total of 2.5 points to 1.75%, which drove the Taiwan 10-year bond yield from a low of 0.68% at the beginning of the year to 1.28% at the\n\nend of the year.\n\n- RMB:\n\nIn 2022, China instituted a lockdown of its own and caused economic weakness. The People's Bank of China adopted an accommodative policy that resulted in the reduction of the required reserve ratio for large financial institutions from 11.5% to 11.0% in 2022.    The one-year LPR interest rate was reduced from 3.70% to 3.65%. The 5-year LPR rate was reduced from 4.6% to 4.3%. The 10-year government bond yield fluctuated throughout the year and was around 2.84% at the end of the year.",

Short-term interest rates in major operating currencies have risen, which  is  relatively  unfavorable  for  short-term  loans  with  floating interest rates.\n\nB.

Geopolitical  conflicts  still  exist  and  commodity  prices  are  rising significantly, causing the central banks of major countries to face the pressure of interest rate hike and the risk of economic recession at the same time. Therefore, the Company will reasonably arrange various financing instruments as early as possible to raise mediumand long-term funds with low interest rates in USD, NTD or JPY to avoid the adverse impact of the increase in interest rates.\n\n## (b) Foreign Exchange:\n\n## Foreign Exchange Changes 2022\n\nUSD-JPY:\n\nIn 2022, given the high inflation rate, the hawks of the Fed raised interest rate, but Japan's economy was weak, BOJ remained loose, and the interest rates in the United States and Japan expanded, USD/JPY rose from the low of 113.49 at the beginning of the year to the high of 151.95 in October.  Subsequently, the inflation in the United States slowed down and the interest rate spread between the United States and Japan narrowed. USD/JPY dropped to around 131.12 by the end of the year.\n\nUSD- NTD:  Expectations of rising inflation in the U.S.A. and higher U.S. bond yields drove the USD to strengthen. Meanwhile, due to the slowdown of external demand and weak Taiwanese exports, the NTD weakened. USD/TWD reached the highest of 32.379 in October. Subsequently, the inflation in the United States slowed down, and the USD fell back. At the end of the year, USD/TWD fell to around 30.730.\n\nUSD-CNY:\n\nIn 2022, China adopted a dynamic reset policy in response to the new",
