        "page_content": "We have a responsibility to transform. Everybody at BT Group, across the Board, our managerial and front-line colleagues, has a clear sense of what we must do to deliver on our strategy to transform this business for the benefit of all our stakeholders.\n\nPhilip sets out the detail and vision for BT Group's future in his letter (pages 4 to 7), and the Board and I have every confidence that he and his Executive Committee have the right plan and are the right team to lead BT Group through its transformation.\n\nAs I wrote here last year, a transformation of this size cannot be accomplished overnight. However, there are clear signs of progress at this stage in the multi-year programme. And it is also clear that every team across the business is tenaciously pursuing our transformation agenda as we move from copper to fibre, analogue to digital, manual to automated.\n\nThe immense value that BT Group delivers to the UK is hard, but not impossible, to quantify. A report into our national and regional economic impact in the UK 1 (FY22) estimated that our activities provide a \u00a324bn boost to the economy every year, and the business supports a total of 284,000 jobs across the country.\n\nThese calculations are a reminder of the central role BT Group plays in the lives of families and businesses up and down the UK and globally. A role that brings great responsibility: to continue delivering for our customers no matter what. To do that we need to enact one of the most radical overhauls of a company and its product offering in UK corporate history.\n\n## Investing for the long-term for our customers and our shareholders\n\nThe team delivered another year of strong financial and operational results in FY23, despite some extremely challenging conditions. This allowed us to declare an FY23 final dividend of 5.39 pence per share to be paid on 13 September 2023, bringing the full year dividend to 7.7 pence per share.\n\nAs we continue through the most intensive phase of our full fibre 2 investment programme, capital expenditure will remain high with a corresponding impact on our normalised free cash flow. Despite this short-term impact, the Board remains convinced that the investments BT Group is making today will be value enhancing, benefiting our customers and generating long-term growth.\n\nAlthough our share price underperformed this year compared to last, BT Group must continue to drive its strategic agenda for long-term growth, and to do that it must take a long-term view on the investments required to deliver it.\n\n## Competition driving the right outcomes\n\nThe scale and speed of BT Group's investment in full fibre broadband are, in part, down to the regulatory framework set by our regulator, Ofcom. They have incentivised new network build across the country through a combination of strong competition balanced by a regime that allows fair returns. We remain fully committed to working within this framework and context set by Ofcom.\n\nBuilding full fibre broadband is a national mission and we will play our part. It will create better outcomes for families and businesses across the UK, as well as the wider economy: a recently updated report by the Centre for Economics and Business Research estimated that Openreach's full fibre network is expected to deliver a \u00a372bn uplift to the output of the UK economy in 2030.\n\n## Our duty to customers\n\nOur role is about more than just building new networks; we also have a duty to provide access and opportunity for customers, leaving no one behind.\n\nOfcom data shows that 10% of households lack a broadband connection - a figure that rises to 26% for the over 75s. Of course, in some cases this is by choice rather than the result of poverty, but in any event these statistics equate to growing social and economic exclusion. We need to tackle this, ensuring that we are building for everyone.\n\nWhile telecoms bills represent a small proportion of household running costs when compared to energy, accommodation or transport, we have nevertheless taken steps to protect our lowest income customers during the worst cost of living crisis for a generation.\n\nIn FY23 BT Group had 3m customers on fixed line and pay-as-you-go tariffs that were protected from price rises. This\n\nincludes social tariffs (subsidised rates for those on low incomes), where we have both broadband and mobile tariffs available to eligible customers. Of all the consumers in the UK on a broadband social tariff, 85% are with BT.\n\nAlong with efforts to help children, jobseekers, small businesses and the elderly boost their digital skills (see our Manifesto on page 36 for details), we are making affordable services available to those who need them most in line with our purpose: we connect for good.\n\n## Board changes\n\nAt the AGM in July, we'll bid farewell to Ian Cheshire and Iain Conn when they step down from the Board. I'd like to thank them both for their wisdom and valuable contributions they made during their time on the Board and the Committees they served.\n\nAs part of the comprehensive review of the Board's composition we undertook last year, we recognised the need to enhance the Board's technology and digital capabilities given the group's focus on digital and legacy platform transformation. We therefore focused the search for individuals with specific skills and expertise and this led to us appointing Steven Guggenheimer and Maggie Chan Jones during the year. Ruth Cairnie joined the Board on 6 April 2023. From the conclusion of the AGM in July, she will succeed Iain Conn as the Senior Independent NonExecutive Director and Ian Cheshire as Chair of the Remuneration Committee .\n\nFollowing the AGM, the Board's female membership will stand at 45%, which is in line with our Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy (see page 100). Having refreshed the composition of our Board, we feel we now have the right diversity and set of skills to take us forward in pursuit of our strategic agenda.\n\n## Resilience enabling a national mission\n\nBT Group's transformation is now well under way and it is starting to bear fruit, with strong customer take-up on our next generation networks. While there remains a long way to go, the positive early customer response proves our plan is the right one.\n\nWe experienced challenges on many fronts in FY23 and an economic climate that has made things so much harder for our customers, investors and for us. Of course, this has required adaptability on our part, but our strategy is not optional - it is a national mission. This year, we've shown that we have the resilience to get the job done.\n\n## Adam Crozier\n\nChairman\n\n17 May 2023",

        "page_content": "Thanks to the dedication and commitment of colleagues right across the business, BT Group achieved its financial outlook in FY23. For the first time in six years, we grew both revenue and EBITDA on a pro forma basis, demonstrating our determination to get on with the job in another tumultuous year macro economically and geopolitically.\n\nWe have stayed true to our strategy over the last four years. We're building the UK's leading next generation fixed broadband and mobile networks, and radically transforming the way we operate to deliver for customers.\n\n## Building and connecting like fury\n\nOpenreach has now built full fibre broadband to a total of 10.3m homes and businesses across the UK, including 3.1m in rural locations. Added to that, initial build is underway for a further 6m premises.\n\nThe business is now more than 40% of the way through the initial 25m premises target, and the number of people taking up full fibre is ahead of our expectations. Of the total premises passed, nearly one third had opted to upgrade to full fibre (c. 3.1m end users) at the year-end.\n\nThe Government's full expensing regime introduced in the 2023 Spring Budget will mean BT Group defers paying UK corporation tax in fiscal years 24, 25 and 26. We will use this benefit to ensure Openreach is able to offset inflation and stick to its target of reaching 25m premises by the end of 2026 as well as covering the upfront costs of connecting customers to full fibre at a faster rate than we had originally expected.\n\nWe are also continuing to build EE's 5G mobile network which now covers 68% of the UK population. Since launching the UK's first 5G network just four years ago, we have grown our 5G connections to an impressive 8.6m customers; and RootMetrics named our 4G and 5G networks as the UK's best for the ninth year in a row.\n\n## Next generation networks\n\nThe combined power of BT Group's next generation networks will deliver an economic dividend for our customers and the UK economy for many decades to come. Fundamentally, that's why we remain laser focused on building them and accelerating take-up.\n\nThis, however, requires significant investment. While we fully understand that price rises are rarely welcomed, they are necessary to fund the transformation of our networks which will create better outcomes for customers and ensure we remain competitive. The two things go hand in hand.\n\nThat said, we still offer terrific value for money for customers who rely on our services today more than ever. Ofcom's pricing trends report 2022 showed that the UK had the lowest standalone mobile prices across Europe and in the mobile and broadband markets, average UK prices are well below the US.\n\nThe combined power of BT Group's next generation networks will deliver an economic dividend for our customers and the UK economy for many decades to come.\n\n## Competition is good for BT Group\n\nOf course, choice and competition in the UK market - prompted by our regulator, Ofcom - are big drivers of keen pricing, as well as stimulating significant and rapid investment in the UK's full fibre networks.\n\nOfcom's regulatory framework ensures that all network builders have the freedom to compete fairly, which is good for the UK, the country's telco industry and - most importantly - for customers.\n\n## Standing by our customers and our colleagues\n\nThose same customers need us to stand by them through the worst cost of living crisis in a generation. Throughout the year, supporting our customers in need has been an overriding priority for me and my leadership team. On page 3, our Chairman outlines our approach to protecting those customers who need it most.\n\nIt is also vital that we're there for our people. I was pleased that during FY23 we were able to award pay increases equivalent to a 15% rise for our lowest paid colleagues and agreed a way forward with our union partners on a shared vision for BT Group's modernisation agenda.\n\n<!-- image -->",

It will continue providing industry-leading service and strengthen its relationship with all communications providers.\n\nAcross BT Group we will fundamentally change what we do and how we work. We'll automate, digitise and shut down legacy systems, processes and networks. This will cut costs, boost execution speed and deliver better experiences for customers and colleagues.\n\nWe'll keep reviewing ways to strengthen our business portfolio by owning, selling or partnering. We'll allocate substantial amounts of capital to next generation networks and solutions to better meet our customers' current and future needs. As we move beyond the peak of our full fibre broadband build programme, we'll reduce capex by c. \u00a31bn and realise value from our investment.\n\n## Transforming our business\n\nModernising the UK's digital infrastructure isn't only about building new networks; it also requires us to migrate customers off our nearly obsolete and energy-hungry legacy networks. In FY24 we will be ramping up activity to smoothly migrate customers onto newer technology through the All IP and 3G sunsetting programmes, among others.\n\nNext generation networks need next generation customer service. They also need the very best products and services running over them. Across the business, we are partnering with some of the world's most innovative companies, including AWS, Google, Microsoft and TCS (Tata Consulting Services) to provide leading products and services and drive exceptional customer outcomes.\n\nWe are also radically changing the size and shape of our business. During the year we completed the BT Sport 50-50 joint venture with Warner Bros. Discovery and we announced the creation of our integrated Business unit with the merger of our Enterprise and Global operations. The new Business unit will be better focused and better able to compete in the market, serving enterprise customers large and small.\n\nThe combined financial benefit from our transformation programmes will result in gross annualised cost savings of \u00a33bn by the end of FY25. We are well on track to achieving this and by the end of FY23 we had made gross annualised savings of \u00a32.1bn.\n\n## New BT Group\n\nThe new BT Group will be a higher margin, high-tech organisation built on the UK's best fixed and mobile networks. It will be fully digitised and highly automated with exceptional products and services for customers.\n\nBy continuing to build and connect like fury, digitise the way we work and simplify our structure, towards the end of the 2020s BT Group will rely on a much smaller total workforce and a significantly reduced cost base. New BT Group will be a leaner company with a brighter future, and we will get there by continuing to deliver our five strategic priorities. (See table opposite.)",

Despite the relative under-performance of our shares compared to the FTSE 100 in the year to 31 March 2023, they ended the year on an improving trend.\n\nHaving returned BT Group to both pro forma revenue and EBITDA growth for the first time in six years, we are now determined to maintain this momentum. Over the coming years we will deliver consistent and predictable revenue and EBITDA growth which, combined with the completion of our full fibre build and move off legacy networks, will result in an expansion to normalised free cash flow of at least \u00a31.5bn by the end of the decade.\n\nBT Group has the right strategy to deliver its purpose: we connect for good; and the business has again proved its ability to deliver in testing circumstances. Everything we do starts and ends with our customers; our success is built on enabling theirs.

By delivering excellent customer service and differentiated solutions, they earn revenue and drive growth. This year we announced the merger of Enterprise and Global into Business to better serve our business customers. Business will formally begin reporting as a single unit from 1 April 2023. So, for FY23 reporting we have continued to cover Enterprise and Global separately.\n\n## Technology units (TUs)\n\nOur TUs build, maintain and manage our digital and network assets (apart from the fixed access network, managed by Openreach). They focus on modernising BT Group to make us more agile, efficient and help deliver better solutions for our customers. They also drive our research & development (R&D) and support innovation.\n\n## Corporate units (CUs)\n\nOur CUs support the CFUs and TUs through sharing common activities and best practice to drive efficiency benefits. They also provide overall group-level directionsetting, management and coordination.\n\nBT Group is made up of customer-facing, technology, and corporate units. In line with regulations, our Openreach customer-facing unit operates independently. The rest of the group operates through an integrated model. We share resources like our mobile network, technology, shared services such as billing and procurement, personnel and brands to deliver the best outcomes for customers.\n\nUK individuals and households\n\nUK businesses, public sector and CPs\n\n## Consumer\n\nServes individuals and households. We help people in over 14m homes to communicate, study, work, learn, play and be entertained through our EE, BT and Plusnet brands.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Digital\n\nLeads our digital transformation, drives innovation and delivers IT and digital platforms to underpin the products and services that our customers need, while also helping to build new revenue platforms.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFinance, strategy & business services\n\nLegal, company secretarial & regulatory affairs\n\nCorporate affairs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHuman resources\n\n## Networks\n\nDesigns, builds and runs the mobile, core and global networks that we and our customers rely on. Networks is now also responsible for BT Group's security, operational resilience and health, safety and environment agenda.\n\n## Enterprise\n\nServes over 1.2m UK and Republic of Ireland organisations with connectivity solutions to help them run, transform and grow. Enterprise serves small, medium and large corporate businesses, the public sector and the UK government. We also wholesale some network solutions to other CPs.\n\nMultinational companies and international businesses\n\nCPs including Consumer and Enterprise\n\n## Global\n\nServes multinational companies and governments, with a presence in c. 180 countries. Our expertise helps customers with connectivity, cloud and cyber security solutions.\n\nFollowing their merger, Enterprise and Global will report as Business from 1 April 2023\n\n## Openreach\n\nOperates with strategic and operational autonomy in line with the Commitments (see page 45). It builds and operates our fixed wholesale access network including rolling out our next generation full fibre network. Openreach serves over 680 CPs who sell fixed access services to their end customers like homes, schools, hospitals, libraries, government buildings and businesses across the UK.",

They let us offer widespread coverage and superior connectivity for retail and wholesale customers. Our scale and experience enables us to outperform competitors.\n\n## >32m\n\n## Premises can be served by our fixed access network\n\nOur fixed access network delivers speeds of up to 900Mbps, with connections available to more than 32m homes and businesses. We're building the UK's largest full fibre network, faster than anyone else, serving both rural and urban areas. It already has an over 30% take-up rate.\n\n## 68%\n\n## Of the UK population covered by our 5G network\n\nFor nine years, Rootmetrics has recognised our mobile network as #1 in the UK. We have the largest spectrum holdings of any UK mobile network operator and continue to extend our national coverage. Today our 4G network covers 99.6% of the UK population - and our 5G network already covers 68%.\n\nOur large and varied customer base gives us strength in all our markets. Customers typically take out multi-year subscriptions or contracts. These trusted, established long-term relationships give us valuable insights into what customers want today and tomorrow. This helps us create and deliver the right new connectivity solutions and experiences to meet their evolving needs.\n\n## >14m\n\nUK households served\n\n## >1.2m\n\n## Business customers\n\nWe directly serve over 14m UK households and our Enterprise and Global units support over 1.2m business customers from multinational corporations and the public sector to small and medium UK businesses.\n\n## >680\n\nCPs served\n\nOpenreach serves over 680 CPs - 49 of whom have signed up to our Equinox deal on our full fibre platform.

We have a significant local presence, covering service, support and other resources to meet customers' needs quickly and in a personalised way.\n\n## >29k\n\n## Openreach engineers\n\nOver 29,000 Openreach engineers play a crucial role in keeping the UK connected.

In the UK we have a sales and service presence in every region.\n\n## Well established and trusted brands\n\nOur four customer-facing brands underpin our relationships with millions of customers. The trust in these brands means that customers look to us for connectivity solutions, and more. This year we announced EE will become our flagship consumer brand, while Plusnet continues to be our value brand. BT will be our business brand in the UK and around the world.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Strong partner and supplier relationships\n\nCollaboration is vital in our business. We work with partners and suppliers in every part of our operations. We work closely with them to create solutions that build on both parties' strengths, speed up our transformation and benefit our customers.\n\nFor example, Openreach continues to strengthen third-party contractor and supplier relationships that are helping us build and connect end customers to our full fibre network at unrivalled pace and scale. And its close engagement with CPs helps Openreach provide the best experience for end customers.\n\n## R&D and innovation\n\nInnovation is key to the group's success. We strive to deploy innovative uses of technology to enhance our solutions, processes and networks to better serve our customers.\n\n## \u00a3683m\n\n## Expenditure on R&D\n\nWe recognised expenditure of nearly \u00a3683m on R&D last year and hold over 5,400 patents and patent applications. Our R&D centre at Adastral Park leads our research into new technologies, pushing connectivity boundaries in areas like 5G. Openreach's innovations such as subtended headends enable new full fibre cables to be extended beyond their normal reach. This helps to reduce build and maintenance costs while improving the network quality, thereby enhancing the service we give to our CPs and further differentiating against competitors.\n\n## Rich data assets\n\nOur rich data sets are derived from customer, product, network and operational sources. Applying appropriate forms of artificial intelligence (AI) gives us a unique perspective and understanding of what's important and what we can improve on. It lets us create personalised experiences for customers, build innovative products and protect them through stateof-the-art network monitoring.\n\nAs an example, our Active Intelligence products analyse over 10bn daily data points in the UK. This can provide anonymous insights into footfall and aggregate population movements.",

We're right in the thick of it. Our investment in these networks will deliver long-term benefits with better customer solutions and more reliable, cost-efficient networks for us.\n\n## Unprecedented demand for connectivity\n\nTechnology and connectivity are ever more entwined in our customers' lives.

We're making progress in our ethnic minority representation, with notable gains against our targets. But we're clear there's much more to be done. Our UK declaration rates of more than 78% mean we can use data to better understand our demography and areas of concern.\n\nIn the Manifesto we state that a more inclusive digital landscape will help us drive productivity, innovation and growth for our business and for the UK (see pages 36 to 39). Supporting that, we have created a rich ecosystem of partners to help us expand our reach into the community, create awareness, and invest in, develop and open\n\nup opportunities for the talent pools for the future. Inside and outside our business, we've continued to encourage inclusivity through understanding other people's lives better.\n\nMore broadly, we engage with colleagues through the Colleague Board (see the corporate governance report on pages 92 to 93) and we work with our highly active, engaged and award-winning People Networks. These colleague-driven groups raise awareness and advocate for change both inside and outside BT Group.\n\n## Our targets for 2025\n\nPresented below is the progress made for the year in review against our stated Manifesto targets for gender, ethnic\n\nminority and disability at various levels of the organisation.

Our UK gender pay gap figures have decreased favourably this year.\n\n## Median pay gap %\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Office for National BT Group median\n- Statistics (ONS) median\n- -  Our median pay gap is 6.1% (-0.6%).\n- -  Our mean pay gap is 3.7% (-1.3%).\n\nBoth these figures continue to sit well below the telecommunications industry 19.6% and UK 14.9% median averages. Our figures have improved because we've recruited more women into senior roles and because of the slight rise in female representation in the upper 23.3% (0.3%) and lower middle 16.6% (1.3%) pay quartiles.\n\nTo close our gender pay gap we need more balanced gender representation at all levels, so we're doing a lot more to attract, hire and keep women. We're focusing particularly on sales and engineering roles.\n\nYou can find more examples of initiatives - as well as pay quartile analysis, bonus information and entity breakdowns in the ESG Addendum, available at bt.com/esgaddendum\n\nYou can find more information in our Gender Pay Gap 2022 Statement, available at bt.com/genderpaygap\n\n## Ethnicity pay\n\nThis is the third year we've reported on our ethnicity pay gap.

For Black colleagues, we've seen a slight increase in median and mean pay gaps versus White colleagues. The mean is 6.6% (+1.3%) and the median is -0.3% (+2.4%). For mixed ethnicity colleagues, pay gaps are consistent with 2021, with both median and mean in favour of White colleagues.\n\nThis is reflected by the fact there are more Asian colleagues in higher paid management roles, and more Black colleagues in frontline roles such as our engineers.\n\nYou can find more examples of initiatives to improve representation - as well as pay quartile analysis, bonus information and entity breakdowns - in the ESG Addendum, available at bt.com/esgaddendum\n\n- 1 Our pay gap figures have been calculated in line with legal obligations. They show the mean and median pay gap (based on hourly rates of pay at 5 April 2022) and mean and median bonus gap (based on bonuses paid in the 12 months to 5 April 2022).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Our partnerships\n\nPurple Goat is one of the UK's only communications agencies run by disabled people. We partnered with them to deliver a series of videos highlighting the experiences of colleagues with a range of disabilities - including diabetes, autism and visual and hearing impairments.\n\nWe've also built relationships with Code First Girls, Women Returners, Black Girls Tech Summit and Girls Talk London. These initiatives help delegates develop their skills and network with peers, creating more opportunities for women to move into technology careers.\n\nAnd as lead sponsor of the Avado FastFutures programme, we're helping upskill over 7,000 18-24 year old learners from ethnically diverse backgrounds.

It's also in our Health and Safety policy statement. Our strategy is to build a team of fulfilled, safe, happy and healthy employees in a culture where everyone can thrive.\n\nThis year we published guidance on fulfilling the physical, mental and cognitive needs and expectations of our people in relation to their work. We also launched a psychological risk assessment tool to help our managers and safety professionals identify roles and ways of working that could potentially harm our employees' mental health. This was part of meeting our obligations under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974, and aligns to the recently published ISO45003 ('Occupational health and safety management - Psychological health and safety at work').\n\nWe're a founder member of the World Wellbeing Movement. This is a coalition of global leaders from business, civil society and academia who've committed to put wellbeing at the heart of decision making in both business and public policy. We're also an active member of the European Telecommunications Network Operations Association, inputting to the recently announced commitment to protecting all telecommunications workers from violence and harassment in the workplace.\n\nTo minimise risks to our colleagues' health and improve attendance, we have strong health assessment processes and safe systems of work in place. In line with regulations, we run surveillance programmes for colleagues doing jobs that might affect their health, for example around vibration and noise.\n\nWe continue to set targets for measures of health and wellbeing, the performance of which are reported to the Executive Committee and Board. Sickness absence rate was 3.87% and work-related mental ill health was 8.3%, a 19% reduction over last year.\n\n## Accelerating our pay award\n\nAs part of our 2023 pay review - and following discussions with our unions we agreed to move forward a pay increase from April to January to help support colleagues facing increased living costs from rising inflation and interest rates.\n\nWe also awarded a consolidated cost of living pay rise of \u00a31,500 to 85% of our UK workforce - all our team member and frontline grades and more than half of UK managers.\n\nWe wanted to reach as many of our people as possible with a genuinely meaningful raise. Combined with the April 2022 increase, in FY23 we delivered a total salary increase of 15% to our lowest-paid colleagues.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Support to colleagues experiencing long Covid\n\nOur Health, Safety and Wellbeing Centre of Expertise headed up by our Chief Medical Officer identified the need to provide bespoke support to colleagues experiencing the impact of long Covid.\n\nWorking with our specialist rehabilitation provider we created our two-step 'Covid Recovery Programme' to help all employees manage the effects of long Covid and improve their health, wellbeing and functional capabilities. The programme was designed to support colleagues who had ongoing Covid symptoms, but not severe enough to enrol on an NHS programme. At 4 weeks since acute symptoms, step one provided individuals with access to self-help materials. At 12 weeks since acute symptoms, a manager-initiated referral to step two provided individuals with access to a 4-12 week programme offering bespoke management plans and tailored support to facilitate a return to work and full duties. Between July 2021 and August 2022, we referred 151 colleagues to step two of the programme. The number of those off work dropped from 46% to 12%, and those on full duties rose from 28% to 76%. Data taken from validated questionnaires also indicated a significant improvement in functional capability, wellbeing and mental health.\n\n151\n\nColleagues referred to step two of our Covid Recovery Programme\n\n12%\n\nThose off work with long Covid dropped from 46% to 12% after referral to step two of the programme\n\n76%\n\nThose on full duties rose from 28% to 76% after referral to step two of the programme",

They're grounded in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and are part of our risk management framework.\n\n## Our responsible tech principles are\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## For Good\n\nWe design and deliver tech to empower people and improve their lives\n\n## Accountable\n\nWe're accountable for our actions and take care to avoid, and protect against, tech misuse\n\n## Fair\n\nWe work hard to ensure everyone is treated fairly and with respect\n\n## Open\n\nWe listen, collaborate and are transparent about our actions\n\n## Governance\n\nOur Responsible Tech Steering Group oversees how we implement the principles. This year it continued looking into our emerging risks and strategic growth areas. It invited external experts to help define our approach to topics like children's digital rights, evolving high risk markets and customers, and new products and innovation.\n\n## Developing new tech\n\nWe apply the principles right from the start when we develop and design new tech. This year we:\n\n- -  launched an AI accelerator - shortening new AI rollout time by over 90%, and built with security and ethics in mind\n- -  started embedding responsible tech by design into new product development to build trust and drive growth\n- -  carried out a group-wide digital child rights impact assessment on how to protect and empower children in their digital lives, and made an action plan for the year ahead.\n\n## Buying tech\n\nOur procurement company, BT Sourced, has responsibility and sustainability criteria set into its processes - giving our buyers clarity on supplier risks and opportunities. This year we:\n\n- -  started embedding our 'Responsible AI for Buyers' guide into our supplier onboarding processes\n- -  continued to do due diligence on our suppliers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For details of onsite supplier audits completed, refer to our Modern Slavery Statement 2023 at bt.com/modernslavery\n\n## Using tech\n\nWe want to make sure our products and services are used for good. We focus on protecting privacy and free expression and helping to prevent online harms. We support the Global Network Initiative (GNI) Principles on Freedom of Expression and Privacy. This year we:\n\n- -  completed our first external GNI assessment. They said we were 'making good faith efforts to implement the GNI principles with improvement over time' and also confirmed our strong commitment. They also showed us opportunities to improve our policies, oversight in overseas jurisdictions and related training and tools\n- -  developed our data ethics standard. It sets out how we use responsible tech principles to determine what's 'right' and 'wrong' when deciding why and how to process data (personal or otherwise)\n- -  created our Responsible AI standard for building ethical AI. It will help mitigate risk at every AI lifecycle stage - from conception to real world monitoring.\n\n## Selling tech\n\nWe sell to customers around the world. This year we:\n\n- -  further enhanced sales due diligence in our Global and Enterprise units. This will help us better identify and address potential human rights impacts of our products and services\n- -  delivered training to our sales colleagues to help them understand the enhanced process\n- -  conducted assurance to check our process was being followed. We concluded it was, with some minor exceptions which are being addressed with additional training\n- -  reviewed our approach to evolving high risk markets and customers, and strengthened our ability to respond to them.\n\n## Inclusive\n\nThe future of tech must be diverse and inclusive for everyone to benefit.\n\n## Championing digital inclusion\n\nWe want to support families worst hit by the cost of living crisis. We excluded a total of 3m eligible customers from the April 2023 price increase. We're the market leader in social tariffs, currently helping around 1m low-income and vulnerable customers through affordable fibre broadband and calls.\n\nOur Home Essentials social tariff lets customers on Universal Credit get discounted broadband. And we've launched EE Basics which mirrors the offer for eligible mobile customers. Openreach's 'Connect the Unconnected' scheme waives connection fees for vulnerable customers, via their communications provider. Working with charity partner Home-Start UK, we're also supporting the most socially excluded households with thousands of laptops, mobiles and free broadband vouchers.\n\nWe're working to develop the right digital infrastructure so no one gets left behind. Our full fibre broadband already passes 10.3m homes and businesses, including 3.1m in rural locations. We have the UK's largest and fastest 4G mobile network and we're rolling out 5G across the country. See pages 18 to 19 for more.\n\n## Skilling the nation\n\nThis year we've helped 4.6m more UK people and businesses improve their digital skills - and a total of 19.3m people since FY15. We're on track to reach our Group KPI target of 25m by the end of FY26 (see page 48).\n\n## Supporting small businesses\n\nWe're helping businesses unlock their potential through our free digital skills programme:\n\n- -  we've helped upskill a further 465k businesses and their employees this year\n- -  our webinar series provides businesses with digital skills help and advice, on topics from digital marketing and social media strategy to cyber security\n- -  our 'Let's Talk About' video series offered practical tips from successful entrepreneurs\n- -  we sponsored the 10th anniversary Small Business Saturday Tour providing support through mentoring sessions and webinars across the 23 UK locations visited.",

The bootcamps support teachers by encouraging STEM study subjects and careers.\n- -  We support the National Cyber Security Centre's CyberFirst programme. It aims to encourage school pupils into cyber and tech careers, hosting events for over 2,000 pupils in the UK.\n\n## Child online safety\n\nWith so many children and young adults owning their own mobile phones, it puts them at risk of harm. That's why we launched EE PhoneSmart - the first phone safety licence for kids - with Internet Matters and other experts. We've issued more than 1,300 PhoneSmart licences to children since launch. And over 3,800 children have signed up to the scheme's online educational training.\n\nEE teamed up with Beano to create a series of animated comics and videos on how kids can learn to stay safe and be kind online. These have already given advice to more than 400k parents.\n\n## Tackling online hate\n\nOur Hope United campaign is part of EE's ongoing commitment to delivering positive societal change. Hope United is a team of elite professional football players from all four home nations brought together to tackle online hate. So far, it's helped educate 7.4m people on how to be good digital citizens. The award-winning 'Not her problem' campaign tackled sexist hate and ran during the UEFA Women's Euros 2022.\n\n## India skills partnership\n\nWith our partner The British Asian Trust, BT India has reached over 1m girls since 2019 with digital skills, STEM career guidance and job opportunities. We've also helped launch a smartphone library and helped match 12,000 mentors to mentees through a BT-developed app.\n\n## UNICEF partnership\n\nWe've partnered with UNICEF to enable digital skills development around the world via the Digital Learning Passport. The passport is a tech platform providing schoolchildren with online and offline access to quality educational resources. Since its 2020 launch, it's helped more than 2m users in 23 countries.\n\n## Digital talent pipeline\n\nWe're developing digital talent for BT Group and the whole UK. We're building a Digital Campus (a one-stop learning shop and community) so our people can be at the cutting edge of digital tech.\n\nTogether with other big UK employers, we're an Avado FastFutures programme partner. We're helping a diverse range of young people (ages 18-24) get into digital roles, supporting the government's skills agenda. So far, it's helped over 7,000 young people build their networks, gain experience and accelerate their careers. Our colleagues are involved - mentoring over 300 participants this year. We're now the programme's lead sponsor.\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nEmbracing diversity and inclusion is core to our people strategy and critical to our growth. We've set big ambitions to champion a more inclusive culture across BT Group.\n\n- Read more on how we're achieving this on page 33.\n- 1 99.9% of the global electricity BT Group consumes is from renewable sources. The remaining 0.1% is where renewable electricity is not available in the market.\n\n## Sustainable\n\nTech must accelerate our journey to net zero emissions and a circular economy.\n\nWe've led on climate action for over 30 years. We've been 'A' rated on climate by Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) for the last seven years running. But the transition to a low carbon economy needs to happen much faster. We've committed to being net zero for our operations by the end of March 2031 and for our full value chain by the end of March 2041. And we've also set goals to help customers avoid 60m tonnes of CO 2 e and be a circular business by the end of March 2030, building towards a circular tech ecosystem by the end of March 2040.\n\n## Reducing carbon emissions in our operations\n\nWe've cut our carbon emissions intensity by 56%, against our science-based target of an 87% cut by the end of March 2031 (compared to FY17 levels). This year our performance improved due to a large decrease in natural gas consumption. This is also a Group KPI (see page 48).\n\nOne of the biggest ways we can cut carbon comes from our energy usage. All of our electricity worldwide is renewably sourced 1 , powering our buildings estate, shops and networks. This year we increased the amount of electricity provided through power purchase agreements - meeting around 23% of our worldwide electricity demand this year, and around 26% of the UK total, supporting growth in the overall UK grid renewables supply.\n\nWe have more to do to get to net zero. We'll get there by electrifying our vehicle fleet, decarbonising our estate and building more energy efficient networks.\n\n## Transition to electric vehicles\n\nOver 80% of our operational emissions come from our fleet of more than 34,000 vehicles. We're making investments to convert the majority of our commercial fleet to electric or zero emission vehicles by 2030.\n\nBuilding our full fibre network has increased emissions - from the supporting (mainly diesel) vehicles. We're working hard to change the BT Group fleet and have added more than 1,000 electric vehicles (EVs) this year. Those EVs have travelled more than 7.9m miles, saving over 2,200 tonnes of CO 2 e. In total, we have over 2,400 EVs in our fleet.",

        "page_content": "We're still pushing for policy measures to support a wider UK EV transition as a member of the UK Electric Fleets Coalition, who this year published a seven-point policy plan to encourage Government momentum on EVs.\n\n## Decarbonising our buildings estate\n\nWe cut our global energy consumption by an extra 77GWh this year - a reduction of nearly 3%. We're decarbonising our estate through our Better Workplace Programme by consolidating hundreds of buildings to around 30.\n\nOur new and refurbished buildings are designed with environmental impact firmly in mind, with new-builds constructed to the BREEAM 2 -Excellent standard.\n\nOur new Bristol Assembly building has now opened. We expect it to save more than 140 tonnes of CO 2 e a year to start with rising to over 500 tonnes as we reduce our buildings estate in the area.\n\n## Building energy efficient networks\n\nWe're building more energy efficient networks that are renewably powered, whilst switching off our old networks. As well as saving energy, full fibre networks can better handle the effects of physical risks like flooding and higher temperatures. That means fewer faults or engineering visits.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## See page 78 for more.\n\n## Cutting carbon emissions across our value chain\n\nOur Scope 3 carbon emissions account for 95% of our overall emissions. They come mainly from our supply chain and from customers using our products and services. Decarbonising the grid and improving our products' energy efficiency will help cut customer emissions.\n\nSince FY17, we've cut our Scope 3 net emissions by 21% to 3,289ktonnes of CO 2 e this year. This is an increase on FY22, caused by additional spend on carbonintensive goods and services associated with our full fibre rollout.\n\n## Helping suppliers cut carbon\n\nWe continue to work with suppliers to cut carbon. We've cut supply chain emissions by 20% since FY17, and we're targeting a 42% reduction target by FY31.\n\nWe've hardwired carbon reduction into supplier contracts. Climate clauses commit 11 of our key suppliers to make measurable carbon savings during the life of their contracts with us.\n\nWe require suppliers with new contracts over \u00a325m to sign up to science-based net zero\n\ntargets. We encourage our key suppliers to report to CDP to improve visibility and action on emissions. Today more than 200 of them are doing so. We have been recognised for our supply chain leadership, through the CDP supplier engagement leader board for the sixth consecutive year.\n\nWe continued our collaboration with the 1.5\u00b0C Supply Chain Leaders initiative to drive climate action across global supply chains, and support small- and medium-sized enterprises through the SME Climate Hub.\n\n## Helping customers cut carbon\n\nThere's huge potential to use our networks, products and services to help customers cut their emissions. We've set a target to help customers avoid 60m tonnes of carbon by the end of March 2030. They avoid carbon by using new technologies like full fibre broadband and mobile solutions, plus growth technologies like cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT).\n\nThis year we've:\n\n- -  helped customers avoid over 935,000 tonnes of carbon, mainly through full fibre broadband reducing personal or work-related travel. As we develop more products and services like IoT and AI we expect this number to grow\n- -  launched an AI-powered edge computing solution in partnership with QiO, helping business customers cut carbon by optimising energy use across their operations\n- -  introduced real-time energy and carbon dashboards for larger customers helping them estimate their network's carbon footprint and start to drive emissions reductions\n- -  continued working with tech scaleup partners through our Green Tech Innovation Platform - developing breakthrough manufacturing tech to support the race to net zero.\n\n## Circularity\n\nDeveloping a circular economy is a vital step in achieving a net zero economy. Around 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from material use and handling 3 . We want to become a circular business by 2030 - and build towards a circular tech ecosystem by 2040.\n\nFor our operational waste, we're aiming for zero waste to landfill by 2030, by increasing the amount we reuse and recycle. Globally, we generated 80,665 tonnes of operational waste this year, 83% more than in FY22. That significant increase was largely due to the increased network infrastructure build within Openreach, which generated a high volume of heavy material, such as soil and construction spoils. Our UK recycling, reuse and recovery rate was 89.4% (88.5% globally).\n\nOur return rate for leased customer premises equipment was 68.2% during 2022 - up 6.5% on 2021 (our target is 75%\n\nby 2026 4 ). Overall, customers returned more than 1.8m home hubs and set-top boxes to us and through our refurbishment operation, we reused 83% and recycled the rest. As well as promoting more circularity, we also save on manufacturing and shipping costs. We also collected over 190k mobile devices through consumer and business trade-in schemes, all of which were reused or recycled.\n\nWe rolled out our nationwide EE superfast in-store phone repair service, with customers able to get their phones fixed in as little as two hours. We joined the Eco Rating initiative for mobile devices, providing an overall environmental impact score to help customers make more informed and sustainable choices.\n\nWe're also launching more sustainably designed new home hubs and TV boxes design features include up to 95% recycled plastic in the casing, using fewer materials, and reducing or completely removing plastic packaging. This supports our policy to reduce and remove single-use plastics while using more recycled polymers by 2025.\n\nA new partnership with Cisco is also letting business customers return old network devices for reuse and recycling. And 1,279 tonnes of network equipment have been reused or recycled through our Exchange Clearance Operations programme working with partners N2S and TXO.\n\n## Biodiversity\n\nThis year we ran a pilot to explore our impact on nature, in line with the draft Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures framework. Openreach has set up a working group to look at the operational impacts of infrastructure build on nature. Openreach has also joined the UK Business and Biodiversity Forum.\n\n## Water consumption\n\nOur UK water use rose by 7.6% this year to 1,531,893m 3 , due mainly to an increase in adiabatic cooling during the above average summer heat. Using water self-supply has helped us save nearly \u00a33m since 2019, and has allowed us to improve how we monitor water usage, pinpoint areas of concern and fix leaks in order to minimise water wastage.\n\n- Our Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures statement can be found on page 71, and our detailed environmental data can be viewed in the ESG Addendum ( bt.com/esgaddendum )\n- 2 Building Research Establishment's Environmental Assessment Method, the world's leading sustainability assessment for infrastructure.\n- 3 Circle Economy - The Circularity Gap Report 2022 https://circulareconomy.europa.eu/platform/en/ knowledge/circularity-gap-report-2022-five-yearsanalysis-circle-economy.\n- 4 This target only relates to equipment which is leased to our consumers under their contract terms.",

To understand how well we're engaging with different groups, the Board and its committees get regular updates from relevant parts of the business and from stakeholders themselves. They use them to make better decisions, give feedback and constructively challenge activities, programmes and initiatives being considered.\n\n- Our stakeholder management group risk category recognises just how important they are to our business. You can read more on page 63.\n- Our Section 172 statement on pages 94 to 95 gives examples of how the Board and its committees took our stakeholders' interests into account in decision making during the year.",

We've expanded this to include quarterly pulse surveys in several units.\n- -  Our People Networks are colleague groups that share opinions and ideas with our leadership to make us more diverse and inclusive. Each is supported by an executive sponsor.\n- -  We also formally engage with our European Consultative Council and EE employee representatives in the UK.\n\n## The results\n\n- -  This year engagement fell six points to 73% - just above the 70% external benchmark but continuing the downward trend from the last survey in 2021.\n- -  The post-Covid return to work, cost of living increases and industrial action have led to a turbulent year where engagement fell as a result, notably in Openreach. In response and to address areas of concern we continue to focus on our leadership capability, in-unit change management together with the cost of living pay award and our D&I agenda detailed further in the people section.\n\n## See pages 32 to 35.\n\n- -  'Getting things done here is straightforward' at 42% still trails behind other metrics. We're working to address this through our group-wide modernisation programmes.\n- -  Perceptions of management are still very high with almost no change since 2022.\n- -  We're still getting high scores for supporting colleagues to do the right thing for customers (81%, down 3% from 2022).\n- See pages 32 to 35 for more details on what we're doing for our colleagues outside of direct engagement.",

So we:\n\n- -  Choose suppliers based on principles that make sure we act ethically and responsibly\n- -  Undertake due diligence on suppliers before and after we sign a contract, which covers financial health, antibribery and corruption. And whether they meet our standards on areas such as quality management, security and data privacy\n- -  Check the things we buy are made, delivered and disposed of in a socially and environmentally responsible way\n- -  Measure suppliers' energy use, environmental impact and labour standards, and work with them to improve these.\n\nIn April 2021 we launched BT Sourced, a standalone procurement company based in Dublin. BT Sourced has been established to challenge the traditional ways of buying goods and services by simplifying processes and introducing new technology and partnership-based approaches to the way we work with suppliers and start-ups.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBelow are some of the key initiatives\n\nBT Sourced has delivered this year.\n\n- -  We partnered with Candex, a fintech company, to simplify bringing on board suppliers for small off-contract purchases. It also gives us a better view of the diversity of our suppliers.\n- -  We deployed Globality's AI-powered platform for sourcing across a range of business areas. We're also working with Globality to scope requirements more precisely, find suppliers in real-time, compare proposals and make better, data-driven buying decisions.\n- -  Responding to small and midsize business' (SMBs') cash flow management concerns, we implemented C2FO's early payment marketplace. It gives our suppliers the working capital they need to grow.\n- -  We've put a big focus on supply and procurement risk management this year (see page 62). We've designed a new risk management framework for supply management and we've developed our internal controls arrangements, as part of our wider group key controls framework (see page 61). This will manage supply-related enduring risks more consistently and efficiently and make our supply chain more resilient.\n- -  BT Sourced is investing in data science. Our negotiation analytics teams are creating custom-made predictive analytics products which will help our sourcing teams.\n\n## The results\n\n- -  Our partnership with Candex has cut a 7-day task to 7 minutes and allowed suppliers to deliver what we need faster. They get a simpler, more flexible experience and get paid quicker too.\n- -  In 2022, 50% of suppliers onboarded by Candex have self-declared with a diversity status (e.g. small business, minority-owned).\n- -  Our buyers have placed more than 400 projects on the Globality Platform. BT Sourced used it to automate adminheavy tasks - cutting go-to-market time for a typical sourcing project from approximately 7-10 working days to 3-4.\n- -  SMBs can now rely on efficient and timely payment via the C2FO platform helping them free up cash to invest and develop their business.",

Our priority is fulfilling our responsibilities and obligations to our customers and country.\n- -  Our policy and public affairs team manages relationships with government and politicians.\n- -  Enterprise manages public sector contracts and services like the Emergency Services Network.\n- -  Under the Communications Act 2003, the Government can ask us (and others) to run or restore services during disasters.

Our conversations focus on how regulation can support its ambition for a world class UK digital infrastructure and allow efficient investment, while keeping the market fair and competitive.\n- -  In 2017, we put in place the Commitments. These provide Openreach with a greater degree of strategic and operational independence, in line with objectives set out in Ofcom's Digital Communications Review.\n- -  On behalf of the Board, the BT Compliance Committee checks that we're adhering to the Commitments - including in our culture and colleagues' behaviour.

The impact of the resulting uncertainty has been a key focus during the year, in particular inflationary pressures.\n\nWe are able to mitigate the impact through cost management, our risk management framework and the proportion of inflation linkage within our key revenue streams which helps offset the impact of inflation and energy price rises. We are further protected against energy price volatility with 91% of our costs hedged for the next 12 months. Accordingly, we are comfortable that the group will be able to navigate these challenges in the short, mid and long term as reflected in our viability statement (pages 81 to 82).\n\nReported revenue was \u00a320,681m, down 1%. Revenue growth in Openreach has been more than offset by declines in other units. Revenue decline reflects the removal of BT Sport revenue. Revenue was up 1% on a Sports JV pro forma f basis.\n\nAdjusted b EBITDA of \u00a37,928m was up 5% due to our cost transformation programme and the removal of BT Sport costs, partially offset by cost inflation and reported revenue decline. Adjusted b EBITDA was up 3% on a Sports JV pro forma f basis.\n\nReported profit before tax of \u00a31,729m was down 12%, primarily due to increased depreciation from network build and specific items, partially offset by adjusted b EBITDA growth.\n\nCapital expenditure of \u00a35,056m was down 4%, mainly driven by the impact of our prior-year investment in spectrum offsetting increased fixed network investment.\n\nNormalised free cash flow d was \u00a31,328m, down 5% due to increased cash capital expenditure and adverse working capital movements offset by adjusted b EBITDA growth and a tax refund.\n\n## Financial outlook\n\n|                                | FY24 outlook                               | Beyond FY24                                                                   |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Change in   adjusted a revenue | Growth on a  Sports JV pro  forma f  basis | Consistent growth                                                             |\n| Adjusted b  EBITDA             | Growth on a  Sports JV pro  forma f  basis | Consistent growth                                                             |\n| Capital expenditure c          | \u00a35.0bn- \u00a35.1bn                             | \u00a35.0bn-5.1bn from  FY24-FY26   >\u00a31bn reduction post peak  fibre build in FY28 |\n| Normalised free  cash flow d   | \u00a31.0bn- \u00a31.2bn                             | At least \u00a31.5bn incremental  normalised free cash flow  by end of the decade  |\n\nWe expect to be a significant beneficiary of the UK Government's full expensing scheme from FY24-FY26 and expect to pay no UK cash tax for the next three years. With demand for FTTP well ahead of our expectations, we will reinvest this benefit into further accelerating our FTTP connections and absorbing inflation whilst remaining committed to our target of building to 25m premises by the end of 2026, bringing our annual capital expenditure outlook to \u00a35.0bn - 5.1bn for FY24-FY26 inclusive. We expect take-up to accelerate beyond 30% whilst maintaining our build cost envelope of \u00a3250-\u00a3350 per premises.\n\nFY24 Outlook: adjusted a revenue and adjusted b EBITDA growth on a pro forma basis driven by CPI-linked pricing and the impact of cost transformation; despite expected headwinds from cost of living pressure, and cost inflation, including higher energy costs. Normalised free cash flow d for FY24 is expected to be between \u00a31.0bn and \u00a31.2bn as the tax benefit from full expensing will be offset by higher capital expenditure. Cash capital expenditure in FY24 may be up to \u00a3200m higher than reported capital expenditure of \u00a35.0bn to \u00a35.1bn due to the repayment of government grants resulting from higher than expected fibre take-up on the BDUK programmes.\n\nBeyond FY24, we continue to expect consistent and predictable adjusted a revenue and adjusted b EBITDA growth driven by CPIlinked pricing and by cost transformation. We remain confident in expanding normalised free cash flow by at least \u00a31.5bn, when compared with FY22, by the end of the decade. This comes from lower capital and operating expenditure as we move past peak capex and towards an all-fibre, all-IP network.\n\n## Dividend\n\nWe have declared a final dividend for FY23 of 5.39 pence per share (FY22: 5.39 pence per share), bringing the full-year total to 7.70 pence per share (FY22: 7.70 pence per share).\n\nWe reconfirm our progressive dividend policy which is to maintain or grow the dividend each year whilst taking into consideration a number of factors including underlying medium-term earnings expectations and levels of business reinvestment.\n\nThe Board expects to continue with this policy for future years, and to declare two dividends per year, with the interim dividend being fixed at 30% of the prior year's full year dividend.\n\n## Simon Lowth\n\nChief Financial Officer 17 May 2023\n\n- a Adjusted measures exclude specific items, as explained on page 233.\n- b Adjusted EBITDA is defined as the group profit or loss before specific items, net finance expense, taxation, depreciation and amortisation and share of post tax profits or losses of associates and joint ventures, as explained on page 234.\n- c Additions to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets in the period.\n- d Normalised free cash flow as defined on page 234.\n- e Financial outlook originally provided in May 2022 was updated in November 2022 to clarify revenue growth on a Sports JV pro forma basis and normalised free cash flow at the lower end of the stated range, and increase capital expenditure guidance from around \u00a34.8bn to c. \u00a35.0bn.\n- f On 1 September 2022 BT Group and Warner Bros.

Revenue was up 1% on a Sports JV pro forma e basis.\n\nYou can find details of revenue by CFU on pages 56 to 57. Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements shows a full breakdown of revenue by all our major product and service categories.\n\n## Operating costs\n\nReported operating costs were \u00a318,062m, up 1%, primarily due to increased depreciation and cost inflation partially offset by tight cost control and the removal of BT Sport rights and production costs.\n\nOur cost transformation programme, first announced in May 2020, remains on track to complete by the end of FY25. In response to cost inflation, during the year we revised the gross annualised savings target to \u00a33.0bn (previously \u00a32.5bn), with a cost to achieve of \u00a31.6bn (previously \u00a31.3bn). Since embarking on the programme we have achieved gross annualised savings of \u00a32.1bn and incurred costs of \u00a31.1bn.\n\n## Adjusted c EBITDA\n\nAdjusted c EBITDA of \u00a37,928m increased by 5% primarily due to our cost transformation programme and the removal of BT Sport costs, partially offset by cost inflation and decline in reported revenue. Adjusted c EBITDA was up 3% on a Sports JV pro forma e basis.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## c You can find details of adjusted  EBITDA by CFU\n\non pages 56 to 57.\n\n## Profit before tax\n\nReported profit before tax of \u00a31,729m was down 12% due to increased depreciation from our network build and specific items, partially offset by adjusted c EBITDA growth.\n\n## Specific items\n\nAs we explain on page 233, we separately identify and disclose those items that in management's judgement need to be disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence. We call these specific items. Specific items are used to derive the adjusted results as presented in the consolidated income statement. Adjusted results are consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and assists in providing an additional analysis of the reported trading results of the group.\n\nSpecific items resulted in a net charge after tax of \u00a3253m (FY22: \u00a3728m). The main components were restructuring charges of \u00a3300m (FY22: \u00a3347m), net charges associated with the disposal of BT Sport of \u00a3155m and subsequent charge of \u00a334m (FY22: \u00a3nil) and property impairment charges of \u00a365m (FY22: \u00a3nil), offset by tax credit on specific items of \u00a3308m (FY22: net tax charge of \u00a3340m).

The FY22 rate was higher due to a tax charge on the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities from 19% to the new 25% UK corporation tax rate.\n\nThe effective tax rate on adjusted profit was 5.8% (FY22: 14.8%) as we expect a large proportion of our capital spend on fibre rollout to qualify for the Government's super-deduction scheme.\n\nAt the end of FY23, we had c. \u00a38bn of carried forward UK tax losses.\n\nWe received a net income tax refund globally of \u00a3136m (FY22: \u00a352m paid) following the agreement of an outstanding issue with HMRC during the prior period.\n\nOur tax expense recognised in the income statement before specific items was \u00a3132m (FY22: \u00a3349m). We also recognised a \u00a3642m tax credit (FY22: \u00a3430m tax charge) in the statement of comprehensive income, mainly relating to our pension scheme.\n\nWe expect our sustainable income statement effective tax rate before specific items to be around the UK rate of corporation tax, as we do most of our business in the UK.\n\n## Earnings per share\n\nReported earnings per share was 19.4p, up 6.5p, while adjusted b earnings per share was 22.0p, up 1.7p.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nCapital expenditure was \u00a35,056m (FY22: \u00a35,286m). The decrease was driven by the impact of our prior year investment in spectrum which offset Openreach's increased investment in fixed network infrastructure.\n\nCapital expenditure contracted but not yet spent was \u00a31,480m at 31 March 2023 (FY22: \u00a31,596m).\n\n## Cash flow\n\nNet cash inflow from operating activities was \u00a36,724m, up 14%.\n\nNormalised free cash flow d was \u00a31,328m, down 5% due to increased cash capital expenditure and adverse working capital movements, offset by EBITDA growth and a tax refund.\n\nYou can see a reconciliation to normalised free cash flow d from net cash inflow from operating activities (the most directly comparable IFRS measure) on page 234.\n\nThe net cash cost of specific items adjusted from normalised free cash flow d was \u00a3404m (FY22: \u00a3606m), primarily relating to restructuring payments.\n\n## Sports JV performance\n\nIn August 2022, we formed a sports joint venture (Sports JV) with Warner Bros.

Both joint venturers contributed, sublicensed or delivered the benefit of their respective sports rights and distribution businesses for the UK & Ireland to the Sports JV. Both parties each hold a 50% ordinary equity interest and equal voting rights in the Sports JV.\n\nOn completion of the transaction, the group recorded an investment in Sports JV for our ordinary shareholding at a fair value of \u00a3414m and investments in two classes of preference shares in the Sports JV, with a combined fair value of \u00a3589m. Subsequently in FY23, we have recorded a \u00a362m share of accounting loss of the Sports JV, reducing the carrying value of our equity investment to \u00a3352m at 31 March 2023, and a net decrease of \u00a334m in the fair value of the investment in preference shares - refer to note 25 of the consolidated financial statements for more details.\n\nAs part of the transaction, we entered into a distribution agreement with the Sports JV, which includes a minimum revenue guarantee of \u00a32bn for the first four years.

The \u00a32.0bn increase reflects negative asset returns mainly due to higher real gilt yields, partly offset by an increase in the real discount rate reducing liabilities and \u00a31.0bn of deficit contributions paid over the period.\n\nThe movements in the deficit for the group's defined benefit plans are shown below:\n\n## \u00a3bn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Net of deferred tax asset\n- Deferred tax asset\n\nNote 20 to the consolidated financial statements gives more information on our pension arrangements.\n\n## Net debt b and net financial debt\n\nNet financial debt (which excludes lease liabilities) was \u00a313.5bn at 31 March 2023, compared to \u00a312.2bn at 31 March 2022. The increase was mainly due to pension scheme contributions; normalised free cash flow was mostly offset by dividend payments and cash specifics.\n\nNet debt b (which includes lease liabilities) was \u00a318.9bn at 31 March 2023, compared to \u00a318.0bn at 31 March 2022. The difference to the movement in net financial debt reflects lease movements.\n\nAt 31 March 2023 the group held cash and current investment balances of \u00a33.9bn. The current portion of loans and other borrowings is \u00a31.8bn.\n\nOur \u00a32.1bn revolving credit facility, which matures in March 2027, remains undrawn at 31 March 2023.\n\nWe remain committed to our credit rating target of BBB+ and minimum rating of BBB. During FY23, all of the major agencies confirmed their ratings at BBB or equivalent.\n\n- a Primarily reflects the impact on the liabilities of actual inflation being higher than assumed at the prior reporting date. There has been a broadly equivalent benefit to inflation-linked assets from higher inflation.\n- b Loans and other borrowings and lease liabilities (both current and non-current), less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents, including items which have been classified as held for sale on the balance sheet. Currency denominated balances within net debt are translated to sterling at swapped rates where hedged. Fair value adjustments and accrued interest applied to reflect the effective interest method are removed. Amounts due to joint ventures held within loans and borrowings are also excluded.

Adjusted b EBITDA was up 16% due to rights and production cost savings from the BT Sport disposal along with adjusted revenue growth and tight cost management, including lower indirect mobile commissions.\n\nNormalised free cash flow was up due to adjusted EBITDA growth and favourable device working capital movements, offset by sports rights timing.\n\nCapital expenditure was flat with continued mobile network, equipment and digital investment.\n\nChurn continues to remain stable in a competitive market with Ofcom complaints in EE lower than or in line with industry average for mobile, broadband and landline and in BT Ofcom complaints were lower than or in line with industry average for broadband and landline.\n\n## Enterprise\n\nAdjusted a revenue\n\nAdjusted a operating pro/fit\n\n## \u00a34,962m (4)%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                               |         |         | Change   | Change   |\n|-------------------------------|---------|---------|----------|----------|\n| Year ended 31 March           | 2023 \u00a3m | 2022 \u00a3m | \u00a3m       | %        |\n| Adjusted a  revenue           | 4,962   | 5,157   | (195)    | (4)      |\n| Adjusted a  operating  costs  | 3,568   | 3,521   | 47       | 1        |\n| Adjusted b EBITDA             | 1,394   | 1,636   | (242)    | (15)     |\n| Depreciation &  amortisation  | 842     | 724     | 118      | 16       |\n| Adjusted a  operating  profit | 552     | 912     | (360)    | (39)     |\n| Capital expenditure           | 608     | 569     | 39       | 7        |\n| Normalised free  cash flow c  | 522     | 791     | (269)    | (34)     |\n\nAdjusted revenue was down, driven by the migration of an MVNO customer, legacy contract exits and declines in legacy products.

        "page_content": "## Regulatory update\n\nFibre build, the cost of living crisis, migrating off legacy networks and net neutrality led our regulatory agenda this year. In broadband, fixed and mobile retail markets, inflation and investment commitments made consumer and business price rises unavoidable. We're transparent about pricing, while proactively supporting those in financial difficulty. We're looking to restart our digital voice migration this summer after listening to feedback and ensuring we protect the most vulnerable. In mobile, Ofcom's strategy review recognised the link between financial return and market competitiveness. We're also switching off our 3G network next year, repurposing our spectrum on to the more efficient 4G/5G technologies.\n\n## Fibre builds and pricing: competing fairly in a thriving market\n\nIn 2021, Ofcom set out the regulatory regime for full fibre investment in its 2021-26 Wholesale Fixed Telecoms Market Review. Ofcom keeps monitoring Openreach activities and the overall market to make sure it is competitive and delivers good customer outcomes.\n\nOpenreach continues to build full fibre and connect customers at pace, while pricing transparently. It also continues to deliver on its commitment, under the regulatory regime, delivering over 3 million rural connections as part of its overall build. In December 2022, it told Ofcom about Equinox 2, a new wholesale fibre offer introducing price discounts designed to promote copper to fibre migration. Ofcom is still reviewing whether Equinox 2 is consistent with its goal of promoting fibre market competition and is expected to make a decision by end of May 2023.\n\nIn December 2022, Cityfibre raised a Competition Act complaint about Openreach to the Competition and Markets Authority and Ofcom. Ofcom is still considering whether to launch an investigation on the back of this.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Openreach's regulated quality of service targets\n\nOpenreach attaches the highest priority to delivering the best level of service for its customers. In FY23, Openreach had very strong service performance in Q1 and Q4 and continues to achieve high customer satisfaction scores. Its performance against Ofcom's targets across the year was impacted by industrial action in Q2 and Q3 such that we have reported a narrow miss against 3 of the total of 35 targets.\n\n## Living costs and pricing: being transparent and protecting the vulnerable\n\nIn December, Ofcom opened a crossindustry enforcement programme on 'in-contract price variation terms'. Its aim is to check whether individual providers' past pricing policies were prominent and transparent enough to consumers who signed contracts between March 2021 and June 2022.\n\nIn February, Ofcom launched a separate policy review to check whether inflation linked mid-contract price rises give customers enough clarity on future pricing, especially given the current inflationary environment.\n\nWe continue to be upfront and transparent with all our customers on pricing, making sure annual in-contract price rises are clear and predictable when they buy a service from us. We also contact customers by email, post or text message well ahead of a price change, explaining if and how it will affect them.\n\nDuring the year we boosted help for those needing it most in paying for services:\n\n- -  We have more customers on subsidised or social tariffs than the rest of the industry combined (c. 1m). Of those customers on a social tariff, 85% are with BT.\n- -  We continued providing affordable broadband at \u00a315 a month for eligible customers.\n- -  In November we launched EE Mobile Basics - giving customers 5GB of data for \u00a312 a month.\n- -  Through 2023, we're freezing prices for more than 3m social tariff, landline-only and pay-as-you-go customers.\n- -  We led the industry to develop the first eligibility checker using Department for Work and Pensions data - making signing up to social tariffs easier for those eligible.\n- -  We have debt and disconnection policies in place to support vulnerable consumers.",

This switch is vital to support future-proofed networks, but is sensitive for customers. It will affect many across society, including vulnerable customers, as well as the UK's critical national infrastructure.\n\nFollowing customer feedback, last year we paused migrating consumer customers to put in place extra measures to protect vulnerable people. While voluntary digital switches continued, during the pause we worked to give better back-up options to those that needed them, and we listened extensively to our vulnerable customers' needs.\n\nIn April 2023 we expanded our updated digital voice migration trials beyond Salisbury and Mildenhall (Openreach's PSTN switch-off trial locations) - aiming to restart the migration in summer 2023. We'll continue to work closely with Government, Ofcom, the industry and user groups to minimise any disruption for all.\n\nIn the mobile market, 3G is quickly becoming obsolete. It consumes 35% of EE's mobile network power but carries less than 1% of total data. When we switch off our 3G network in January 2024, it will reduce our power consumption and carbon footprint by 48,650 metric tonnes of CO 2 .\n\nIn February, Ofcom published what it expects from mobile providers in managing this switch. We'll give customers lots of notice about when they might need to upgrade their mobiles to keep using data services.\n\n## Policymakers: mobile investment, competition and coverage\n\nOur 5G mobile network now covers 68% of the UK population; over 500 small towns and villages now have EE 5G signal for the first time. Our 4G network ambition is to pass 90% of UK landmass by mid-2020s in part as a result of our contribution to the Shared Rural Network.\n\nIn December Ofcom's 'Future approach to mobile markets and spectrum' set out a vision for the industry. It found that mobile investment and customer outcomes were still good, with no need for extra consumer protection regulation.\n\nIt also acknowledged that if mobile network providers' financial returns were lower than capital costs for a long time this would disincentivise investment and could lead to 'weaker competition and poorer outcomes for customers'.\n\nIn April 2023 Government's newly created Department for Science, Innovation and Technology also published its Wireless Infrastructure Review which focuses on improving the investment environment and sets out a new ambition to deliver nationwide coverage of standalone 5G to all populated areas by 2030. Government asked Ofcom to also review how well spectrum pricing works.\n\n## Net neutrality and digital markets: growing policy debate\n\nThe modern internet needs modern rules. There is a growing global debate on how to balance customers' rights to internet access with greater flexibility supporting network efficiency and investment.\n\nIn October, Ofcom's net neutrality consultation proposed that internet service providers should be able to differentiate offerings - including premium internet for gaming or specialised services - and use traffic management to tackle network congestion.\n\nWe welcome this proposal. We believe there needs to be more commercial flexibility to negotiate better efficiency, improve content coordination and make sure the heaviest traffic loaders don't affect everyone else's online experience.\n\nOn digital markets, we continue to contribute to Ofcom's Digital Strategy work programme. That includes its Cloud Services Market Study and emerging work on overthe-top communications services (NIICs).",

        "page_content": "## A letter from the Chair of Openreach\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Without question, the last 12 months have been tough for everyone.\n\nLike other businesses, we've been hit by rising inflation and supply chain challenges. And we can see the pressures facing our people, our communications provider (CP) customers and households up and down the country.\n\nIn that context, I'm proud that we've achieved a solid year of progress at Openreach. One of the main reasons for that progress is that our purpose and strategy remain crystal clear.\n\nAs the nation's largest wholesale broadband network, we keep the country connected and we're building the next generation of digital infrastructure ultrafast, ultra-reliable full fibre to 25m homes and businesses.\n\nWe're laser focused on that goal. We know it will deliver the best possible outcome for our customers and help power the UK's growth and ambition for decades ahead.\n\n## Delivering on our ambition\n\nThis year we've continued to build our new network at record pace.\n\nFull fibre is now available to 10.3m homes and businesses - including 3.1m in mainly rural locations. We've kept a balanced approach to build in rural and urban areas, reaching more than 59k premises every single week.\n\nWe remain focused on efficiency. We've maintained a low cost of \u00a3250-\u00a3350 to reach each premises despite inflationary pressures, and without compromising on quality or safety standards. And, most importantly for our future, we're winning the real race - to upgrade customers and all of our CPs on to that new network.\n\nThere's a growing appetite for full fibre. This year we've seen record order and provision volumes and more than 3.1m homes and businesses already reaping the benefits of our fastest, most reliable broadband connection.\n\nAnd we're not stopping there. We expect substantial growth in customer numbers next year - driven by sharper pricing offers and the long-term certainty we're giving CPs.\n\n## Investing in people, diversity and inclusion\n\nAs always, our near 37,000 people are at the heart of our business and purpose.\n\nThis year, we hired over 3,000 people and we continue to invest heavily in training and developing our existing workforce. We've already retrained thousands of copperskilled engineers to work on our new fibre network.\n\nWe also made good progress on becoming more inclusive and diverse. This is a long journey for a business and industry like ours, but we're committed to building a workplace that fully represents the communities we serve all over the UK. More of our trainee engineer recruits were women last year and our People Networks - which champion diversity and inclusion grew to 7,500 members.\n\nGiven the financial challenges everyone's facing, it was also important that BT Group was able to help as many of our colleagues as possible through bringing forward the 2023 pay award to January.\n\n## Being safe and responsible\n\nOpenreach has a responsibility to both its people and the planet.\n\nThe work we do comes with inherent risk, so our safety practices are paramount. I'm encouraged by the progress made in further strengthening our safety culture. But one injury is one too many. So we'll continue to invest in training and innovations that encourage a stronger safety culture for our people and the public.\n\nWe also understand we're in a unique position to deliver positive environmental change. Our 29,000-strong van fleet represents a big opportunity to cut our atmospheric impact - and we've pledged to switch most of it to electric or zero emissions by 2030.\n\nWe've already invested in over 2,000 electric vans. But there are considerable challenges to this programme, including the lack of charging infrastructure and supply chain. Next year we'll continue to work hard with stakeholders to overcome these barriers.\n\n## Competing fairly\n\nWith the massive investment and transformation happening across the country, it's no surprise to see increasing scrutiny on the telecoms market and the intense competition that's playing out.\n\nWith that in mind, we understand our legal and regulatory obligations inside out and we're committed to both competing intensely and fairly and supporting our industry. We're clear. Our job at Openreach is to maintain a strong and sustainable business for colleagues, shareholders and the nation.\n\n## Upgrading the UK to digital phone lines\n\nResponding to BT's plan to retire the analogue PSTN system is a critical programme for Openreach. We've continued our work this year to support CPs and the industry to withdraw analogue services.\n\nOur trials in Salisbury and Mildenhall helped us test, understand and improve the readiness of all kinds of customers for this change. We've honed our ability to migrate them smoothly and safely to futureproof digital products.\n\nWe'll continue to speed up this work next year - when we also hope to see a step change in awareness as CP migrations ramp up.\n\n## Looking forward\n\nBroadband usage hit record-breaking levels in 2022, and we know that faster, more reliable connectivity has become a necessity for almost everyone.\n\nWith this in mind, next year's focus will be to keep building, delivering and upgrading. The more customers we upgrade to our full fibre network, the more everyone will reap the benefits of an ultrafast, digitally connected economy.\n\nAs ever, I thank all our people for their dedication, resilience and the good progress we've made towards fulfilling our goals this year.\n\n## Mike McTighe\n\nChair, Openreach 17 May 2023",

        "page_content": "## Risk management\n\nRisk management taken seriously and done simply and consistently helps us make the best decisions for our colleagues, customers, shareholders and wider stakeholders in the face of uncertainty. This helps protect BT Group and drive growth.\n\n## Strong foundations built on our risk mindset aligned with strategy\n\nOur business thrives on stakeholder trust. That means we must manage risks smartly to achieve our ambition, deliver our strategy, support our business model and protect our assets while leading the way to a bright, sustainable future.\n\nOur leaders promote a mindset of being smart with risk when making bold choices. Our code sets expected behaviours for all our colleagues. We have ongoing training and formally defined risk management roles that help weave risk awareness into our culture.\n\nRisk management aligns with our internal strategic framework, business planning and performance management. This helps integrate risk thinking into key decisionmaking areas and makes sure we share information in a joined-up way for the biggest impact.\n\n## The ongoing risks we face\n\nWe divide our risk landscape into 16 Group Risk Categories (GRCs) of enduring risks - like supply management and legal compliance. These will always be important, needing consistent, enduring structures to manage them across the group.\n\nEach GRC has an Executive Committee sponsor. This provides accountability, tone from the top and joined-up risk thinking. GRCs set how we measure and manage our risk exposure. They ensure we do what's needed to achieve and maintain our target risk appetite and level of control.\n\nThis is facilitated through our risk management framework. For each GRC, we set our risk appetite - how much risk we're willing to take underpinned by metrics with upper and lower boundaries setting our tolerance. We manage these risks through simple and clear policies, underpinned by standards and controls. We use a 'three lines of defence' model to clarify and coordinate assurance activities and to give confidence to stakeholders.\n\nThis year we focused on enhancing our internal control arrangements. We simplified all our corporate policies, replacing them with new, much shorter policies aligned to each of the 16 GRCs. Each policy is supported by standards clearly setting out who needs to do what to comply with the policy.\n\nUnderpinning this, we also designed a group-wide Key Control Framework. This will help us manage all our enduring risks consistently and efficiently across the business - driving accountability and letting us target assurance activities. Next year, we'll focus on further embedding this Key Control Framework. We'll replace legacy activities and processes and make it the bedrock of assessing and assuring how effectively we're managing enduring risks.\n\n## Dynamic risks we face\n\nWe're also aware of and act on significant, dynamic risks and uncertainties. There are two types:\n\n- 1. Point risks (risks which can't be managed properly through the Key Control Framework, or that are materially significant to us and need to be separately managed)\n- 2. Emerging risks (long-term uncertainties which might be materially significant but which we can't currently fully define as a point risk).\n\nFor these dynamic risks we assign management ownership and identify and execute appropriate actions.\n\nWe categorise dynamic risks by GRC based on their causes and consequences. There are examples in the following pages.\n\n## Connecting it all up\n\nEach unit leadership team regularly reviews its exposure across the GRCs and brings together any point and emerging risks to prioritise and act on. Categorising risks by GRC helps us spot broad trends, so we can understand potential impacts and respond in a consistent and coordinated way.\n\nOur risk management tool, ARTEMIS, supports this with real-time access to risk and assurance information. This helps us link risk and control data and simplify reporting - so we can spend more time on the right behaviours, conversations and actions.\n\nOur Emerging Risk Hubs consider the more ambiguous and cross-group uncertainties we face. They bring together cross-functional representatives to share intelligence, identify potential trade-offs and agree actions.",

        "page_content": "## Risk management continued\n\n## The context we operate in\n\nThis year a combination of economic pressures, increased competitive intensity, industrial action and supply chain disruption have created a challenging environment.\n\nInside the group, our business model, technology shifts and transformation initiatives are changing the quantity, type and location of skills and talent we need.\n\nOutside the group, today's inflationary environment affects us across a number of our GRCs. We've included some examples of point risks in the following pages. As part of our long-term viability analysis, we've also considered the effects of sustained inflation on our business (see pages 81 to 82).\n\nIn the past 12 months, two GRCs which have had a lot of focus are supply management and cyber security.\n\nWe continue to develop our risk management structures. This lets us respond well to this volatile and complex operating environment. Whether reviewing and adjusting risk appetite, managing new or emerging risks, strengthening our controls or managing risks in programmes and change initiatives, we're always learning to help us make smarter decisions to protect ourselves and drive growth.\n\n## Supply management\n\nThe level of risk in our supply chains is high. We have to manage a combination of energy volatility, inflation and supply shortages (like semiconductors and fibre optic cables).\n\nThese issues are happening against a backdrop of increasing geopolitical instability that will likely cause continued disruption. During the year we reviewed our risk appetite and supporting metrics for this category, embedding them into key decisions to get the right balance between supply chain resilience and efficiency.\n\nGeopolitical tensions in the South China Sea increased during the year and China continues to dominate our supply chain emerging risks. We recently ran a crisis simulation based on further escalation in the region, to understand better our exposure and critical supply options and to test our preparedness for a major supply chain event. From that, we created a playbook defining our approach, process and roles and responsibilities for managing such a disruption - and integrated it into our group-wide crisis management process and governance structures. We're also monitoring progress and further developments through our crossfunctional Geopolitical Risk Hub.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Cyber security\n\nWe're a high-profile provider of critical national infrastructure. That makes us a prominent target for hostile cyber actors and we remain vigilant to this threat. This year the Russia-Ukraine conflict was a significant part of the cyber security backdrop. We'll keep monitoring shortand medium-term implications.\n\nSecurity is at the centre of our business. We've brought together cyber, physical and personnel security teams into one function under a new expanded Executive Committee role of Chief Security and Networks Officer.\n\nOur security stance continues to evolve. This year we commissioned an external review to assess and benchmark our security maturity, and we used the results to define and mobilise a new security strategy. We've also made delivering the requirements of the Telecommunications (Security) Act 2021 a key multi-year cyber security priority.\n\nWe'll never stop working to protect customers from cyber security-related harms. A recent example is our initiative to block international scam calls on landlines - which blocked 10 million calls in the first month.",

But each also contains examples of point and emerging risks. Scenarios used for our viability analysis, put forward for each GRC, are also noted here.\n\n## Strategic\n\n## Strategy, technology and competition\n\nSponsor: Chief Financial Officer\n\n## What this category covers\n\nWhile developing and executing a strategy to grow value for stakeholders, we must manage risks from an uncertain economic context, intensifying competition and rapid changes in customer and technology trends.\n\nChanges could affect our profit, shareholder value and reputation. Similarly, pursuing the wrong strategy, not reflecting strategy in business plans, or not executing against it could make us less competitive and create less long-term sustainable value.\n\n## Our appetite for risk in this category\n\nOur risk appetite sets our tolerance for managing 'internal' risks associated with this category which include developing the right strategy, ensuring it is reflected in the business plan and executing against it.\n\nWe measure and track this through the performance of specific metrics. We also qualitatively assess how clearly our strategy is defined, the robustness of our strategic analysis and how closely our business and financial plans reflect our strategy.\n\nDoing this means we will make robust strategic choices and execute them to stay competitive and grow value for all our stakeholders.\n\n## Examples of what we do to manage this category\n\n- -  we extensively monitor, research and analyse economic, customer, market, competitor and technology trends\n- -  the Executive Committee and Board discusses key strategic topics throughout the year\n- -  the Executive Committee and Board frequently review performance against our strategic priorities/targets.\n\n## Dynamic risk examples in this category\n\n## Point risks:\n\n- -  uncertain economic outlook which may suppress demand, increase customers' price sensitivity and drive up costs\n- -  intensifying competition in the retail broadband and fixed wholesale access markets could increase churn and impact our market share\n- -  slower than expected progress on key programmes could limit our ability to deliver our strategy and growth ambitions.\n\n## Emerging risk:\n\n- -  ecosystem changes in the industry (like private 5G networks) could reduce our revenue and increase customer churn.\n\n## Scenario considered in viability analysis/planning\n\nHyperscalers making direct moves into our markets.\n\n## Stakeholder management\n\nSponsor: Corporate Affairs Director\n\n## What this category covers\n\nTrusted stakeholder management is essential to us achieving our ambitions. We listen to and communicate with stakeholders fairly and transparently to build strong, sustainable relationships.\n\nSome sensitive topics need extra focus. These include network plans, customer fairness, net neutrality, using technology responsibly, ESG and industrial relations.\n\n## Our appetite for risk in this category\n\nWe recognise the importance of strong stakeholder relationships and consider them when setting strategy and making decisions.\n\nAt times this creates tensions when weighing up choices: price rises to sustain investment, markets we operate in, who we buy from and sell to, the way we use and develop technology and how we use data.\n\nWe want to sustain our sector leadership on reputation and trust among professional opinion formers, and our top quartile position on ESG.\n\n## Examples of what we do to manage this category\n\n- -  we monitor the media, and track our reputation across our main stakeholder groups\n- -  we engage with stakeholders to build stronger relationships. See our stakeholder section on pages 40 to 45 for details\n- -  our Manifesto (pages 36 to 39) sets out our commitment to growth through responsible, inclusive and sustainable technology. The Digital Impact & Sustainability Committee provides Board-level governance\n- -  our cross-organisational Responsible Technology Steering Group and the Geopolitical Risk Hub bring together representatives from across the group to share intelligence and agree actions.\n\n## Dynamic risk examples in this category\n\n## Point risks:\n\n- -  the impact of inflation and cost of living on customers which may reduce demand or increase churn\n- -  protecting our customers' interests while migrating to digital products and closing legacy networks.\n\n## Emerging risks:\n\n- -  escalating geopolitical tensions\n- -  climate change and perceptions of our sector's role in carbon emissions.

If these failed it could result in material financial losses or cause us to misrepresent our financial position.\n\nWe might fail to apply the correct accounting principles and treatment. This could result in financial misstatement, fines, legal disputes and reputational damage.\n\n## Our appetite for risk in this category\n\nWe want our overall financial control framework to be effective so that there is a less than remote likelihood of a material financial misstatement in our reported numbers.\n\nWe have defined the proportion of our financial controls that we aim to be preventative rather than detective, and automated rather than manual.\n\nWe take a risk-based approach to compliance monitoring through a combination of sample testing and financial data analytics.\n\n## Examples of what we do to manage this category\n\n- -  we maintain financial controls that provide planning and budgetary discipline, efficiency and accuracy while reducing the risk of fraud, leakage or errors\n- -  we continually enhance processes, systems and our operating model to improve and automate accounting, financial reporting and controls\n- -  we've improved tax risk management processes and training.\n\n## Dynamic risk examples in this category\n\n## Point risks:\n\n- -  not simplifying and modernising our finance processes and operating model could reduce speed and quality of decision making and reporting\n- -  impact of complex legacy systems on our internal controls.\n\n## Emerging risk:\n\n- -  higher chance of fraudulent behaviour from increasing cost of living.\n\n## Scenario considered in viability analysis/planning\n\nA material financial misstatement which could lead to regulatory fines, lawsuits and reputational damage.",

Key areas of focus for this category are anti-bribery and corruption, competition, trade sanctions, export controls and corporate governance obligations.\n\n## Our appetite for risk in this category\n\nWe want to take advantage of commercial opportunities. So we take considered, evidenced and defensible decisions around how we comply with applicable laws.\n\nWe assess risk to support decisions about proposed actions. This means looking at the nature of the risk, the costs of compliance, the value of the proposed actions and the steps we could take to bring them within our risk appetite.\n\nIn corporate governance, we determine the risks for a position we take by considering things like our rules and policies, market practice, investor expectations and our stakeholders' views.\n\n## Examples of what we do to manage this category\n\n- -  through our code we foster a culture where colleagues know expected standards and speak up if something's not right\n- -  we regularly assess risks when giving legal or compliance advice on strategic projects, signing new business and on our commercial operations\n- -  we train colleagues to know where legal and compliance risks come from, how to handle them and when to get expert help\n- -  we do assurance on day-to-day operations, regions, partners, projects and suppliers.

We expect to continue scaling-up and broadening such products and services over the coming years, which means we must meet all applicable FCA principles, rules and requirements.\n\nOperating outside FCA rules, requirements or permissions could harm customers and lead to fines, loss of FCA permissions, slow service take-up and broader reputational damage.\n\n## Our appetite for risk in this category\n\nWe aim to minimise regulatory risk in two ways. First, by building operational and organisational capabilities that help us develop financial services activities compliantly. Second, by building and maintaining a trusted relationship with the FCA.\n\nWe monitor a range of conduct risk metrics, complaints data and customers in collections. These are early warning indicators of customer harm which we can act on.\n\n## Examples of what we do to manage this category\n\n- -  we review and update relevant standards every year, and implement controls into operational procedures\n- -  we run mandatory training on FCA regulations, aligned to job roles\n- -  we review financial services products and promotions when we develop them and each year afterwards\n- -  our 'second line' compliance team provides support and oversight\n- -  we scan the horizon, interpret new regulatory requirements and regularly communicate with the regulator\n- -  our proportionate governance framework provides clear responsibility, accountability and reporting.\n\n## Dynamic risk examples in this category\n\n## Point risks:\n\n- -  we might not have enough operational capability and resources to support our financial services strategy\n- -  we could fail to comply with new Consumer Duty regulation, leading to regulatory scrutiny/challenge and brand damage.\n\n## Emerging risk:\n\n- -  the extra FCA permissions needed to undertake new activities will need us to comply with new regulatory framework areas. We could fail to do that.\n\n## Scenario considered in viability analysis/planning\n\nFailing to get full FCA permissions and the impact on product rollout and projected revenue.",

To achieve that we must prioritise our resources to maximise overall service and customer experience, whilst aligning with our strategy.\n\nWe aim to deliver exceptional performance for high volume (FTTC/4G) and strategic (FTTP/5G) products and maintain reasonable performance for legacy services.\n\n## Examples of what we do to manage this category\n\n- -  we continuously capacity plan, manage asset lifecycles and monitor our network, assets and services\n- -  we respond quickly and professionally to incidents, reducing their impact through geographically dispersed emergency response teams - while communicating with customers\n- -  we have comprehensive testing and change management processes\n- -  we do regular business impact assessments that feed into tested, up-to-date continuity and disaster recovery plans\n- -  we ensure our operational estate has requisite levels of physical security controls in place to assure service\n- -  our operational planning improves network and IT resilience, including handling more frequent and severe bad weather.\n\n## Dynamic risk examples in this category\n\n## Point risks:\n\n- -  increasing flood risk at non-protected sites could lead to flooding, interrupting services\n- -  not creating robust contracts and/or managing relationships with third parties might lead to gaps in support arrangements and extended fix times, creating poor customer experience and churn.\n\n## Emerging risk:\n\n- -  failing to properly manage significant changes to our digital estate could interrupt services and delay fix times.\n\n## Scenario considered in viability analysis/planning\n\nOngoing crisis in the energy sector leads to insufficient gas supply and energy volatility.\n\n## Cyber security\n\nSponsor: Chief Security and Networks Officer\n\n## What this category covers\n\nOur aim is to protect the group, colleagues and customers from harm and financial loss from cyber security events.\n\nBecause we run critical national infrastructure, a cyber attack could disrupt both customers and the country and compromise data.\n\nA poorly managed cyber security event might cost us money, damage our reputation and impact our market share. The regulator might also impose fines or penalties.\n\n## Our appetite for risk in this category\n\nCyber risk is inherent to our business, and significant reputational damage could be incurred by a major cyber event, but we acknowledge that not all cyber risks can be eradicated.\n\nCyber events could be deliberate or unintentional, originate from inside or outside the group, and we adapt our security posture and controls accordingly to detect and respond robustly to the evolving threat.\n\nWe prioritise the protection of our critical systems and networks, and the data and information they contain.\n\n## Examples of what we do to manage this category\n\n- -  we have leading best practice security standards, tools and processes to protect our applications, systems and networks\n- -  we monitor external threats and gather intelligence on evolving cyber techniques, tactics and capabilities\n- -  to quickly detect, assess and respond to cyber risks we maintain a vigilant security stance\n- -  we run communications, engagement and training\n- -  we continue to invest in cyber defences and security tooling, shifting to automation where appropriate\n- -  we nurture partnerships with industry, government and customers.\n\n## Dynamic risk examples in this category\n\n## Point risks:\n\n- -  cyber attacks from nation states could target critical national infrastructure which could lead to service disruption, data loss, regulatory action and damage to our reputation\n- -  exposure to suppliers with security vulnerabilities which might result in compromised supply chains, increased costs, loss of data or interrupted services\n- -  relying on externally hosted cloud services potentially impacting service delivery and customer experience.\n\n## Emerging risks:\n\n- -  AI and machine learning could be weaponised as security threats\n- -  more connected home devices means more focus on protecting customers.\n\n## Scenario considered in viability analysis/planning\n\nWe fall victim to cyber attacks and experience a major loss of customer data which leads to a successful class action against us.",

We avoid risks that could compromise critical business priorities and minimise those which cannot be avoided to as low as reasonably practicable. We avoid risks that could result in us not complying with applicable employment legislation.\n\nA relatively small number of roles have a disproportionate effect on our success. For those roles we have a much lower tolerance for the risk of not having the right capabilities, compared to other roles in the organisation.\n\nTo deliver our transformation, we're prepared to take carefully managed short-term employee relations risks to achieve our ambitions.\n\n## Examples of what we do to manage this category\n\n- -  our group people strategy is supported by a workforce plan\n- -  we share consistent performance goals and performance management review processes - through clear organisation structures, roles and job descriptions\n- -  we assess skills and capabilities, invest in group-wide workforce and talent planning and provide training, development and wellbeing support - for specific roles, future skills and succession planning\n- -  our D&I strategy raises awareness, addresses bias and promotes our People Networks and support (read more about D&I and our people on pages 32 to 35)\n- -  we engage with employees and maintain close relationships with formal representative groups and unions\n- -  we offer fair, competitive and sustainable remuneration to promote smart risk taking, support engagement and retention and help align colleagues' and shareholders' interests.\n\n## Dynamic risk examples in this category\n\n## Point risks:\n\n- -  large-scale, escalated industrial action could increase disruption, affect colleague engagement and damage our reputation\n- -  changes to our strategy, technology or business model could affect what skills we need. Coupled with tightened talent markets, higher pay and increased attrition, this could create skills gaps.\n\n## Emerging risks:\n\n- -  long-term social and workplace changes\n- -  growing colleague activism on social or environmental topics.\n\n## Scenario considered in viability analysis/planning\n\nWidespread lack of availability of frontline colleagues impacting service delivery and leading to poor customer experience and reputational harm.\n\n## Health, safety and environment\n\nSponsor: Chief Security and Networks Officer\n\n## What this category covers\n\nWe have diverse working environments in various locations, some of which could pose a health or safety risk to colleagues, partners or the public. We must make sure our colleagues and partners are safe and healthy and can perform at their best while managing hazards that could harm them.\n\nNot maintaining or continually improving the right health, safety and environmental management systems could impact our provision of a safe and compliant business which protects colleagues.\n\nIneffective health, safety and environmental standards could lead to legal or financial penalties, and reputational and commercial damage.\n\n## Our appetite for risk in this category\n\nIt's important that employees and partners follow appropriate standards which support our business priorities. We aim to eliminate all unacceptable risks. We apply proactive risk management to identify, control and mitigate significant risks across the business to a level deemed as low as reasonably practicable.\n\nWe consider our legal, regulatory and other requirements the minimum obligation. We want to go beyond that - aiming for zero avoidable harm, optimum physical and mental health and minimal pollution.\n\n## Examples of what we do to manage this category\n\n- -  our group policy is underpinned by standards and a safety framework reflected in our code\n- -  we train colleagues and make sure they're clear on their roles and responsibilities around health, safety and environment\n- -  we monitor health and safety through colleague surveys, focus groups and a dedicated portal\n- -  our incident reporting system monitors and evaluates our health, safety and environmental performance.\n\n## Dynamic risk examples in this category\n\n## Point risks:\n\n- -  heightened risks from the extra civil and construction work supporting the full fibre rollout including harm to colleagues, increased regulatory scrutiny, legal claims and reputational damage\n- -  failure to manage contractors properly when they start and during their contracts, potentially leading to harm to colleagues, partners or the public, regulatory intervention and legal claims\n- -  failure to keep our sites clean, tidy and environmentally safe could lead to increased fire risks or compliance breaches.\n\n## Emerging risk:\n\n- -  complying with future health, safety and environment regulation.\n\n## Scenario considered in viability analysis/planning\n\nA new pandemic as severe as Covid-19 causes harm to colleagues, disrupted service delivery and business operations.",

We do that, while navigating customer relationships and risk in complex agreements - delivering highly sensitive, critical or essential services globally.\n\nCustomer contractual terms can be onerous and challenging to meet which might lead to delays, penalties and disputes. Delivery or service failures against obligations and commitments could damage our brand and reputation, particularly for critical infrastructure contracts or security and data protection services. Not managing contract exits, migrations, renewals and disputes could erode profit margins and affect future customer relationships.\n\n## Our appetite for risk in this category\n\nWe want a diverse mix of major contracts that will help our business grow. To do that, we must build on our market share, target the right customers, make beneficial commercial and legal agreements and deliver services successfully.\n\nAs markets change, we need to proactively adjust our portfolio of services, countries and customers to avoid concentration risk, stagnation and legacy dependency.\n\nWe know this involves taking on some higher risk, complex customer agreements with obligations we can't fully meet through standard portfolio, terms and conditions and/or delivery process. We must manage this risk during the bid process and contract lifecycle to minimise the overall impact.\n\n## Examples of what we do to manage this category\n\n- -  we have a clear governance framework to assess new business opportunities, manage bids and monitor in-life contract risks\n- -  as part of bids, we check non-standard unfavourable terms and conditions, mitigating them where we can\n- -  our senior management, and a dedicated team, regularly review our contracts\n- -  we support frontline contract managers with contract and obligation management tools.\n\n## Dynamic risk examples in this category\n\n## Point risks:\n\n- -  inflationary pressures affecting our supply chain might not be fully offset by adjusted prices given market challenges or us not having leverage to negotiate\n- -  new IT infrastructure challenges, skills shortages, scale or complexity could stop us delivering our digital portfolio transformation.\n\n## Emerging risks:\n\n- -  increasing geopolitical tensions and East/West divide could affect our multinational customers and our ability to provide global connectivity\n- -  it could be difficult to manage EU contracts if the UK and EU don't renew their data adequacy agreement.\n\n## Scenario considered in viability analysis/planning\n\nLosing major public services contracts.\n\n## Customers, brand and product\n\nSponsor: CEO, Consumer (excluding Openreach, which has separate GRC sponsorship and management)\n\n## What this category covers\n\nWe want to give customers standout service, building personal and enduring relationships and taking extra care of vulnerable customers. We aim to keep customer satisfaction high as we continue to migrate customers from legacy products and services to newer ones - while billing them accurately.\n\nNot digitising or continually improving our customer experience could affect customer satisfaction and retention, colleague pride and advocacy, revenues and brand value.\n\nCentral to this is being accurate and competitive with our pricing, billing and collection. We must also manage our product and service lifecycles, inventory and supply chain, and comply with our customer obligations and product and service standards.\n\n## Our appetite for risk in this category\n\nWe want to be below the industry average for Ofcom complaints and continue to grow our NPS. We aim to maintain customer satisfaction, launch new products and services that benefit them and keep billing issues to a minimum.\n\nWe must serve customers through modern and cost-effective platforms - with as few as possible on expensive and labour intensive legacy and aging products and services. We also want customers to feel they get personalised service through frictionfree channels.\n\n## Examples of what we do to manage this category\n\n- -  we stick to our promises on the service levels customers should expect and we track a range of customer experience performance metrics\n- -  we have clear and comprehensive brand usage guidelines\n- -  we work with suppliers to manage ongoing relationships and risks\n- -  we pilot products and services to make sure they benefit customers\n- -  we have a colleague retention and skills development plan to make sure we're not short on key skills.\n\n## Dynamic risk examples in this category\n\n## Point risks:\n\n- -  switching customers from old to new service platforms could interrupt the service and cause customer churn and/or regulator intervention\n- -  failing to make sure we have the right current and future skill sets to serve our customers could lead to not meeting customer expectations, reputational damage and loss of customers and market share.\n\n## Emerging risk:\n\n- -  long-term changes in customer needs and expectations.\n\n## Scenario considered in viability analysis/planning\n\nWrongly billing customers leading to dissatisfaction, unforeseen churn and possible regulatory investigation.",

We must make supplier decisions on concentration, capability, resilience, security, costs and broader issues that could impact our business and reputation.\n\n## Our appetite for risk in this category\n\nOur appetite guides us when we make purchasing decisions. That includes when we sole or dual source for products or services that support key business aims or activities and where alternative sources are not economically viable. To get the best commercial rates and operational resilience we continuously engage with and challenge key suppliers on pricing and supply chain diversity.\n\nWorking with so many third parties needs effective governance to manage them properly. So, we have a low appetite for dealing with suppliers outside our defined policies or processes.\n\nWe have to make sure third parties don't expose our brands to damage. That means avoiding - or stopping working with - any that don't meet our standards on things like human rights.\n\n## Examples of what we do to manage this category\n\n- -  our sourcing strategy uses different approaches by category, standard terms and conditions and controls so we can make purchasing decisions efficiently and effectively\n- -  we have comprehensive supplier due diligence, contract management, on-boarding and in-life assessment processes\n- -  we have robust supplier risk management, performance, renewal and termination processes\n- -  we do demand planning and forecasting, stock counts and inventory management so we have supplies available\n- -  we get assurance that the goods and services we buy are made, delivered and disposed of responsibly. That includes monitoring energy use, labour standards and environmental, social and governance impacts.\n\n## Dynamic risk examples in this category\n\n## Point risks:\n\n- -  rising energy prices, supply shortages, and inflationary pressures could affect cost reduction targets and future investments\n- -  an escalating Russia-Ukraine war and/or China-Taiwan tensions could compound current supply chain challenges.\n\n## Emerging risk:\n\n- -  long-term metal shortages could lead to much higher prices\n- -  extreme climate conditions might disrupt supply chains.\n\n## Scenario considered in viability analysis/planning\n\nGeopolitical uncertainty widens, with wholesale impact on the China supply chain.\n\n## Transformation delivery\n\nSponsor: Chief Financial Officer\n\n## What this category covers\n\nWe're accelerating transformation delivery to build a simpler, more efficient and dynamic BT Group.\n\nWe're modernising and streamlining our IT, simplifying and refining our product portfolio, switching to next-generation strategic networks, unlocking cost efficiencies through better and more agile ways of working, improving our customers' digital journeys, automating our processes and using AI.\n\nFailing to transform could make us less efficient and damage our financial performance and customer experience.\n\n## Our appetite for risk in this category\n\nWe've defined the level of risk we're willing to tolerate for simplifying and modernising our products, customer journeys and technology. We track specific metrics to check we're achieving genuine, sustainable transformation outcomes and not just cutting costs.\n\nDelivering within our risk appetite will give us competitive advantage, enable faster delivery, improve customer experience and ensure our costs benchmark favourably with peers.\n\n## Examples of what we do to manage this category\n\n- -  we invest in digital and data capabilities to cut costs and grow revenue - prioritising it around making sure we have the right resources to deliver sustainable change effectively\n- -  we have strong governance, with senior leaders clearly owning operational and financial outcomes to be delivered. Each quarter we assess performance to allocate funding prioritising programmes delivering the most strategic value\n- -  we share robust tracking and reporting (using financial and non-financial measures) with the Executive Committee and Board monthly\n- -  we hold monthly Executive Committee transformation sessions to accelerate delivery by managing dependencies, making informed decisions and removing blocks.\n\n## Dynamic risk examples in this category\n\n## Point risks:\n\n- -  managing complex interdependencies to complete migrating customers and close legacy IT and networks\n- -  delivering the volume of change at pace while still focusing on cutting costs.\n\n## Emerging risk:\n\n- -  the changing external environment could affect the size, scale and speed of transformation needed to deliver our strategy.\n\n## Scenario considered in viability analysis/planning\n\nThe group is unable to execute transformation plans required to deliver savings initiatives.",

Matters reserved to the Board include items of significant strategic importance, such as those which have a direct impact on the group's funding position, reputation or integrity; and/or ethical standards.\n\n## Digital Impact & Sustainability Committee\n\nOversees our climate change strategy, programme and goals. It's chaired by Non-Executive Director Sara Weller and made up of four Independent Non-Executive Directors. It's attended by our Chief Human Resources Officer, Corporate Affairs Director, Director of Digital Impact and External Communications and the Sustainability and Corporate Affairs Strategy Director.\n\nThe Deputy Company Secretary is secretary to the Committee and attends all meetings. The Committee meets at least three times a year and monitors progress on our long-term digital impact and sustainability goals, including those on climate change. The Chair reports to the Board on our climaterelated activities, including net zero. To support the induction of Sara Weller, as the new Chair of the Digital Impact & Sustainability Committee , and other senior leaders, a training session was held on sustainability and climate change.\n\n## Audit & Risk Committee\n\nMonitors and assesses our risk management and internal control system effectiveness on the Board's behalf. That includes climate change risks which sit under a number of different GRCs, see pages 63, 67 and 70.\n\n## Embedding climate\n\n## change into our strategy\n\nClimate is a core part of our strategic objective to lead the way to a bright, sustainable future.\n\nWe have ambitious strategic and financial targets which aim to ultimately reach net zero and decarbonise our operations by FY31 and value chain by FY41.\n\nOur Carbon Reduction Plan ( bt.com/ carbonreductionplan ) explains what we're doing to reduce operational and value chain emissions. We include our investments on renewable electricity, transforming our buildings estate, energy efficiency and transitioning to a low carbon fleet in our medium term plan. Our medium term plan considers both capital and operating expenditure over a rolling five-year timeframe.\n\nTo reduce customer emissions, in 2021 we set a target to help our customers avoid 60m tonnes of CO2e by FY30. This is based on shifting them to technologies like FTTP, 4G/5G, cloud computing and IoT-based products.\n\n## Management's roles and responsibilities\n\n## Chief Executive\n\nOur Chief Executive is ultimately responsible for our environmental policy and performance. That includes climaterelated issues. After consulting with the Executive Committee the Chief Executive recommended our target to become a net zero carbon emissions business by the end of FY31 for our operations (Scopes 1 and 2) and by the end of FY41 for value chain (Scope 3) to the Digital Impact & Sustainability Committee - who then approved it in 2021.\n\n## Executive Committee\n\nSets operational strategy on climate change and sustainability. It also monitors associated progress, performance and risks - supported by our digital impact and sustainability team.\n\nOur Group Health, Safety & Environment Sub-Committee manages day-today climate-related compliance and risk issues on behalf of the Executive Committee , reporting back regularly.\n\n## Climate change strategy and planning",

We track and report risks to the Audit & Risk Committee and Executive Committee .\n\n## Identifying risks\n\nWe identify climate change risks as part of our risk management framework. We manage them through GRCs - including operational resilience (physical assets), stakeholder management (reputation), and supply management (supply chain).\n\n- Read more on pages 63, 67 and 70.\n\n## Planning climate risks and opportunities across different time horizons\n\nWe think about climate risks and opportunities over short-, medium- and long-term timeframes. We do that in line with our risk management framework and financial planning processes - and considering external legal and regulatory changes.\n\n## Assessing risks\n\nWe evaluate climate risks against time horizon, preparedness and likely degree of impact. We calculate the impact using quantitative and qualitative measures on revenue and market capitalisation, customer experience, and stakeholder perception. This lets us determine relative risk priority.\n\n## Short-term horizon\n\nOur short-term horizon considers the chance of events creating risk exposure over the next three years. We factor acute physical risks like flooding and higher temperatures into our annual plans. This helps us to adapt and reduce the impact on our business and value chain.\n\n- Full detail on our risk management framework can be found on pages 61 to 62 and we describe below how the framework is applied to climate risks.\n\n## Managing and reporting on risks\n\nOur Group Health, Safety & Environment (GHSE) SubCommittee manages a range of risk and compliance issues (including climate change) on behalf of the Executive Committee .

For example, our procurement team measures suppliers' energy use and environmental impact. We decide how to mitigate or control a risk based on its likelihood and impact, leading to investments in areas such as flood defences because more floods could have a big effect on us.\n\n## Long-term horizon\n\nOur long-term horizon matches our investment timeframes for strategic assets like networks that are planned over longer periods - sometimes up to 20 years. It also influences our strategy, targets and plans for responding to the bigger risks and transitional implications of climate change. We also think about climate risks beyond these timeframes. For example, our long-term climate targets extend to FY41, and TCFD scenario analysis set out in the following pages considers risks in 2050.",

For example floods, heatwaves or storms can result in service interruptions and downtime.\n\nThe transition risks that could affect us include changes to policy and regulations in areas like carbon pricing. These could have direct financial implications based on our residual emissions, and changes in customers' behaviour and preferences around purchasing and choice of service provider.\n\nWe considered potential climate-related opportunities for our sector, such as improved energy efficiency and winning new business by positioning ourselves as a leader in our response to climate change.\n\nWe aimed to identify the risks and opportunities that could have the most material financial impact on our business - for example on revenue and current and future costs, including cost of capital.\n\nWe use different scenarios to assess our climate risks and opportunities from physical impacts and the move to a lowcarbon economy. We've based our scenarios on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Network for Greening the Financial System and International Energy Agency, among other sources.\n\nOur analysis is based on a 'middle-of-theroad' scenario of 2\u00b0C to 3\u00b0C warming. We also reviewed 'optimistic' and 'very warm' transition and physical scenarios (1.5\u00b0C and\n\nThe summary of climate scenario analysis results on the next two pages captures our prioritised climate risks and opportunities under a range of outcomes (fifth to 95th percentile) for the different scenarios we considered.\n\nIn line with TCFD guidance and requirements 3 , we modelled the impact on our current strategy and business plan - using current decarbonisation plans and the commitments in our latest medium term plan.\n\nOur results are global in scope. For most risks and opportunities, the contribution from non-UK geographies is relatively limited, as most of our networks and estates are based in the UK. We also operate primarily in the ICT sector. Therefore, we present global figures that are not disaggregated by geography or sector.\n\nWe've treated each risk and opportunity as a mutually exclusive event. We've presented the final outputs in annualised nominal terms, without applying social discount factors to avoid double counting with our financial models. We determined relative financial effects using our risk management framework.\n\n- 1 We mapped our physical risks to the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report's climate scenarios - known as Representative Concentration Pathways. We modelled transition risks using the Network for Greening the Financial System version 3 and International Energy Agency for the scenarios in scope. We derived projections from the World Climate Research Programme's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (versions 5 and 6/ CMIP5 and CMIP6) and the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment. Other climateconditioned data sets include high precision flood data. Where we didn't have scenario data, we used secondary literature proxies and assumptions.\n- 2 NGFS Scenarios Portal.\n- 3 TCFD: Implementing the Recommendations on the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\n4\u00b0C warming) to assess climate change's potential financial impact on BT Group in 2030, 2040 and 2050.\n\nBT Group's TCFD Climate Scenarios in Table 2 below shows the different climaterelated scenarios 1 we've considered to help us to test our organisational strategy's resilience. RCPs (Representative Concentration Pathways) are IPCC greenhouse gas trajectories representing different climate scenarios.\n\n## The results of our analysis\n\nWe consider our strategy to be resilient to climate risks in all modelled scenarios.\n\nThe Current Policies scenario assumes that some climate policies are implemented, but global efforts are not enough to stop significant global warming.\n\nThe Delayed Transition scenario assumes that annual emissions don't fall until 2030, and climate policies are delayed or different across countries and sectors.\n\nThe Net Zero scenario limits global warming to 1.5\u00b0C and assumes that the necessary policy changes are introduced early and become more stringent over time, achieving global net zero CO2e around 2050. 2\n\nUnder a Current Policies scenario, we expect physical risks to have a greater impact than transition risks, as these are driven by more frequent and severe weather, particularly in the longer term.\n\nWe expect transition risks to have a greater impact under the Delayed Transition and Net Zero scenarios - because they're driven by changes in policy and regulation as well as stakeholders' behaviour (including customers).\n\nDelayed Transition scenario trends are similar to Net Zero - but with the impact on the business realised sooner under Net Zero.\n\n| Table 2: BT Group's TCFD Climate Scenarios Model scenarios  (transition risk)   | Model scenarios  (physical risk)   | BT Group temperature equivalent  scenarios (degree of warming by  2100 above pre-industrial levels)   | Scenario descriptions                                                               |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Current   Policies                                                              | RCP 8.5                            | 3.5 - 4.5\u00b0C                                                                                           | High emissions Emissions continue to rise at current   rates with no policy changes |\n| Delayed   Transitions                                                           | RCP 6.0                            | 2.5 - 3\u00b0C                                                                                             | Intermediate emissions Emissions peak around 2060   and then decline                |\n|                                                                                 | RCP 4.5                            | 2 - 2.5\u00b0C                                                                                             | Intermediate emissions Emissions stabilise at half   of today's emissions by 2080   |\n| Net   Zero                                                                      | RCP 1.9 /   RCP 2.6                | 1.5 - 2\u00b0C                                                                                             | Low emissions Emissions halved by 2050,   achieving net zero around 2075            |",

        "page_content": "## Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures continued\n\nRisk management and climate scenario analysis continued\n\n## Physical and transition risks impact by climate scenario and time horizon\n\n## Physical risks\n\nThe biggest physical risk is flooding, with the largest effects coming from indirect losses from business disruption. Across all three physical risks, the worst effects happen under the Current Policies scenario in 2050. More frequent and severe heatwaves and extreme weather would likely mean a need for extra cooling and more business disruption.\n\n## Consumer preferences risk\n\nThere are financial risks from damage to our reputation. These are based on the level of our emissions and speed of decarbonisation compared to the rest of our industry. If we were a lot slower, customers might go elsewhere.\n\nShort-term, this isn't a big risk as any gap is likely to be limited in effect as customer attitudes aren't yet thought to drive material changes. But that could change in the medium to long term, particularly under Net Zero and Delayed Transition scenarios.\n\n## Carbon pricing risk\n\nCarbon pricing poses a more material risk under Delayed Transition and Net Zero scenarios - especially in the medium to long-term as we'd expect carbon prices to rise over time under these scenarios. We'd expect prices to be a lot lower under a Current Policies scenario, minimising any financial impact. Any risk under other scenarios should also be relatively limited, given our plans to reduce emissions under our net zero targets.\n\n## Cost of capital risk\n\nWe could find ourselves paying more interest under a Net Zero scenario from investors demanding a higher risk premium because of slow progress on climate targets. Investments in renewable technologies and other policy mechanisms to drive decarbonisation can impact economic conditions in different climate scenarios, thereby affecting our cost of capital. This potential impact starts to lessen under a Delayed Transition scenario, reducing significantly from 2030-2040.\n\n## Energy efficiency opportunity\n\nThe chance to save money from energy efficiency comes from cutting consumption - by making our building estate and networks more energy efficient. In all scenarios and timeframes, the opportunity for cost savings is minimal compared to other opportunities. This is because we don't rely much on expensive and carbonintensive fossil fuels, because almost all of our energy already comes from renewable electricity.\n\n## Reputation opportunity\n\nThis financial opportunity comes from us winning market share by lowering our emissions and decarbonising quicker than our competitors - resulting in customers switching to us. Short-term, this isn't a big opportunity as any gap would have limited effect as customer attitudes aren't yet thought to drive material changes. But this could grow in the medium to long term - particularly under a Current Policies scenario where we'd expect the rest of the industry to decarbonise slower.\n\n## Being resilient to climate risks\n\nBased on our analysis, we don't think climate risks have a material impact on our financial statements. But we'll closely monitor our prioritised risks and opportunities as part of continually assessing climate risks.\n\nWe're acting to reduce risk across the various climate-related scenarios, with an emphasis on long-term resilience.\n\n## Responding to our main physical risks\n\n## Flooding\n\nLast year we continued to analyse the potential effects of flooding in our UK estate. We ran a pilot covering 27 operational sites, using extra flood risk data and a number of warming scenarios to provide a more extreme view of potential flood impacts from 2030-2050.\n\nThis year we widened our analysis, in line with our future location strategy, to understand possible flood risks from climate change across different RCP scenarios (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, 8.5). We're doing a gap analysis to review the level of protection we already have. This will help us target mitigation and maintenance and plan future defence investments.\n\n## Heat\n\nIn most scenarios from 2030-2050 the UK will see more extreme heat days. But the risk of them damaging our core network sites is low. Cooling system upgrades in our large metronode sites allow them to operate effectively in up to 45\u00b0C external temperatures. We've invested \u00a360m in these upgrades so far. We expect to complete them in FY24 - at a total cost of around \u00a365m.\n\nWe've also finished upgrades in our strategic data centres and invested over \u00a34m last year to upgrade cooling plants at core mobile sites.\n\nTo minimise the effects of global warming, all the cooling plants we install in our exchanges are manufactured and tested to confirm they work properly in extreme ambient temperatures. Since 2015 we've invested more than \u00a3104m on cooling system upgrades for local exchanges, covering the remainder of the estate.\n\nThe new adiabatic units installed in our exchanges cool with fresh air and water evaporation, making us less reliant on refrigerant gases. They work best on the hottest days - well suited to the rising ambient temperatures of different warming scenarios from 2030-2050.\n\n## Extreme weather\n\nOur exposure to this risk will change over time, as rolling out FTTP and closing the PSTN network will mean fewer physical network sites. This will cut our exposure to physical climate change risks but does mean more services going through fewer operational locations.\n\nOur flood and temperature mitigations help cut risks around this smaller operational footprint. On top of that, FTTP services are more 'passive' (with no electronics between exchanges and connected properties), which further cuts the risk of extreme weather damaging our equipment.",

Our sustainability targets and supporting plans aim to reduce the potential impact of transition risks and support the UK's commitment to becoming a net zero economy by 2050.\n\n## Consumer preferences risk\n\nThere are lots of opportunities for customers to reduce their carbon emissions and associated climate change risks by using our products and services. We offer solutions that, for example, reduce the need to travel, cut energy use and reduce material and manufacturing needs.\n\n## Carbon pricing risk\n\nWe track carbon pricing developments and prices in the UK and international voluntary carbon offsets markets to assess our climate risks. The carbon prices we use in our TCFD climate scenario analysis shape our understanding of costs under different transition scenarios and in certain jurisdictions.\n\n## Our targets, metrics and measurement\n\nClimate and net zero are core elements of the BT Group Manifesto. You can find full details on our targets, programmes and performance on pages 36 to 39.\n\n## Cost of capital risk\n\nWe've implemented our net zero strategy and carbon emission reduction targets, showing our commitment to reducing our climate change risk exposure. We're making investments to meet our targets by continuing to purchase renewables, converting the majority of our vehicle fleet to ultra-low emissions vehicles and decarbonising our buildings.\n\n## Energy efficiency opportunity\n\nEnergy savings are part of our strategy to transform our operating model. For example, we've focused on reducing energy consumption, while improving the performance of the cooling systems that protect our network equipment from overheating. We're also moving to fewer, more efficient buildings. And longer term, FTTP migration will reduce the number of exchanges and other network sites we need and cut our network's overall energy consumption.\n\nWe publish a Carbon Reduction Plan ( bt.com/carbonreductionplan ) showing how we're reducing our carbon emissions footprint across all scopes. We're also part of the UK Government's Transition Plan Taskforce Sandbox Initiative to help develop a new climate transition reporting framework.\n\nIn November, our Chief Executive led an ESG business briefing with investors and financial analysts. He gave an update on our Manifesto - covering climate and environmental targets, performance and plans.\n\nOur sustainability and corporate affairs strategy director meets regularly with stakeholders to discuss our carbon targets. This allows shareholders, customers and colleagues to review our approach and progress.\n\n## Reputation opportunity\n\nAs well as opportunities from our strategy and targets, action on climate change is an increasing focus for the group to help differentiate us from our competitors. We were one of the first companies to participate in initiatives like RE100, the CDP supply chain programme, 1.5\u00b0C Supply Chain Leaders and the We Mean Business Coalition.\n\nRecognising that supportive policy environments are critical to both our company and wider society to keep within the 1.5\u00b0C warming limit, we work with regulators and policymakers to advocate for policies and regulation to create these enabling conditions. We work with peers through associations like GSMA, techUK, Joint Audit Cooperation and the European Green Digital Coalition to build knowledge and expertise on the potential of our sector to help decarbonise other sectors. We work closely with policymakers to inspire others (like small and medium-sized enterprises) to take climate action.\n\nIn FY23, 5% of the annual bonus available to eligible managers was based on our science-based target to cut the carbon emissions intensity of our operations by 87% by FY31.\n\nWe'll keep working on defining metrics around our physical risks and products and services as our modelling and data capabilities evolve and become more mature.",

        "page_content": "## Viability statement\n\nIn accordance with provision 31 of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018, the Directors have assessed the prospects and viability of the group.\n\nThe assessment has been based on the Company's strategy, balance sheet and financing position, including our \u00a32.1bn undrawn committed borrowing facility which matures in March 2027, and the potential impact of 'Our principal risks and uncertainties' (pages 63 to 70).\n\nThe Board has chosen to conduct its review for a period of five years to 31 March 2028. The Board believe that this is an appropriate timeframe as it aligns with the primary focus of our business and financial planning.\n\nThe assessment of viability is based on our medium term plan which forecasts the group's profitability, cash flows and funding requirements, and is approved by the Board at the end of each year. The medium term plan is built from bottom-up forecasts of each of our CFUs based on some central macroeconomic assumptions such as inflation and exchange rates. This is then supplemented by items managed at a group level. The macroeconomic assumptions are informed by independent third party forecasts. The performance of the group and our CFUs against these forecasts is monitored monthly and this is supplemented each quarter through a series of quarterly business reviews of each unit conducted by the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer.\n\nBeyond our medium term plan horizon, the group also makes investments that have business cases covering a longer time period, such as our network investments. Significant capital expenditure investment cases are approved by the Chief Executive and, where appropriate, the Board, after taking into account longer-term risks and opportunities such as the economy, technology and regulation.\n\n## Approach\n\nOur medium term plan has been stress tested in a series of individual severe but plausible downside scenarios, each aligned to our group risk categories as set out on pages 63 to 70. This was followed by stress testing our forecasts against a combined scenario of correlated risks using a stochastic model. Finally, we then identified several mitigations that could realistically be taken by the business to avoid or reduce the impact of the underlying risk.\n\n## Scenarios included in our combined severe but plausible stress test\n\nOur hypothetical combined downside scenario is based on the geopolitical tensions between the West and Russia and China intensifying. The combined effect on energy security for Europe and supply\n\nchain disruption drives up inflation, creating a prolonged recession and intensifying the cost of living crisis and increased cyber risk.\n\nThe individual scenarios selected for inclusion in the combined scenario were chosen based on their correlation and the current headwinds BT Group and the industry is facing.\n\n| Scenario                                          | Risk category                             | Scenario modelled                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| China supply  chain disruption                    | Supplier  management                      | Geopolitical uncertainty widens, with wholesale  impact on the China supply chain.

        "page_content": "## Viability statement continued\n\nWe have considered directly relevant mitigations that we would employ if these events occurred and included those impacts in our calculations.\n\nA summation of the full impact of each of the individual scenarios in this stress test would be an extremely unlikely outcome, therefore we use a stochastic model to develop a more realistic combined scenario. We applied an 80th percentile confidence interval which allows for a stress test of the medium term plan with a plausible but still severe combination of events, without assuming the worst impact happens across all scenarios at the same time.\n\nWe have reduced the confidence interval from the 95th percentile applied last year, which was considered to exaggerate the severity of the combined exposure to an implausible degree, largely driven by the increase in the scenarios included within the combined scenarios compared to last year. However, had we used the more severe 95th percentile the group would still be viable.\n\n## Result\n\nApplying our severe but plausible combined scenario, and assuming repayment of debt as it falls due, indicates that if BT Group took no mitigating actions, including debt refinancing, it would experience a liquidity shortage commencing in the third year. Our mitigations, including cutting expenditures, reducing dividends and refinancing debt, could be applied to eliminate this liquidity shortage. We would only need to adopt around half of the available mitigations to maintain positive cash flow over the full five year period of the assessment.\n\nThe mitigations directly in our control primarily revolve around reducing cash outflow from the group. In addition, there are also several mitigations which are outside of our control like raising debt. The Board believe that it is reasonable to expect that it could continue to access debt capital markets to refinance a portion of our outstanding debt as it falls due, or to renew our undrawn committed facility (which expires in March 2027, before the end of the viability period). If access to debt markets wasn't available, then equity capital markets would be considered as an alternative to raise funds.\n\nBased on the results of this analysis, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the five year period of their assessment.",

        "page_content": "## Chairman's governance letter\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCorporate Governance has always been given prominence across the BT Group. Promoting fairness, openness and transparency in its responsibilities to stakeholders and generating long-term, sustainable success has been, and will continue to be, the Board's primary objective.\n\nThe governance section of this Annual Report sets out our approach to facilitate effective governance and how it supports our strategy, and the decisions we have made, whilst considering the interests of our stakeholders and our contribution to society.\n\n## Simplification\n\nBT Group is a complex group of businesses that operate in many different markets, and they are all on simplification journeys. In order to ensure that those journeys are smooth, we've sought to explore all avenues to simplify the way the group is governed and operated. That applies in the business units themselves but also with the way the Board and committees oversee and input into those activities.\n\nDuring the year, we reviewed various aspects of the Board and committees' processes, including looking at the constitution, frequency and responsibilities of the committees. As a result, we've made a few changes in pursuance of efficiency and we've made important changes to refresh the responsibilities of the committees. In particular, the Board agreed to increase the responsibilities of the Digital Impact & Sustainability Committee to cover the full breadth of initiatives that are discussed and reported in our Manifesto. For example, that means bringing into the scope of that Committee issues such as modern slavery in the supply chain. To recognise this change we've decided to move to a simpler, more holistic Committee name: the Responsible Business Committee .\n\nAs discussed elsewhere in the Annual Report (including in our section 172 statement on page 94), we also took the decision to combine our Enterprise and Global units into a single B2B unit, Business. A key advantage of the combined business will be to enable simpler and more efficient governance and consistent decision-making processes, increasing the agility of the business and removing the potential for different approaches across two separate B2B units.\n\n## Board changes\n\nAt the conclusion of the 2023 AGM, Iain Conn will be stepping down after serving on the Board for nine years, and Ian Cheshire will be stepping down from the Board following an increase in other non-executive responsibilities. Iain and Ian have been distinguished members of the Board and the committees they serve. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank both for their wisdom and the valuable contributions they made to the Board.\n\nWe have and will continue to ensure that our governance processes and capabilities support and complement the changes across the wider group, focusing on simplified and efficient delivery of oversight and decision making that leverages a truly diverse set of skills and viewpoints.\n\nIn the comprehensive review of the Board's composition we undertook last year, we recognised that we needed to enhance the Board's technology and digital capabilities given the group's focus on digital and legacy platform transformation. We also recognised that we'd cease to enjoy the benefit of Iain and Ian's skills following the 2023 AGM. We therefore focused the search for individuals with digital and technology capabilities, transformation experience, those who have had a focus on managing cultural and people agendas, infrastructure and industrials expertise and familiarity with UK corporate governance and market dynamics. This led to us appointing Steven Guggenheimer and Maggie Chan Jones on 1 October 2022 and 1 March 2023 respectively, and Ruth Cairnie on 6 April 2023. From the conclusion of the 2023 AGM, Ruth will succeed Iain as the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director and Ian as Chair of the Remuneration Committee .\n\n## Diversity and inclusion\n\nWe continue to commit to the development of a diverse and inclusive organisation. Our aim is for our workforce to be truly representative of all sections of society, and against discrimination of our customers or the public. We're making good progress in our ethnic minority representation, with notable gains against the diversity targets set in our Manifesto launched in 2021. We continue to encourage inclusivity inside and outside our business. This year, we launched 'Hope United - Not Her Problem' to challenge sexism in the workplace. To support our development of a more inclusive digital landscape to drive productivity, innovation and growth for our business and for the UK, a new and rich ecosystem of partners was created to help us expand our reach into the community to create awareness, invest in and open up opportunities for the talent pool for the future.\n\nThe Board's diversity targets are set out in our Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy. As at 31 March 2023, our Board comprised 33% female directors, two directors from an ethnic minority background, and one who has a disability. The Board is cognisant that the female membership of the Board is currently below our Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy of 40%. However, taking into consideration the changes at the 2023 AGM, the percentage of female membership on the Board will stand at 45%.\n\nThese new appointments were carefully selected to complement the existing skills on the Board, and means we have the right diversity of viewpoints, skills and experience to support our continued transformation and strategic journey.\n\n## Adam Crozier\n\nChairman\n\n17 May 2023",

It determines the group's risk appetite, ensures that we have robust systems of risk management and internal controls in place, and is responsible for ensuring that the group has an effective leadership team in place to efficiently execute the group's strategy.\n\nA number of key decisions and matters are reserved to the Board and are not delegated to any of the committees, the Chief Executive or management. These are set out in the matters reserved to the Board and are available on our website:\n\n## bt.com/governance\n\n## Meetings and attendance\n\nWe held eight scheduled Board meetings and one strategy meeting in FY23. The Chairman also held private sessions with the Non-Executive Directors during the year. The Company Secretary is Secretary to the Board, and she, or her nominated delegate, attends all meetings and provides advice, guidance and support as required.\n\nBoard and committee members are provided with papers in advance of each meeting on a secure electronic portal. Directors are expected to attend Board and relevant committee meetings of which they are a member, unless prevented by prior commitments, illness or a conflict of interest. If a director is unable to attend a meeting, they usually give their comments to the Chairman or the Committee Chair in advance so that these can be considered as part of the discussion at the meeting.\n\nBoard meetings were held in person in our head office in London to allow us to maintain constructive levels of engagement and discussion, to challenge management and have robust debates as part of decision making. Video conference was available for invited attendees who were unable to join the Board in person. Pre-Board meeting dinners were held for the Board as part of informal interactions.\n\n|                         | Meetings attended   |\n|-------------------------|---------------------|\n| Adam Crozier (Chairman) | 8 /8                |\n| Philip Jansen           | 8 /8                |\n| Simon Lowth             | 8 /8                |\n| Adel Al-Saleh           | 8/ 8                |\n| Maggie Chan Jones a,b   | 0 /0                |\n| Ian Cheshire            | 8 /8                |\n| Iain Conn               | 8 /8                |\n| Steven Guggenheimer c,d | 2 /3                |\n| Isabel Hudson           | 8 /8                |\n| Matthew Key             | 8 /8                |\n| Allison Kirkby e        | 7 /8                |\n| Leena Nair f,g          | 2 /3                |\n| Sara Weller             | 8 /8                |\n\n- a Maggie joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director on 1 March 2023.\n- b No scheduled Board meeting was held in March 2023.\n- c Steven joined the Board as a Non-Executive Director on 1 October 2022.\n- d Steven gave apologies for one meeting during the year due to other business commitments.\n- e Allison gave apologies for one meeting during the year due to other business commitments.\n- f Leena gave apologies for one meeting during the year due to other business commitments.\n- g Leena stepped down from the Board at the conclusion of the AGM on 14 July 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Section 172 statement and stakeholders\n\nThe Board focus in FY23 section sets out on the following pages includes our Section 172 statement on pages 94 to 95.\n\nOur Section 172 statement demonstrates our directors' regard to the matters in section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 (2006 Act) in performing their duties.\n\nSee the Strategic report on pages 40 to 45 for additional details of how we engage with our key stakeholders.\n\nThe Board and each of its committees always have regard to wider stakeholder interests including and beyond those of our shareholders as part of discussions and decision making. On behalf of the Board, the Audit & Risk Committee discussed our key stakeholder groups including their expectations, our engagement and the risks associated with managing these relationships as part of reviewing the stakeholder management group risk category (GRC). The Committee considered engagement with our key stakeholder groups in light of broader developments in the emerging risk landscape and new technologies.\n\nFor details of how our directors have engaged with our colleagues during the year, and how they have had regard to their interests and the need to foster business relationships with suppliers, customers and others, together with a summary including the Board's principal decisions, see pages 40 to 45 and 92 to 95.",

With diverse colleague experiences and priorities across our units, the Board feels that this continues to be the most effective option for the BT Group. Its aim is to bring colleagues from across the group closer to the decision-making process. It achieves this by providing the Board with invaluable, direct insight into colleague sentiment and feedback on key initiatives, programmes and communications, and helps shape better outcomes.\n\nThe Colleague Board is chaired by the Chief Executive, and Isabel Hudson, our Designated Non-Executive Director for workforce engagement, is a member. Isabel was selected for this role due to her breadth of understanding of, and interest in, employee and wider stakeholder matters.\n\nSabine Chalmers, General Counsel, Director of Regulatory Affairs & Company Secretary, and Athalie Williams, Chief Human Resources Officer, are also invited and attend all formal meetings. Other members of the Executive Committee attend meetings on a rotating basis. The Deputy Company Secretary is secretary to the Colleague Board and he or his delegate attends all meetings and provides support, guidance and advice as required. The Chairman and other Non-Executive Directors are also able to attend meetings as observers.\n\nThe last year has been a challenging year for all our colleagues in the business and the Colleague Board has continued to contribute to the Board's thinking with probing questions around progress in the business and a series of 'hot topics' brought to each Colleague Board, representing issues raised with them from throughout the business. In a year of strikes and high inflation, affecting both our customers and everyone who works for BT Group, and with the strong desire to progress with our diversity and inclusion agenda, the Colleague Board members have made thoughtful contributions and helped us to look at things from different angles.\n\nIsabel Hudson , Designated Non-Executive Director for workforce engagement and a member of the Colleague Board\n\n## Colleague Board focus in FY23\n\nThe Colleague Board held four formal meetings this year and a number of informal sessions with internal teams. Through both the Board and the senior leadership team, the Colleague Board 's views were sought on pan-BT programmes (including how they align with our values and culture) and how we communicate these with our colleagues. The Colleague Board has continued to successfully contribute to, and shape, some of our key initiatives this year, by sharing their different views and perspectives.\n\nThe Colleague Board has helped the Board to understand the perspectives of our colleagues on a range of different topics, including the progress of our digital transformation and diversity and inclusion initiatives, career development, colleague retention, people framework, working from home arrangements and the communications and support available for colleagues throughout the cost of living crisis.\n\n## Key Colleague Board contributions\n\n| Topic                   | Context                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Cost of living          | Helping the Board to understand the  perspectives of our colleagues throughout  the cost of living crisis by having two-way  discussions and sharing their thoughts to  help refine approaches.                                                         |\n| Colleague  Board squads | Formulated working groups focused on  culture to understand the perspectives of  colleagues over a range of topics in this  area such as diversity and inclusion.                                                                                       |\n| Meetx                   | Launching Meetx, BT Group's equivalent  of TEDx talks.

As individuals, they are well-connected in their units and have found evermore effective ways of gathering unfiltered views from thousands of their colleagues. This insight is invaluable, helping us to shape our approach to important topics such as colleague experience, address concerns and it has also proven a useful challenge to more conventional corporate thinking.\n\nPhilip Jansen , Chief Executive and Chair of the Colleague Board\n\n## Colleague engagement with the Board\n\nAt each formal meeting of the Colleague Board , management and/or the Board (via Isabel Hudson) have the opportunity to discuss topics that they would like the Colleague Board members' perspectives on. The members also share perspectives on Hot Topics raised by the wider colleague base that they believe should be brought to the attention of the Board and/or management. The Colleague Board has raised a variety of topics with management and open discussions are subsequently held on these. Isabel reports back to the Board and its committees, as appropriate, on discussions with the Colleague Board . This has provided the Board with a direct insight into colleague perspectives to help inform its decision making on relevant topics. The meeting materials and notes are made available to the full Board.\n\nWhilst the Colleague Board is the Board's formal chosen workforce engagement method, it is used alongside other colleague engagement mechanisms. For example the Chief Executive also holds quarterly PJ Live events which provide all colleagues with the opportunity to ask the Chief Executive questions on any subject in an informal forum.\n\n- See page 93 for more information on how we engage with colleagues.\n\nI enjoy the teamwork and collaboration that we have as a cohort with the common goal of assisting leadership in making BT Group the best place to work.\n\nJasmine Kaur , Colleague Board member\n\nI am really proud to be a member of the Colleague Board. We represent all business units, with a strong sense of integrity and responsibility. It is inspiring to be able to represent our amazing colleagues to share both positive feedback and concerns so that they feel genuinely heard.\n\nNick Persaud , Colleague Board member\n\n## Colleague Board communications with our colleagues\n\nColleague Board members feed back on the discussions from the formal meetings to the wider workforce, as well as highlighting points at Colleague Board meetings that have been raised by other colleagues. Members are encouraged to connect with other internal engagement channels including the People Networks and by accessing the Your Say engagement survey results to gain an increased understanding of the views of our colleagues on key issues.\n\nEach Colleague Board member is supported by their respective unit internal communications team, enabling a good rapport to be built in-unit. The Director of Internal Communications attends Colleague Board meetings and members are encouraged to give their views on key internal communications.",

        "page_content": "## Section 172 statement\n\nIn their discussions and decisions during FY23, the directors of BT Group plc have acted in the way that they consider, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the group for the benefit of its members as a whole (having regard to stakeholders and the matters set out in sub-sections 172(1) (a)-(f) of the 2006 Act).\n\nThe Board considers the matters set out in section 172 of the 2006 Act in all its discussions and decision making, including:\n\n## The likely consequence of any decision in the long term:\n\nThe directors recognise that the decisions they make today will affect the group's long-term success. During the year, the Board had particular regard to the long-term success of the group in its discussions on group strategy (see page 89). Our purpose and strategy demonstrate how we realise our ambition and grow value for all our stakeholders. This in turn guides the Board's decisions, specifically the balance between short-and longterm investments. The third pillar of our strategy, lead the way to a bright, sustainable future, incorporates our aim to identify and develop new business opportunities that will help us grow sustainably in the future. More information on our strategy can be found on pages 16 to 17.\n\n## The impact of the group's operations on the community and environment:\n\nThe Digital Impact & Sustainability Committee continues to oversee the progress of our Manifesto. This aims to accelerate growth through technology that is responsible, inclusive and sustainable, ensuring the group can continue to build trust and create value for its stakeholders. The Committee also monitors progress on the digital impact and sustainability strategy and oversees the progress of our related goals, including those in respect of climate and the environment. In line with the ambitions we have in this area, the Committee approved the acceleration of BT Group's net zero target for its own operations from 2045 to the end of FY31 and a new net zero target for supply chain and customer emissions to be achieved by the end of FY41.\n\n- For more information on this see page 48. Information as to how we have addressed the recommendations of the TCFD framework can be found on pages 71 to 72.\n\n## The desirability of maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct:\n\nThe Board acknowledges its responsibility for setting and monitoring the culture, values and reputation of the group. Our colleagues are central to us achieving this ambition and we're building a culture where our colleagues can be their best. During the year, the Board considered the group's culture in its decision making and discussions; further details on this can be found on pages 88 to 91.\n\nThe Audit & Risk Committee also considered regular reports from the Ethics and Compliance Director on our ethics and compliance policies and programmes and reports on issues raised through Speak Up, BT Group's confidential, whistleblowing services (see page 104).\n\n## The interests of our colleagues, and the need to foster business relationships with our key stakeholders:\n\nThe Board and its committees understand the strategic importance of stakeholders to our business. When making decisions, the directors have regard to the interests of colleagues, and the need to foster business relationships with other key stakeholders. We acknowledge that not every decision we make will necessarily result in a positive outcome for all our stakeholders, so the Board must balance competing interests in reaching its decisions.\n\nWhile the Board engages directly with stakeholders on some issues, the size and distribution of the BT Group and our stakeholder groups means that stakeholder engagement often happens below Board-level. However, the Board considers information from across the organisation to help it understand how our operations affect our stakeholders' interests and views.\n\n- More details on how we engage with key stakeholders (including customers and suppliers) on pages 40 to 44.\n\nOur colleagues are key to our success, and they are always considered as part of the Board's discussions and decision making. The Board and its committees have reviewed colleague wellbeing, our diversity and inclusion ambitions, organisational culture and the impact of our transformation programme on them, as well as on employee relations (see page 91 for more details). The Board engages with colleagues primarily through the Colleague Board and through our Designated NonExecutive Director for workforce engagement (see pages 92 to 93). In this role, Isabel Hudson provides feedback after each formal Colleague Board meeting and also discusses any topics raised by members at relevant Board and committee meetings.\n\n- Other colleague engagement channels are set out on page 41.\n\n## The need to act fairly as between BT Group's shareholders:\n\nDuring FY23, the Chairman, Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer, other executives and the Investor Relations team held 320 meetings with investors (see page 42 for more detail on our engagement with shareholders). These meetings gave investors the opportunity to discuss views on financial and operational performance, capital investment, in particular, the investment on FTTP, competitive dynamics, pensions, capital allocation policy and environmental, social and governance matters. The Board is mindful of having two significant shareholders but considers any decisions it makes in the interests of all shareholders.",

We undertook an internal evaluation this year. Given an external evaluation was last completed in FY21, we will carry out an external evaluation in FY24 to fulfil our obligation that an external evaluation be carried out every three years.\n\n## Process\n\nTailored questionnaires were circulated to members and attendees of the Board and each of its committees. The evaluations focused on composition, succession and how well-placed the Board is to add value to the business, in terms of how it oversees strategy, risk management, people, culture and performance. Focus was also given to the Board's decision-making processes, as well as how well it considers stakeholders as part of its decision making and discussions. The Senior Independent Director undertook a discussion with the full Board (without the Chairman) and the Company Secretary on their views of the Chairman's performance. The outcomes and recommendations were fed back to the Chairman. The Non-Executive Directors also reviewed the performance of the Chief Executive during the year.\n\n## Agreed areas of focus and actions\n\nOverall, the Board and its committees are considered to be effective. There were certain areas of focus which the Board felt would continue to improve its performance and effectiveness.

The programme includes meetings with the Chairman, the Chief Executive, other members of the Board and the Company Secretary, as well as members of the Executive Committee and senior management. Directors also receive key information on our strategy and KPIs, governance framework, the regulatory framework in which we operate, recent financial performance, risk management and internal control systems and the policies supporting our business practices.\n\nDirectors are encouraged to visit our different offices, contact centres and BT/EE retail shops, as well as spending a day with an Openreach engineer. Set out opposite is the induction programme undertaken by Steven Guggenheimer, who joined the Board in October 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMaggie Chan Jones Independent Non-Executive Director\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nRuth Cairnie Independent Non-Executive Director\n\nMaggie Chan Jones and Ruth Cairnie, who joined the Board on 1 March 2023 and 6 April 2023 respectively, are currently going through their induction and their programmes will be reported in the 2024 Annual Report.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Steven's induction programme\n\nThe combination of high-quality reading materials and tailored meetings with colleagues provided me with the information necessary to be able to engage in a meaningful way right from the start of my Board tenure.\n\nSteven Guggenheimer\n\nIndependent Non-Executive Director\n\nSteven joined the Board on 1 October 2022 as an Independent Non-Executive Director, and as a member of the Nominations and the Digital Impact & Sustainability Committees .

The Deputy Company Secretary is secretary to the Committee and he, or his delegate, attends all meetings and provides guidance, advice and support as required.\n\nCommittee members and attendees do not attend discussions where a conflict exists. During the year, five scheduled Committee meetings were held.

Given the tenure of longer-serving directors and Leena Nair stepping down from the Board on 14 July 2022, the Committee was also planning to address future anticipated changes as a result of upcoming director departures. Russell Reynolds Associates, an independent external search consultant, who has no other connection to the BT Group, and a signatory of the Voluntary Code of Conduct for Executive Search Firms, was engaged to assist with the search. The Committee recognised that, given the group's continued focus on digital and legacy platform transformation, at least one director should have digital and technology capabilities and transformation expertise. As in all searches, diversity was a key consideration. Russell Reynolds was tasked with enabling us to make appointments that meet the aims and targets of our Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy and related targets and succession planning. In line with that brief, Russell Reynolds prepared a longlist of candidates which comprised a diverse range of candidates, including female candidates and those from ethnic minority backgrounds.\n\nThe Committee agreed a shortlist of candidates who were formally approached by Russell Reynolds for consideration for the role and assessment. Further to a comprehensive assessment and interview process which included meetings with the Non-Executive Directors, feedback was discussed by the Committee at each stage to shortlist candidates based on the criteria and brief.\n\nThe Committee identified Steven Guggenheimer, an accomplished technology executive, with a strong track record of advising businesses on digital transformation and extensive insight into technologies ranging from artificial intelligence to cloud computing, as a preferred candidate to complement and enhance the Board's technology and digital capabilities. The Committee was confident that Steven's significant experience of digital transformation, AI and cloud computing, would bring an invaluable perspective to the Board. Following the Committee's recommendation, Steven joined the Board and the Nominations and Digital Impact & Sustainability Committee s on 1 October 2022.\n\nAs part of the succession planning, the Committee continued with the search for two further Non-Executive Directors. Maggie Chan Jones, with a wealth of experience following a highly successful career in marketing at several of the world's largest technology companies, including Microsoft and SAP, joined the Board and the Nominations and Digital Impact & Sustainability Committee s on 1 March 2023 following the Committee's recommendation.\n\nThe Committee further recommended the appointment of Ruth Cairnie, who holds extensive experience gained from a broad range of executive and non-executive roles at leading UK and international industrial companies, including Royal Dutch Shell. Ruth joined the Board and the Audit & Risk, Nominations and",

        "page_content": "Remuneration Committee s on 6 April 2023. Ruth will succeed Iain Conn, who will be stepping down at the conclusion of the 2023 AGM, after serving on the Board for nine years as Senior Independent Director, and Ian Cheshire, who has decided to step down at the conclusion of the 2023 AGM following an increase in non-executive responsibilities as Chair of Land Securities Group, as Remuneration Committee Chair.\n\nThe Committee is confident that Maggie and Ruth will add a significant breadth of experience and diversity of expertise and thought to the Board, and both will be key in supporting BT Group's broad agenda of strategic priorities.\n\n## Time commitment\n\nOn accepting their appointment, directors must confirm they are able to allocate sufficient time to discharge their responsibilities effectively. Directors are expected to attend meetings of the Board and any committees of which they are members, as well as the AGM and Board offsites. Directors are also expected to devote sufficient time to prepare for each meeting and to participate in other site or office visits to understand the business better. Before accepting new external appointments, directors are required to obtain the prior approval of the Board.\n\nBefore recommending the Board approve the appointments of Steven Guggenheimer, Maggie Chan Jones and Ruth Cairnie as Independent Non-Executive Directors, the Committee considered their other commitments and whether they would be able to allocate sufficient time to their roles. The Committee was comfortable that their other commitments would not be detrimental to their ability to perform their duties as Independent Non-Executive Directors of BT Group.\n\nSara Weller joined the boards of Virgin Money UK, (Virgin Money) and Clydesdale Bank, part of the Virgin Money Group as a Non-Executive Director in October 2022, and Allison Kirkby became an Independent Non-Executive Director of Brookfield Asset Management in February 2023. Ahead of their respective appointments, the Board considered the proposed appointments in line with the time commitment required for BT Group and Sara and Allison's other roles. On balance, the Board felt this would not be detrimental to their ability to perform their duties as an Independent Non-Executive Director of BT Group. The Board also considered the total appointments held by Sara and Allison and was satisfied that they are within the overboarding guidelines published by proxy agencies.\n\n## Election and re-election of directors\n\nThe Committee considered, in respect of each director, their skills and experience, time commitment and tenure as part of its recommendation to the Board in relation to the directors put forward for election and re-election at the AGM. The Board believes that each director it has recommended to shareholders for election or re-election at the 2023 AGM brings considerable knowledge, wide-ranging skills and experience to the Board, makes an effective and valuable contribution and continues to demonstrate commitment to their role.\n\nOn recommendation from the Committee, the Board also considered the continued independence of Non-Executive Directors as part of its consideration of the re-election recommendations. The Board continues to consider all NonExecutive Directors as being independent in line with the Code, with the exception of Deutsche Telekom's nominated representative. The Chairman was judged to be independent at the time of his appointment.\n\n- Details of directors' contracts or letters of appointment are in the Annual remuneration report on page 128.\n\n## Training and development\n\nThe Chairman and the Company Secretary keep the training and development needs of directors under review. Non-Executive Directors meet with management, enhancing their understanding of the business through briefing sessions. We encourage all directors to keep their skills and knowledge up-to-date and to ask for any support they need. As part of ongoing development, the Company Secretary (or her delegate) briefs the Board and its committees at each meeting, as relevant, on any key legal, regulatory and corporate governance developments. During the year, these briefings included updates on the institutional investor guidelines, environmental, social and governance considerations and governance publications. Directors are updated as required on developments in the environment in which the business operates and internal and external advisers are invited to meetings to provide updates as necessary.\n\n## Openreach Limited Board succession\n\nUnder its remit, the Committee has a responsibility to consider changes to the Openreach Limited Board and recommend any changes to the BT Group Board for approval. Following Liz Benison's indication of her intention to step down from the Openreach Limited Board in 2022, a search for her successor was commenced. On the recommendation of the Committee, the BT Group Board approved Natalie Ceeney's appointment and Natalie joined the Openreach Limited Board on 1 May 2022. Liz Benison stepped down on 30 April 2022.\n\n## Executive Committee succession planning and talent\n\n- Throughout the year, the Committee has kept under review: -  the performance and succession planning of Executive Committee members. In particular, the Committee discussed with the Chief Executive potential successor candidates to the HR Director. Given the transformation and people agenda, and the group's key priorities, the Committee considered the impact of the different options on the organisation and its stakeholders, and which candidate would best support this. After an extensive search and a comprehensive assessment, the Committee approved the appointment of Athalie Williams as the permanent Chief Human Resources Officer from 1 December 2022. The Committee continues to focus on broader Executive Committee succession planning, including oversight of the talent pipeline with a focus on diversity\n- -  key talent at senior leadership level. The Committee reflected on the importance of identifying critical roles and building stronger and broader diversity of experience, gender and ethnicity, as well as commercial, technology and transformation capabilities, both through potential external candidates and through our internal talent pipeline\n- -  the external appointments of Executive Committee members, in line with our policy on external interests for Executive Committee members (including Executive Directors) and the CEO, Openreach. Under this policy, proposed external directorships and other significant external interests must not be to an organisation that is a BT Group competitor/major supplier to BT Group, create a conflict of interest for the individual with their role at BT Group, involve significant amounts of BT Group working hours or impede the ability of the individual to perform their BT Group role, or involve disproportionate incentives or remuneration, with reference to the time commitment of the role. Any fees or other incentives arising from such appointments may be retained by the individual, subject to the amount being proportionate.",

Following the recent publications and the changes to the Listing Rules, we have reviewed and updated this policy during FY23. The policy ensures we:\n\n- -  apply an inclusion lens to all our decision-making processes\n- -  monitor the impact of our decisions on diverse populations\n- -  value and communicate the benefits that difference brings and are unapologetic in our pursuit of a diverse workforce at all levels\n- -  actively seek out opportunities across the business to enhance and strengthen our approach to inclusion.\n\nWhilst we appoint candidates based on merit, we continue to challenge our external search consultants to ensure that all forms of diversity, in particular ethnicity and gender, are considered when drawing up candidate lists. This is a key consideration for our searches.\n\nDiversity is considered in the broadest sense and all forms of difference are considered, including age, gender, nationality, independence, professional background, social and ethnic\n\n## Chairman and Non-Executive Directors' tenure As at 31 March 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Diversity and ethnicity\n\n|                                                                  | Number of   Board members   | Percentage   of the Board   | Number of senior   positions on the Board,   CEO, CFO, SID and Chair   | Number   in executive   management   | Percentage   of executive   management   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Diversity                                                        |                             |                             |                                                                        |                                      |                                          |\n| Male   at 31 March 2023                                          |                             | 66.7%                       |                                                                        |                                      | 70%                                      |\n| Female   at 31 March 2023                                        |                             | 33.3%                       |                                                                        |                                      | 30%                                      |\n| Male   Post 2023 AGM                                             |                             | 54.6%                       |                                                                        | n/a                                  | n/a                                      |\n| Female   Post 2023 AGM                                           |                             | 45.4%                       |                                                                        | n/a                                  | n/a                                      |\n| Ethnicity  (at 31 March 2023)                                    |                             |                             |                                                                        |                                      |                                          |\n| White British   or other White (including minority-white groups) | 10                          | 83%                         | 4                                                                      | 8                                    | 80%                                      |\n| Mixed/Multiple   Ethnic Groups                                   | 1                           | 8.5%                        |                                                                        | 1                                    | 10%                                      |\n| Asian/Asian British                                              | 1                           | 8.5%                        |                                                                        | 1                                    | 10%                                      |\n| Black/African/  Caribbean/ Black British                         |                             | 0                           |                                                                        |                                      | 0                                        |\n| Other ethnic group,   including Arab                             |                             | 0                           |                                                                        |                                      | 0                                        |\n\nbackgrounds, business and geographic experience, as well as cognitive and personal strengths. These are considered in reviewing the composition of the Board and, where possible, are appropriately balanced. We believe a key driver in delivering our diversity commitments across the organisation is through a Board which has this balance of skills, experience, diversity and knowledge.\n\nAs at 31 March 2023, four of our 12 Board directors were female (33%) and two directors were from an ethnic minority background (17%), and in addition, one director has a disability. Furthermore, with the appointment of Ruth Cairnie on 6 April 2023, and taking into account the changes to the Board at the 2023 AGM, this will bring the female membership of the Board to 45% and therefore within the targets of the Board Diversity and Inclusion Policy of 40%. Ruth's appointment as Senior Independent Director will ensure that we meet the requirements of the Listing Rules to have female representation in at least one of the four senior board positions.\n\n- Details of our diversity and inclusion strategy, including its objectives, implementation and progress can be found on page 33.\n\n## Post 2023 AGM",

As Committee Chair, I met with the KPMG lead audit partner, the internal auditor and management as appropriate ahead of meetings to discuss specific items of focus to report to the Committee. After each meeting, I also reported back to the Board on the Committee's activities, the main issues discussed and matters of particular relevance, with the Board receiving copies of the Committee's meeting papers and minutes.\n\n## Financial reporting\n\nDuring the year, the Committee considered the full year and half year results, and the Q1 and Q3 trading updates. It reviewed the quality of accounting policies and practices, as well as critical accounting estimates and judgements.\n\nThe Committee considered, and was satisfied with:\n\n- -  the processes supporting the preparation and consolidation of the financial statements , including consistent application of the accounting policies, and the ongoing verification by management and the external auditor\n- -  management's accounting judgements and the appropriate application of the accounting policies, having also discussed these with the external auditor.\n- More information on BT Group's significant accounting policies is set out on page 157\n\nThe Committee exercised its judgement when considering matters related to the financial statements , and recommended approval by the Board of each of our full year and half year results, Q1 and Q3 trading updates and the Annual Report.",

In its assessment, it\n\nconsidered that the following had been carried out and this formed the basis of its recommendation to the Board:\n\n- -  a verification process covering the factual content reviewed by the internal audit team\n- -  comprehensive reviews by different levels of management, including the Executive Committee , to consider the messaging and ensure consistency and overall balance.",

        "page_content": "## Significant matters related to the financial statements and how these were addressed\n\n## Group accounting policies, critical and key accounting estimates and significant judgements\n\nThe Committee considered the accounting policies and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements regarding critical and key accounting estimates and significant judgements as summarised in note 2 of the consolidated financial statements . These relate to the valuation of our pensions assets and liabilities, taxation, contingent liabilities associated with litigation, provisions, our goodwill impairment model, determination of lease terms including reasonable certainty, and judgements and estimates associated with our BT Sport joint venture. More detail on the Committee's oversight of these matters is set out below where appropriate.\n\n## Going concern assessment\n\nThe Committee considered management's forecasts of group cash flows and net debt, as well as the group's liquidity requirements and borrowing facilities, including downside scenarios from the viability model as discussed below. Following this review and a discussion of the sensitivities, it confirmed that the going concern basis of accounting continues to be an appropriate basis of preparation for the financial statements and recommended it for approval by the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## See page 132\n\n## Viability statement\n\nThe Committee reviewed the process and assessment of the group's prospects, taking into account the group's current position and principal risks. The Committee also considered the group risks in management's stress testing model, including the review of downside scenarios and a combined 'severe but plausible' scenario where multiple inter-connected risks materialise. The Committee was satisfied that the viability statement could be provided and the approach to its development, and recommended it for approval by the Board.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## See pages 81 to 82\n\n## BT Sport joint venture\n\nThe Committee reviewed the judgements and estimates made in relation to the formation of the new sports joint venture with Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. including the assessment of joint control, the valuation of contingent consideration, the valuation of the minimum revenue guarantee in BT Group's distribution agreement with the joint venture, the valuation of BT Group's equity interest in the JV and the discounting of applicable cash flows. The Committee was satisfied with the judgements made.\n\n## Pensions\n\nThe Committee considered the assumptions underlying the valuation of the pension assets and liabilities in the financial statements, as summarised in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements , the sensitivities around the assumptions and the impact of the assumptions on the balance sheet, income statement and related disclosures.\n\n## Finance transformation\n\nThroughout the year, the Committee was regularly updated on our finance transformation programme, including the implementation of a new central finance system and group accounting book of record at the start of the financial year and the preparation for the second phase of the programme to replace the UK sub ledgers and fixed asset register at the start of the next financial year. The Committee considered in particular the impact on published financial information and the group's control environment.\n\n## Goodwill impairment\n\nThe Committee received and discussed the key assumptions, including operating cash flow forecasts, resulting headroom and the sensitivity analysis performed by management. The Committee considered and was satisfied with the key assumptions and agreed that no goodwill impairment charges were required for FY23.\n\n## Divestments\n\nThe Committee reviewed the judgements made in relation to the group's divestments, including on whether the held for sale criteria had been satisfied, and how goodwill should be allocated to divested or held for sale entities.\n\n## Regulatory finance reporting\n\nThe Committee supported the processes and systems enhancements that were implemented to ensure that the group met its 2022 regulatory financial reporting obligations.\n\n## Other matters\n\nThe Committee reviewed specific items quarterly, and considered and agreed that they were appropriately categorised. It considered management's view of the quality of earnings and of the effective tax rate. It also challenged the phasing of working capital within normalised free cash flow. At each quarter, it considered a detailed assessment of provisions, and the Committee was satisfied with the analysis provided in relation to the results.\n\n## Risk management and internal controls systems\n\nThe group has continued to enhance and further embed its framework of risk management, controls and assurance for dealing with its landscape of risks.\n\nThis framework provides the tools to enable us to be smart with risk and improve operational and ethical discipline. The risk management processes identify and monitor the risks facing the group and the risk landscape is divided into areas of enduring risk called Group Risks Categories (GRC), which cover strategic, financial, operational and compliance risks.\n\n- Further information on our risk management framework and principal risks can be found on pages 61 to 64.\n\nThe Board monitored the effectiveness of the group's systems of risk management and internal controls through detailed reviews of the GRCs and consideration of reports from management, as well as from internal audit and other assurance functions. Much of this work was undertaken by this Committee on the Board's behalf. Given that the Board is ultimately responsible for the group's systems of risk management and internal controls, as Chair, I subsequently reported the key matters from each of these sessions to the Board.\n\nThe activities listed overleaf, carried out during the year, collectively enable the Committee to confirm that the group's systems of risk management and internal control have been appropriately reviewed. Where required, targeted improvements have been agreed to continue to transform our control and systems environment. As part of its drive for continuous improvement, the Committee has overseen ongoing enhancements to the risk management framework. These included the development by management of a simplified suite of corporate policies and a group-wide key control framework to ensure all enduring risks are managed consistently and efficiently across the group, with clear accountabilities and enabling targeted assurance activities. Further information on improvements being made to the overall risk management framework, as well as specific actions taken to manage our principal risks can be found on pages 61 to 62.",

        "page_content": "## Audit, risk and internal control continued\n\nAudit & Risk Committee Chair's report continued\n\n## Activities carried out during the year:\n\nThe Committee held discussions on the GRCs with the Executive Committee risk owners to understand current and anticipated risk developments, and reviewed how effectively the risks are being managed. It considered the risk appetite and its supporting metrics for the GRCs, the effectiveness of the controls, mitigation activities and any areas for improvement. The Committee robustly assessed both current, specific concerns (point risks) and uncertainties that may materialise in the future (emerging risks), particularly as a consequence of adverse changes to the economic, social, regulatory, political or technology environment, or as an unintended consequence of new products and services being offered or developed by the group. The Committee agreed with management any actions required to manage or mitigate these risks effectively.\n\nGiven the legal and security risks associated with the data we manage, the importance to our colleagues, customers and the group's ambition, as well as the ever-increasing regulatory scrutiny in this space, the Committee has received a number of updates on the management of this GRC, and monitored progress against any agreed enhancements. In addition, the Committee continues to monitor the cyber security GRC closely and has received the outcomes of an independent external cyber security review.\n\nAs well as the rolling programme of reviewing the GRCs (during the year this included the Financial Services, Major Customer Contracts, Supply Management, Legal Compliance and Communications Regulation GRCs), the Committee received updates on specific matters including the progress on FCA permissions and next steps given the importance of this for product rollout and projected revenues; financial market turbulence during Autumn 2022 and impacts on the BT pensions schemes; and power resilience and potential energy shortages or rationing.\n\nThe Committee considered management's approach to managing emerging risks within the risk management framework and in each of the GRCs and units. Management also brings together representatives from across the Group in its emerging risk hubs to consider the emerging risk profile and landscape and to share intelligence and agree actions. The Committee reviews the outcomes of all of these management activities on a six-monthly basis.\n\nIn addition, with the CFU CEOs, the Committee undertakes unit risk reviews, which cover how the GRCs are being managed in the respective units, and the significant point and emerging risks. During the year, these included reviews of the Global, Consumer and Openreach units.\n\nAs part of the reviews of the GRCs, CFUs and other matters, where relevant, the impacts of sustained higher rates of inflation and wider costs of living matters on BT Group colleagues, customers and suppliers have been considered.\n\nThe Committee also monitored the outcome of the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS) consultation paper and how this may impact our current controls development strategy.\n\n## Ethics and compliance\n\nThe Committee considered regular reports on our ethics and compliance policies, and programmes and related learnings and culture. It spent time discussing the enhancement programme in relation to international trade, anti-bribery and corruption, as well as communications regulation compliance in line with the respective GRC.\n\nEach quarter, the Committee received and reviewed reports on issues raised through Speak Up, BT Group's confidential, whistleblowing services operated by an independent company, 24 hours a day, in multiple languages, for both written and telephone reports. The Committee ensures that arrangements are in place for the proportionate and independent investigation of these and other matters via the ethics and compliance team. The procedures\n\nfor Speak Up are reviewed annually with input from the specialists in Speak Up, HR and Legal, to ensure best practice is maintained and that procedures remain compliant. On receipt, any whistleblowing reports are triaged by specialist resource, assigned a priority and, where appropriate, are directed to an investigator from security, HR or Legal with appropriate assistance from subject matter experts and/or independent line management. On completion of any investigation, the Speak Up team ensures the investigation has been thorough and fair. High priority cases are reviewed by a multidisciplinary panel for completeness before closure. The Committee discussed any themes identified across the cases received, the outcomes of these cases and the overall rates of substantiation.\n\n## Internal audit\n\nInternal audit provides independent, objective and timely assurance to senior management and the Board, through this Committee, over the design and operational effectiveness of key processes and controls that manage the risks across the organisation.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee:\n\n- -  reviewed and approved the group internal audit annual plan, ensuring it aligned to the principal risks of the business\n- -  reviewed and, taking into account the current needs of the group, approved the internal audit charter, which establishes internal audit's independence, authority, remit and reporting lines to conduct its work\n- -  received regular reports from internal audit on its activities and progress against the group internal audit plan, allowing the Committee to monitor delivery against the plan\n- -  held in-depth discussions with management on all internal audit reports where controls were assessed as 'inadequate', and action plans to address these. The actions were tracked by the Committee, including the responsiveness of management to the findings and recommendations, and the progress of closing any overdue actions.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee carried out its annual assessment of the performance and effectiveness of internal audit, including whether the activities, structure, expertise, objectivity and quality of the function were appropriate for the business. The Committee concluded that internal audit continues to add value in the context of the group's overall assurance framework. An external effectiveness review of internal audit was previously conducted in FY19 by the Chartered Institute of Internal Auditors in accordance with our five-year cycle of such reviews.\n\n## External audit\n\nThe Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Board on the reappointment of the external auditor, determining their independence from the group and its management and agreeing the scope and fee for the audit. The Committee concluded that the reappointment of KPMG should be recommended to shareholders at the 2023 AGM.\n\nFollowing the audit tender in FY17, KPMG was appointed as BT Group's external auditor from the conclusion of the 2018 AGM. The FY23 audit is KPMG's fifth audit of BT Group. John Luke was appointed as the KPMG lead audit partner for the BT Group in FY21, having been the audit partner for Openreach Limited since FY19. Recognising the rotational requirements for the lead audit partner and taking into account both his tenure at Openreach and BT Group, FY23 will be John Luke's final year as lead audit partner. The Committee Chair has discussed John Luke's succession with the Chief Executive of KPMG in the UK, and following a thorough review of potential candidates put forward by KPMG to succeed John, the Committee approved the appointment of Jon Mills to replace John Luke as the lead audit partner for the FY24 audit.\n\nDuring the year, the Committee:\n\n- -  considered and approved the proposed external audit fees for the year ended 31 March 2023, including one-off fees, as well as",

The Committee discussed the findings and the applicability to the BT Group and are discussing this further with KPMG\n- -  reviewed a joint plan by KPMG and management which addressed debrief points from last years audit to ensure improvements were made on both sides for this year.\n\nAs part of my year-end report to the Board, I informed the Board of the outcome of the external audit.\n\nBT Group confirms that it complies with the EU Regulation on Audit Reform and the Competition and Markets Authority's Statutory Audit Services Order with regard to mandatory auditor rotation and tendering.\n\n## Independence and non-audit services\n\nThe Committee discussed the external auditor's independence and potential areas that could give rise to a conflict of interest, and considered the safeguards in place to prevent compromising their independence and objectivity. BT Group's non-audit services policy sets out the non-audit services that can be provided by the external auditor, in line with the latest ethical standards. The external auditor is not permitted to perform any work which they may later be required to audit, or which might affect their objectivity and independence, or create a conflict of interest. Internal procedures describe the approval process for work performed by the external auditor, and these applied to KPMG throughout the year. The Committee monitored compliance with the policies and procedures and considered business relationships with the external auditor, and the level and appropriateness of non-audit services and fees. The Committee will continue to keep under review BT Group's non-audit services policy.\n\nOur non-audit services policy can\n\nbe found at bt.com/governance\n\nThe Committee reviewed the confirmation and information received from the external auditor on the arrangements that it has in place to safeguard auditor independence and objectivity, which are consistent with the ethical standards published by the FRC, including specific safeguards where they provide permissible non-audit services to the group. The nature of the non-audit services carried out by the external auditor during the year are described in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements on page 166. These were carried out due to either legal or regulatory obligations, contractual requirements, or represented areas of assurance work where it was materially more efficient for the external auditor to be engaged, as opposed to another third party due to the work completed in relation to the audit, and which were permitted to be performed by an auditor under the Revised Ethical Standard 2019. The Board assessed any potential threats to independence that were selfidentified and reported by KPMG, all of which were regarded by the Committee as being adequately addressed. Audit-related assurance services, including the audit of the regulatory financial statements, as well as any approved non-audit services performed by KPMG, are considered a low threat to auditor independence. The largest nonaudit service included providing comfort letters for bond issuances. This work fell within the scope of limited permissible services, which are closely related to existing audit work that KPMG provide. The proportion of 'other non-audit services' to 'total services' carried out by the external auditor is therefore considered the most suitable measure of the non-audit services provided. These represented 0.2% of the total fees (FY22: 0.6%).\n\n## External auditor effectiveness and quality\n\n## Scope\n\nThe Committee assesses the effectiveness of the external audit process and the qualifications, expertise, resources, independence and objectivity of the external auditor, including the nature and extent of non-audit services throughout the year, focusing on:\n\n- -  the quality of the audit and the financial reporting process, including how effective the external auditor is at identifying and addressing matters that could compromise the quality of BT Group's reporting\n- -  the service of the external auditor and the relationships with the Committee, key members of management and the internal auditor\n- -  whether the external auditor has demonstrated professional scepticism\n- -  whether the external auditor has challenged management's assumptions where necessary.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Review process\n\nThe Committee reviewed the audit scope and plan at the start of the year and received regular audit reports from the external auditor. This enabled the Committee to assess the quality of audit work. The Committee had the opportunity to interact with the external auditor at meetings as well as to observe the communication and interactions between the external auditor with management and the internal auditor. The Committee reviewed and monitored management's responsiveness to the external auditor's requests for information, and its findings and recommendations. The Committee Chair also regularly met with the lead audit partner.\n\nDuring the year, a questionnaire was also completed by the Committee members and management to gather their perspectives on the effectiveness and quality of the external auditor's work.\n\nThe Committee also reviewed the key findings from the FRC's Audit Quality Review in respect of KPMG's audits. Whilst the FRC review did not cover the BT Group audit, the report provided a basis for the Committee to challenge KPMG over any actions proposed as a result of the report, and any weakness identified in audit quality. The Committee discussed the findings and the applicability to the BT Group (with and without KPMG) and will continue to keep this under review.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee agreed that:\n\n- -  the audit contributed to the integrity of the group's financial reporting\n- -  the relationship between KPMG and both the Committee and management continues to be effective\n- -  KPMG demonstrated an appropriate degree of professional scepticism and deployed a team with the required level of skill and expertise to enable an effective audit\n- -  the audit strategy and plan was appropriately scoped, communicated and executed\n- -  KPMG continues to be independent, and recommended to the Board that the reappointment of KPMG, as our external auditor, be put to our shareholders for approval at the 2023 AGM (this was subsequently approved by the Board).",

Once again we have ensured that any remuneration decisions taken during the year were in line with our Directors' Remuneration Policy.\n\n## Committee role\n\nThe Committee is responsible on behalf of the Board for:\n\n- -  Determining the salary and benefits for the Chairman, Executive Directors, members of the Executive Committee and the Company Secretary, and monitoring remuneration practices and policies for the wider workforce\n- -  Setting the performance targets for the annual bonus scheme for senior executives for the year ahead\n- -  Determining awards under the annual bonus scheme and the group's long-term incentive plans for senior executives\n- -  Reviewing and approving the Report on directors' remuneration\n- -  Reviewing and approving the Policy including seeking shareholder approval, on a binding basis, at least every three years\n- -  Ensuring that all remuneration decisions are made within the parameters of the approved Policy and align with our reward philosophy and our values. No senior executive is involved in any decision about their own remuneration.\n\nAfter each meeting, I report back to the Board on the Committee's activities and the main issues discussed.\n\nThe Committee's key responsibilities are set out in its terms of reference available at bt.com/governance\n\nThis report sets out information on the Committee's activities during the year, our remuneration framework and its implementation. I have also provided further context on the performance of the business throughout the year and the environment in which the Committee made decisions on executive pay.\n\n## Stakeholder context\n\n## Wider workforce pay and conditions\n\nIn April 2022 we provided a salary increase of \u00a31,500 to all UK frontline colleagues. Despite facing growing cost pressures, we really wanted to support our colleagues and we believe we delivered the best pay review we could afford at the time. Regretfully, we were not able to reach agreement on this with the CWU and FY23 saw eight days of industrial action. I am immensely grateful for the hard work of all colleagues who stepped up to ensure we kept our customers and the country connected during this challenging time.\n\nSince April, colleagues across the globe have continued to be impacted by rising inflation and the cost of living squeeze. We again sought to support our colleagues as best we could, and we took the following actions:\n\n- -  We delivered a \u00a31,500 consolidated salary increase from 1 January 2023 to all UK colleagues earning a \u00a350,000 full-time equivalent salary or below - more than 85% of our UK workforce, including all of our team member and frontline colleagues, and half of our UK manager population. Combined with the increase offered in April 2022, our lowest-paid colleagues received a total increase of 15% year on year. This one-off award was",

As a result, a similar increase was provided in the Republic of Ireland and we paid a one-off allowance to colleagues in Hungary\n- -  In terms of enhanced benefit provision, we rolled out additional support for business-needs drivers and colleagues travelling overnight; and launched our Benefitness campaign to help colleagues understand how our range of flexible benefits could best support them through these difficult economic times.\n\nThe Committee understands that our colleagues continue to face cost pressures and it receives regular updates on pay and conditions across the business throughout the year.\n\nIsabel Hudson, as the Designated Non-Executive Director for workforce engagement, also feeds back to the Committee on a regular basis the comments and sentiments on remuneration matters which are raised by the Colleague Board . These issues are front-of-mind for the Committee as it makes decisions on executive pay throughout the year.\n\n## Customer context\n\nThe whole country has been impacted by the cost of living crisis and we have provided support for our customers as well as our colleagues. In June 2021 we were the first to launch a social tariff, Home Essentials, which provides discounted broadband to support customers claiming certain benefits. Although some of our competitors have now followed suit, BT Group still has more social tariff customers than the rest of the market combined. We made the decision to freeze our pricing in 2023 for one million social tariff and landline-only customers, as well as for two million Pay As You Go mobile customers.\n\nWe continue to build our fibre network at pace, delivering nextgeneration connectivity to the country: more than 10m premises are now covered by our network, with more than 3m connections.\n\nAs noted below, our NPS scores have fallen this year. Delivering strong customer experience is a core pillar of our strategy and in order to bring extra focus on this in FY24, we will be doubling the weighting on NPS in our bonus scorecard from 10% to 20%.\n\n## Shareholder context\n\nOur share price performance during the year has again been volatile, but an upward trend in 2023 reflects improving market confidence in our strategy, as we start to see the benefits of our huge investment projects materialise. We're confident that we will deliver for our shareholders over the longer term. As planned, we reinstated our dividend for FY22 and have continued to pay dividends in FY23.\n\n## Performance and executive remuneration outcomes for FY23\n\n## Annual bonus\n\nFor FY23, annual bonus performance was based on a scorecard of seven key financial and non-financial measures that align to our strategic priorities. Financial performance accounted for 70% of the bonus scorecard and comprised the following measures:\n\n- -Adjusted EBITDA (35%) - despite the challenging economic backdrop and inflationary headwinds, we have delivered on our promise of \u00a37.9bn in EBITDA for the year\n- -Normalised free cash flow (35%) - free cash flow was depressed during the year as we continued to build at pace, but by the end of Q4 we delivered normalised free cash flow of \u00a31.3bn, in line with our guidance.\n\nOur non-financial measures accounted for 30% of the bonus scorecard and comprised the following:\n\n- -Customer (10%) - customer sentiment in the year was impacted by the cost of living crisis, and our ability to support customers was affected by the industrial action. Although NPS scores were strong in Enterprise, at Group level we failed to meet our NPS threshold target\n- -Converged networks (10%) - we have continued to drive sales and delivery of the latest network technologies throughout the year, with both FTTP and 5G metrics landing between target and stretch\n\n## -Digital impact & sustainability (10%)\n\n- -Skills for tomorrow (5%) - we continue to deliver support for our customers, families and small businesses, reaching more than 920,000 people across the country during the year. Performance was between target and stretch\n- -Carbon emissions intensity (5%) - strong progress was made in the year on energy efficiency and reduction in energy consumption across our estate, meaning performance was above our stretch goal for the year. However, it also benefited from unforeseen events outside of management's control, or strategic decisions such as a reduction to our recruitment plans agreed part-way through the year. For scorecard purposes, we removed the impact of these unforeseen events, with the underlying result in line with threshold.\n\n## Further detail on the FY23 annual bonus scorecard can be found on page 122.\n\nThe overall formulaic outcome of the bonus scorecard was 72.9% of target. Taking account of the broader context described above, the Committee agreed that this result was a fair and reasonable reflection of the wider performance of the business and that therefore no discretion needed to be exercised. Philip and Simon will therefore be awarded bonuses of \u00a3962,590 and \u00a3656,440 respectively, half of which will be deferred into shares for three years.\n\n## 2020 Restricted Share Plan awards\n\nThe Committee carried out an assessment of the two underpins applying to the 2020 Restricted Share Plan (RSP) awards (relating to ROCE performance and ESG/reputational damage) and determined that both had been satisfied.\n\nThe Committee is also cognisant of the need to avoid unreasonable windfall gains: however, the 2020 RSP awards were reduced in value by 20% at the point of grant to account for a fall in share price prior to award, and accordingly the Committee agreed that the potential vesting value of these awards remains appropriate and that no further adjustment was required.\n\nAll three tranches of the 2020 RSP awards will therefore vest in full in August 2023, 2024 and 2025 respectively. Tranches one and two remain subject to a holding requirement until August 2025.\n\n## Policy review\n\nOur Directors' Remuneration Policy was last approved by shareholders at the 2020 AGM and is therefore due to be put to a binding vote again at the 2023 AGM in July.\n\nA number of significant changes were made to the Policy in 2020, including the introduction of the RSP, which were supported by 95% of shareholders. Following a thorough review, the Committee has determined that the Policy remains fit for purpose, is well aligned with our strategy and appropriately incentivises and motivates senior executives to deliver shareholder value. We see no reason to move away from the RSP model at this time and we're also comfortable that the Policy maxima remain appropriately market-aligned.",

As always, the Committee and I are grateful for the valuable feedback.\n\n## Policy implementation in FY24\n\n## Base salary\n\nPhilip's salary was fixed for five years on appointment and therefore no increase will be made in FY24. Philip has also volunteered to waive any salary increases beyond FY24.\n\nAs part of the delivery of the cost of living pay rise, it was agreed that our regular annual salary review for UK managers will take place in September rather than June. The Committee will therefore consider any salary increase for Simon nearer this time when rates for the wider workforce are known and this will be confirmed in the 2024 Report on directors' remuneration.\n\n## Annual bonus\n\nThe annual bonus scorecard has been simplified for FY24, with an increased focus on customer and diversity and inclusion:\n\n- -  Unchanged on the prior year, financial measures will account for 70% of the annual bonus scorecard, split equally between Adjusted EBITDA and normalised free cash flow\n- -The remaining 30% of the annual bonus scorecard will be designated as a transformation scorecard , emphasising key inyear priorities. For FY24 the following ESG metrics are proposed:\n- -Group Net Promoter Score , with an increased weighting of 20%, reflecting the critical importance of providing strong customer experience, and\n- -Diversity and inclusion , weighted 10%. D&I is fundamental to our purpose as a business, and ensuring our colleagues reflect the diversity of our customer base is critical to delivering our growth plans. We firmly believe that diversity and inclusion are intrinsically linked: an inclusive culture, driven by a diverse and inclusive management team, will attract diverse candidates into the business, and vice versa, so we will be introducing both a diversity and an inclusion metric (each equally weighted at 5% each)\n- Our diversity metric will measure representation of female, ethnic minority and disabled colleagues within our senior management population, alongside an inclusion index, which will use a set of four questions from our employee engagement survey to measure improvement in inclusion sentiment over time.\n\nNetwork (FTTP and 5G) and Skills for Tomorrow metrics will no longer form part of the bonus: we have made significant progress in these areas and they are now well-embedded in the business. We believe it is the right time to prioritise new measures.\n\nThe Committee also believes that climate-related metrics are better suited to longer-term measurement and so while carbon emissions intensity no longer features in the annual bonus scorecard, we're introducing a new sustainability underpin for future RSP awards.\n\nThe annual bonus remains subject to a health and safety underpin and, if triggered, the Committee retains the discretion to reduce the pay-out as it considers appropriate. The EBITDA underpin which applied in FY23 was intended to apply for a single year only and will be removed for FY24.\n\nNo changes are proposed to the structure of the bonus plan itself: the on-target and maximum opportunity will remain at 120% and 200% of salary for both Philip and Simon, with 50% deferred into shares for a period of three years.\n\n## RSP\n\nDue to the deferral of our annual salary review described above, the annual grant of RSP awards will also be delayed until September. Our normal Policy grant level for Executive Directors is 200% of salary. The Committee will consider the actual grant value for the 2023 awards nearer the time of grant, taking into account the share price at the time. If the share price is materially lower than the share price used to determine the 2022 awards, the Committee will consider whether it is appropriate to reduce awards to mitigate the risk of windfall gains.\n\nAs in prior years, these awards will vest in three equal tranches in June 2026, 2027 and 2028, with all tranches subject to a holding requirement until June 2028.\n\nRSP awards are subject to two underpins, which have been revised for 2023, measured over the initial three-year vesting period: 1. ROCE - average return on capital employed must be at least 7%\n\n- 2. Sustainability - the business must have made sufficient progress over the vesting period towards meeting our sustainability commitments (this could include carbon emissions, carbon abatement and circularity).\n\nIn relation to the ROCE underpin, the Committee concluded that in light of the impact of market volatility on our WACC methodology, it was appropriate to set the underpin as a fixed ROCE figure rather than relative to WACC as in prior years.\n\nIn setting the level of ROCE at 7%, the Committee took into account (1) the purpose of the underpin, being to avoid payment for failure rather than representing a 'target' for success; and (2) our expected ROCE performance over the next three years. The latter factors in our decision to expand and accelerate connections alongside our ambition to reach 25m premises with full fibre by the end of 2026, a once-in-a-generation capital investment of approximately \u00a315bn that will both support the upgrade of the UK's digital economy into the future, and position BT Group to deliver long-term returns to our shareholders.\n\nResponsibility for assessing the sustainability underpin sits with the Digital Impact & Sustainability Committee, which will provide a recommendation to the Committee at the end of the underpin period for their consideration. The Digital Impact & Sustainability Committee has agreed a framework which will enable a robust assessment of performance versus our specific sustainability commitments.\n\n## Chairman and Non-Executive Director fees\n\nNo changes will be made to the fees payable to the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors for FY24.\n\nFinally, I will be stepping down from the BT Group Board at the conclusion of the AGM in July, and will be succeeded in my role as Chair of this Committee by Ruth Cairnie. I would like to thank you for your support over the last three years. As always, the Committee and I wish to maintain an open dialogue on remuneration matters with our investors and I would welcome their comments or feedback, and support, at the forthcoming AGM.\n\n## Sir Ian Cheshire\n\nChair of the Remuneration Committee 17 May 2023",

Maximum total compensation levels are typically set lower than typical market practice to reflect the narrower and more predictable range of performance outcomes for BT Group\n- -  Formulaic incentive outcomes are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee and may be adjusted after considering overall group performance and wider workforce remuneration policies and practices.\n\n## Alignment to culture\n\n- -  When considering performance, the Remuneration Committee takes account of BT Group's values\n- -  The Remuneration Committee receives regular updates on remuneration practices and policies for the wider workforce, and colleagues may provide feedback to the Board via the Colleague Board and the Designated Non-Executive Director for workforce engagement\n- -  We encourage all of our colleagues to become shareholders in the business through the operation of all-employee share plans.",

Subject to approval, this Policy will become effective on that date.\n\nThe Committee has carried out a full review of all elements of the Policy and has determined that it remains fit for purpose, aligned with our strategy, and appropriately incentivises and motivates\n\n## Executive Directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Base salary\n\nPurpose - a core element of remuneration, used to attract and retain Executive Directors of the calibre required to develop and deliver our long-term business strategy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Benefits\n\nPurpose - to support health and wellbeing and provide employees with a market-competitive level of benefits, ensuring the attraction and retention of key talent to deliver our strategy.\n\n## Operation\n\nSalaries are reviewed annually, although an out-of-cycle review may be conducted if the Remuneration Committee determines it appropriate.\n\nA review may not necessarily lead to an increase in salary.\n\nSalaries are normally paid monthly in cash.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee takes into account a number of factors when setting salaries, including (but not limited to):\n\n- -  the size and scope of the individual's responsibilities\n- -  the individual's skills, experience and performance\n- -  typical salary levels for comparable roles within appropriate pay comparators; and\n- -  pay and conditions for our wider employee population.\n\n## Maximum opportunity\n\nWhilst there is no maximum salary level, any increase will typically not exceed the range of increases awarded to our wider employee population.\n\nHigher increases may be made under certain circumstances, such as:\n\n- -  increase in the scope and/or responsibility of the individual's role on either a permanent or temporary basis\n- -  development of the individual within their role\n- -  where an Executive Director has been appointed to the Board at a lower than typical level of salary, for example to reflect a lower level of experience, larger increases may be awarded to move them closer to the market rate as their experience develops\n- -  where there has been a significant change in market practice, or the size and scope of BT Group plc, and\n- -  other exceptional circumstances.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nNone\n\n## Operation\n\nExecutive Directors receive benefits which typically include (but are not limited to) car benefits (which may include any of a company car, cash allowance in lieu, fuel allowance, and driver), personal telecommunication facilities and home security, medical and dental cover for the directors and their immediate family, life cover, professional subscriptions, personal tax advice and a financial counselling allowance of up to \u00a35,000 (excluding VAT) a year.\n\nWhere Executive Directors are required to relocate, the Remuneration Committee may offer oneoff or ongoing relocation benefits, and additional expatriate benefits, if considered appropriate.\n\nExpenses incurred in the performance of an Executive Director's duties for BT Group may be reimbursed (including any relevant taxes due thereon) or paid directly by BT Group, as appropriate.\n\nBT Group plc purchases directors' and officers' liability insurance to cover the directors, and has in place a directors' and officers' indemnity. The insurance operates to protect the directors in circumstances where, by law, BT Group cannot provide the indemnity.\n\nFurther details of the directors' and officers' liability insurance and indemnity are set out on page 132.\n\n## Maximum opportunity\n\nWhile no maximum level of benefits is prescribed, they are generally set at an appropriate marketcompetitive level determined by the Remuneration Committee , taking into account a number of factors including:\n\n- -  the jurisdiction in which the employee is based\n- -  the level of benefits provided for other employees within the group; and\n- -  market practice for comparable roles within appropriate pay comparators in that jurisdiction.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee keeps the benefit policy and benefit levels under regular review.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nNone\n\nsenior executives to deliver shareholder value. As such, no material changes to the Policy are being proposed at this time.\n\n- Further details on the review and implementation are included in the Committee Chair's letter on pages 109 to 110.\n- Details on how the Policy will be implemented in FY24 are provided on page 113.",

The Remuneration Committee may determine that alternative pension provisions will operate. When determining pension arrangements for new appointments, the Remuneration Committee will give regard to:\n\n- -  pension arrangements received elsewhere in the group; and\n- -  relevant market practice including in the jurisdiction in which the Executive Director is based.\n\n## Maximum opportunity\n\nThe maximum cash allowance (or equivalent contribution to an Executive Director's pension, or combination of the two) may not exceed the equivalent level of pension contribution offered to the majority of the workforce in their local jurisdiction (currently 10% of salary in the UK).\n\n## Performance measures\n\nNone\n\n## Operation\n\nExecutive Directors are eligible for an annual bonus.\n\nAwards are based on performance in the relevant financial year, and are not pensionable.\n\nUp to half of any bonus earned will normally be paid in cash, with the remainder granted in the form of deferred share awards to further strengthen the alignment of management's interests with the long-term interests of shareholders. Deferred share awards will normally vest, subject to continued employment, after three years.\n\nBoth cash and deferred elements are subject to BT Group's malus and clawback provisions, which are described in more detail on page 120.\n\n## Maximum opportunity\n\nThe maximum annual bonus opportunity for the Executive Directors is 200% of base salary. Up to 25% of the maximum under each element is payable for threshold performance and 60% of the maximum is normally payable for target performance.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nThe Remuneration Committee sets annual bonus performance measures and targets each year, taking into account key strategic priorities and the approved budget for the year.\n\nMeasures used typically include, but are not limited to:\n\n- -  financial performance measures - these are chosen carefully to ensure alignment between reward and underlying financial performance. As an example, such measures may include normalised free cash flow and EBITDA, and\n- -  non-financial performance measures - these reflect key BT Group strategic goals. For example, such measures may include network, transformation, customer experience and other ESG goals.\n\nFinancial measures will typically account for at least 50% of the total annual bonus.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee ensures that targets set are appropriately stretching in the context of the corporate plan, as well as other internal and external factors, and that there is an appropriate balance between incentivising Executive Directors to meet targets, while ensuring that they do not drive unacceptable levels of risk or inappropriate behaviours.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee has full discretion to adjust outcomes under the annual bonus plan up or down where:\n\n- -  the formulaic outcome does not reflect the underlying financial or non-financial performance of BT Group plc\n- -  the payout level is not appropriate in the context of circumstances that were unexpected or unforeseen at the start of the year; and/or\n- -  there exists any other reason why an adjustment to the level of bonus payout is appropriate.",

The net number of shares vesting (i.e. after tax and other statutory deductions) under the first two tranches are subject to a further holding period until year five.\n\n## Maximum opportunity\n\nUnder normal circumstances, awards granted to Executive Directors in respect of any financial year may be no higher than 200% of salary.\n\nUnder exceptional circumstances, for example on recruitment, a higher limit of 250% of salary applies.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nRSP awards are subject to one or more underpins over a period which is normally three financial years commencing with the year in which the awards were granted.\n\nThese underpins are designed with the protection of BT Group in mind, to ensure an acceptable threshold level of performance is achieved and that vesting is warranted. The underpins applying to each award will be determined by the Remuneration Committee each year, and may be a combination of financial and non-financial assessments.\n\nIf the underpins are not met, the Remuneration Committee may consider a reduction to the final vesting level of the RSP awards (including to nil).\n\nEven where the underpins are met, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to adjust the number of shares vesting up or down where:\n\n- -  the vesting outcome does not reflect the underlying financial or non-financial performance of BT Group plc\n- -  the vesting level is not appropriate in the context of circumstances that were unexpected or unforeseen at the point the awards were granted; and/or\n- -  there exists any other reason why an adjustment to the level of vesting of the award is appropriate.\n\nVested and unvested RSP awards are subject to BT Group's malus and clawback provisions, which are described in more detail on page 120.\n\n## Operation\n\nExecutive Directors may participate in any all-employee share plans operated by BT Group plc on the same basis as other eligible employees.\n\n## Maximum opportunity\n\nAll participants may participate up to the limits operated by BT Group plc at the time, which are set in line within any relevant statutory limits.\n\n## Performance measures\n\nNone\n\n## Operation\n\nExecutive Directors are required to build up and maintain a shareholding equivalent to 500% of their annual salary. It is expected that this requirement is met within five years of an executive's appointment to the Board.\n\nShares counted towards satisfaction of the requirement include:\n\n- -  beneficially-owned shares\n- -  vested share awards subject to a holding period\n- -  unvested Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) awards, counted on a net-of-tax basis; and\n- -  unvested RSP awards subject to underpins, also counted on a net-of-tax basis.\n\nUntil such time that the requirement has been satisfied, Executive Directors will not be permitted to sell any vesting incentive awards (other than to satisfy tax or other statutory liabilities on vesting, or at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee in exceptional circumstances).\n\nThe shareholding requirement will continue to apply for a period of two years post-cessation of employment, to the same value as the in-employment requirement (or the total number of shares held immediately prior to cessation of employment, if lower).\n\n## Maximum opportunity\n\nN/A\n\n## Performance measures\n\nNone",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration Policy continued\n\n## Recruitment\n\nOur recruitment policy is based on a number of key principles:\n\n- -  we aim to provide a remuneration package which is sufficient to attract, retain and motivate key talent, while at all times ensuring that we pay no more than is necessary, with due regard to the best interests of BT Group plc and our shareholders\n- -  the Remuneration Committee will take a number of factors into account in determining an appropriate remuneration package. For example, these may typically include the candidate's experience and calibre, their circumstances, external market influences and arrangements for existing Executive Directors\n- -  the ongoing remuneration package offered to new Executive Directors will only include those elements listed within the Policy table\n- -  the Remuneration Committee may also consider providing oneoff or ongoing relocation benefits, as well as additional benefits to expatriate appointments, where appropriate; and\n- -  the Remuneration Committee will provide full details of the recruitment package for new Executive Directors in the Annual Report on Remuneration and will provide shareholders with the rationale for the decisions that were taken.\n\nThe maximum level of variable pay (excluding buyouts, for which see below) which may be awarded in respect of a recruitment event (internal or external), will not exceed 450% of base salary, representing the aggregated maximum award under the annual bonus and RSP.\n\nIn addition, to facilitate recruitment, the Remuneration Committee may make awards to buy out remuneration or contractual entitlements which the individual would forfeit at their current employer. The Remuneration Committee will give consideration to any relevant factors, typically including the form of the award (e.g. cash or shares), the proportion of the performance/vesting period outstanding and the potential value of the forfeited remuneration, including performance conditions attached to the awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met, and the timing of any potential payments.\n\nIn making buyout awards, the Remuneration Committee may grant awards under our existing incentive arrangements or use the relevant provision in the Listing Rules. This allows for the granting of awards specifically to facilitate the recruitment of an Executive Director, without seeking prior shareholder approval. In doing so, the Remuneration Committee will comply with the relevant provisions in force at the time.\n\nWhere an Executive Director is appointed from within the organisation, BT Group will honour any legacy arrangements in line with their original terms and conditions.\n\nIn the event of the appointment of a new Non-Executive Director, remuneration arrangements will be in line with those detailed on page 126.\n\n## Payment for loss of office\n\nIn a departure event, the Remuneration Committee will typically consider:\n\n- -  whether any element of annual bonus should be paid for the financial year. Any bonus which is paid will normally be limited to the period served during the financial year in which the departure occurs\n- -  whether any outstanding deferred bonus awards should be preserved either in full or in part; and\n- -  whether any awards under the RSP or LTI scheme should be preserved either in full or in part and, if relevant, whether the post-vesting holding period should apply.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee has historically maintained a discretionary approach to the treatment of leavers, on the basis that the facts and circumstances of each case are unique. This provides the Remuneration Committee with the maximum flexibility to review the facts and circumstances of each case, allowing differentiation between good and bad leavers and avoiding payment for failure.\n\nWhen considering a departure event, there are a number of factors which the Remuneration Committee takes into account in determining appropriate treatment for outstanding incentive awards.\n\nThese include:\n\n- -  the position under the relevant plan documentation or any contractual entitlements\n- -  the individual circumstances of the departure\n- -  the performance of BT Group plc/the individual during the year to date; and\n- -  the nature of the handover process.\n\n## DBP\n\nGood\n\nleaver\n\nRetained in full, normally vesting on their usual timeframe.\n\nIn the case of death, awards are accelerated such that they vest on the date of death.\n\n## Bad leaver\n\nForfeit on cessation, subject to discretion.\n\n## RSP\n\nGood leaver\n\n## Bad leaver\n\nForfeit on cessation, subject to discretion.\n\nIn some cases, the treatment is formally prescribed under the rules of the relevant plan so that where there are 'good leaver' circumstances, including death, injury, ill-health, disability, redundancy or sale of BT Group plc or business.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee considers the leaver circumstances along a continuum, ranging from 'bad leaver' scenarios such as termination of employment for gross misconduct or resignation, through to the 'good leaver' scenarios outlined above.\n\nAccordingly, subject to the relevant plan rules, the Remuneration Committee may apply (or disapply) such performance conditions or underpins or time pro-rating to awards vesting in these circumstances as it considers appropriate.\n\nRetained, subject to pro-ration for portion of the three-year initial vesting period served, vesting on the normal timeframe, subject to the satisfaction of any performance conditions or underpins. The postvesting holding period usually continues to apply as normal. On death, awards are accelerated such that they vest on the date of death. All retained awards are subject to pro-ration for the portion of the initial three-year vesting period served, and subject to the Remuneration Committee 's assessment of satisfaction of any performance conditions or underpins applying, measured at or close to the date of death.",

        "page_content": "## All-employee plans\n\nThe treatment of awards under BT Group plc's all-employee plans on leaving is as determined under the respective HMRC-approved rules. For saveshare, someone who ceases to be an employee in special circumstances (for example injury, disability, death, or following sale of BT Group plc or business where they work) may exercise the option within six months after leaving (or 12 months in the case of death) or the relevant corporate event. If someone leaves for a reason not falling within special circumstances, the option lapses on the date the individual leaves.\n\n## Change of control\n\nIn the event of a takeover or scheme of arrangement involving BT Group plc, DBP and RSP awards will vest, at a minimum, to the extent that any applicable performance measures have been satisfied at the time (subject to the Remuneration Committee 's discretion to determine the appropriate level of vesting, having regard to such relevant factors as it decides to take into account). If the acquiring company offers to exchange awards over BT Group plc shares for awards over its shares (or shares in another company), awards may, if the Remuneration Committee determines, be exchanged and continue under the rules of the relevant plan.\n\nIn the event of a voluntary winding up of BT Group plc, awards may vest on the members' resolution to voluntarily wind-up BT Group plc being passed.\n\n## Executive Director service contracts\n\nThe other key terms of the service contracts for the current Executive Directors are set out below. The termination provisions described above are without prejudice to BT Group's ability in appropriate circumstances to terminate in breach of the notice period referred to above, and thereby be liable for damages to the Executive Director. In the event of termination by BT Group plc, each Executive Director may have entitlement to compensation in respect of his or her statutory rights under employment protection legislation in the UK.\n\nWhere appropriate, BT Group may also meet a director's reasonable legal expenses in connection with either his or her appointment or termination. BT Group plc may, where appropriate and reasonable, cover the cost of outplacement services.\n\nThere are no other service agreements, letters of appointment or material contracts, existing or proposed, between BT Group plc and the Executive Directors.\n\n## Notice period\n\n12 months' notice by BT Group plc, six months' notice by the Executive Director (there is no fixed expiry date).\n\n## Termination payment\n\n- -  In lieu of giving an Executive Director 12 months' notice, BT Group plc may terminate the director's contract and make a payment in lieu of notice to which the director was entitled if he or she had received salary and to the extent no longer payable the value of contractual benefits for the period; and\n- -  the payments in lieu will be payable in equal monthly instalments until the date on which the notice period would have expired or (if earlier) the date on which the director secures alternative employment with the same or higher basic salary or fee. In the event that the director secures alternative employment at a basic salary of \u00a330,000 or higher, but lower than their salary, payment in lieu will be reduced by the amount of the new lower salary received. The Board retains the right to lower the payment in lieu of the director's new employment if it considers the new employment terms of the director are not appropriately balanced between basic salary and other elements, and may cease making payments entirely where the Board is not satisfied the director is making reasonable efforts to secure alternative employment.\n\n## Remuneration and benefits\n\n- -  Participation in the annual bonus, long-term incentive and other share plans, is non-contractual.\n- -  Other benefits which typically include (but are not limited to) car benefits (which may include any of a company car, cash allowance in lieu, fuel allowance, and driver), personal telecommunication facilities and home security, medical and dental cover for the directors and their immediate family, life cover, professional subscriptions, personal tax advice and financial counselling up to a maximum of \u00a35,000 (excluding VAT) a year.\n\n## Illustration of Executive Director pay scenarios\n\nOur Policy aims to ensure that a significant proportion of pay is dependent on the achievement of stretching performance targets. The Remuneration Committee has considered the level of total remuneration that would be payable under different performance scenarios and is satisfied that, as the graphs illustrate, executive pay is appropriate in the context of the performance required and is aligned with shareholders' interests.\n\nThe illustrative scenarios below set out the total remuneration that might be achieved by each Executive Director for different levels of performance, based on our Policy.\n\nThe minimum reflects base salary, benefits and pension only which are not performance-related.\n\n| F  Fixed pay    | All scenarios   | Consists of total fixed pay - base  salary, benefits and pension -  Base salary - salary effective  as at 1 June 2023   |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| V Variable  pay | Minimum         | -  No payout under the annual  bonus                                                                                    |\n|                 | On target       | -  No vesting under the RSP -  On-target payout under the                                                               |\n|                 |                 | annual bonus of 120% of salary -  Full vesting of the RSP at 200%                                                       |\n|                 | Maximum         | -  Maximum payout under the  annual bonus of 200% of salary                                                             |\n|                 | Maximum         | -  Full vesting of the RSP at 200%  of salary. -  Maximum payout under the                                              |\n\n## Fixed pay is calculated as follows:\n\n| \u00a3000                    | Salary   |   Benefits |   Pension | Total fixed  pay   |\n|-------------------------|----------|------------|-----------|--------------------|\n| Chief Executive         | 1,100    |        113 |       110 | 1,323              |\n| Chief Financial Officer | 750      |         23 |        75 | 848                |",

        "page_content": "## Directors' Remuneration Policy continued\n\nRSP awards have been shown at face value, with no share price growth or discount rate assumptions, other than the fourth scenario which includes an uplift of 50% on the restricted share awards. All-employee plans have been excluded, as have any legacy awards held by Executive Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Malus and clawback\n\nBoth annual bonus and long-term incentive arrangements are subject to malus and clawback. Under the malus provision, the Remuneration Committee may apply its discretion to reduce (including to nil) any DBP or RSP award prior to the award vesting, if circumstances arise which justify a reduction.\n\nUnder the clawback provision, the Remuneration Committee has discretion to require an employee to pay back to BT Group plc part or all of the cash part of the annual bonus within one year of payment. The Remuneration Committee also has discretion to require an employee to pay back part or all of a vested long-term incentive plan award within two years of the award or respective tranche vesting.\n\nThe circumstances in which the Remuneration Committee may consider it appropriate to apply clawback and/or malus include, but are not limited to those summarised below:\n\n- -  behaviour by a participant which fails to reflect BT Group's governance and business values\n- -  the extent to which any condition was satisfied was based on an error, or on inaccurate or misleading information or assumptions which resulted either directly or indirectly in an award being granted or vesting to a greater extent than would have been the case had that error not been made\n- -  material adverse change in the financial performance of BT Group plc or any division in which the participant works and/or worked\n- -  a material financial misstatement of BT Group plc's audited financial accounts (other than as a result of a change in accounting practice)\n- -  any action which results in or is reasonably likely to result in reputational damage to BT Group plc\n- -  a material failure in risk management\n- -  corporate failure\n- -  negligence or gross misconduct of a participant; and/or\n- -  fraud effected by or with the knowledge of a participant.\n\nOther elements of remuneration are not subject to malus and clawback provisions.\n\n## Consideration of remuneration arrangements throughout the group\n\nThe Remuneration Committee considers the pay and conditions of employees throughout BT Group when determining the remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors, and is provided with relevant information and updates by the Chief Human Resources Officer. Whilst we do not consult directly with colleagues on executive remuneration arrangements, the Committee receives regular updates from the Colleague Board via the Designated NonExecutive Director for workforce engagement.\n\nFurther detail on pay conditions within BT Group are provided in Remuneration in context on page 129.\n\n## Consideration of shareholder views\n\nThe Remuneration Committee is strongly committed to an open and transparent dialogue with shareholders on remuneration matters. We believe that it is important to meet regularly with our key shareholders to understand their views on our remuneration arrangements and discuss our approach going forward.\n\nThe Remuneration Committee will continue to engage with shareholders and will aim to consult on any material changes to the Policy or other relevant matters.\n\n## Summary of decision-making process and changes to the Policy\n\nDuring the year, the Remuneration Committee undertook a review of the Policy and its implementation to ensure that the Policy supports the execution of strategy and the delivery of sustainable long-term shareholder value. Throughout the review process, the Remuneration Committee took into account the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code, wider workforce remuneration and emerging best practice in relation to Executive Director remuneration, as well as input from management and its independent advisors. The Remuneration Committee considers that the overall remuneration framework remains appropriate to continue to incentivise management to drive long-term sustainable performance for shareholders and as such, no significant changes are proposed to the Policy.\n\nMinor changes have been made to the wording of the Policy to aid operation and to increase clarity. The Remuneration Committee believes that the proposed Policy is clear and transparent and aligned with our culture and considers that it complies with Provision 40 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code.\n\n## Legacy matters\n\nThe Remuneration Committee can make remuneration payments and payments for loss of office outside of the Policy set out above where the terms of the payment were agreed (i) before the Policy set out in this report came into effect, provided that the terms of the payment were consistent with any applicable policy in force at the time they were agreed; or (ii) at a time when the relevant individual was not a director of BT Group plc (or another person to whom the Policy set out above applies) and that, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee , the payment was not in consideration for the individual becoming a director of BT Group plc (or taking on such other applicable position). This includes the exercise of any discretion available to the Remuneration Committee in connection with such payments. For these purposes, payments include the Remuneration Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.\n\n## Minor amendments\n\nThe Remuneration Committee may make minor amendments to the arrangements for the directors as described in the Policy, for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes, or to take account of a change in legislation.",

The annual bonus is based on performance against a scorecard of seven key financial and non-financial measures linked to our KPIs as set out on pages 48 to 49.\n\n| Category                          | Measure                           | Weighting   | Threshold   | Target   | Stretch   | Actual   | Payout (% of max)              |                                |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------|-------------|----------|-----------|----------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| Financial                         | Adjusted EBITDA (\u00a3m)              | 35%         | 7,747       | 7,947    | 8,247     | 7,848    |                                | 45%                            |\n|                                   | Normalised free cash flow (\u00a3m)    | 35%         | 1,252       | 1,452    | 1,752     | 1,328    |                                | 41%                            |\n| Customer                          | Group NPS                         | 10%         | 0           | 100      | 200       | 0        |                                | 0%                             |\n| Converged networks                | 5G customers (000s)               | 5%          | 7,436       | 8,262    | 9,088     | 8,606    |                                | 77%                            |\n|                                   | FTTP connections (000s)           | 5%          | 2,617       | 2,908    | 3,199     | 3,124    |                                | 90%                            |\n| Digital impact   & sustainability | Reduction in carbon emissions (%) | 5%          | (50)        | (52)     | (54)      | (50)     |                                | 30%                            |\n| Digital impact   & sustainability | Skills for Tomorrow (000s)        | 5%          | 600         | 800      | 1,200     | 920      |                                | 72%                            |\n| Formulaic outcome                 |                                   |             |             |          |           |          | 43.7% of max (72.9% of target) | 43.7% of max (72.9% of target) |\n\nFor scorecard purposes, the EBITDA result assumes an on-target bonus payout for all colleagues. Actual post-bonus EBITDA for FY23 is \u00a37,928m.\n\nAs part of its normal process, the Committee agreed appropriate adjustments to the EBITDA and normalised free cash flow target ranges to account for items not included in the targets at the start of the year, including the tax super-deduction and sale of BT Sport (including changes to accounting treatment). These amendments had the impact of reducing the formulaic outcome of the bonus scorecard.\n\nThe formulaic outcome under the carbon emissions metric was a 56% reduction. Strong progress was made in the year on energy efficiency and reduction in energy consumption across our estate. However, we also benefited from unforeseen events outside of management's control, or strategic decisions such as a reduction to our recruitment plans agreed part-way through the year. For scorecard purposes, the Committee removed the impact of these unforeseen events, with the underlying result in line with threshold at a 50% reduction.\n\nWhen determining the overall performance and bonus pay-outs, the Committee also considers a number of other factors including share price performance, the external environment and overall affordability. The Committee agreed that the formulaic outcome of 72.9% of target was a fair reflection of performance in the year and that no further adjustments were warranted.\n\nThe final bonus outturns for the Executive Directors are set out in the table below:\n\n|               | Formulaic   outcome   | % of   max   | Value    |\n|---------------|-----------------------|--------------|----------|\n| Philip Jansen | 72.9% of target       | 43.7%        | \u00a3962,590 |\n| Simon Lowth   | 72.9% of target       | 43.7%        | \u00a3656,440 |\n\nAs per the Policy, 50% of the FY23 annual bonus will be deferred into shares for three years.\n\n## 2020 RSP\n\nThe RSP is a conditional share award. Two underpins applied over the initial three-year vesting period:\n\n- -  ROCE is equal to or exceeds the WACC over the same period\n- -  there must have been no ESG issues which have resulted in material reputational damage for the group.\n\nThe Committee assessed performance against the two underpins at the end of the financial year and agreed that both had been satisfied.\n\nThe Committee also considered share price performance over the vesting period and the absolute value of vesting awards. Noting that a 20% reduction to the award values was made at the point of grant, the Committee agreed that the value of the 2020 RSP awards was appropriate and that no further adjustment was required.\n\nAs a result, all three tranches of the 2020 RSP award will vest in full in August 2023, 2024 and 2025 respectively. Tranches one and two remain subject to a holding requirement until August 2025.",

An award of 200% of salary was made to both Executive Directors in line with the normal Policy level. The face value was based on the BT Group plc share price at the date of grant of 184.35p. The grant price is calculated using the average middle-market price of a BT Group plc share for the three dealing days prior to grant.\n\n| Director      | Date of award   | RSP award  (shares)   | Face value  of award   |\n|---------------|-----------------|-----------------------|------------------------|\n| Philip Jansen | 24 June 2022    | 1,195,652             | \u00a32,200,000             |\n| Simon Lowth   | 24 June 2022    | 815,376               | \u00a31,500,294             |\n\nThese awards are conditional share awards.

The awards were made under the deferred bonus plan (DBP) in June 2022 as set out below and on page 125. The face value was based on the BT Group plc share price at the date of grant of 184.35p. The grant price is calculated using the average middle-market price of a BT Group plc share for the three dealing days prior to grant.\n\n| Director      | Date of award   | DBP award  (shares)   | Face value  of award   |\n|---------------|-----------------|-----------------------|------------------------|\n| Philip Jansen | 24 June 2022    | 358,695               | \u00a3660,000               |\n| Simon Lowth   | 24 June 2022    | 239,816               | \u00a3441,263               |\n\nDeferred shares are not subject to performance conditions and have a three-year vesting period. At vesting, additional shares representing the value of reinvested dividends on the underlying shares are added.\n\nMalus and clawback provisions apply as set out in the Policy, and the Committee retains the ultimate discretion to adjust vesting levels to ensure alignment with our overall performance.\n\n- Details of all interests under the DBP are set out on page 125.\n\n## Payments for loss of office (audited)\n\nNo payments were made to directors during the year for loss of office.\n\n## Former directors (audited)\n\nNo payments were made to former directors during the year.\n\n## Directors' share ownership (audited)\n\nThe Committee believes that the interests of the Executive Directors should be closely aligned with those of shareholders. The aim is to encourage the build-up of a meaningful shareholding in BT Group plc over time by retaining net shares received through the executive share plans or from market purchases.\n\nThe shareholding requirement for both Executive Directors under the Policy is 500% of salary. Executive Directors are expected to meet this requirement within five years of the approval of the Policy or, in the case of any new Executive Directors appointed, within five years of their date of appointment.\n\nThe shareholding requirement continues to apply in full for two years post-cessation of employment (or the total number of shares held at cessation, if lower). The post-cessation shareholding requirement will be calculated and expressed as a fixed number of shares by reference to the closing BT Group plc share price on the day immediately prior to the cessation date. The requirement is fixed as this number of shares for a period of two years and compliance will be measured at cessation and annually thereafter. In enforcing continued compliance post-cessation, the Committee may request that the Executive Director transfers any shares subject to the shareholding requirement which we will hold in trust until such time that they no longer need to be retained.\n\nWe encourage the Chairman and Independent Non-Executive Directors to purchase, on a voluntary basis, BT Group plc shares with an aggregate value of \u00a35,000 on average each year (based on acquisition price) to further align the interests of Non-Executive Directors with those of our shareholders. They are asked to hold these shares until they cease being a member of the Board.\n\nThis policy does not apply to the Deutsche Telekom nominated representative director appointed to the Board as a NonIndependent, Non-Executive Director under the terms of the EE acquisition in January 2016. This helps avoid any conflict of interest.",

Two underpins will apply over the initial three-year vesting period as set out on page 122. The Committee assessed performance against the two underpins at the end of the financial year and agreed that both had been satisfied. As a result, all three tranches of the 2020 RSP award will vest in full in August 2023, 2024 and 2025 respectively. Tranches one and two remain subject to a holding requirement until August 2025.\n- d Awards granted on 24 June 2021.

        "page_content": "## Annual remuneration report continued\n\n## Implementation of Policy in FY24\n\n## Base salary\n\nPhilip's base salary of \u00a31,100,000 was agreed on appointment in January 2019 and is fixed for five years. Philip has also volunteered to waive any salary increases beyond FY24.\n\nOur annual salary review for the UK management population will take place in September rather than June. As such, any change in base salary for Simon will be considered at that time and reported in the 2024 Report on directors' remuneration.\n\n## Benefits\n\nFor Executive Directors, the Committee has set benefits in line with the Policy. No changes are proposed to the benefit framework for FY24.\n\n## Pension allowance\n\nIn line with the rate offered to the majority of our UK workforce, both Executive Directors receive an annual allowance equal to 10% of salary in lieu of pension provision.\n\n## Annual bonus\n\nBoth Executive Directors are eligible for an on-target and maximum bonus payment of 120% and 200% of salary. In line with the Policy, 50% of any bonus payable will be deferred into shares for three years.\n\nThe Committee has reviewed in full the measures, weightings and targets used in the annual bonus scorecard. As set out on page 110 we're proposing a simplified annual bonus scorecard for FY24 with an improved focus customer and diversity and inclusion metrics.\n\nThe FY24 annual bonus structure measures and weightings are set out below.\n\n| Category       | Measure                   | Weighting   |\n|----------------|---------------------------|-------------|\n| Financial      | Adjusted EBITDA           | 35%         |\n|                | Normalised free cash flow | 35%         |\n| Transformation | NPS                       | 20%         |\n| scorecard      | Diversity & inclusion     | 10%         |\n\nAll of the annual bonus measures are linked to our KPIs as set out on pages 48 to 49.\n\nIn addition to the annual bonus scorecard, a health and safety underpin applies which allows the Committee to exercise its discretion to reduce the annual bonus pay-out result if there is a significant breach in health and safety.\n\nWe do not publish details of the targets in advance as these are commercially confidential. Targets will be disclosed in full in the 2024 Report on directors' remuneration.\n\n## RSP\n\nGiven the annual salary review will take place in September rather than June, the annual grant of RSP awards will also be deferred to that time. Our normal Policy grant level for Executive Directors is 200% of salary. The Committee will consider the actual grant value for the 2023 awards nearer the time of grant, taking into account the share price at the time. If the share price is materially lower than the share price used to determine the 2022 awards, the Committee will consider whether it is appropriate to reduce awards to mitigate the risk of windfall gains.\n\nThe Committee has agreed the following two underpins for the 2023 RSP awards which will be measured over the initial three-year vesting period:\n\n- -  Average ROCE must be at least 7%\n- -  The business must have made sufficient progress over the vesting period towards meeting our sustainability commitments (which could include carbon emissions, carbon abatement and circularity).\n\nAwards will vest in three equal tranches after three, four and five years, with an additional holding period such that no shares may be sold until year five. At vesting, additional shares representing the value of reinvested dividends on the underlying shares are added.\n\nMalus and clawback provisions and overarching Committee discretion applies, as set out in the Policy.\n\n## Chairman and Non-Executive Director remuneration\n\nThe base fee for Non-Executive Directors is unchanged for FY24 at \u00a378,540 per year.

The Committee is satisfied that the advice provided by Deloitte has been objective and independent. The Deloitte partner who provides remuneration advice to the Committee does not have any connections with BT Group plc that may impact their independence. Deloitte received \u00a3147,415 (excluding VAT) in fees for these services.\n\nThe fees are charged on a time-spent basis in delivering advice. That advice materially assisted the Committee in its consideration of matters relating to executive remuneration and the Policy.\n\nDeloitte is a founder member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.\n\nIn addition, during FY23, Deloitte provided the group with advice on corporate and indirect taxes, assistance with regulatory, risk and compliance issues, accounting advice, help with delivering on the making finance better transformation and additional consultancy services.\n\n## Dilution\n\nWe use both treasury shares and shares purchased by the BT Group Employee Share Ownership Trust (the Trust) to satisfy our all-employee share plans and executive share plans. Shares held in the Trust do not have any voting rights.\n\nAs at 31 March 2023, shares equivalent to 3.03% (FY22: 4.16%) of the issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) would be required to satisfy all outstanding share options and awards.\n\nOf these, we estimate that for FY24, shares equivalent to approximately 0.87% (FY23: 0.53%) of the issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) will be required to satisfy the allemployee share plans.\n\n## Previous AGM voting outcomes\n\nThe table below sets out the previous votes cast at the AGM in respect of the Annual remuneration report and the Policy.\n\n|                                                         | For % of votes cast/ Number   | Against % of votes  cast/ Number   | Withheld votes/  Number   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Report on  directors' remuneration at  the 14 July 2022 | 93.58                         | 6.42                               |                           |\n| AGM                                                     | 6,408,190,533                 | 439,625,354                        | 58,845,040                |\n| Policy at the 16 July 2020  AGM                         | 95.04 6,036,920,089           | 4.96 315,057,559                   | 4,101,574                 |\n\nWithheld votes are not counted when calculating voting outcomes.\n\n## Committee evaluation FY23\n\n- This year we undertook an internal Board and committee evaluation, details of which can be found on page 96.\n\n## Comparison of Chief Executive remuneration to TSR (unaudited)\n\nTSR is the measure of the returns that a company has provided for its shareholders, reflecting share price movements and assuming reinvestment of dividends. The graph below illustrates the performance of BT Group plc measured by TSR relative to a broad equity market index over the past ten years. We consider the FTSE 100 to be the most appropriate index against which to measure performance, as BT Group plc has been a member of the FTSE 100 throughout the ten-year period.\n\n## BT Group plc's TSR performance vs the FTSE 100\n\nSource: Datastream.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## History of Chief Executive remuneration\n\n| Year end   | Chief Executive   | Total  remuneration  \u00a3000   | Annual bonus  (% of max)   | ISP/ RSP  vesting   (% of max)   |\n|------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| 2023       | Philip Jansen     | 3,089                       | 43.7%                      | 100%                             |\n| 2022       | Philip Jansen     | 3,460                       | 60%                        | 19.1%                            |\n| 2021       | Philip Jansen     | 2,628                       | 60%                        | 0%                               |\n| 2020       | Philip Jansen     | 3,248                       | 50%                        | n/a                              |\n| 2019       | Philip Jansen a   | 725                         | 56%                        | n/a                              |\n|            | Gavin Patterson b | 1,719                       | 28%                        | 0%                               |\n| 2018       | Gavin Patterson   | 2,307                       | 54%                        | 0%                               |\n| 2017       | Gavin Patterson   | 1,345                       | 0%                         | 0%                               |\n| 2016       | Gavin Patterson   | 5,396                       | 45%                        | 82.0%                            |\n| 2015       | Gavin Patterson b | 4,562                       | 58%                        | 67.4%                            |\n| 2014       | Gavin Patterson c | 2,901                       | 62%                        | 78.7%                            |\n|            | Ian Livingston d  | 4,236                       | 35%                        | 63.4%                            |\n\n- a Philip was appointed as a director on 1 January 2019 and became Chief Executive from 1 February 2019.

2023, Ruth Cairnie joined the Board as an Independent Non-Executive Director on 6 April 2023. In addition, Ian Cheshire and Iain Conn will step down from the Board at the conclusion of the AGM on 13 July 2023.\n\nThere are no other service agreements, letters of appointment or material contracts, existing or proposed, between BT Group plc and any of the directors. There are no arrangements or understandings between any director or executive officer and any other person pursuant to which any director or executive officer was selected to serve. There are no family relationships between the directors.\n\n## Independent Non-Executive Directors' letters of appointment\n\nEach Independent Non-Executive Director has an appointment letter setting out the terms of his or her appointment. We ask each Non-Executive Director to allow a minimum commitment of 22 days each year, subject to committee responsibilities, and to allow slightly more in the first year in order to take part in the induction programme. The actual time commitment required in any year may vary depending on business and additional time may be required during periods of increased activity.\n\n## Inspection by the public\n\nThe service agreements and letters of appointment are available for inspection by the public at BT Group plc's registered office.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration in context\n\n## Consideration of colleague and stakeholder views\n\nOur colleagues are vital to our business and we believe in fairness throughout the group. There are several general reward principles which we apply at all levels:\n\n- -  We will provide a competitive package with reference to the relevant market for each colleague\n- -  We will ensure colleagues can share in the success of the business, and through the operation of all-employee share plans encourage colleagues to become shareholders\n- -  Where appropriate, variable remuneration is provided to incentivise employees towards driving the strategic aims of the business. Performance is based on both individual performance and the performance of the group, using a consistent framework for our senior management team and the majority of other colleagues\n- -  We offer a range of employee benefits, many of which are available to all colleagues\n- -  We aim for transparency and a fair cascade of remuneration throughout the group\n- -  Employment conditions for all colleagues reflect our values and are commensurate with those of a large publicly listed company, including high standards of health and safety, a strong commitment to diversity and inclusion and wellbeing.\n\nThe Committee supports fairness and transparency of remuneration arrangements and the Policy has been designed to align with the remuneration philosophy and principles that underpin remuneration across the wider group. To support this, the Committee receives regular updates on HR policies and reward practices for the wider workforce as well as updates on employee relations.\n\nWhilst the Committee does not directly consult with our employees as part of the process of determining executive pay, the Board does receive feedback from employee surveys that take into account remuneration throughout the organisation.\n\nThe Designated Non-Executive Director for workforce engagement also updates the Committee on sentiments being raised by our colleagues in relation to the remuneration of our workforce and related decisions, as raised by the Colleague Board through their 'hot topics' discussions.\n\nWhen setting Executive Directors' remuneration, the Committee considers the remuneration of other senior managers and colleagues in the group more generally to ensure that arrangements for Executive Directors are appropriate in this context. When determining salary increases for Executive Directors, the Committee considers the outcome of the wider pay review for the group.\n\n## Chief Executive pay ratio\n\nThe table below sets out the Chief Executive pay ratios as at 31 March 2023, as well as those reported in respect of the prior four years. This report will build up over time to show a rolling ten-year period.\n\nThe ratios compare the single total figure of remuneration of the Chief Executive with the equivalent figures for the UK lower quartile (P25), median (P50) and upper quartile (P75) employees.\n\nA significant proportion of the Chief Executive's remuneration is delivered through long-term incentives, where awards are linked to share price movements over the longer term. This means that the ratios will depend significantly on long-term incentive outcomes and may fluctuate from year to year - for example, a higher total remuneration ratio was exhibited in 2020 due to the vesting of the Chief Executive's Worldpay buyout award and in 2022 due to the partial vesting of the 2019 ISP award, while a lower ratio was exhibited in FY23 due to a reduced bonus pay-out. We believe that these ratios are appropriate given the size and complexity of the business, and are a fair reflection of our remuneration principles and practices.\n\nWe have used the 'Option B' methodology (based on gender pay reporting), as the most robust way to identify the individual reference points within an organisation with multiple operating segments.\n\n## Total remuneration\n\n|      |                 | Employee remuneration   | Employee remuneration   | Employee remuneration   | Pay ratio   | Pay ratio   | Pay ratio   |\n|------|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n|      | Chief Executive | P25                     | P50                     | P75                     | P25         | P50         | P75         |\n| 2019 | \u00a32,444,000      | \u00a334,281                 | \u00a341,477                 | \u00a351,594                 | 71:1        | 59:1        | 47:1        |\n| 2020 | \u00a33,248,000      | \u00a334,881                 | \u00a342,173                 | \u00a351,351                 | 93:1        | 77:1        | 63:1        |\n| 2021 | \u00a32,628,000      | \u00a335,569                 | \u00a341,600                 | \u00a350,391                 | 74:1        | 63:1        | 52:1        |\n| 2022 | \u00a33,350,000      | \u00a335,722                 | \u00a340,059                 | \u00a349,488                 | 94:1        | 84:1        | 68:1        |\n| 2023 | \u00a33,089,000      | \u00a336,960                 | \u00a340,095                 | \u00a350,999                 | 84:1        | 77:1        | 61:1        |\n\n## Base salary\n\n|      |                 | Employee remuneration   | Employee remuneration   | Employee remuneration   | Pay ratio   | Pay ratio   | Pay ratio   |\n|------|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n|      | Chief Executive | P25                     | P50                     | P75                     | P25         | P50         | P75         |\n| 2019 | \u00a31,222,000      | \u00a330,090                 | \u00a335,918                 | \u00a341,740                 | 37:1        | 31:1        | 27:1        |\n| 2020 | \u00a31,100,000      | \u00a331,144                 | \u00a337,321                 | \u00a342,800                 | 35:1        | 29:1        | 26:1        |\n| 2021 | \u00a31,100,000      | \u00a331,842                 | \u00a335,606                 | \u00a342,836                 | 35:1        | 31:1        | 26:1        |\n| 2022 | \u00a31,100,000      | \u00a331,637                 | \u00a335,017                 | \u00a343,908                 | 35:1        | 31:1        | 25:1        |\n| 2023 | \u00a31,100,000      | \u00a333,144                 | \u00a335,948                 | \u00a344,986                 | 33:1        | 31:1        | 24:1        |\n\nThe P25, P50 and P75 employees were identified from our gender pay reporting data, based on the April snapshot period at the start of each respective year. We then identified the 80 employees above and below each of the 'P' points to form enlarged groups. This approach is thought to be an appropriate representation - while there is a reasonable level of consistency given the size of the UK population, this methodology reduces volatility in the underlying data, and helps account for differences in the gender pay and pay ratio calculation methodologies. Other than the exclusion of a small number of data points for leavers and divestments, no other adjustments were made to the underlying data.",

        "page_content": "## Statement of directors' responsibilities in respect of the Annual Report and the financial statements\n\nThe directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the group and parent company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.\n\nCompany law requires the directors to prepare group and parent company financial statements for each financial year. Under that law they are required to prepare the group financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nUnder company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group and parent company, and of the group's profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the group and parent company financial statements, the directors are required to:\n\n- -  select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently\n- -  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable, relevant, reliable and prudent\n- -  state whether the group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the UK-adopted international accounting standards\n- -  state whether applicable UK accounting standards have been followed with regards to the parent company financial statements, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent company financial statements\n- -  assess the group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern and disclose, as applicable, matters related to going concern\n- -  use the going concern basis of accounting unless they either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations or have no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent company's transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy, at any time, the financial position of the parent company, and enable them to ensure that its financial statements comply with the 2006 Act. They are responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.\n\nUnder applicable law and regulations, the directors are also responsible for preparing an annual strategic report, directors' report, report on directors' remuneration and corporate governance statement that comply with such law and regulation.\n\nThe directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the BT Group website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\n## Responsibility statement of the Board in respect of the annual financial report\n\nWe confirm, to the best of our knowledge that:\n\n- -  the financial statements , prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the group and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole\n- -  the Strategic report and the Report of the directors include a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the group and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\n\nWe consider that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the group's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\nThis responsibility statement was approved by the Board on 17 May 2023 and was signed on its behalf by:\n\n## Philip Jansen\n\n## Simon Lowth\n\nChief Executive\n\nChief Financial Officer",

        "page_content": "## Report of the directors\n\nThe directors present the Report of the directors, together with audited financial information for the year ended 31 March 2023. The Report of the directors also encompasses the entirety of our Corporate governance report on pages 83 to 136 for the purpose of section 463 of the Companies Act 2006 (the 2006 Act). The Report of the directors together with the Strategic report on pages 1 to 82 form the Management Report for the basis of DTR 4.1.5R.\n\nIn accordance with DTR 4.1.14R, the financial statements will form part of the annual financial report prepared using the single electronic reporting format under the TD ESEF Regulation. The auditor's report on these financial statements provides no assurance over the ESEF format.\n\n## Critical accounting estimates, key judgements and significant accounting policies\n\nOur critical accounting estimates, key judgements and significant accounting policies conform with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and are set out on pages 156 and 157 of the consolidated financial statements . The directors have reviewed these policies and applicable estimation techniques and have confirmed that they are appropriate for the preparation of the FY23 consolidated financial statements .\n\n## Disclosure of information to the auditor\n\nAs far as each of the directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information (as defined by section 418(3) of the 2006 Act) that hasn't been disclosed to the auditor. Each of the directors confirms that all steps have been taken that ought to have been to make them aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the auditor has been made aware of that information.\n\n## Going concern\n\nIn line with IAS 1 'Presentation of financial statements', and revised FRC guidance on 'risk management, internal control and related financial and business reporting', management has taken into account all available information about the future for a period of at least, but not limited to, 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements when assessing the group's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nThe Strategic report on pages 1 to 82 includes information on the group structure, strategy and business model, the performance of each customer-facing unit and the impact of regulation and competition. The Group performance section on pages 50 to 57 includes information on our group financial results, financial outlook, cash flow and net debt, and balance sheet position. Notes 24, 26, 27 and 29 of the consolidated financial statements include information on the group's investments, cash and cash equivalents, borrowings, derivatives, financial risk management objectives, hedging policies and exposure to interest, foreign exchange, credit, liquidity and market risks.\n\nOur principal risks and uncertainties are set out on pages 63 to 70 including details of each risk and how we manage them. The directors carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks affecting the group, including any that could threaten our business model, future performance, insolvency or liquidity.\n\nThis assessment is consistent with the assessment of our viability, as set out on pages 81 to 82, in estimating the financial impact for a severe but plausible outcome for each risk, both individually and in combination through stochastic risk modelling. This stress testing confirmed that existing projected cash flows and cash management activities provide us with adequate headroom over the going concern assessment period.\n\nHaving assessed the principal and emerging risks, the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting when preparing the financial statements. This assessment covers the period to May 2024, which is consistent with FRC guidance. When reaching this conclusion, the directors took into account the group's overall financial position (including trading results and ability to repay term debt as it matures without recourse to refinancing) and the exposure to principal risks (including severe but plausible downsides, refer to the Viability statement on pages 81 to 82).\n\nAt 31 March 2023, the group had cash and cash equivalents of \u00a30.4bn and current asset investments, of \u00a33.5bn. The group also had access to committed borrowing facilities of \u00a32.1bn. These facilities were undrawn at the period-end and are not subject to renewal until March 2027.\n\n## Independent advice\n\nThe Board has a procedure that allows directors to seek independent professional advice at our expense. All directors also have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary and her nominated delegate.\n\n## Directors' and officers' liability insurance and indemnity\n\nWe routinely buy insurance cover for directors, officers and employees in positions of managerial supervision of BT Group plc and its subsidiaries. This is intended to protect against defence costs, civil damages and, in some circumstances, civil fines and penalties following an action brought against them in their personal capacity. The policy also covers individuals serving as directors of other companies or of joint ventures, or on boards of trade associations or charitable organisations at the group's request. The insurance protects the directors and officers directly in circumstances where, by law, BT Group plc cannot provide an indemnity. It also provides the group, subject to a retention, with cover against the cost of indemnifying a director or officer. One layer of insurance is ring-fenced for the directors of BT Group plc.\n\nAs at 17 May 2023, and throughout FY23, BT Group plc's whollyowned subsidiary, British Telecommunications plc, has provided an indemnity for a group of people similar to the group covered by the above insurance. Neither the insurance nor the indemnity provides cover where the individual is proven to have acted fraudulently or dishonestly.\n\nAs permitted by BT Group plc's Articles of Association, and to the extent permitted by law, the group indemnifies each of its directors and other officers against certain liabilities that may be incurred as a result of their positions within the group. The indemnity was in force throughout the tenure of each director during the last financial year, and remains in force.",

        "page_content": "## Interest of management in certain transactions\n\nDuring and at the end of FY23, none of BT Group plc's directors were materially interested in any material transaction in relation to the group's business. None are materially interested in any currently proposed material transactions.\n\n## Power to authorise conflicts\n\nAll directors have a duty under the 2006 Act to avoid a situation in which he or she has, or can have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the group. BT Group plc's Articles of Association include provisions for dealing with directors' conflicts of interest in accordance with the 2006 Act. The group has procedures in place, which it follows, to deal with such situations. These require the Board to:\n\n- -  consider each conflict situation separately on its particular facts\n- -  consider the conflict situation in conjunction with its other duties under the 2006 Act\n- -  keep records and Board minutes on any authorisations granted by directors and the scope of any approvals given\n- -  regularly review conflict authorisation.\n\nThe Company Secretary maintains a conflicts of interest register.\n\nThe Conflicted Matters Committee identifies to what extent Board and Committee materials are likely to refer to a potential or actual conflict of interest between BT Group plc and Deutsche Telekom and, as a result, what materials should be shared with our NonIndependent, Non-Executive Director and Deutsche Telekom nominated representative. He owes duties to both BT Group plc and Deutsche Telekom, and the Conflicted Matters Committee helps him comply with his fiduciary duties, although ultimate responsibility rests with him.\n\n## Systems of risk management and internal control\n\nThe Board is responsible for reviewing the group's systems of risk management and internal control each year, and for ensuring their effectiveness, including in respect of relevant assurance activities. These systems are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, risks we face that may prevent us from achieving our business objectives and delivering our strategy. Any system can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss.\n\nOur group risk management framework is simple and consistent, and defines our (1) risk mindset and culture, (2) risk process and activities; and finally (3) governance. The framework:\n\n- -  provides the business with the tools to take on the right risks and make smart risk decisions\n- -  supports the identification, assessment and management of the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the group\n- -  is an integral part of BT Group's annual strategic review cycle.\n\nThe framework was designed in accordance with the FRC guidance on risk management, internal control and related financial and business reporting and has been in operation throughout the year and up to the date on which this document was approved. The framework was reviewed in FY23 and was deemed effective. Enhancements were made to simplify and standardise the groupwide policies and key controls to ensure all our enduring risks are managed consistently and effectively across our business, driving accountability, and enabling targeted assurance activities.\n\nMore information on our group risk management framework can be found under the section Risk management on pages 61 to 62.\n\nInternal audit carry out periodic assessments of the quality of risk management and control, promote effective risk management across all our units and report to management and the Audit & Risk Committee on the status of specific areas identified for improvement. We do not cover joint ventures and associates not controlled by the group in the scope of our group risk management framework. Such third parties are responsible for their own internal control assessment.\n\nFurthermore, the Audit & Risk Committee , on behalf of the Board, reviews the effectiveness of the systems of risk management and internal control across the group. Further details on how the Audit & Risk Committee fulfils these duties can be found on pages 101 to 105.\n\n## Capital management and funding policy\n\nThe objective of our capital management policy is to target an overall level of debt consistent with our credit rating objectives, while investing in the business, supporting our pension schemes and meeting our distribution policy.\n\nThe Board regularly reviews the group's capital structure. Management proposes actions and produces analyses which reflect the group's investment plans and risk characteristics, as well as the macroeconomic conditions in which we operate.\n\nOur funding policy is to raise and invest funds centrally to meet the group's anticipated requirements. We use a combination of capital market bond issuance and committed borrowing facilities to fund the group. When issuing debt, in order to avoid refinancing risk, group treasury will take into consideration the maturity profile of the group's debt portfolio, financial market conditions as well as forecast cash flows.\n\nSee note 29 to the consolidated financial statements for details of our treasury policy.\n\n## Financial instruments\n\nDetails of the group's financial risk management objectives, policies of the group and exposure to interest risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and foreign exchange are given in note 29 to the consolidated financial statements .\n\n## Credit risk management policy\n\nWe take proactive steps to minimise the impact of adverse market conditions on our financial instruments. In managing investments and derivative financial instruments, group treasury monitors the credit quality across treasury counterparties and actively manages any exposures that arise. Management within the business units also actively monitors any exposures arising from trading balances.\n\n## Off-balance sheet arrangements\n\nOther than the financial commitments and contingent liabilities disclosed in note 32 to the consolidated financial statements , there are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on:\n\n- -  our financial condition\n- -  changes in financial condition\n- -  revenues or expenses\n- -  results of operations\n- -  liquidity\n- -  capital expenditure\n- -  capital resources.\n\nWe use a supply chain financing programme with a limited number of suppliers with short payment terms to extend them a more typical payment term. More details are disclosed in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements .",

In respect of each of the claims described in note 19, the nature and progression of such proceedings and investigations can make it difficult to predict the impact they will have on the group.

This includes the ability to exercise the authority to allot or purchase BT Group plc shares pursuant to shareholders passing an ordinary resolution at the Annual General Meeting (AGM)\n- -  we have no agreements with directors providing for compensation for loss of office or employment as a result of a takeover. Similarly, there is no provision for this in our standard employee contracts\n- -  we're not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer of shares or on voting rights.\n\n## Articles of Association\n\nBT Group plc's current Articles of Association were adopted pursuant to a resolution passed at the AGM of BT Group plc held on 15 July 2021 and contain, amongst others, provisions on the rights and obligations attaching to BT Group plc's shares.\n\nThe Articles of Association may only be amended by special resolution at a general meeting of the shareholders in accordance with applicable legislation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA copy of the current Articles of Association is available at bt.com/articles",

        "page_content": "## Directors' appointment, retirement and removal\n\nThe Articles of Association regulate the appointment and removal of directors, as does the 2006 Act and related legislation. The Board, and shareholders (by ordinary resolution), may appoint a person who is willing to be elected as a director, either to fill a vacancy or as an additional director. At every AGM, all directors must automatically retire. A retiring director is eligible for election or re-election, as applicable. In addition to any power of removal under the 2006 Act, the shareholders can pass an ordinary resolution to remove a director.\n\nAdel Al-Saleh is appointed as a Non-Independent, Non-Executive Director under the terms of the Relationship Agreement between BT Group plc and Deutsche Telekom. His appointment is terminable immediately by either party.\n\n## Share rights\n\n## (a) Voting rights\n\nOn a show of hands, every shareholder present in person or by proxy at any general meeting has one vote and, on a poll, every shareholder present in person or by proxy has one vote for each share which they hold.\n\nThere are no restrictions on exercising voting rights except in situations where BT Group plc is legally entitled to impose such a restriction (for example where a notice under section 793 of the 2006 Act has been served).\n\n## (b) Variation of rights\n\nIf the share capital of BT Group plc were to be split into different classes of shares by special resolution, the special rights attached to any of those classes can be varied or withdrawn either: (i) with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class; or (ii) with the consent in writing of the holders of at least 75% in nominal value of the issued shares of that class. BT Group plc can issue new shares and attach any rights and restrictions to them, as long as this is not restricted by special rights previously given to holders of any existing shares. Subject to this, the rights of new shares can take priority over the rights of existing shares, or existing shares can take priority over them, or the new shares and the existing shares can rank equally. BT Group plc currently has one class of shares.\n\n## Transfer of shares\n\nThere is no specific restriction on the transfer of BT Group plc shares in the group, which is governed by the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation.\n\n## Political donations\n\nOur policy is that no company in the group will make contributions in cash or in kind to any political party, whether by gift or loan. However, the definition of political donations used in the 2006 Act is significantly broader than the sense in which these words are ordinarily used. The 2006 Act's remit could cover making members of Parliament and others in the political world aware of key industry issues and matters affecting BT Group plc, and enhancing their understanding of the group.\n\nThe authority for political donations requested at the 2023 AGM is not intended to change this policy. It does, however, ensure that the group continues to act within the provisions of the 2006 Act, requiring companies to obtain shareholder authority before they make donations to political parties and/or political organisations as defined in the 2006 Act. During FY23, BT Group plc's wholly owned subsidiary, British Telecommunications plc, paid the costs of attending events at (i) the Labour party conference; (ii) the Conservative party conference; and (iii) the Liberal Democrats Business day. These costs totalled \u00a35,848 (FY22: \u00a36,205). No company in the BT Group made any loans to any political party.\n\n## Substantial shareholdings\n\nAs at 31 March 2023, BT Group plc had received notice, under the DTRs, in respect of the following holdings of 3% or more of the voting rights in its issued ordinary share capital:\n\n|                    | Date of notification                | Shares        | % of total   voting rights   |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------|------------------------------|\n|                    | Altice UK S.\u00e0 r.l. 13 December 2021 | 1,785,476,188 | 18.0%                        |\n| T-Mobile  Holdings | 23 March 2018                       | 1,196,175,322 | 12.06%                       |\n| BlackRock, Inc.    | 1 June 2022                         | 584,662,245   | 5.88%                        |\n\nAs at 17 May 2023, BT Group had not received any further such notices under the DTRs.\n\n## Colleague engagement\n\nEngaging with our colleagues is critical to creating a culture where they can be their best and contribute to our purpose, ambition, strategy and long-term success.\n\nEngaging with our colleagues takes many forms, including through:\n\n- -  the Board receiving regular updates from the Chief Executive and Chief Human Resources Officer on colleagues, key people strategy initiatives, culture and overall sentiment in the organisation\n- -  the Colleague Board, our workforce engagement mechanism\n- -   the annual Your Say colleague engagement survey\n- -  regular colleague communications.\n\nColleagues are kept well informed on matters such as the strategy and performance of the group, including after certain key events such as results and trading updates. We work with our highly active, engaged and award-winning People Networks. These colleaguedriven groups raise awareness and advocate for change both inside and outside BT Group.\n\nColleague engagement is still above the external benchmark of 70% but went down six points in this year's Your Say survey. This was driven by the cost of living crisis and industrial action.\n\nWe encourage all of our colleagues to become shareholders in the business through the operation of all-employee share plans. We annually consider which all-employee plans to offer, both in the UK and globally.",

During the year we partnered with them to deliver a series of videos highlighting the experiences of colleagues with a range of disabilities - from diabetes and visual and hearing impairments to autism.\n\nWe're a member of Valuable 500, a global business collective made up of 500 CEOs and their companies that are committed to disability inclusion. At the disability summit held December 2022, we renewed our commitment to three priorities: Workplace adjustment; Disability advocacy; and Career progression of our junior managers.\n\nThese priorities support our Valuable 500 commitment: To accelerate the pace of progress we're making for disabled and neurodiverse colleagues, and those that have an impairment, or a long-term health condition. We renewed our status as a Disability Confident Leader and continue to work with several teams across the business, our Able2 People Network and external partner the Business Disability Forum.\n\nRead more on diversity and inclusion\n\nat bt.com/diversity-and-inclusion\n\n## AGM\n\n## Resolutions\n\nAt the 2023 AGM, shareholders will be asked to vote on all resolutions including the Annual Report, the Report on directors' remuneration , the directors' remuneration policy, the election/ re-election of directors, the reappointment of KPMG LLP as our external auditor and to authorise the Audit & Risk Committee to agree its remuneration, giving authority to the directors to allot BT Group plc shares and disapply pre-emption rights.\n\nBefore the AGM, our share registrar, Equiniti, will count the proxy votes for and against each resolution, as well as votes withheld. We will make the results available as soon as reasonably practicable following the conclusion of the meeting. As at previous AGMs, we will take votes on all matters at the 2023 AGM on a poll.\n\nThe separate Notice of meeting 2023, which we send to all shareholders who have requested shareholder documents by post, contains the resolutions (with explanatory notes) which we will propose at the 2023 AGM on 13 July 2023. We notify all shareholders of the publication of these documents which are available on our website at bt.com/annualreport\n\n## Authority to purchase shares\n\nThe authority given at the 2022 AGM for BT Group plc to purchase in the market 992m of its shares, representing 10% of BT Group plc's issued share capital (excluding treasury shares), expires at the conclusion of the 2023 AGM. We will ask shareholders to give a similar authority at the 2023 AGM.\n\nDuring FY23 and up to 17 May 2023, no shares were purchased under this authority.\n\nAt the start of the year, 41.5m shares (having a total nominal value of \u00a32m, and constituting 0.4% of the issued share capital (0.4% excluding treasury shares)) were held as treasury shares. During FY23, 5.2m treasury shares (having a nominal value of \u00a3262,000, and constituting 0.05% of the issued share capital (0.05% excluding treasury shares)) were transferred to meet BT Group plc's obligations under its employee share plans. At 31 March 2023, a total of 36.1m shares (having a total nominal value of \u00a31.8m, and constituting 0.36% of the issued share capital (0.36% excluding treasury shares)) were held as treasury shares (see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements ).\n\nSince 31 March 2023 (up to and including 17 May 2023), 554,286 treasury shares (having a nominal value of \u00a327,700, and constituting 0.005% of the issued share capital (0.005% excluding treasury shares)) have been transferred to meet BT Group plc's obligations under its employee share plans.\n\nAt 17 May 2023, a total of 35.6m shares (having a nominal value of \u00a31.8m, and constituting 0.36% of the issued share capital (0.36% excluding treasury shares)) were held as treasury shares.\n\nIn addition, during FY23 and up to 17 May 2023 the Trust purchased 48.1m BT Group plc shares for a total consideration of \u00a388m. The Trust held 138.8m shares both at 31 March 2023 and 17 May 2023.\n\n## Cross-reference to the Strategic report\n\nWe have chosen to include the following information in the Strategic report in line with the 2006 Act (otherwise required by law to be included in the Report of the directors ):\n\n- -  the final dividend proposed by the Board (page 51)\n- -  an indication of likely future developments in the business of BT Group plc and its group (pages 1 to 82)\n- -  an indication of our research and development activities (page 13)\n- -  information about how the directors engaged with UK employees, had regard to UK employee interests, and the effect of that regard, including on principal decisions during the year (pages 23, 41 and 92 to 93)\n- -  information about how the directors have had regard to the need to foster business relationships with suppliers, customers and others, and the effect of that regard, including on principal decisions during the year (pages 24 to 27, 40 to 45 and 94 to 95)\n- -  information about greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption and energy efficiency action (pages 39, 72 and 80).\n\nBy order of the Board\n\n## Sabine Chalmers\n\nGroup General Counsel, Company Secretary & Director Regulatory Affairs 17 May 2023",

        "page_content": "## KPMG LLP's Independent Auditor's Report to the members of BT Group plc\n\n## 1. Our opinion is unmodified\n\nIn our opinion:\n\n- -  the financial statements of BT Group plc give a true and fair view of the state of the Group's and of the Parent Company's affairs as at 31 March 2023, and of the Group's profit for the year then ended;\n- -  the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards;\n- -  the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK accounting standards, including FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; and\n- -  the Group and Parent Company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\n## What our opinion covers\n\nWe have audited the Group and Parent Company financial statements of BT Group plc ('the Company') for the year ended 31 March 2023 (FY23) included in the Annual Report, which comprise:\n\nGroup (BT Group plc and its subsidiaries)\n\nParent Company (BT Group plc)\n\nGroup income statement\n\nGroup statement of comprehensive income\n\nGroup balance sheet\n\nGroup statement of changes in equity\n\nGroup cash flow statement\n\nNotes 1 to 33 to the Group financial statements, including the accounting policies in the respective notes\n\nCompany balance sheet\n\nCompany statement of changes in equity\n\nNotes 1 to 3 to the Parent Company financial statements, including the accounting policies in note 1\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) ('ISAs (UK)') and applicable law. Our responsibilities are described below. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is a sufficient and appropriate basis for our opinion. Our audit opinion and matters included in this report are consistent with those discussed and included in our reporting to the Audit and Risk Committee ('ARC').\n\nWe have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities under, and we remain independent of the Group in accordance with, UK ethical requirements including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities.\n\n## 2. Overview of our audit\n\n## Audit and Risk Committee interaction\n\nDuring the year, the ARC met five times. KPMG are invited to attend all ARC meetings and are provided with an opportunity to meet with the ARC in private sessions without the Executive Directors being present. For each Key Audit Matter, we have set out communications with the ARC in section 4, including matters that required particular judgement for each.\n\nThe matters included in the Audit and Risk Committee Chair's report on pages 101 to 105 are materially consistent with our observations of those meetings.\n\n## Our independence\n\nWe have fulfilled our ethical responsibilities and remain independent of the Group in accordance with UK ethical requirements, including the FRC Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities.\n\nApart from the matters noted below, we have not performed any non-audit services during the year ended 31 March 2023 or subsequently which are prohibited by the FRC Ethical Standard.\n\nDuring 2023, we identified that certain KPMG member firms had provided preparation of local financial statement services and foreign language translation services during the periods ended 31 March 2018 to 31 March 2023 to some entities not in scope for the group audit. The services, which have been terminated, were administrative in nature and did not involve any management decision-making or bookkeeping. The work in each case was undertaken after the group audit opinion was signed by KPMG LLP for each of the related financial years and had no direct or indirect effect on BT Group plc's consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn our professional judgment, we confirm that based on our assessment of the breaches, our integrity and objectivity as auditor has not been compromised and we believe that an objective, reasonable and informed third party would conclude that the provision of these services would not impair our integrity or objectivity for any of the impacted financial years. The Audit and Risk Committee have concurred with this view.\n\nWe were first appointed as auditor by the shareholders for the year ended 31 March 2019. The period of total uninterrupted engagement is for the 5 financial years ended 31 March 2023.\n\nThe Group engagement partner is required to rotate every 5 years. As this is the fifth year of John Luke's involvement in the Group audit, he will be required to rotate off after the FY23 audit. The Audit and Risk Committee has confirmed Jon Mills as his successor.\n\nThe average tenure of partners responsible for component audits as set out in section 7 below is 3 years.\n\n| Total audit fee                                               | \u00a319.8m       |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Audit related fees (including interim review)                 | \u00a32.6m        |\n| Other services                                                | \u00a30.1m        |\n| Non-audit fee as a % of total audit   and audit related fee % | 11.6%        |\n| Date first appointed                                          | 11 July 2018 |\n| Uninterrupted audit tenure                                    | 5 years      |\n| Next financial period which requires a tender                 | 2029         |\n| Tenure of Group engagement partner                            | 5 years      |\n| Average tenure of component signing partners                  | 3 years      |\n\n## Materiality\n\n## (Item 6 below)\n\nThe scope of our work is influenced by our view of materiality and our assessed risk of material misstatement.\n\nGroup Materiality is determined with reference to a benchmark of Group profit before tax normalised by adding back the oneoff operating cost arising from the BT Sport disposal (FY22: normalised by averaging over the last 5 years due to fluctuations as a result of Covid-19). We have determined overall materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole at \u00a395m (FY22: \u00a3100m) and for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole at \u00a390m (FY22: \u00a395m).",

        "page_content": "Consistent with FY22, we determined that normalised profit before tax remains the benchmark for the Group as BT Group plc is publicly traded and a profit seeking entity and the profitability and prospects for future net cash inflows is important to the users of the financial statements. In FY22, we determined normalised profit before tax by averaging over the last 5 years due to fluctuations as a result of Covid-19. Users including existing and potential investors and analysts are interested in this metric as it shows the company profitability from its operations. As such, we based our Group Materiality on normalised profit before tax, of which it represents 4.95% (FY22: 4.4%).\n\nMateriality for the Parent Company financial statements was determined with reference to a benchmark of Parent Company Total Assets of which it represents 0.80% (FY22: 0.80%).\n\n## Materiality levels used in our audit\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGroup\n\nGroup Materiality\n\nGPM\n\nGroup Performance Materiality\n\nHCM\n\nHighest Component Materiality\n\nPCM\n\nParent Company Materiality\n\nLCM\n\nLowest Component Materiality\n\nAMPT\n\nAudit Misstatement Posting Threshold\n\n## Group scope\n\n## (Item 7 below)\n\nWe have performed risk assessment and planning procedures to determine which of the Group's components are likely to include risks of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, the type of procedures to be performed at these components and the extent of involvement required from our component auditor.\n\nThe total number of components in scope for FY23 is three, reduced from four from FY22. The decrease is due to the exclusion of BT Italy and BT America, which comprise 0.8% and 2.6% respectively of the group's FY23 revenue and 1.86% in aggregate of the group's normalised profit before tax and the inclusion of Openreach Limited. The below factors were considered before reaching a judgement to remove the two components from the Group audit scope:\n\n- -  Reduction in the size and complexity of the underlying operations of the business, which is partly attributable to the recent divestment activities in the BT Italy and BT America components\n- -  Audit evidence obtained from procedures performed in the prior year shows both components have a reducing risk profile in terms of errors and fraud.\n\nThe components within the scope of our work accounted for the percentages illustrated below.\n\nIn addition, we have performed group level analysis on the remaining components to determine whether further risks of material misstatement exist in those components.\n\nWe consider the scope of our audit, as communicated to the Audit and Risk Committee, to be an appropriate basis for our audit opinion.\n\n## Coverage of Group financial statements\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## The impact of climate change on our audit\n\nIn planning our audit, we considered the potential impacts of climate change on the Group's business and its financial statements.\n\nThe Group has pledged in the Strategic report to be a net-zero business by 2030 and has also outlined several shorter-term climate change targets. Furthermore, the Group has mentioned its commitment to implementing the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). As a part of our audit, we have performed a risk assessment, including enquiries of management, to understand how the impact of commitments made by the Group in respect of climate change, as well as the physical and transition risks of climate change, may affect the financial statements and our audit.\n\nThe potential impacts of these matters relate to the forwardlooking estimates, which include projections for impairment assessment of goodwill, useful economic life of vehicle fleet and infrastructure impacting on future depreciation charges, and significant assumptions used in pension asset valuations. Taking into account our risk assessment procedures, the headroom on goodwill, the remaining useful economic lives of relevant assets and the nature of the assumptions used in the pension valuation, we have assessed that there is not a significant risk to the balances in the financial statements as a result of climate change. Therefore, there was no material impact on the Group's critical accounting estimates and our key audit matters.\n\nWe have read the disclosures of climate related information in the Annual Report and considered their consistency with the financial statements and our audit knowledge. We have not been engaged to provide assurance over the accuracy of the climate risk disclosures in the Annual Report.",

        "page_content": "## KPMG LLP's Independent Auditor's Report to the members of BT Group plc continued\n\n## 3. Going concern, viability and principal risks and uncertainties\n\nThe Directors have prepared the financial statements on the going concern basis as they do not intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease their operations, and as they have concluded that the Group's and the Parent Company's financial position means that this is realistic. They have also concluded that there are no material uncertainties that could have cast significant doubt over their ability to continue as a going concern for at least a year from the date of approval of the financial statements ('the going concern period').\n\n## Going concern\n\nWe used our knowledge of the Group, its industry, and the general economic environment to identify the inherent risks to its business model and analysed how those risks might affect the Group's and Company's financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. The risks that we considered most likely to adversely affect the Group's and Company's available financial resources over this period were:\n\n- -  The impact of rising energy prices, supply shortages, and inflationary pressures;\n- -  The impact of significant supply chain disruptions driven by geo-political factors;\n- -  The impact of plans to deliver new initiatives required to meet savings commitments not being mobilised and executed;\n- -  The impact of an increased level of financial market volatility and deterioration of BT's covenant triggers on the funding obligation of the BT Pension Scheme;\n- -  The likelihood of existing legal matters/claims crystallising within the going concern period.\n\nWe also considered less predictable but realistic second order impacts, such as a large scale cyber breach or adverse changes to telecoms regulation, which could result in a rapid reduction of available financial resources.\n\nWe considered whether these risks could plausibly affect the liquidity in the going concern period by comparing severe but plausible downside scenarios that could arise from these risks individually and collectively against the level of available financial resources indicated by the Group's financial forecasts.\n\nOur procedures also included an assessment of whether the going concern disclosure in note 1 to the financial statements gives a complete and accurate description of the Directors' assessment of going concern.\n\nAccordingly, based on those procedures, we found the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting without any material uncertainty for the Group and Parent Company to be acceptable. However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Group or the Parent Company will continue in operation.\n\n## Our conclusions\n\n- -  We consider that the Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the Group and Parent Company's financial statements is appropriate;\n- -  We have not identified, and concur with the Directors' assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group's or Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period;\n- -  We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors' statement in note 1 to the financial statements\n\non the use of the going concern basis of accounting with no material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt over the Group and Parent Company's use of that basis for the going concern period, and we found the going concern disclosure in note 1 to be acceptable; and\n\n- -  The related statement under the Listing Rules set out on page 132 is materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\n## Disclosures of emerging and principal risks and longer-term viability\n\n## Our responsibility\n\nWe are required to perform procedures to identify whether there is a material inconsistency between the Directors' disclosures in respect of emerging and principal risks and the Viability statement, and the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\nBased on those procedures, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:\n\n- -  the Directors' confirmation within the Viability statement on page 81 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity;\n- -  the Principal Risks and Uncertainties disclosures describing these risks and how emerging risks are identified and explaining how they are being managed and mitigated; and\n- -  the Directors' explanation in the Viability statement of how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they considered that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.\n\nWe are also required to review the Viability statement set out on page 81 under the Listing Rules.\n\nOur work is limited to assessing these matters in the context of only the knowledge acquired during our financial statements audit. As we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the absence of anything to report on these statements is not a guarantee as to the Group's and Parent Company's longer-term viability.\n\n## Our reporting\n\nWe have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to these disclosures.\n\nWe have concluded that these disclosures are materially consistent with the financial statements and our audit knowledge.\n\n## 4. Key audit matters\n\n## What we mean\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by us, including those which had the greatest effect on:\n\n- -  the overall audit strategy;\n- -  the allocation of resources in the audit; and\n- -  directing the efforts of the engagement team.\n\nWe include below the Key Audit Matters (KAM) in decreasing order of audit significance together with our key audit procedures",

These matters were addressed, and our results are based on procedures undertaken, for the purpose of our audit of the financial statements as a whole. We do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## 4.1 Disposal of BT Sport and re-investment in Sports JV\n\n## Financial Statement Elements\n\nAt the date of disposal\n\n| Profit on disposal after tax                               | \u00a328m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Joint ventures and associates                              | \u00a3414m  |\n| Other Payables - Minimum guarantee from BT Sport  Disposal | \u00a3712m  |\n\n## Our assessment of risk vs FY22\n\n## Our results\n\n## FY23: Acceptable\n\nFY22: N/A\n\n## Description of the Key Audit Matter\n\n## Accounting Judgement and Subjective Valuation\n\nBT have classified the Sports JV ('JV') as a joint venture and have therefore deconsolidated BT Sport from the group as described in note 25.\n\n## Assessment of joint control\n\nThere is significant judgement involved in determining joint control due to the complex structure of the transaction. This includes the unequal size of businesses contributed to the JV by BT and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and the unequal split of cash distribution during the first four years of operation.\n\n## Valuation of BT's equity interest in the JV and the offmarket element of the minimum guarantee contract with JV\n\nThere is significant estimation uncertainty over the valuation of consideration on the disposal in relation to two main areas which have initially been recognised at fair value.\n\nThe valuation of BT's equity interest in the JV as described in note 23. A change in the methodology applied or a small change in key assumptions around forecast cashflows, exit multiple or discount rate can significantly impact the valuation.\n\nThe valuation of the off-market element of the wholesale distribution minimum guarantee contract between BT and the JV. A small change in the assumption of market price or market minimum volume commitment can significantly impact the valuation as described in note 23.\n\n## Overall assessment\n\nDue to the level of judgement and estimation uncertainty in relation to the BT Sport disposal as a whole, there is increased susceptibility to management bias, resulting in a significant risk of fraud or error.\n\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the profit on disposal has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount. The financial statements (note 23) disclose the sensitivity estimated by the Group.\n\n## Our response to the risk\n\nOur procedures to address the risk included:\n\n## Assessment of joint control\n\nOur accounting expertise: We evaluated and challenged the assessment of control with reference to IFRS 10 by taking into account a number of operational, economic and legal factors including:\n\n- -  Jointly controlled board and voting rights and pre-agreed business plan\n- -  Unequal value of business contributed and unequal exposure to variable returns\n- -  WBD's options to purchase BT's shares at set points in the first 4 years and its interaction with the timing of key decisions over material activities of the JV.\n\nInspection of transaction documents: We inspected legal agreements between BT, WBD and the JV, including the Joint Venture agreement, master service agreement and loan facility documents.\n\n## Valuation of BT's equity interest in the JV\n\nOur valuation expertise: We challenged, with the support of our own valuation specialists, the valuation methodology applied including developing our own independent assessment of key assumptions including, the determination of comparator group of companies, discount rate and multiple applied.\n\nBenchmarking assumptions: We challenged the accuracy of cashflow forecasts, including any growth rates and risk adjustments applied with reference to historic trends in the industry and wider economic forecasts. We inspected and challenged sensitivity analysis over the forecasts by considering plausible downside scenarios, including the impact of the ongoing economic downturn and the potential loss of key sports rights.\n\nTest of details: We compared forecast cashflows with contractual arrangements in place over revenues and costs.\n\nHistorical comparisons: We compared historic results such as subscriber numbers and revenues to underlying data sources and compared historic trends with those forecast.\n\nRe-performance: We inspected valuation calculations and recalculated for mathematical accuracy and internal consistency.\n\nSensitivity analysis: We performed sensitivity analysis on key assumptions of forecast cashflows, exit multiple and discount rate applied.\n\n## Valuation of the off-market element of the minimum guarantee contract with JV\n\nBenchmarking assumptions: We compared the Group's estimate of a market price and market volume commitment to contractual evidence from other market participants recent and historic transactions with BT or the Sports Joint Venture.\n\nComparing valuations: We developed an independent expectation of the range of fair values based on the limited evidence of market pricing available. In doing so, we considered the relevance and reliability of alternative price points, giving more weight to external evidence. Having found the estimate to be at the high end of the range we consider to be acceptable, we exercised judgement to determine the acceptability of the amount recognised, taking into account the limited number of market participants, and the clarity of the associated disclosure of estimation uncertainty.",

We also assessed whether the key judgements in respect of deconsolidation were appropriately disclosed.\n\nWe performed the detailed tests above rather than seeking to rely on any of the Group's controls because our knowledge of the design of these controls indicated that we would not be able to obtain the required evidence to support reliance on controls.\n\n## Communications with BT Group plc's Audit and Risk Committee\n\nOur discussions with and reporting to the Audit and Risk Committee included:\n\n- -  Our definition of the KAM and related audit approach.\n- -  Our assessment of the key judgments impacting the control assessment including the timing of key decisions over material activities in the JV and their interaction with WBD's options to purchase the business and the unequal contributions and cash distributions during the first four years.\n- -  Our assessment of the key valuation judgements over BT's equity interest in the JV including key assumptions over the cashflow forecasts, discount rate and EBITDA multiples, and our acceptable range of possible outcomes.\n- -  Our assessment of the key estimates within the valuation of the minimum guarantee contract with the JV including the key assumptions of market price and related market volume commitment, and our acceptable range of possible outcomes.\n- -  Our assessment of management bias in the preparation of the estimate.\n- -  Our assessment of the adequacy of the proposed disclosures.\n\n## Areas of particular auditor judgement\n\nWe identified the following as the areas of particular auditor judgement:\n\n- -  A number of factors formed part of the control assessment. Taken individually these factors could result in a different outcome, so significant judgement was required to assess the different factors, before weighting them and reaching an overall conclusion.\n- -  The appropriateness of the valuation of BT's equity interest in the Joint Venture, particularly the selection of comparable market data inputs and valuation model. The balance is sensitive to a number of assumptions and the overall estimate could fall within a range of reasonable amounts.\n- -  The appropriateness of the valuation of the off-market element of the minimum guarantee contract with the JV given the limited number of market based valuation points. Having found the estimate of the off-market element of the minimum guarantee contract with the JV to be at the high end of the range we consider\n\nto be acceptable, we exercised judgement to determine the acceptability of the amount recognised, taking into account the clarity of the associated disclosure and potential for management bias due to the impact on future reported underlying profit.\n\n## Our results\n\nWe found the Group's classification of the JV as a joint venture to be acceptable. We found the estimate of consideration, related balance sheet amounts and recognised profit on disposal to be acceptable.\n\n## Further information in the Annual Report and Accounts\n\nSee the Audit and Risk Committee Report on page 103 for details on how the Audit and Risk Committee considered the Disposal of BT Sport and Re-investment in the Sports JV as an area of significant attention, and note 23 and 25 for the accounting policy on divestments and joint ventures and financial disclosures.\n\n## 4.2 Valuation of unquoted investments in the BT pension scheme (group)\n\n## Financial Statement Elements\n\n|                                                      | FY23    | FY22    |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Certain unquoted investments in the                  |         |         |\n| BTPS: included within the unquoted BTPS  plan assets | \u00a316.4bn | \u00a318.6bn |\n\n## Our assessment of risk vs FY22\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Decreased                                                |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Refer to pages 190 to 200 (financial disclosures note 20 |\n| Defined Benefit Obligation)                              |\n\n## Our results\n\n## FY23: Acceptable\n\nFY22: Acceptable\n\n## Description of the Key Audit Matter\n\n## Subjective Valuation\n\nThe BTPS has unquoted plan assets in property, mature infrastructure assets and a longevity insurance contract which are classified as fair value level three assets.\n\nSignificant judgement is required to determine the value of a portion of these unquoted investments, which are valued based on inputs that are not directly observable. BT engage valuation experts to value these assets.\n\nThe key unobservable inputs used to determine the fair value of these plan assets includes estimated rental value and price inflation (for properties), discount rates and comparable transactions (for mature infrastructure assets), discount rate, model and projected future mortality (for the longevity insurance contract).\n\nThe effect of these matters is that, as part of our risk assessment, we determined that the valuation of unquoted plan assets in the BTPS has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than our materiality for the financial statements as a whole, and possibly many times that amount.\n\nThe financial statements (note 20) disclose as part of sensitivities of growth assets the key sensitivities of key assumptions for the valuation of unquoted plan assets.\n\nThe valuation risk arising from private equity, secure income and non-core credit assets has decreased on the prior year as the impact of geo-political events is now embedded in market valuations and is no longer considered a significant risk for our audit.",

The Group operates a number of distinct billing systems and the IT landscape underpinning revenue and linking the billing systems together is complex.\n\nThere are multiple products sold at multiple rates with varying price structures in place. Products represent a combination of service based products, such as fixed line telephony, as well as goods, such as the provision of mobile handsets. There are monthly tariff charges.\n\nThe revenue recognition of non-long-term contract revenue is not subject to significant judgement. However, due to the large number of transactions and complexity of the billing systems, this is considered to be an area of most significance in our audit.\n\n## Our response to the risk\n\nOur procedures to address the risk included:\n\nProcess Understanding: Obtaining an understanding of the revenue processes by observing transactions from customer initiation to cash received for certain revenue streams.\n\nTest of Detail: Comparing a sample of revenue transactions, including credit notes, to supporting evidence e.g., customer bills, orders, price lists and cash received (all where applicable). We performed an assessment of whether the overstatements of revenue identified through these procedures were material, taking into account findings from other areas of the audit and qualitative aspects of the financial statements as a whole.\n\nWe performed the detailed tests above rather than seeking to rely on the Group's controls because our knowledge of the design of these controls indicated that we would be unlikely to obtain the required evidence to support reliance on controls.\n\n## Communications with the BT Group plc's Audit and Risk Committee\n\nOur discussions with and reporting to the Audit and Risk Committee included:\n\n- -  Our definition of the Key Audit Matter and our audit approach, including the extent of our planned control reliance.\n- -  The findings from our substantive testing.

However, due to their materiality in the context of the parent company financial statements, this is considered to be the area that had the greatest effect on our overall parent company audit.\n\n## Our response to the risk\n\nOur procedures to address the risk included:\n\nTest of Detail: Comparing the carrying amount of the parent company's investment with the relevant subsidiary balance sheet to identify whether its net assets, being an approximation of their minimum recoverable amount, was in excess of its carrying amount and assessing whether that subsidiary group has historically been profit-making.\n\nComparing valuations: Comparing the carrying amount of the parent company's investment and loans to Group undertakings, with the market capitalisation of the Group.\n\nWe performed the tests above rather than seeking to rely on any of the Company's controls because the nature of the balance is such that we would expect to obtain audit evidence primarily through the detailed procedures described.\n\n## Communications with the BT Group plc's Audit and Risk Committee\n\nOur discussions with and reporting to the Audit and Risk Committee included our definition of the Key Audit Matter and our findings.\n\n## Areas of particular auditor judgement\n\nWe did not identify any areas of particular auditor judgement.\n\n## Our results\n\nWe found the carrying amounts of the investment in subsidiary to be acceptable (2022: acceptable).\n\n## Further information in the Annual Report and Accounts\n\nRefer to page 226 for the accounting policy on Investment in Subsidiaries Undertakings and page 227 for the financial disclosures.\n\n## 5. Our ability to detect irregularities, and our response\n\n## Fraud - identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement due to fraud\n\n## Fraud risk assessment\n\nTo identify risks of material misstatement due to fraud ('fraud risks') we assessed events or conditions that could indicate an incentive or pressure to commit fraud or provide an opportunity to commit fraud. Our risk assessment procedures included:\n\n- -  enquiring of Directors, the Audit and Risk Committee, internal audit and inspection of policy documentation as to the Group's high-level policies and procedures to prevent and detect fraud, including the internal audit function, and the Group's channel for 'whistleblowing', as well as whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud;\n- -  reading Board, Remuneration Committee and Executive Committee minutes;\n- -  considering significant unusual transactions, such as the BT Sport disposal;\n\n- -  considering remuneration incentive schemes and performance targets for management and Directors including the EPS target for management remuneration;\n- -  using analytical procedures to identify any unusual or unexpected relationships.\n\n## Risk communications\n\nWe communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group to full scope component audit teams of relevant fraud risks identified at the Group level and request to full scope component audit teams to report to the Group audit team any instances of fraud that could give rise to a material misstatement at Group.\n\n## Fraud risks\n\nAs required by auditing standards, and taking into account possible pressures to meet profit targets, recent revisions to guidance and our overall knowledge of the control environment, we performed procedures to address the risk of management override of controls, in particular the risk that Group and component management may be in a position to make inappropriate accounting entries.\n\nOn this audit we do not believe there is a fraud risk related to revenue recognition because non-long-term contract revenues are not judgemental and consist of a high number of low value transactions, and long-term contracts are generally low in complexity with most having a revenue recognition profile aligned to billing.\n\nWe also identified a fraud risk related to the BT Sport disposal in response to possible pressures to meet strategic objectives and future profit targets.\n\n## Procedures to address fraud risks\n\nIn determining the audit procedures, we took into account the results of our evaluation and test of operating effectiveness of some of the Group-wide fraud risk management controls.\n\n## We also performed procedures including:\n\n- -  identifying journal entries to test for all full scope components based on risk criteria and comparing the identified entries to supporting documentation. These included those posted by senior finance management, those posted and approved by the same user and those posted to unusual or seldom used accounts;\n- -  assessing whether the judgements made in making accounting estimates are indicative of a potential bias;\n- -  evaluating the business purpose for significant unusual transactions\n\n## Laws and regulations - identifying and responding to risks of material misstatement relating to compliance with laws and regulations\n\n## Laws and regulations risk assessment\n\nWe identified areas of laws and regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the financial statements from our general commercial and sector experience, through discussion with the Directors and other management (as required by auditing standards), and from inspection of the Group's regulatory and legal correspondence and discussed with the Directors and other management the policies and procedures regarding compliance with laws and regulations.\n\nAs the Group is regulated, our assessment of risks involved gaining an understanding of the control environment including the Group's procedures for complying with regulatory requirements.",

        "page_content": "## KPMG LLP's Independent Auditor's Report to the members of BT Group plc continued\n\n## Risk communications\n\nWe communicated identified laws and regulations throughout our team and remained alert to any indications of non-compliance throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group to full-scope component audit teams of relevant laws and regulations identified at the Group level, and a request for full scope component auditors to report to the Group team any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement at Group.\n\nThe potential effect of these laws and regulations on the financial statements varies considerably.\n\n## Direct laws context and link to audit\n\nFirstly, the Group is subject to laws and regulations that directly affect the financial statements including financial reporting legislation (including related companies legislation), distributable profits legislation, taxation legislation, and pension legislation and we assessed the extent of compliance with these laws and regulations as part of our procedures on the related financial statement items.\n\n## Most significant indirect law/ regulation areas\n\nSecondly, the Group is subject to many other laws and regulations where the consequences of non-compliance could have a material effect on amounts or disclosures in the financial statements, for instance through the imposition of fines or litigation or the loss of the Group's licence to operate. We identified the following areas as those most likely to have such an effect: anti-bribery, regulations affecting telecommunication providers (including compliance with Ofcom regulation), and certain aspects of company legislation recognising the nature of the Group's activities and its legal form.\n\nAuditing standards limit the required audit procedures to identify non-compliance with these laws and regulations to enquiry of the Directors and other management and inspection of regulatory and legal correspondence, if any. Therefore if a breach of operational regulations is not disclosed to us or evident from relevant correspondence, an audit will not detect that breach.\n\n## Known actual or suspected matters\n\nFor the legal matters discussed in note 19 we assessed disclosures against our understanding from legal correspondence.\n\n## Significant actual or suspected breaches discussed with ARC\n\nWe discussed with the Audit and Risk Committee other matters related to actual or suspected breaches of laws or regulations, for which disclosure is not necessary, and considered any implications for our audit.\n\n## Context\n\n## Context of the ability of the audit to detect fraud or breaches of law or regulation\n\nOwing to the inherent limitations of an audit, there is an unavoidable risk that we may not have detected some material misstatements in the financial statements, even though we have properly planned and performed our audit in accordance with auditing standards. For example, the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely the inherently limited procedures required by auditing standards would identify it. In addition, as with any audit, there remained a higher risk of non-detection of fraud, as these may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls. Our audit procedures are designed to detect material misstatement. We are not responsible for preventing non-compliance or fraud and cannot be expected to detect non-compliance with all laws and regulations.\n\n## 6. Our determination of materiality\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set quantitative thresholds and overlay qualitative considerations to help us determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our procedures, and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in the aggregate, on the financial statements as a whole.\n\n## \u00a395m (FY22: \u00a3100m)\n\n## Materiality for the group financial statements as a whole\n\n## What we mean\n\nA quantitative reference for the purpose of planning and performing our audit.\n\n## Basis for determining materiality and judgements applied\n\nMateriality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at \u00a395m (FY22: \u00a3100m). This was determined with reference to a benchmark of normalised profit before tax.\n\nConsistent with FY22, we determined that normalised profit before tax remains the main benchmark for the Group as BT Group plc is publicly traded and a profit seeking entity and the profitability and prospects for future net cash inflows is important to the users of the financial statements. Users including existing and potential investors and analysts are interested in this metrics as it shows the company profitability from its operations.\n\nWe normalised by adding back adjustments that do not represent the normal, continuing operations of the Group. The items we adjusted for were BT Sport related items as disclosed in note 9. As such, we based our Group materiality on Group normalised profit before tax of \u00a31.905bn. In FY22, we determined normalised profit before tax of \u00a32.265bn by averaging over the last 5 years due to fluctuations as a result of Covid-19.\n\nOur Group materiality of \u00a395m was determined by applying a percentage to the normalised profit before tax. When using a benchmark of normalised profit before tax to determine overall materiality, KPMG's approach for listed entities considers a guideline range 3% - 5% of the measure. In setting overall Group materiality, we applied a percentage of 4.99% (FY22: 4.4%) to the benchmark.\n\nMateriality for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole was set at \u00a390m (FY22: \u00a395m), determined with reference to a benchmark of Parent Company Total Assets of which it represents 0.80% (FY22: 0.80%).\n\n## \u00a361.70m (FY22: \u00a365.00m)\n\n## Performance materiality\n\n## What we mean\n\nOur procedures on individual account balances and disclosures were performed to a lower threshold, performance materiality, so as to reduce to an acceptable level the risk that individually immaterial misstatements in individual account balances add up to a material amount across the financial statements as a whole.\n\n## Basis for determining performance materiality and judgements applied\n\nWe have considered performance materiality at a level of 65% (FY22: 65%) of materiality for BT Group plc Group financial statements as a whole to be appropriate.\n\nThe Parent Company performance materiality was set at \u00a358.5m (FY22: \u00a361.75m), which equates to 65% (FY22: 65%) of materiality for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole.",

The scope of our audit\n\n## Group scope\n\n## What we mean\n\nHow the Group audit team determined the procedures to be performed across the Group.\n\nThe Group has 226 (FY22: 234) reporting components. In order to determine the work performed at the reporting component level, we identified those components which we considered to be of individual financial significance, those which were significant due to risk and those remaining components on which we required procedures to be performed to provide us with the evidence we required in order to conclude on the group financial statements as a whole.\n\nWe determined individually financially significant components as those contributing at least 10% (FY22: 10%) of revenue or total assets. We selected revenue and total assets because these are the most representative of the relative size of the components. We identified 2 (FY22: 2) components as individually financially significant components and performed full scope audits on these components.\n\nIn addition, to enable us to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence for the group financial statements as a whole, we selected 1 component where we performed an audit of payroll account balances (2022: 2 components on which we performed full scope audits).\n\nThe components within the scope of our work accounted for the following percentages of the Group's results, with the prior year comparatives indicated in brackets:\n\n| Scope                      | Number of components   | Range of materiality applied   | Group revenue   | Group PBT   | Group total assets   |\n|----------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|----------------------|\n| Full scope audits          | 2 (4)                  | \u00a360m - \u00a380m (\u00a320m - \u00a385m)      | 86% (90%)       | 78% (83%)   | 90% (97%)            |\n| Audit of account  balances | 1 (0)                  | \u00a335m (\u00a3nil)                    | 0% (0%)         | 0% (0%)     | 0% (0%)              |\n\nFor the residual components, we performed analytical reviews at an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant risks of material misstatement within those.\n\nThe work on 1 of the 3 in scope components (2022: 1 of the 4 in scope components) was performed by component auditors and the rest, including the audit of the parent company, was performed by the Group team.\n\nThe Group audit team has also performed audit procedures on the following areas on behalf of the components:\n\n- -  Testing of IT Systems\n- -  Litigation and Claims\n\nThese items were audited by the Group team because of efficiency reasons, where the Group team has direct access to the underlying information. The Group team communicated the results of these procedures to the component teams.\n\nThe Group team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed above and the information to be reported back. The Group team approved the component materialities, as detailed in the table above, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group across the components.\n\nThe scope of the audit work performed was predominately substantive as we placed limited reliance upon the Group's internal control over financial reporting.\n\nThe Parent company audit was undertaken by the Group audit team.",

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nA fuller description of our responsibilities is provided on the FRC's website at www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities .\n\nThe Company is required to include these financial statements in an annual financial report prepared using the single electronic reporting format specified in the TD ESEF Regulation. This auditor's report provides no assurance over whether the annual financial report has been prepared in accordance with that format.\n\n## 10. The purpose of our audit work and to whom we owe our responsibilities\n\nThis report is made solely to the Company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company's members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\n## John Luke\n\nfor and on behalf of KPMG LLP, Statutory Auditor Chartered Accountants 15 Canada Square London E14 5GL\n\n17 May 2023",

In addition, on 29 January 2016, the company issued 1,594,900,429 ordinary shares of 5p at 470.7p per share. These shares were used as part consideration for the acquisition of EE. As a result of this transaction the merger reserve was credited with \u00a37,424m net of \u00a33m issue costs. In FY21, following settlement of intercompany loans by qualifying consideration of \u00a31,574m, equivalent balances were transferred from merger reserve to realised profit.\n\n- f In June 2021, BT exercised an option to purchase the minority shareholding in a subsidiary (BT Communications South Africa). The obligation to purchase the subsidiary's equity instruments is accounted for as a financial liability with a corresponding debit to equity. Non-controlling interests are not material to the group so are not accounted for separately.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements\n\n## 1. Basis of preparation\n\n## Preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.\n\nThis assessment is consistent with the assessment of our viability, as set out on pages 81 to 82, in estimating the financial impact of a severe but plausible outcome for each risk, both individually, in combination and through stochastic risk modelling. This stress testing confirmed that existing projected cash flows and cash management activities provide us with adequate headroom over the going concern assessment period.\n\nHaving assessed the principal and emerging risks, the directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting when preparing the group and parent company financial statements. This assessment covers the period to May 2024, which is consistent with the FRC guidance. When reaching this conclusion, the directors took into account the group's and parent company's overall financial position (including trading results and ability to repay term debt as it matures without recourse to refinancing) and the exposure to principal risks.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors have considered the impact of climate change, particularly in the context of the risks identified in the TCFD disclosure on pages 71 to 80 this year. There has been no material impact identified on the financial reporting judgements and estimates.\n\nThese financial statements consolidate BT Group plc, the parent company, and its subsidiaries (together the 'group', 'us', 'we' or 'our').\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for certain financial and equity instruments that have been measured at fair value. The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, the functional currency of BT Group plc.\n\nThese financial statements cover the financial year from 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 ('FY23'), with comparative figures for the financial year from 1 April 2021 to 31 March 2022 ('FY22').\n\n## New and amended accounting standards effective during the year\n\nThe following amended standards were effective during the year:\n\n## Amendments to IAS 37 for onerous contracts\n\nThe group adopted Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendments to IAS 37) from 1 April 2022. This resulted in a change in accounting policy for performing an onerous contracts assessment. Previously, only incremental costs to fulfil a contract were included when determining whether that contract was onerous. The revised policy is to include both incremental costs and an allocation of other costs directly attributable to the fulfilment of a contract.\n\nThe amendments apply prospectively to contracts existing at the date when the amendments are first applied. We analysed contracts existing at 1 April 2022 and identified the cumulative effect of applying the revised policy to be a \u00a312m increase in the onerous contract provision. This has been recorded as an opening balance adjustment to retained earnings. Comparative figures have not been restated.\n\n## IFRS Interpretations Committee agenda decisions\n\nThe IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) periodically issues agenda decisions which explain and clarify how to apply the principles and requirements of IFRS standards. Agenda decisions are authoritative and may require the group to revise accounting policies or practice to align with the interpretations set out in the decision.\n\nWe regularly review IFRIC updates and assess the impact of agenda decisions. The following were identified as being potentially significant to the group:\n\n## Demand Deposits with Restrictions on Use arising from a Contract with a Third Party\n\nIn its agenda decision, the IFRIC concluded that restrictions on the use of demand deposits arising from a contract with a third party do not result in the deposits being declassified as cash and cash equivalents, unless those restrictions change the nature of the deposit in a way such that it would no longer meet the definition of cash in IAS 7. Application of this agenda decision to deposits held by the group identified one bank account with restrictions on use that nonetheless meets the IAS 7 definition of cash. This bank account was subsequently recognised on the group balance sheet and is now reflected in the cash and cash equivalents balance presented throughout the financial statements. An equal and opposite amount was recognised in trade payables.\n\nThe balance on this account was \u00a396m at 31 March 2023 and \u00a3148m at 31 March 2022. Prior period comparatives have not been restated as the impact is not considered material, having regard to the fact that a corresponding liability is recognised within trade payables and therefore has no bearing on the group's net assets. The impact on the cash flow statement is not considered to be material and recognition of the balance is presented as an increase in trade and other payables. Cash flows relating to the account which have already been accounted for within normalised cash flow (including its initial recognition) will be excluded from this metric.\n\n## Other\n\nThe following changes have not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements:\n\n- -  Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use (Amendments to IAS 16)\n- -  Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018-2020\n- -  Reference to the Conceptual Framework - Amendments to IFRS 3\n\n## New and amended accounting standards that have been issued but are not yet effective\n\nThe following new or amended standards and interpretations are applicable in future periods:\n\n## IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts\n\nBT adopted IFRS 17 with retrospective application on 1 April 2023. It is therefore effective from FY24 onwards.\n\nThe standard establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts. The measurement method for insurance contracts required by IFRS 17 is a probability weighted discounted cash flow model, including a best estimate and an adjustment for non-financial risk calculated for groups of similar contracts.\n\nIFRS 17 primarily impacts insurance entities, however as it applies to individual contracts it is possible that non-insurers could issue contracts that are in scope of the standard such as product breakdown contracts or warranties.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 1. Basis of preparation continued\n\nWe have assessed the impact of the standard on the group and the BT Group plc legal entity, and concluded that its impact is not material. Contracts in scope of the standard entered into by the group are restricted to intragroup insurance arrangements, and the group does not issue external insurance contracts. Contracts in scope of the standard entered into by the BT Group plc legal entity are restricted to parent company guarantees, which we have assessed to have no material impact.\n\nThe following are not expected to have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements:\n\n- -  Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments to IAS 1)\n- -  Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2)\n- -  Definition of Accounting Estimate (Amendments to IAS 8)\n- -  Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12)\n- -  Non-Current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to IAS 1)\n- -  Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (Amendments to IFRS 16)\n\n## Presentation of specific items\n\nOur income statement and segmental analysis separately identify trading results before specific items ('adjusted'). The directors believe that presentation of our results in this way is relevant to an understanding of our financial performance, as specific items are identified by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.\n\nThis presentation is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board and the Executive Committee and assists in providing a meaningful analysis of our trading results. In determining whether an event or transaction is specific, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors such as the frequency or predictability of occurrence.\n\nSpecific items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Examples of charges or credits which meet the above definition include significant business restructuring programmes such as the current group-wide cost transformation and modernisation programme, acquisitions and disposals of businesses and investments, charges or credits relating to retrospective regulatory matters, property rationalisation programmes, significant out of period contract settlements, net interest on our pension obligation, and the impact of remeasuring deferred tax balances. In the event that other items meet the criteria, which are applied consistently from year to year, they are also treated as specific items. Any releases to provisions originally booked as a specific item are also classified as specific. Conversely, when a reversal occurs in relation to a prior year item not classified as specific, the reversal is not classified as specific in the current year.\n\nSpecific items for the current and prior year are disclosed in note 9.\n\n## 2. Critical & key accounting estimates and significant judgements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying our accounting policies. We continually evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgements based on available information and experience. As the use of estimates is inherent in financial reporting, actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\nOur critical accounting estimates are those estimates that carry a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. We also make other key estimates when preparing the financial statements, which, while not meeting the definition of a critical estimate, involve a higher degree of complexity and can reasonably be expected to be of relevance to a user of the financial statements. Management has discussed its critical and other key accounting estimates and associated disclosures with the Audit and Risk Committee .\n\nSignificant judgements are those made by management in applying our significant accounting policies that have a material impact on the amounts presented in the financial statements. We may exercise significant judgement in our critical and key accounting estimates.\n\nOur critical and key accounting estimates and significant judgements are described in the following notes to the financial statements. They can be identified by the following symbol .\n\n| Note                                                       | Critical  estimate   | Key   estimate   | Significant  judgement   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------|--------------------------|\n| 10.

        "page_content": "## 3. Significant accounting policies that apply to the overall financial statements\n\nThe significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are set out below. Other significant accounting policies applicable to a particular area are disclosed in the most relevant note. They can be identified by the following symbol  .\n\nWe have applied all policies consistently to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Basis of consolidation\n\nThe group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of BT Group plc and its subsidiaries, and include its share of the results of associates and joint ventures using the equity method of accounting. The group recognises its direct rights to (and its share of) jointly held assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations under the appropriate headings in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nAll business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired.\n\nA subsidiary is an entity that is controlled by another entity, known as the parent or investor. An investor controls an investee when the investor is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.\n\nNon-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries, which consist of the amounts of those interests at the date of the original business combination and non-controlling share of changes in equity since the date of the combination, are not material to the group's financial statements.\n\nThe results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are consolidated from and up to the date of change of control. Where necessary, accounting policies of subsidiaries have been aligned with the policies adopted by the group. All intra-group transactions including any gains or losses, balances, income or expenses are eliminated on consolidation.\n\nWhen the group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on disposal is calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities of the subsidiary and any non-controlling interests. The profit or loss on disposal is recognised as a specific item.\n\nAssociates are those entities in which the group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating policies.\n\nA joint venture is an arrangement in which the group has joint control, whereby the group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the activities that significantly affect the returns of the arrangement require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.\n\nInterests in associates and joint ventures are initially recognised at cost (including transaction costs) except where they relate to a retained non-controlling interest in a former subsidiary, which is initially recognised at a deemed cost being the fair value of the retained interest. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated financial statements include the group's share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of equity-accounted investees, until the date on which significant influence or joint control ceases.\n\n## Inventories\n\nNetwork maintenance equipment and equipment to be sold to customers are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value, taking into account expected revenue from the sale of packages comprising a mobile handset and a subscription. Cost corresponds to purchase or production cost determined by either the first in first out (FIFO) or average cost method.\n\n## Government grants\n\nGovernment grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions associated with the grants have been complied with and the grants will be received.\n\nGrants for the purchase or production of property, plant and equipment are deducted from the cost of the related assets and reduce future depreciation expense accordingly. Grants for the reimbursement of operating expenditure are deducted from the related category of costs in the income statement. Estimates and judgements applied in accounting for government grants received in respect of Building Digital UK (BDUK) and other rural superfast broadband contracts are described in note 14.\n\nOnce a government grant is recognised, any related deferred income is treated in accordance with IAS 20 'Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance'.\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. The functional currency of the group is sterling. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of transactions and the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at period end exchange rates are recognised in the income statement line which most appropriately reflects the nature of the item or transaction.\n\nOn consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign undertakings are translated into sterling at year end exchange rates. The results of foreign undertakings are translated into sterling at the rates prevailing on the transaction dates. Foreign exchange differences arising on the retranslation of foreign undertakings are recognised directly in a separate component of equity, the translation reserve.\n\nIn the event of the disposal of an undertaking with assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency, the cumulative translation difference associated with the undertaking in the translation reserve is charged or credited to the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the income statement.\n\n## Research and development\n\nResearch expenditure is recognised in the income statement in the period in which it is incurred. Development expenditure, including the cost of internally developed software, is recognised in the income statement in the period in which it is incurred unless it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the group from the asset being developed, the cost of the asset can be reliably measured and technical feasibility can be demonstrated, in which case it is capitalised as an intangible asset on the balance sheet.\n\nCapitalisation ceases when the asset being developed is ready for use. Research and development costs include direct and indirect labour, materials and directly attributable overheads.\n\n## Termination benefits\n\nTermination benefits (leaver costs) are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or when an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits. We recognise termination benefits when they are demonstrably committed to the affected employees leaving the group.",

Segment information\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to segment information\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Operating and reportable segments\n\nOur operating segments are reported based on financial information provided to the Executive Committee , which is the key management committee and represents the 'chief operating decision maker'.\n\nOur organisational structure reflects the different customer groups to which we provide communications products and services via our customer-facing units (CFUs). The CFUs are our reportable segments and generate substantially all of our revenue.\n\nWith effect from 1 January 2023 we formed the new Business unit, but its components, Global and Enterprise, continued to be managed separately and reported separately to the Executive Committee . At 31 March 2023 the group had four CFUs: Consumer, Enterprise, Global and Openreach. From 1 April 2023 Business will be a single unit and financial information for this unit will be provided to the Executive Committee on a consolidated basis only. From FY24 our CFUs will be Business, Consumer and Openreach.\n\nThe CFUs are supported by technology units (TUs) comprising Digital and Networks; and corporate units (CUs) including procurement and property management. TUs and CUs are not reportable segments as they did not meet the quantitative thresholds as set out in IFRS 8 'Operating Segments' for any of the years presented.\n\nWe aggregate the remaining operations and include within the 'Other' category to reconcile to the consolidated results of the group. The 'Other' category includes unallocated TU costs and our CUs.\n\n## Allocation of certain items to segments\n\nProvisions for the settlement of significant legal, commercial and regulatory disputes, which are negotiated at a group level, are initially recorded in the 'Other' segment. On resolution of the dispute, the full impact is recognised in the results of the relevant CFU and offset in the group results through the utilisation of the provision previously charged to the 'Other' segment. Settlements which are particularly significant or cover more than one financial year may fall within the definition of specific items as detailed in note 9.\n\nThe costs incurred by TUs and CUs are recharged to the CFUs to reflect the services provided to them. Depreciation and amortisation incurred by TUs in relation to the networks and systems they manage and operate on behalf of the CFUs is allocated to the CFUs based on their respective utilisation. Capital expenditure incurred by TUs for specific projects undertaken on behalf of the CFUs is allocated based on the value of the directly attributable expenditure incurred. Where projects are not directly attributable to a particular CFU, capital expenditure is allocated between them based on the proportion of estimated future economic benefits.\n\nSpecific items are detailed in note 9 and are not allocated to the reportable segments as this reflects how they are reported to the Executive Committee . Finance expense and income are not allocated to the reportable segments, as the central treasury function manages this activity, together with the overall net debt position of the group.\n\n## Measuring segment performance\n\nPerformance of each reportable segment is measured based on adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as the group profit or loss before specific items, net finance expense, taxation, depreciation and amortisation and share of post tax profits or losses of associates and joint ventures. Adjusted EBITDA is considered to be a useful measure of the operating performance of the CFUs because it approximates the underlying operating cash flow by eliminating depreciation and amortisation and also provides a meaningful analysis of trading performance by excluding specific items, which are disclosed separately by virtue of their size, nature or incidence. We also increasingly track adjusted operating profit which reflects the growing depreciation expense arising from our elevated network investment.\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nOur revenue recognition policy is set out in Note 5.\n\n## Internal revenue and costs\n\nMost of our internal trading relates to Openreach and arises on rentals, and any associated connection or migration charges, of the UK access lines and other network products to the other CFUs, including the use of BT Ireland's network. This occurs both directly, and also indirectly, through TUs which are included within the 'Other' segment. Enterprise internal revenue arises from Consumer for mobile Ethernet access and TUs for transmission planning services. Internal revenue arising in Consumer relates primarily to employee broadband and wi-fi services. Intra-group revenue generated from the sale of regulated products and services is based on market price. Intra-group revenue from the sale of other products and services is agreed between the relevant CFUs and therefore the profitability of CFUs may be impacted by transfer pricing levels.\n\n## Geographic segmentation\n\nThe UK is our country of domicile and is where we generate the majority of our revenue from external UK customers. The geographic analysis of revenue is based on the country in which the customer is invoiced. The geographic analysis of non-current assets, which excludes derivative financial instruments, investments, preference shares in joint ventures, retirement benefit schemes in surplus and deferred tax assets, is based on the location of the assets.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 5. Revenue continued\n\nWe recognise revenue based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Determining the standalone selling price often requires judgement and may be derived from regulated prices, list prices, a cost-plus derived price or the price of similar products when sold on a standalone basis by BT or a competitor. In some cases it may be appropriate to use the contract price when this represents a bespoke price that would be the same for a similar customer in a similar circumstance.\n\nThe fixed access and mobile subscription arrangements sold by our Consumer business are typically payable in advance, with any variable or one-off charges billed in arrears. Contracts are largely inflation-linked with price increases recognised when effective. Payment is received immediately for direct sales of equipment to customers. Where equipment is provided to customers under mobile and fixed access subscription arrangements, payment for the equipment is received over the course of the contract term. For sales by our enterprise businesses, invoices are issued in line with contractual terms. Payments received in advance are recognised as contract liabilities; amounts billed in arrears are recognised as contract assets.\n\nWe are applying the practical expedient to recognise revenue 'as-invoiced' for certain fixed access and mobile subscription services revenues. Where we have a right to invoice at an amount that directly corresponds with performance to date, we recognise revenue at that amount. We have also adopted the practical expedient not to calculate the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to the performance obligations that are unsatisfied for these contracts.\n\nWe do not have any material obligations in respect of returns, refunds or warranties. Where we act as an agent in a transaction, such as insurance services offered, we recognise commission net of directly attributable costs. Where the actual and estimated costs to completion of the contract exceed the estimated revenue, a loss is recognised immediately.\n\nWe exercise judgement in assessing whether the initial set-up, transition and transformation phases of long-term contracts are distinct from the other services to be delivered under the contract and therefore represent distinct performance obligations. This determines whether revenue is recognised in the early stages of the contract, or deferred until delivery of the other services promised in the contract begins.\n\nWe recognise immediately the entire estimated loss for a contract when we have evidence that the contract is unprofitable. If these estimates indicate that any contract will be less profitable than previously forecast, contract assets may have to be written down to the extent they are no longer considered to be fully recoverable. We perform ongoing profitability reviews of our contracts in order to determine whether the latest estimates are appropriate. Key factors reviewed include:\n\n- -  Transaction volumes or other inputs affecting future revenues which can vary depending on customer requirements, plans, market position and other factors such as general economic conditions.\n- -  Our ability to achieve key contract milestones connected with the transition, development, transformation and deployment phases for customer contracts.\n- -  The status of commercial relations with customers and the implications for future revenue and cost projections.\n- -  Our estimates of future staff and third party costs and the degree to which cost savings and efficiencies are deliverable.\n\n## Revenue from lease arrangements in scope of IFRS 16\n\nSome consumer broadband and TV products and arrangements to provide external communications providers with exclusive use of Openreach's fixed-network telecommunications infrastructure meet the definition of operating leases under IFRS 16.\n\nAt inception of a contract, we determine whether the contract is, or contains, a lease following the accounting policy set out in note 15. Arrangements meeting the definition of a lease in which we act as lessor are classified as operating or finance leases at lease inception based on an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case then the lease is a finance lease; if not, it is an operating lease. For sub-leases, we make this assessment by reference to the characteristics of the right-of-use asset associated with the head lease rather than the underlying leased asset.\n\nIncome from arrangements classified as operating leases is presented as revenue where it relates to our core operating activities, for example leases of fixed-line telecommunications infrastructure to external communications providers and leases of devices to consumer customers as part of fixed access subscription products. Operating lease income from other arrangements is presented within other operating income (note 6).\n\nWe recognise operating lease payments as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any upfront payments received, such as connection fees, are deferred over the lease term. Determining the lease term is subject to the significant judgements set out in note 15.\n\nWhere the contract contains both lease and non-lease components, the transaction price is allocated between the components on the basis of relative standalone selling price.\n\nWhere an arrangement is assessed as a finance lease we derecognise the underlying asset and recognise a receivable equivalent to the net investment in the lease. Finance lease receivables are presented in note 17. The receivable is measured based on future payments to be received discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, adjusted for any direct costs. Any difference between the derecognised asset and the finance lease receivable is recognised in the income statement. Where the nature of services delivered relates to our core operating activities it is presented as revenue. Where it relates to non-core activities it is presented within other operating income (note 6).",

See note 9.\n\nRevenue expected to be recognised in future periods for performance obligations that are not complete (or are partially complete) as at 31 March 2023 is \u00a312,792m (FY22: \u00a313,502m). Of this, \u00a36,592m (FY22: \u00a37,108m) relates to ICT and managed services contracts and equipment and other services which will substantially be recognised as revenue within three years. Fixed access and mobile subscription services typically have shorter contract periods and so \u00a36,200m (FY22: \u00a36,394m) will substantially be recognised as revenue within two years.\n\nRevenue recognised this year relating to performance obligations that were satisfied, or partially satisfied, in previous years was not material. Revenue related to customers' unexercised rights (for example, unused amounts on prepaid SIM cards) was not material.\n\n## Lease income\n\nPresented within revenue is \u00a32,909m (FY22: \u00a32,745m) income from arrangements classified as operating leases under IFRS 16 and which represent core business activities for the group. Income relates predominantly to Openreach's leases of fixed-line telecommunications infrastructure to external communications providers, classified as fixed access subscription revenue in the table above, and leases of devices to Consumer customers as part of fixed access subscription offerings, classified as equipment and other services.\n\nDuring the year we also recognised:\n\n- -  \u00a329m (FY22: \u00a333m) operating lease income from non-core business activities which is presented in other operating income (note 6). Note 15 presents an analysis of payments to be received across the remaining term of operating lease arrangements.\n- -  \u00a358m (FY22: \u00a344m) revenue in relation to upfront gains from arrangements meeting the definition of a finance lease. These arrangements meet the criteria for revenue recognition as they concern leases and sub-leases of telecommunications infrastructure that represent core business activities of the group.\n\n\u00a369m (FY22: \u00a368m) of this income relates to the sub-leasing of right-of-use assets. These are primarily operating sub-leases of unutilised properties, and finance sub-leases of telecommunications infrastructure.\n\n## Contract assets and liabilities\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to contract assets and liabilities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe recognise contract assets for goods and services for which control has transferred to the customer before we have the right to bill. These assets mainly relate to mobile handsets provided upfront but paid for over the course of a contract. Contract assets are reclassified as receivables when the right to payment becomes unconditional and we have billed the customer.\n\nContract liabilities are recognised when we have received advance payment for goods and services that we have not transferred to the customer. These primarily relate to fees received for connection and installation services that are not distinct performance obligations.\n\nWhere the initial set-up, transition or transformation phase of a long-term contract is considered to be a distinct performance obligation we recognise a contract asset for any work performed but not billed. Conversely a contract liability is recognised where these activities are not distinct performance obligations and we receive upfront consideration. In this case eligible costs associated with delivering these services are capitalised as fulfilment costs, see note 17.\n\nWe provide for expected lifetime losses on contract assets following the policy set out in note 17.",

Specific items\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to specific items\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur income statement and segmental analysis separately identify trading results on an adjusted basis, being before specific items. The directors believe that presentation of the group's results in this way is relevant to an understanding of the group's financial performance as specific items are those that in management's judgement need to be disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.\n\nThis presentation is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board and the Executive Committee and assists in providing an additional analysis of our reporting trading results. Specific items may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\nIn determining whether an event or transaction is specific, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors. Examples of charges or credits meeting the above definition and which have been presented as specific items in the current and/or prior years include significant business restructuring programmes such as the current group-wide cost transformation and modernisation programme, acquisitions and disposals of businesses and investments, charges or credits relating to retrospective regulatory matters, property rationalisation programmes, significant out of period contract settlements, net interest on our pension obligation, and the impact of remeasuring deferred tax balances. In the event that items meet the criteria, which are applied consistently from year to year, they are treated as specific items. Any releases to provisions originally booked as a specific item are also classified as specific. Conversely, when a reversal occurs in relation to a prior year item not classified as specific, the reversal is not classified as specific in the current year.\n\nIn FY20 we included the impacts of Covid-19 on various balance sheet items as at 31 March 2020 as specific. Any releases to this provision have been released through specific items in subsequent periods.\n\nCurrent and future movements relating to the sports joint venture (Sports JV) with Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), such as fair value gains or losses on the A and C preference shares or impairment charges on the equity-accounted investment, will be classified as specific as they are deemed to be related to the divestment of BT Sport operations and linked to the overall fair value of the transaction.

These items represent movements in provisions relating to various matters.\n\n## Restructuring charges\n\nWe have incurred charges of \u00a3300m (FY22: \u00a3347m) relating to projects associated with our group-wide cost transformation and modernisation programme. Costs primarily relate to leaver costs, consultancy costs, and staff costs associated with colleagues working exclusively on programme activity. The net cash cost of restructuring activity during the year was \u00a3326m (FY22: \u00a3370m).\n\nThe programme was first announced in May 2020 and runs until the end of FY25. In response to cost inflation, during the year we revised the gross annualised savings target to \u00a33.0bn (previously \u00a32.5bn), with a cost to achieve of \u00a31.6bn (previously \u00a31.3bn). Since embarking on the programme we have achieved gross annualised savings of \u00a32.1bn and incurred costs of \u00a31.1bn.\n\n## BT Sport disposal\n\nDuring FY23 we completed the disposal of BT Sport operations. We recognised a profit on disposal of \u00a328m in specific items, made up of \u00a3155m charges recognised within operating costs net of \u00a3183m tax credits. We also recognised a \u00a313m credit within finance costs as specific (FY22: \u00a38m charge), relating to a foreign exchange hedging arrangement with the Sports JV, see note 31. Further details on the BT Sport disposal can be found in note 23.\n\n## Sports JV subsequent movements\n\nSubsequent to the disposal, we have recorded a net fair value movement of \u00a334m on the A and C preference shares in the Sports JV (see note 25).\n\n## Other divestment-related items\n\nWe recognised a \u00a32m charge (FY22: \u00a336m credit) relating to ongoing divestment projects.\n\n## Covid-19\n\nIn FY20 we recognised one-off charges of \u00a395m relating to the impact of Covid-19 on various balance sheet items. Any releases of this provision have also been booked as a specific item. At 31 March 2023 these provisions had been fully released or utilised.\n\n## Impairment charges due to property rationalisation\n\nDuring FY23, we recognised a \u00a365m impairment charge as specific (FY22: \u00a3nil), in relation to an ongoing property rationalisation programme.",

Specific items continued\n\n## Interest expense on retirement benefit obligation\n\nDuring the year we incurred \u00a318m (FY22: \u00a393m) of interest costs in relation to our defined benefit pension obligations.\n\n## Tax on specific items\n\nA tax credit of \u00a3308m (FY22: \u00a380m) was recognised in relation to specific items. Of this, \u00a3183m relates to the BT Sport disposal. Further details can be found in note 25.\n\n## Remeasurement of deferred tax balances\n\nIn FY22 we remeasured our deferred tax balances following the enactment of the new UK corporation tax rate of 25% from April 2023. The corresponding adjustment comprised a net tax charge of \u00a3420m in the income statement and a non-recurring tax credit of \u00a3298m in the statement of comprehensive income. This was classified as a specific item due to its size and the out-of-period nature of this charge.\n\n## 10. Taxation\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to taxation\n\nCurrent income tax is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the group's subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures operate and generate taxable income. We evaluate positions taken in tax returns where tax regulation is subject to interpretation, and establish provisions if appropriate based on the amounts likely to be paid to tax authorities.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised, using the liability method, in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of our assets and liabilities and their tax base. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised or liability settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred and current income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis. Any remaining deferred tax asset is recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it is probable that there will be suitable taxable profits against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax balances for which there is a right of offset within the same jurisdiction are presented net on the face of the group balance sheet as permitted by IAS 12, with the exception of deferred tax related to our pension schemes which is disclosed within deferred tax assets.\n\n## Key accounting estimates and significant judgements made in accounting for taxation\n\nWe seek to pay tax in accordance with the laws of the countries where we do business. However, in some areas these laws are unclear, and it can take many years to agree an outcome with a tax authority or through litigation. We estimate our tax on country-by-country and issue-by-issue bases. Our key uncertainties are whether our intra-group trading model will be accepted by a particular tax authority; whether intra-group payments are subject to withholding taxes and the deductibility of certain compensation payments made in prior years. We provide for the predicted outcome where an outflow is probable, but the agreed amount can differ materially from our estimates. Approximately 75% by value of the provisions are under active tax authority examination and are therefore likely to be re-estimated or resolved in the coming 12 months. \u00a3104m (FY22: \u00a3194m) is included in current tax liabilities or offset against current tax assets where netting is appropriate.\n\nUnder a downside case an additional amount of \u00a3174m could be required to be paid. This amount is not provided as we don't consider this outcome to be probable.\n\nDeciding whether to recognise deferred tax assets is judgemental. We only recognise them when we consider it is probable that they can be recovered. In making this judgement we consider evidence such as historical financial performance, future financial plans and trends, the duration of existing customer contracts and whether our intra-group pricing model has been agreed by the relevant tax authority.\n\nThe value of the group's income tax assets and liabilities is disclosed on the group balance sheet. The value of the group's deferred tax assets and liabilities is disclosed below.",

These enhanced deductions are available for FY22 and FY23, driving a projected UK tax loss and no UK tax payments for these periods. Together with trading losses and pension deficit contribution deductions, these result in c. \u00a38bn of tax losses expected to be carried forward from FY23 to be utilised against UK taxable profit from FY24 onwards. These are represented by a net c. \u00a32.0bn deferred tax asset which is disclosed within the \u00a32,194m deferred tax asset relating to tax losses in the table above.",

Taxation continued\n\n## What are our unrecognised tax losses and other temporary differences?\n\nAt 31 March 2023 we had operating losses and other temporary differences carried forward in respect of which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to \u00a33.7bn (FY22: \u00a33.8bn). Our other temporary differences have no expiry date restrictions. The expiry date of operating losses carried forward is dependent upon the tax law of the various territories in which the losses arose. A summary of expiry dates for losses in respect of which restrictions apply is set out below:\n\n| At 31 March 2023              | \u00a3m    | Expiry      |\n|-------------------------------|-------|-------------|\n| Restricted losses             |       |             |\n| Europe                        | -     | 2024 - 2027 |\n| Americas                      | 365   | 2024 - 2045 |\n| Other                         | 3     | 2024 - 2030 |\n| Total restricted losses       | 368   |             |\n| Unrestricted operating losses | 3,073 | No expiry   |\n| Other temporary differences   | 266   | No expiry   |\n| Total                         | 3,707 |             |\n\nAt 31 March 2023 we had UK capital losses carried forward in respect of which no deferred tax assets were recognised amounting to \u00a316.8bn (FY22: \u00a316.8bn). These losses have no expiry date, but we consider the future utilisation of significant amounts of these losses to be remote.\n\nAt 31 March 2023 the undistributed earnings of non-UK subsidiaries were \u00a32.5bn (FY22: \u00a31.9bn). No deferred tax liabilities have been recognised in respect of these unremitted earnings because the group is in a position to control the timing of any dividends from subsidiaries and hence any tax consequences that may arise. Under current tax rules, tax of \u00a341m (FY22: \u00a335m) would arise if these earnings were to be repatriated to the UK.\n\n## 11. Earnings per share\n\n## How is earnings per share calculated?\n\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit after tax attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue after deducting the own shares held by employee share ownership trusts and treasury shares.\n\nIn calculating the diluted earnings per share, share options outstanding and other potential shares have been taken into account where the impact of these is dilutive.\n\n| Year ended 31 March                                  | 2023   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Basic weighted average number of shares (millions)   | 9,803  | 9,866  |\n| Dilutive shares from share options (millions)        | 83     | 105    |\n| Dilutive shares from share awards (millions)         | 171    | 165    |\n| Diluted weighted average number of shares (millions) | 10,057 | 10,136 |\n| Basic earnings per share                             | 19.4p  | 12.9p  |\n| Diluted earnings per share                           | 18.9p  | 12.5p  |\n\nThe earnings per share calculations are based on profit after tax attributable to equity shareholders of the parent company which excludes non-controlling interests. Profit after tax was \u00a31,905m (FY22: \u00a31,274m) and profit after tax attributable to non-controlling interests was \u00a34m (FY22: \u00a32m). Profit attributable to non-controlling interests is not presented separately in the financial statements as it is not material.\n\n## 12. Dividends\n\n## What is the group's dividend policy?\n\nWe have a progressive dividend policy to maintain or grow the dividend each year whilst taking into consideration a number of factors including underlying medium-term earnings expectations and levels of business reinvestment.\n\n## What dividends have been paid?\n\nA final dividend of 5.39p per share amounting to approximately \u00a3534m is proposed in respect of the year ended 31 March 2023 (FY22: final dividend of 5.39p per share amounting to \u00a3527m paid in respect of the year ended 31 March 2022). An interim dividend of 2.31p per share amounting to \u00a3226m was paid on 6 February 2023 (FY22: interim dividend of 2.31p per share amounting to \u00a3227m paid). This value may differ from the amount shown for equity dividends paid in the group cash flow statement, which represents the actual cash paid in relation to dividend cheques that have been presented over the course of the financial year.\n\n|                                                 | 2023             | 2023   | 2022             | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|------------------|--------|------------------|--------|\n| Year ended 31 March                             | pence per  share | \u00a3m     | pence per  share | \u00a3m     |\n| Final dividend in respect of the prior year     | 5.39             | 527    | -                | -      |\n| Interim dividend in respect of the current year | 2.31             | 226    | 2.31             | 227    |\n|                                                 | 7.70             | 753    | 2.31             | 227    |",

Intangible assets\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to intangible assets\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe recognise identifiable intangible assets where we control the asset, it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the group, and we can reliably measure the cost of the asset. We amortise all intangible assets, other than goodwill, over their useful economic life. The method of amortisation reflects the pattern in which the assets are expected to be consumed. If the pattern cannot be determined reliably, the straight-line method is used.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the group's share of the identifiable net assets (including intangible assets) of the acquired business. Our goodwill impairment policy is set out later in this note.\n\n## Acquired intangible assets - customer relationships and brands\n\nIntangible assets such as customer relationships or brands acquired through business combinations are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition and subsequently carried at amortised cost. Assumptions are used in estimating the fair values of these relationships or brands and include management's estimates of revenue and profits to be generated by them.\n\n## Telecommunications licences\n\nLicence fees paid to governments, which permit telecommunications activities to be operated for defined periods, are initially recorded at cost and amortised from the time the network is available for use to the end of the licence period or where our usage can extend beyond the initial licence period, over the period we expect to benefit from the use of the licences, which is typically 20 years. Licences acquired through business combinations are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition and subsequently carried at amortised cost. The fair value is based on management's assumption of future cash flows using market expectations at acquisition date.\n\n## Computer software\n\nComputer software comprises computer software licences purchased from third parties, and also the cost of internally developed software. Computer software licences purchased from third parties are initially recorded at cost. We only capitalise costs directly associated with the production of internally developed software, including direct and indirect labour costs of development, where it is probable that the software will generate future economic benefits, the cost of the asset can be reliably measured and technical feasibility can be demonstrated, in which case it is capitalised as an intangible asset on the balance sheet. Costs which do not meet these criteria and research costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nOur development costs which give rise to internally developed software include upgrading the network architecture or functionality and developing service platforms aimed at offering new services to our customers.\n\n## Other\n\nOther intangible assets include website development costs and other licences. Items are capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic life or the term of the contract.\n\n## Estimated useful economic lives\n\nThe estimated useful economic lives assigned to the principal categories of intangible assets are as follows:\n\n- -  Computer software\n\n2 to 10 years\n\n- -  Telecommunications licences\n\n2 to 20 years\n\n- -  Customer relationships and brands\n\n1 to 15 years\n\n## Impairment of intangible assets\n\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are tested for impairment if events or changes in circumstances (assessed at each reporting date) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When an impairment test is performed, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the higher of the net present value of the expected future cash flows (value in use) of the relevant cash generating unit and the fair value less costs to dispose.\n\nGoodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually as described below. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement, as a specific item. If a cash generating unit is impaired, impairment losses are allocated firstly against goodwill, and secondly on a pro-rata basis against intangible and other assets.",

Intangible assets continued\n\n## Impairment of goodwill\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to impairment of goodwill\n\nWe perform an annual goodwill impairment review.\n\nGoodwill recognised in a business combination does not generate cash flows independently of other assets or groups of assets. As a result, the recoverable amount, being the value in use, is determined at a cash generating unit (CGU) level. These CGUs represent the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other groups of assets. Our CGUs are deemed to be Consumer, Enterprise and Global.\n\nWe allocate goodwill to each of the CGUs that we expect to benefit from the business combination. Each CGU to which goodwill is allocated represents the lowest level within the group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.\n\nThe value in use of each CGU is determined using cash flow projections derived from financial plans approved by the Board covering a five-year period. They reflect management's expectations of revenue, EBITDA growth, capital expenditure, working capital and operating cash flows, based on past experience and future expectations of business performance. Cash flows beyond the fifth year have been extrapolated using perpetuity growth rates.\n\n## Significant judgements and key accounting estimates made in reviewing goodwill for impairment\n\n## Determining our CGUs\n\nThe determination of our CGUs is judgemental. The identification of CGUs involves an assessment of whether the asset or group of assets generate largely independent cash inflows. This involves consideration of how our core assets are operated and whether these generate independent revenue streams. Our determination of CGUs is unchanged from FY22.\n\nFrom 1 April 2023 the existing Enterprise and Global units will be managed and reported as a single unit, Business, and we will review the impact this has on our determination of CGUs in FY24. In FY22 we brought together the Legacy BT Consumer and Legacy EE CGUs into a combined 'Consumer' CGU.\n\n## Estimating value in use\n\nOur value in use calculations require estimates in relation to uncertain items, including management's expectations of future revenue growth, operating costs, profit margins, operating cash flows and the discount rate for each CGU. Future cash flows used in the value in use calculations are on a nominal basis and based on our latest Board-approved five-year financial plans, representing management's best estimate of future growth. This includes the direct and indirect impacts of inflation and associated mitigations. Expectations about future growth reflect the expectations of growth in the markets to which the CGU relates and consideration of the overall variability relating to individual assumptions at the unit level. The future cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax nominal discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money. The discount rate used in each CGU is adjusted for the risk specific to the asset, including the countries in which cash flow will be generated, for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.",

See note 23.\n\n## What discount rate have we used?\n\nThe pre-tax discount rates applied to the cash flow forecasts are derived from our post-tax weighted average cost of capital. The assumptions used in the calculation of the group's weighted average cost of capital are benchmarked to externally available data. The pre-tax discount rate used in performing the value in use calculation in FY23 was 9.4% (FY22: 7.6%). We have used the same discount rate for all CGUs except Global where we have used 9.7% (FY22: 7.9%) reflecting higher risk in some of the countries in which Global operates.\n\nIn FY23 we changed the calculation methodology of the group's weighted average cost of capital. The most significant change relates to the nominal interest rate for debt which we previously benchmarked to a 5-year historic average. We now use a spot rate to better reflect the recent significant increases in interest rates by the Bank of England, and the increase in our discount rate is largely attributable to this. The pre-tax discount rate calculated under the previous methodology would have been 7.8%.\n\n## What growth rates have we used?\n\nThe perpetuity growth rates are determined based on the forecast market growth rates of the regions in which the CGU operates, and reflect an assessment of the long-term growth prospects of that market. The growth rates have been benchmarked against external data for the relevant markets. None of the growth rates applied exceed the expected average long-term growth rates for those markets or sectors. We used a perpetuity growth rate of 2.4% (FY22: 2.3%) for Global and 2.0% (FY22: 2.0%) for Enterprise and Consumer.\n\n## What sensitivities have we applied?\n\nThere is significant headroom in our Enterprise and Consumer CGUs. For Global, the value in use exceeds the carrying value of the CGU by approximately \u00a30.7bn (FY22: \u00a33.9bn) due mainly to market conditions and the increased weighted average cost of capital. Any of the following changes in assumptions in isolation would cause the recoverable amount for the CGU to equal its carrying amount:\n\n- -  A reduction in the perpetuity growth rate from our 2.4% assumption to a revised assumption of a perpetuity decline rate of 3.9%;\n- -  An increase in the discount rate from our 9.7% assumption to a revised assumption of 14.4%; or\n- -  Shortfalls in trading performance against forecast resulting in operating cash flows decreasing by 41% each year and in perpetuity.",

Property, plant and equipment\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to property, plant and equipment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur property, plant and equipment is included at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation, government grants and any impairment charges. Property, plant and equipment acquired through business combinations is initially recorded at fair value and subsequently accounted for on the same basis as our existing assets. We derecognise items of property, plant and equipment on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. The difference between the sale proceeds and the net book value at the date of disposal is recognised in operating costs in the income statement.\n\nIncluded within the cost of network infrastructure and equipment are direct and indirect labour costs, materials and directly attributable overheads.\n\nWe depreciate property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis from the time the asset is available for use, to write off the asset's cost over the estimated useful life taking into account any expected residual value. Freehold land is not depreciated.\n\n## Estimated useful economic lives\n\nThe estimated useful lives assigned to principal categories of assets are as follows:\n\n## Land and buildings\n\n- -  Freehold buildings\n\n14 to 50 years\n\n- -  Short-term leasehold improvements\n\nShorter of 10 years or lease term\n\n- -  Leasehold land and buildings\n\nShorter of unexpired portion of lease or 40 years\n\n## Network infrastructure\n\nTransmission equipment\n\n- -  Duct\n\n40 years\n\n- -  Cable\n\n3 to 25 years\n\n- -  Fibre\n\n5 to 20 years\n\nExchange equipment\n\n2 to 13 years\n\nOther network equipment\n\n2 to 20 years\n\n## Other assets\n\n- -  Motor vehicles\n\n2 to 10 years\n\n- -  Computers and office equipment\n\n3 to 7 years\n\nResidual values and useful lives are reassessed annually and, if necessary, changes are recognised prospectively.\n\n## Network share assets\n\nCertain assets have been contributed to a network share arrangement by both EE and Hutchison 3G UK Limited, with legal title remaining with the contributor. This is considered to be a reciprocal arrangement. Our share of the assets on acquisition of EE was recognised at fair value within tangible assets, and depreciated in line with policy. Subsequent additions are recorded at cost.\n\n## Impairment of property, plant and equipment\n\nWe test property, plant and equipment for impairment if events or changes in circumstances (assessed at each reporting date) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When an impairment test is performed, we assess the recoverable amount by reference to the higher of the net present value of the expected future cash flows (value in use) of the relevant asset and the fair value less costs to dispose. If it is not possible to determine the recoverable amount for the individual asset then we assess impairment by reference to the relevant cash generating unit as described in note 13.\n\n## Building Digital UK (BDUK) government grants\n\nWe receive government grants in relation to BDUK and other rural superfast broadband contracts. Where we have achieved certain service levels, or delivered the network more efficiently than anticipated, we have an obligation to either re-invest or repay grant funding. Where this is the case, we recognise deferred income in respect of the funding that will be re-invested or repaid, and make a corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the related property, plant and equipment.\n\nAssessing the timing of whether and when we change the estimated take-up assumption is judgemental as it involves considering information which is not always observable. Our consideration on whether and when to change the base case assumption is dependent on our expectation of the long-term take-up trend.\n\nOur assessment of how much grant income to defer includes consideration of the difference between the take-up percentage agreed with the local authority and the likelihood of actual take-up. The value of the government grants deferred is disclosed in note 18.",

Leases\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to leases\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Identifying whether a lease exists\n\nAt inception of a contract, we determine whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. A lease exists if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, for a period of time, in exchange for consideration. In making this assessment, we consider whether:\n\n- -  The contract involves the use of an identified asset, either explicitly or implicitly. The asset must be physically distinct or represent substantially all the capacity of a physically distinct asset. Assets that a supplier has a substantive right to substitute are not considered distinct.\n- -  The lessee (either the group, or the group's customers) has the right to obtain substantially all the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the period of use; and\n- -  The lessee has the right to direct the use of the asset, in other words, has the decision-making rights that are most relevant to changing how and for what purpose the asset is used.\n\nWhere practicable, and by class of underlying asset, we have elected to account for leases containing a lease component and one or more non-lease components as a single lease component. Where this election has been taken, it has been applied to the entire asset.\n\n## Lessee accounting\n\nWe recognise a lease liability and right-of-use asset at the commencement of the lease.\n\nLease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of lease payments that are due over the lease term, discounted using the group's incremental borrowing rate.\n\nThe lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease adjusted for the impact of any extension options that we are reasonably certain that the lessee will exercise, or termination options that we are reasonably certain that the lessee will not exercise.\n\nThe incremental borrowing rate is the rate that we would have to pay for a loan of a similar term, and with similar security, to obtain an asset of similar value.\n\nLease payments include:\n\n- -  fixed payments\n- -  variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate\n- -  amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees\n- -  the exercise price of any purchase options that we are reasonably certain to exercise\n- -  payments due over optional renewal periods where we are reasonably certain to renew\n- -  penalties for early termination of the lease where we are reasonably certain to terminate early\n\nLease liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. They are remeasured if there is a change in future lease payments, including changes in the index or rate used to determine those payments, or the amount we expect to be payable under a residual value guarantee.\n\nWe also remeasure lease liabilities where the lease term changes. This occurs when the non-cancellable period of the lease changes, or on occurrence of a significant event or change in circumstances within the control of the lessee and which changes our initial assessment in regard to whether the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise extension options or not to exercise termination options. Where the lease term changes we remeasure the lease liability using the group's incremental borrowing rate at the date of reassessment. Where a significant event or change in circumstances does not occur, the lease term remains unchanged and the carrying amounts of the lease liability and associated right-of-use asset will decline over time.\n\nRight-of-use assets are initially measured at the initial amount of the corresponding lease liabilities, adjusted for any prepaid lease payments, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of any decommissioning costs that have been recognised as provisions, less any lease incentives received. They are subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the asset or the end of the lease term. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment following the policy set out in note 14 and are adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.\n\nWe have elected not to recognise lease liabilities and right-of-use assets for short-term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or less, and leases of low-value assets with a purchase price under \u00a35,000. We recognise payments for these items as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nAny variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate, such as usage-based payments, are recognised as an expense in the period to which the variability relates.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 15. Leases continued\n\n## Lessor accounting\n\nAt inception or on modification of a contract that contains a lease component, we allocate the consideration in the contract to each lease component on the basis of their relative standalone prices.\n\nWhen we act as a lessor, we determine at lease inception whether each lease is a finance lease or an operating lease.\n\nTo classify each lease, we make an overall assessment of whether the lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset. If this is the case, then the lease is a finance lease; if not, then it is an operating lease. As part of this assessment, we consider certain indicators such as whether the lease is for the major part of the economic life of the asset.\n\nWhen we are an intermediate lessor, we account for our interests in the headlease and the sublease separately. We assess the lease classification of a sublease with reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the headlease, not with reference to the underlying asset. If a headlease is a short-term lease to which we apply the exemption described above, then we classify the sublease as an operating lease.\n\nIf an arrangement contains lease and non-lease components, then we apply IFRS 15 to allocate the consideration in the contract.\n\nWe apply the derecognition and impairment requirements in IFRS 9 to the net investment in the lease. We further regularly review estimated unguaranteed residual values used in calculating the gross investment in the lease.\n\nWe recognise lease payments received under operating leases as income on a straight-line basis over the lease term as part of 'other revenue'.\n\n## Significant judgements made in accounting for leases\n\nThe lease term is a key determinant of the size of the lease liability and right-of-use asset recognised where the group acts as lessee; and the deferral period for any upfront connection charges where the group acts as lessor. Determining the lease term requires judgement to evaluate whether we are reasonably certain the lessee will exercise extension options or will not exercise termination options. Key facts and circumstances that create an incentive to exercise those options are considered; these include:\n\n- -  Our anticipated operational, retail and office property requirements in the mid and long term.\n- -  The availability of suitable alternative sites.\n- -  Costs or penalties associated with exiting lease arrangements relative to the benefits to be gained, including costs of removing leasehold improvements or relocating, and indirect costs such as disruption to business.\n- -  Significant investments in leased sites, in particular those with useful lives beyond the lease term.\n- -  Costs associated with extending lease arrangements including rent increases during secondary lease periods.\n\nOur definition of 'reasonable certainty', and therefore the lease term, will often align with the judgements made in our medium-term plan, in particular for leases of non-specialised property and equipment on rolling (or 'evergreen') arrangements that continue until terminated and which can be exited without significant penalty.\n\nFollowing initial determination of the lease term, we exercise judgement in evaluating whether events or changes in circumstances are sufficiently significant to change the initial assessment of whether we are reasonably certain the lessee will exercise extension options or will not exercise termination options; and in the subsequent reassessment of the lease term.\n\n## Key judgements exercised in setting the lease term\n\nThe quantum of the lease liability and right-of-use asset currently recognised on our balance sheet is most significantly affected by the judgement exercised in setting the lease term for the arrangement under which the bulk of our operational UK property estate is held. Setting the lease term for our leased cell sites has also involved the use of judgement, albeit to a lesser degree.",

        "page_content": "## 15. Leases continued\n\n## UK operational property portfolio\n\nSubstantially all of our leased property estate is held under an arrangement which can be terminated in 2031, at which point we may either vacate some or all properties or purchase the entire estate. If neither option is taken the lease continues to the next unilaterally available break point in 2041. The lease liability recognised for the arrangement reflects a lease end date of 2031.\n\nOn initial recognition we concluded that, although the majority of these properties are expected to be needed on a long-term basis, we couldn't be reasonably certain that we wouldn't exercise the termination option or that we would exercise the purchase option. In coming to this conclusion, we had due regard to material sub-lease arrangements relating to the estate.\n\nAs time progresses our assessment may change; if this happens, we will remeasure the lease liability and right-of-use asset to reflect either the rentals due for any properties we will continue to occupy, or the cost of purchasing the estate, using an updated discount rate. There would be no overall impact on net assets.\n\nIf the assessment were to change at the balance sheet date 31 March 2023:\n\n- -  Exercising the purchase option would lead to an estimated increase in the lease liability and right-of-use asset of between \u00a33bn and \u00a35bn\n- -  Continuing to lease the estate beyond 2031 until the next available break in 2041 would lead to an estimated increase in the lease liability and right-of-use asset of between \u00a31bn and \u00a32bn\n\nOur assessment will be directly linked to future strategic decisions, which will be resolved at some time prior to 2031, around the development of the fixed network and the associated rationalisation of our exchange estate. The breadth of the ranges reflects the significant uncertainty around key variables used to determine cash outflows, especially future inflation and which properties the group will be able to exit prior to or in 2031.\n\nEstimates are based on discounted cash outflows and do not reflect the likely and significant impact of cash inflows generated from the disposal, repurposing or subleasing of properties retained post-2031.\n\nWe are permitted to hand a limited number of properties back to the lessor prior to 2031. On initial adoption of IFRS 16 we were not reasonably certain which properties would be handed back and as such the lease term did not reflect the exercise of these options. Subsequently we exercise judgement in identifying significant events that trigger reassessment of our initial conclusion. We exercise similar judgement in identifying events triggering reassessment of whether we are reasonably certain we will not exercise termination options associated with other leased properties.\n\nIn doing so we consider decisions associated with our ongoing workplace rationalisation programme, in particular decisions to exit a particular location or lease an alternative property. Generally we remain reasonably certain that we will not exercise a termination option until implementation of the associated business plan has progressed to a stage that we are committed to exiting the property. At that point we reassess the lease term by reference to the time we expect to remain in occupation of the property and any notice period associated with exercise of the option.\n\n## Cell sites\n\nMost of the liability recognised in respect of leased cell sites relates to multi-site arrangements with commercial providers. The fixedterm nature of these arrangements means it has not been necessary to exercise significant judgement when determining the lease term. Where the arrangements offer extension options we have been required to conclude whether the options are reasonably certain to be exercised. Although the balance sheet could be materially affected by the conclusion reached in regard to these options, we have not been required to exercise a significant degree of judgement in arriving at the lease term having regard to the period of time covered by the options, the difficulty in predicting the group's long-term network requirements, and the relatively high threshold that 'reasonably certain' represents.\n\nA smaller proportion of the cell site liability relates to arrangements with individual landlords which are either rolling or can be exited with notice. When setting the initial lease term for these arrangements we exercised significant judgement in establishing the period that we are reasonably certain to require use of the site. We broadly aligned lease terms with our medium-term planning horizon after assessing the relative strengths of the following factors:\n\n- -  Long-term economic incentives to remain on sites including existing capital improvements;\n- -  A need to maintain flexibility in our ability to develop and manage our network infrastructure to react quickly to technological developments and evolving capacity requirements; and\n- -  Incentives to renegotiate arrangements in the medium term to gain more security over sites to support future capital investment.\n\nAlthough significant judgement has been exercised in determining the lease term, reaching an alternative conclusion would not have a material impact on the balance sheet having regard to the most feasible alternative lease terms.\n\nSubsequently, we consider key events that trigger reassessment of lease terms to be developments which resolve uncertainty around our economic incentive to remain on individual sites in the long term. These are primarily lease renegotiations and significant capital investments, for example that associated with our 5G rollout and other capital refresh programmes.",

Our cash flow statement and normalised free cash flow reconciliation present \u00a3727m (FY22: \u00a3659m) of the cash outflow as relating to the principal element of lease liability payments, with the remaining balance of \u00a3133m (FY22: \u00a3133m) presented within interest paid.\n\nNote 29 presents a maturity analysis of the payments due over the remaining lease term for lease liabilities currently recognised on the balance sheet. This analysis only includes payments to be made over the reasonably certain lease term. Cash outflows are likely to exceed these amounts as payments will be made on optional periods that we do not currently consider to be reasonably certain, and in respect of leases entered into in future periods.",

Trade and other receivables\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to trade and other receivables\n\nTrade receivables are recognised where the right to receive payment from customers is conditional only on the passage of time. We initially recognise trade and other receivables at fair value, which is usually the original invoiced amount. They are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The carrying amount of these balances approximates to fair value due to the short maturity of amounts receivable.\n\nWe provide services to consumer and business customers, mainly on credit terms. We know that certain debts due to us will not be paid through the default of a small number of our customers. Because of this, we recognise an allowance for doubtful debts on initial recognition of receivables, which is deducted from the gross carrying amount of the receivable. The allowance is calculated by reference to credit losses expected to be incurred over the lifetime of the receivable. In estimating a loss allowance we consider historical experience and informed credit assessment alongside other factors such as the current state of the economy and particular industry issues. We consider reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort.\n\nOnce recognised, trade receivables are continuously monitored and updated. Allowances are based on our historical loss experiences for the relevant aged category as well as forward-looking information and general economic conditions. Allowances are calculated by individual CFUs in order to reflect the specific nature of the customers relevant to that CFU.\n\nThe group utilises factoring arrangements for selected trade receivables. Trade receivables that are subject to debt factoring arrangements are derecognised if they meet the conditions for derecognition detailed in IFRS 9 'Financial instruments'.\n\nContingent assets such as any insurance recoveries which we expect to recoup, have not been recognised in the financial statements as these are only recognised within trade and other receivables when their receipt is virtually certain.\n\n| At 31 March                     | 2023  \u00a3m   | 2022  \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------|------------|------------|\n| Current                         |            |            |\n| Trade receivables               | 1,395      | 1,339      |\n| Prepayments                     | 545        | 523        |\n| Accrued income                  | 158        | 150        |\n| Deferred contract costs         | 369        | 336        |\n| Finance lease receivables a     | 29         | 3          |\n| Amounts due from joint ventures | 268        | -          |\n| Other assets a,b                | 296        | 273        |\n|                                 | 3,060      | 2,624      |\n| Non-current                     |            |            |\n| Deferred contract costs         | 211        | 226        |\n| Finance lease receivables a     | 98         | 90         |\n| Other assets a,b                | 194        | 21         |\n|                                 | 503        | 337        |\n\nAmounts due from joint ventures relates to a sterling Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) provided to the Sports JV formed during the year, see note 23.

acquisition and fulfilment of contracts with customers and amortise them over the period that we transfer the associated services.\n\nConnection costs are deferred as contract fulfilment costs because they allow satisfaction of the associated connection performance obligation and are considered recoverable. Sales commissions and other third party contract acquisition costs are capitalised as costs to acquire a contract unless the associated contract term is less than 12 months, in which case they are expensed as incurred. Capitalised costs are amortised over the minimum contract term. A portfolio approach is used to determine contract term.\n\nWhere the initial set-up, transition and transformation phases of long-term contractual arrangements represent distinct performance obligations, costs in delivering these services are expensed as incurred. Where these services are not distinct performance obligations, we capitalise eligible costs as a cost of fulfilling the related service. Capitalised costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the remaining contract term, unless the pattern of service delivery indicates a more appropriate profile. To be eligible for capitalisation, costs must be directly attributable to specific contracts, relate to future activity, and generate future economic benefits. Capitalised costs are regularly assessed for recoverability.",

Trade and other payables\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to trade and other payables\n\nWe initially recognise trade and other payables at fair value, which is usually the original invoiced amount. We subsequently carry them at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\nWe use a supply chain financing programme to extend payment terms with a limited number of suppliers to a more typical payment term. We also use a separate supply chain financing programme to allow suppliers to receive funding earlier than the invoice due date. We assess these arrangements against indicators to assess if debts which vendors have sold to the funder under the supplier financing schemes continue to meet the definition of trade payables or should be classified as borrowings. At 31 March 2023 the payables met the criteria of trade payables.

Provisions & contingent liabilities\n\nOur provisions principally relate to obligations arising from property rationalisation programmes, restructuring programmes, asset retirement obligations, network assets, third party claims, litigation and regulatory risks. Contingent liabilities primarily arise from litigation and regulatory matters that are not sufficiently certain to meet the criteria for recognition as provisions.\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to provisions & contingent liabilities\n\nWe recognise provisions when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.\n\nWhere these criteria are not met we disclose a contingent liability if the group has a possible obligation, or has a present obligation with an outflow that is not probable or which cannot be reliably estimated.\n\nProvisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a nominal pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Cash flows are adjusted for the effect of inflation where appropriate.\n\n## Key accounting estimates and significant judgements made in accounting for provisions & contingent liabilities\n\nWe exercise judgement in determining the quantum of all provisions to be recognised. Our assessment includes consideration of whether we have a present obligation, whether payment is probable and if so whether the amount can be estimated reliably.\n\nAs part of this assessment, we also assess the likelihood of contingent liabilities occurring in the future. Contingent liabilities are not recognised as liabilities on our balance sheet. By their nature, contingencies will be resolved only when one or more uncertain future events occur or fail to occur. We assess the likelihood that a potential claim or liability will arise and also quantify the possible range of financial outcomes where this can be reasonably determined.\n\nIn estimating contingent liabilities we make key judgements in relation to applicable law and any historical and pending court rulings, and the likelihood, timing and cost of resolution.\n\n## Key accounting estimates applied in accounting for provisions and contingent liabilities\n\nOther provisions may involve the use of key (but not critical) estimates as explained below.\n\nWhen measuring provisions we reflect the impact of inflation as appropriate particularly in relation to our property, asset retirement obligation and third party claims provisions. Although this involves a degree of estimation it does not represent a significant source of estimation uncertainty having regard to the quantum of the balances in question and the anticipated timing of outflows.\n\nProperty provisions relate to obligations arising in relation to our property portfolio, in particular costs to restore leased properties on vacation where this is required under the lease agreement. In measuring property provisions, we have made estimates of the costs associated with the restoration of properties by reference to any relevant guidance such as rate cards. Cash outflows occur as and when properties are vacated and the obligations are settled.\n\nAsset retirement obligations (AROs) relate to obligations to dismantle equipment and restore network sites on vacation of the site. The provision represents the group's best estimate of the costs to dismantle equipment and restore the sites. Obligations are settled as and when sites are vacated and the timing is largely influenced by the group's network strategy.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued\n\n## 19. Provisions & contingent liabilities continued\n\nOur regulatory provision represents our best estimate of the cost to settle our present obligation in relation to historical regulatory matters. The charge/credit for the year represents the outcome of management's re-assessment of the estimates and regulatory risks across a range of issues, including price and service issues. The prices at which certain services are charged are regulated and may be subject to retrospective adjustment by regulators. When estimating the likely value of regulatory risk we make key judgements, including in regard to interpreting Ofcom regulations and past and current claims. The precise outcome of each matter depends on whether it becomes an active issue, and the extent to which negotiation or regulatory and compliance decisions will result in financial settlement. The ultimate liability may vary from the amounts provided and will be dependent upon the eventual outcome of any settlement.\n\nLitigation provisions represent the best estimate to settle present obligations recognised in respect of claims brought against the group. The estimate reflects the specific facts and circumstances of each individual matter and any relevant external advice received. Provisions recognised are inherently judgemental and could change over time as matters progress.\n\nEstablishing contingent liabilities associated with litigation brought against the group may involve the use of key estimates and assumptions, in particular around the ability to form a reliable estimate of any probable outflow. We provide further information in relation to specific matters in the 'contingent liabilities' section below.\n\nThird party claims provisions (previously described as insurance provisions) represent our exposure to claims from third parties, with latent disease claims from former colleagues and motor vehicle claims making up the majority of the balance. We engage an independent actuary to provide an estimate of the most likely outcomes in respect of latent disease and third party motor vehicle accident claims, and our in-house insurance teams review our exposure to other risks.\n\nOther provisions do not include any individually material provisions.\n\nFor all risks, the ultimate liability may vary materially from the amounts provided and will be dependent upon the eventual outcome of any settlement.\n\n|                                     | Property a \u00a3m   | Network ARO a \u00a3m   | Regulatory \u00a3m   | Litigation \u00a3m   | Third party  claims b \u00a3m   | Other c,d \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------------|----------------|------------|\n| At 1 April 2021                     | 138             | 158                | 96              | 109             | 91                         | 123            | 715        |\n| Additions                           | 17              | 25                 | 14              | 7               | 6                          | 22             | 91         |\n| Unwind of discount                  | -               | 1                  | -               | -               | -                          | -              | 1          |\n| Utilised                            | (9)             | (3)                | (26)            | -               | (5)                        | (11)           | (54)       |\n| Released                            | (2)             | -                  | (18)            | (31)            | -                          | (38)           | (89)       |\n| Transfers                           | (2)             | -                  | (1)             | -               | -                          | -              | (3)        |\n| Exchange differences                | -               | -                  | -               | -               | -                          | -              | -          |\n| At 31 March 2022                    | 142             | 181                | 65              | 85              | 92                         | 96             | 661        |\n| IAS 37 opening balance adjustment e | -               | -                  | -               | -               | -                          | 12             | 12         |\n| At 1 April 2022                     | 142             | 181                | 65              | 85              | 92                         | 108            | 673        |\n| Additions                           | 43              | -                  | 16              | 6               | 35                         | 15             | 115        |\n| Unwind of discount                  | 1               | 3                  | -               | -               | -                          | -              | 4          |\n| Utilised                            | (8)             | (4)                | (1)             | (41)            | (30)                       | (7)            | (91)       |\n| Released                            | (37)            | (87)               | (16)            | (9)             | (43)                       | (42)           | (234)      |\n| Transfers f                         | -               | -                  | 4               | -               | 132                        | (11)           | 125        |\n| Exchange differences                | 1               | -                  | -               | 3               | 1                          | 1              | 6          |\n| At 31 March 2023                    | 142             | 93                 | 68              | 44              | 187                        | 64             | 598        |\n\n- a Timing of expected cash flows associated with property and network ARO provisions varies depending on the exit dates of individual properties and sites.

        "page_content": "## 19. Provisions & contingent liabilities continued\n\n## Contingent liabilities and legal proceedings\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are periodically notified of actual or threatened litigation, and regulatory and compliance matters and investigations. We have disclosed below a number of such matters including any matters where we believe a material adverse impact on the operations or financial condition of the group is possible and the likelihood of a material outflow of resources is more than remote.\n\nWhere the outflow of resources is considered probable, and a reasonable estimate can be made of the amount of that obligation, a provision is recognised for these amounts and reflected in the table above. Where an outflow is not probable but is possible, or a reasonable estimate of the obligation cannot be made, a contingent liability exists.\n\nIn respect of each of the claims below, the nature and progression of such proceedings and investigations can make it difficult to predict the impact they will have on the group. There are many reasons why we cannot make these assessments with certainty, including, among others, that they are in early stages, no damages or remedies have been specified, and/or the often slow pace of litigation.\n\n## Class action claim\n\nIn January 2021, law firm Mishcon de Reya applied to the Competition Appeal Tribunal to bring a proposed class action claim for damages they estimated at \u00a3608m (inclusive of compound interest) or \u00a3589m (inclusive of simple interest) on behalf of our landline customers alleging anti-competitive behaviour through excessive pricing by BT to customers with certain residential landline services. Ofcom considered this topic more than five years ago. At that time, Ofcom's final statement made no finding of excessive pricing or breach of competition law more generally. The claim seeks to hold against us the fact that we implemented a voluntary commitment to reduce prices for customers that have a BT landline only and not to increase those prices beyond inflation (CPI). At the reporting date we are not aware of any evidence to indicate that a present obligation exists such that any amount should be provided for. In September 2021 the Competition Appeal Tribunal certified the claim to proceed to a substantive trial on an opt-out basis (class members are automatically included in the claim unless they choose to opt-out). We appealed the opt-out nature of that decision and in May 2022 the Court of Appeal determined that the claim should proceed on an opt-out basis. A hearing window has been set for January - April 2024. BT intends to defend itself vigorously.\n\n## Italian business\n\nMilan Public Prosecutor prosecutions: in February 2019 the Milan Public Prosecutor served BT Italia S.P.A. (BT Italia) with a notice (which named BT Italia, as well as various individuals) to record the Prosecutor's view that there is a basis for proceeding with its case against BT Italia for certain potential offences, namely the charge of having adopted, from 2011 to 2016, an inadequate management and control organisation model for the purposes of Articles 5 and 25 of Legislative Decree 231/2001. BT Italia disputes this and maintains in a defence brief filed in April 2019 that: (a) BT Italia did not gain any interest or benefit from the conduct in question; and (b) in any event, it had a sufficient organisational, management and audit model that was circumvented/overridden by individuals acting in their own self-interest. However, following a series of committal hearings in Autumn 2020, on 10 November 2020, the Italian court agreed (as is the normal process unless there are limitation or other fundamental issues with the claim) that BT Italia, and all but one of the individuals, should be committed to a full trial. The trial commenced on 26 January 2021 and is ongoing. On 23 April 2021, the Italian court allowed some parties to be joined to the criminal proceedings as civil parties ('parte civile') - a procedural feature of the Italian criminal law system. These claims are directed at certain individual defendants (which include former BT/ BT Italia employees). Those parties have now successfully joined BT Italia as a respondent to their civil claims ('responsabile civile') on the basis that it is vicariously responsible for the individuals' wrongdoing. If successful, the quantum of those claims is not anticipated to be material.\n\nAccounting misstatement claims: a law firm acting on behalf of a group of investors has made claims under s.90A of the Financial Services & Markets Act 2000, alleging that untrue or misleading statements were made in relation to the historical irregular accounting practices in BT's Italian business (which have been the subject of previous disclosures). No value is stated and the matter is in the very early stages. As mentioned in our earlier reports, the accounting issues in Italy have previously been the subject of class actions in the US that were dismissed by the US courts.\n\n## Phones 4U\n\nSince 2015 the administrators of Phones 4U Limited have made allegations that EE and other mobile network operators colluded to procure Phones 4U's insolvency. Legal proceedings for an unquantified amount were issued in December 2018 by the administrators. The trial on the question of liability/breach ran from May to July 2022. The parties are now awaiting judgment, and the court has not yet indicated when it will be delivered. A second trial on quantum would be required in the event of a finding for the claimant. We continue to dispute these allegations vigorously.\n\n## UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) investigation\n\nOn 12 July 2022 the CMA opened a competition law investigation into BT and other companies involved in the purchase of freelance services for the production and broadcasting of sports content in the UK. The investigation is focused on BT Sport. In February 2023, the CMA extended its investigation to include suspected breaches of competition law in relation to the employment of staff supporting the production and broadcasting of sports content in the UK. The CMA has said no assumption should be made at this stage that competition law has been infringed. BT is cooperating with the investigation.",

Retirement benefit plans\n\n## Background to BT's pension plans\n\nThe group has both Defined Benefit and Defined Contribution retirement benefit plans. The group's main plans are in the UK:\n\n- -  The BT Pension Scheme (BTPS) is the largest UK Defined Benefit plan. It was closed to future benefit accrual in 2018 for the majority of members, and has 62,000 deferred members and 208,000 pensioners. All BTPS members receive pensions benefits at retirement based on salary and years of service, and some members also receive a lump sum payment at retirement. Increases for the majority of benefits are linked to either the Retail Price Index (RPI) or the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The scenarios on page 196 illustrate how sensitive the BTPS liabilities are to inflation expectations. The BTPS constitutes 97% of BT Group's IAS 19 liability.\n- -  The EE Pension Scheme (EEPS) has a Defined Benefit section that was closed to future benefit accrual in 2014 and a Defined Contribution section. The Defined Benefit section constitutes 2% of BT Group's IAS 19 liability.\n- -  The BT Retirement Saving Scheme (BTRSS) is a Defined Contribution, contract-based, plan operated by Standard Life which new UK employees join. There are around 65,000 employees building benefits in the BTRSS.\n\nThe group also has retirement arrangements around the world in line with local markets and culture.\n\n## Types of retirement benefit plans\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Defined benefit ('DB') plans\n\nDB plan benefits are determined by the plan rules, typically dependent on factors such as age, years of service and pensionable pay, but not on the value of actual contributions made by the company and members. The group is exposed to investment and other experience risks and may need to make additional contributions where it is estimated that the benefits will not be met from regular contributions, expected investment income and assets held.\n\nThe net defined benefit liability, or deficit, is the present value of all expected future benefit cash flows to be paid by each plan, calculated using the projected unit credit method by professionally qualified actuaries (also known as the Defined Benefit Obligation (DBO) or liabilities) less the fair value of the plan assets.\n\n## Defined contribution ('DC') plans\n\nDC plan benefits are linked to the value of each member's fund, which is based on contributions paid and the performance of each individual's chosen investments. The group has no exposure to investment and other experience risks.\n\n## Amounts in the financial statements\n\n## Group income statement\n\nThe expense arising from the group's retirement benefit arrangements recognised in the group income statement is shown below.\n\n| Year ended 31 March                                                             | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Recognised in the income statement before specific items (note 6)               |           |           |\n| - Service cost:                                                                 |           |           |\n| - DB plans                                                                      | 17        | 20        |\n| - DC plans                                                                      | 537       | 525       |\n| - Past service cost/(credit)                                                    | (2)       | (1)       |\n| - Administration expenses and PPF levy                                          | 38        | 47        |\n| Subtotal                                                                        | 590       | 591       |\n| Recognised in the income statement as specific items (note 9)                   |           |           |\n| - Costs to close BTPS and provide transition payments a  for affected employees | 13        | 14        |\n| - Interest on pensions deficit                                                  | 18        | 93        |\n| Subtotal                                                                        | 31        | 107       |\n| Total recognised in the income statement                                        | 621       | 698       |\n\n- a All employees impacted by the closure of the BTPS were eligible for transition payments from the date of closure into their BTRSS pot for a period linked to the employee's age.",

The Trustee's key powers include setting the investment strategy of BTPS (after consultation with BT) and agreeing with BT the actuarial assumptions to be used when assessing the BTPS funding position and the resulting contributions that will be paid.\n\nThere are nine Trustee directors, all of whom are appointed by BT, as illustrated below. Trustee directors are usually appointed for a threeyear term but are then eligible for re-appointment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Chairman of the Trustee directors\n\nAppointed by BT after consultation with, and with the agreement of, the relevant trade unions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMember nominated Trustee directors\n\nAppointed by BT based on nominations by trade unions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employer nominated Trustee directors\n\nAppointed by BT.

Retirement benefit plans continued\n\n## BTPS IAS 19 assets\n\n## Critical accounting estimates and significant judgements made when valuing the BTPS assets\n\nUnder IAS 19, plan assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date and include quoted and unquoted investments.\n\n## Valuation of main quoted investments\n\n- -  Equities listed on recognised stock exchanges are valued at closing bid prices.\n- -  Bonds that are regularly traded are valued using broker quotes.\n- -  Exchange traded derivative contracts are valued based on closing bid prices\n\n## Valuation of main unquoted investments\n\nA portion of unquoted investments are valued based on inputs that are not directly observable, which require more judgement. The assumptions used in valuing unquoted investments are affected by market conditions.\n\n- -  Equities are valued using the International Private Equity and Venture Capital (IPEVC) guidelines where the most significant assumptions are the discount rate and earnings assumptions.\n- -  Property investments are valued on the basis of open market value by an independent valuer using RICS guidelines. The significant assumptions used in the valuation are rental yields and occupancy rates.\n- -  Bonds, including those issued by BT, that are not regularly traded are valued by an independent valuer using pricing models making assumptions for credit risk, market risk and market yield curves.\n- -  Holdings in investment funds are typically valued at the Net Asset Value provided by the fund administrator or investment manager. The significant assumption used in the valuation is the Net Asset Value.\n- -  Infrastructure investments are valued by an independent valuer using a model-based valuation such as a discounted cash flow approach, or at the price of recent market transactions if they represent fair value. Where a discounted cash flow model is used, the significant assumptions used in the valuation are the discount rate and the expected cash flows.\n- -  Over the counter derivatives are valued by an independent valuer using cash flows discounted at market rates. The significant\n- assumptions used in the valuation are the yield curves and cost of carry.\n- -  The longevity insurance contract is measured by discounting the projected cash flows payable under the contract (projected by an actuary, consistent with the terms of the contract). The significant assumptions used to value the asset are the discount rate (including adjustments to the risk free rate) and the mortality assumptions.\n\n\u00a36.4bn of unquoted investments that are formally valued periodically by the investment manager have a latest valuation that precedes the balance sheet date. These assets consist of: \u00a33.7bn non-core credit; \u00a31.2bn mature infrastructure; \u00a31.1bn private equity; \u00a30.2bn secure income; and \u00a30.2bn overseas property. These valuations have been adjusted for cash movements between the previous valuation date and 31 March 2023. The valuation approach and inputs for these investments would only be approximately updated where there were indications of significant movements, for example implied by market indicators. No such adjustment was required at 31 March 2023.\n\n## Asset-backed funding arrangement\n\nThe asset-backed funding arrangement, issued to the BTPS in May 2021, has a fair value of \u00a31.3bn at 31 March 2023 (2022: \u00a31.4bn) calculated as the present value of the future stream of payments, allowing for the probability of the BTPS becoming fully funded and therefore the payments to the BTPS ending early. It is not recognised as a pension asset when measuring the group's IAS 19 net defined benefit liability as it is a non-transferable financial instrument issued by the group.\n\n## How are the BTPS assets invested?\n\nThe Trustee regularly reviews the allocation of assets between different investment classes, taking into account current market conditions and trends. The allocations reflect the Trustee's views on a range of areas, including: i) the balance between seeking returns and incurring risk; ii) the extent to which the assets should be allocated to match movements in the liabilities due to changes in interest rates, inflation and/or longevity (i.e. liability-driven investments, or LDI); iii) the extent to which the assets should provide cash flows to meet expected payments to beneficiaries; and iv) liquidity needed to meet benefit payments and collateral requirements for derivatives contracts.\n\nFinancial derivatives (e.g. swaps) are used to reduce the mismatch between movements in the liabilities and the assets from changes in interest rates, inflation, and exchange rates. This provides greater stability in the funding position, and therefore the deficit contributions that may be required from BT. The sensitivity chart on page 198 shows how the use of some of these derivatives adjusts outcomes for the BTPS. While the use of derivatives reduces funding risk, it increases the Scheme's liquidity requirements which is factored into the overall investment strategy. Following the impact of the September 2022 mini-budget on derivatives, the Bank of England and the Pensions Regulator issued guidance on the minimum level of collateral pension schemes should hold. At 31 March 2023, the BTPS held more collateral than these minimum levels.",

We use estimates for all of these uncertain events. Our assumptions reflect historical experience, market expectations (where relevant), actuarial advice and our judgement regarding future expectations at the balance sheet date.\n\n## What are the forecast benefits payable from the BTPS?\n\nThere are c 270,000 members, and their dependents, who will be receiving benefits from the BTPS for the remainder of their lives. Members currently receiving pension benefits make up around 69% of the liability and 77% of the membership. Forecasting the benefit payments involves judgement about uncertain events. While assumptions are made for these events, actual benefit payments in a given year may be higher or lower than the assumption, for example if members retire sooner or later than assumed. The liabilities are the present value of the future expected benefit payments.\n\nThe chart below illustrates how the forecast benefits payable from the BTPS, and IAS 19 liabilities, projected using the IAS 19 assumptions evolve over time. While benefit payments are expected to increase in the early years, as non-pensioners retire, the value of the liabilities is expected to reduce.",

The duration is sensitive to the assumptions and has reduced following the increase in bond yields, and therefore discount rate, over the year.\n\n## What are the most significant assumptions, and how have they been set?\n\nThe most significant financial assumptions used to calculate the IAS 19 liabilities for the BTPS are the discount rate and inflation.

Things like future low investment returns, high inflation, longer life expectancy and regulatory changes may all mean the BTPS becomes more of a financial burden to BT.\n\nChanges in external factors, such as bond yields, can have an impact on the IAS 19 and funding assumptions, impacting the measurement of BTPS liabilities. These factors can also impact the BTPS assets. A summary is set out in the table below:\n\n| Change in               | Impact                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Government  bond yields | A fall in government bond yields will: -  increase the IAS 19 liabilities, driven by the fall in the discount rate.  -  increase the assets, driven by an increase in the value of government bonds, corporate bonds and interest rate  derivatives held by the BTPS. |\n| Credit  spreads         | A fall in credit spreads will lead to a fall in corporate bond yields, and therefore an increase in the IAS 19 liabilities and  a corresponding but smaller increase in both asset values and funding liabilities.                                                    |\n| Inflation  expectations | A significant proportion of the benefits paid to members are currently increased in line with RPI or CPI inflation.                                                                                                                                                   |\n\n## Changes in average inflation expectations over the lifetime of the plan\n\nAn increase in average inflation expectations will:\n\n- -  increase the IAS 19 liabilities\n- -  increase the value of index-linked bonds, other inflation linked assets and inflation derivatives held by the BTPS\n\n## Changes in inflation over the next year\n\nIf inflation over the next year is lower or higher than assumed, it would lead to a fall or increase in the IAS 19 liabilities. We estimate the change in asset values will broadly offset the movement in both the IAS 19 liabilities and funding liabilities. If inflation is higher than the caps that apply to benefits, the assets will increase by more than the liabilities. Similarly, in a deflationary environment, the asset values are expected to fall by more than the IAS 19 liabilities and funding liabilities since the payments on index-linked gilts would be reduced but pensions paid by the BTPS would not.\n\nA significant proportion of the BTPS assets are invested in growth assets, such as equities and property. Although the BTPS has temporary hedges in place to partly offset the impact of a fall in equity markets, and adopts a diverse portfolio, a fall in these growth assets will increase the IAS 19 and funding deficit.\n\nAn increase in the life expectancy of members will result in benefits being paid out for longer, leading to an increase in the\n\nIAS 19 liabilities and funding liabilities.\n\nThe BTPS holds a longevity insurance contract which covers around 20% of the BTPS's total exposure to improvements\n\nin longevity, providing long-term protection and income to the BTPS in the event that members live longer than currently\n\nexpected.\n\nOther risks include: changes in legislation or regulation which impact the value of the liabilities or assets; and member take-up of options before and at retirement to reshape their benefits. The scale of the BTPS means that investment changes and any future de-risking actions need to be planned and executed carefully, potentially over an extended timeframe or multiple transactions.\n\n## Scenario analysis\n\nThe potential negative impact of these risks is illustrated by the following five scenarios. These have been assessed by BT's independent actuary as scenarios that might occur no more than once in every 20 years. The scenarios have been updated to reflect market experience over the last year.\n\n|                                                                               | 1-in-20 events   | 1-in-20 events   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Scenario                                                                      | 2023             | 2022             |\n| 1.

In practice a combination of events could arise, and the effects are not additive nor are they linear (e.g. doubling the change in bond yields assumed will not exactly double the impact).\n\nGrowth\n\nassets\n\nLife\n\nexpectancy",

The change in impact from FY22 is due to a combination of: changes in the scenarios, the significant fall in asset and liability values over the year, and changes in the scheme's investment strategy in line with the agreed de-risking plan.\n\n## BTPS funding\n\n## Triennial funding valuation\n\nA funding valuation is carried out for the Trustee by a professionally qualified independent actuary at least every three years. The funding valuation assesses the ongoing financial health of the Scheme. If there are insufficient assets to meet the estimated future benefit payments to members (i.e. a funding deficit), BT and the Trustee agree the amount and timing of additional cash contributions. It is prepared using the principles set out in UK Pension legislation, such as the 2004 and 2021 pensions acts, and uses a prudent approach overall when setting the actuarial assumptions. Some of the key differences compared to the IAS 19 deficit are set out in the table below.\n\n|                   | IAS 19                                  | Funding                                                          |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Purpose           | Balance sheet in BT plc accounts        | Assessing the ongoing financial health and setting cash payments |\n| Regulation        | IFRS                                    | 2004 and 2021 pensions acts                                      |\n| Frequency         | Semi-annually                           | At least every three years                                       |\n| Key assumptions   |                                         |                                                                  |\n| Determined by     | BT                                      | BT and BTPS agreement                                            |\n| Discount rate     | Yield curve based on AA corporate bonds | Yield curve reflecting prudent return expected from BTPS assets  |\n| Other assumptions | Best estimate                           | Prudent overall approach                                         |\n\nThe different purpose and principles lead to different assumptions being used, and therefore a different estimate for the liabilities and deficit.\n\nThe next funding valuation is scheduled to take place as at 30 June 2023.

Retirement benefit plans continued\n\n## Interim updates of the funding position (unaudited)\n\nThe Scheme Actuary carried out an interim assessment as at 30 June 2022, estimating the BTPS's funding position to have improved from a deficit of \u00a38.0bn to \u00a34.4bn, predominantly reflecting \u00a33.5bn of contributions from BT. BT and the Trustee will agree cash contributions in the usual way at the next full triennial funding valuation, scheduled to take place as at 30 June 2023.\n\nThe impact of changes in market conditions on the funding liabilities differs to the impact on the IAS 19 liabilities. For example, the funding liabilities use a discount rate linked to a risk-free rate and a fixed margin which is reviewed at each triennial valuation, whereas the IAS 19 liabilities use a discount rate based on corporate bond yields (and so are affected by changes in credit spreads). The chart below illustrates the impact of the scenarios set on page 196 on the 30 June 2022 interim assessment of the funding position.\n\n## Scenario analysis - Funding position at 30 June 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Increase/(decrease) in assets - Physical assets\n- Increase/(decrease) in assets - Derivatives / synthetic assets\n\nThe figures shown in the table apply to the BTPS assets and funding liabilities as at 30 June 2022; an increase in the assets or funding liabilities will increase the impact of the scenarios shown.\n\n## Deficit payments from the Group\n\nThe 2020 funding valuation showed a deficit of \u00a38.0bn, which was agreed to be met as follows:\n\n- -  \u00a32bn of the deficit met through an Asset Backed Funding arrangement (ABF), providing cash payments of \u00a3180m pa which are secured on EE Limited. The BTPS is entitled to the full value of these future payments in the unlikely event that BT becomes insolvent. If the BTPS reaches full funding at any 30 June, the payments to the BTPS will cease.\n- -  Annual cash contributions until June 2023 paid directly to the BTPS\n- -  Annual cash contributions from July 2023 to June 2030 paid either to the BTPS directly, or to a co-investment vehicle where they will be invested as if part of the overall BTPS investment strategy.\n\nThese payments are summarised in the table below:\n\n| Year to 31 March     | 2024   | 2025   | 2026   | 2027   | 2028   | 2029   | 2030   | 2031   | 2032   | 2033   | 2034   |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Payments from BT plc | 610 a  | 600 b  | 600 b  | 600 b  | 600 b  | 600 b  | 600 b  | 500 b  | -      | -      | -      |\n| Payments from ABF    | 180    | 180    | 180    | 180    | 180    | 180    | 180    | 180    | 180    | 180    | 180    |\n| Total                | 790    | 780    | 780    | 780    | 780    | 780    | 780    | 680    | 180    | 180    | 180    |\n\n- a \u00a3500m due by 30 June.\n- b \u00a3490m of each payment due by 30 June. \u00a310m is directly payable to the BTPS, and BT has the option to pay remaining amounts into the co-investment vehicle.\n\n## ABF\n\nThe future payments from the ABF have a present value of \u00a31.4bn at 31 March 2023. The fair value of the ABF is \u00a31.3bn at 31 March 2023 and allows for the probability of the BTPS becoming fully funded, and therefore the payments to the BTPS ending early.\n\nThe fair value of the ABF is included in the assets of the BTPS when assessing the funding deficit. Payments from the ABF to BTPS are treated in the same way as coupon payments from bonds, and do not affect the funding deficit when they are paid.\n\nThe fair value of the ABF is not included in the assets of the BTPS when assessing the IAS 19 deficit in the group consolidated accounts, as it is a non-transferable asset issued by the group. Payments from the ABF to BTPS are treated as deficit contributions, and reduce the IAS 19 deficit, when they are paid.",

The fair value of assets in the co-investment vehicle are included in the assets of the BTPS when assessing the IAS 19 and funding deficits.\n\nThe co-investment vehicle provides BT with some protection against the risk of overfunding by allowing money to be returned to BT if not needed by the BTPS, enabling BT to provide upfront funding with greater confidence.\n\nTo the extent there is a funding deficit at 30 June 2034, the co-investment vehicle will pay funds to the BTPS. BT will receive tax relief on funds paid at this point, rather than in the year when funds are paid from BT into the vehicle. Any remaining funds in the co-investment vehicle will then be returned to BT in three annual payments in 2035, 2036 and 2037, unless the BTPS has subsequently moved into funding deficit or the Trustee, acting prudently but reasonably, decides to defer or reduce these payments.\n\n## Protections for BTPS (going concern)\n\nBT has agreed to provide the Trustee with certain protections. These will predominantly be in place until 2035, or until the Protections Deficit (which is calculated in line with the funding liabilities but with an adjustment to the discount rate) has reduced below \u00a32bn.

When shares held for the beneficial ownership of employees vest unconditionally or are cancelled they are transferred from the own shares reserve to retained earnings at their weighted average cost.\n\n|                           | Treasury   shares a   | Treasury   shares a   | Employee share   ownership trust a   | Employee share   ownership trust a   | Total    | Total   |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|----------|---------|\n|                           | millions              | \u00a3m                    | millions                             | \u00a3m                                   | millions | \u00a3m      |\n| At 1 April 2021           | 51                    | (132)                 | 9                                    | (11)                                 | 60       | (143)   |\n| Own shares purchased b    | -                     | -                     | 114                                  | (210)                                | 114      | (210)   |\n| Yourshare issue           | (1)                   | 2                     | (18)                                 | 34                                   | (19)     | 36      |\n| Share options exercised b | (9)                   | 22                    | -                                    | -                                    | (9)      | 22      |\n| Share awards vested       | -                     | -                     | (11)                                 | 21                                   | (11)     | 21      |\n| At 31 March 2022          | 41                    | (108)                 | 94                                   | (166)                                | 135      | (274)   |\n| Own shares purchased b    | -                     | -                     | 114                                  | (187)                                | 114      | (187)   |\n| Share options exercised b | (5)                   | 14                    | -                                    | -                                    | (5)      | 14      |\n| Share awards vested       | -                     | -                     | (14)                                 | 25                                   | (14)     | 25      |\n| At 31 March 2023          | 36                    | (94)                  | 194                                  | (328)                                | 230      | (422)   |\n\n- a At 31 March 2023, 36,190,551 shares (FY22: 41,429,938) with an aggregate nominal value of \u00a32m (FY22: \u00a32m) were held at cost as treasury shares and 193,798,578 shares (FY22: 94,120,883) with an aggregate nominal value of \u00a310m (FY22: \u00a35m) were held in the Trust.\n\nThe treasury shares reserve represents BT Group plc shares purchased directly by the group.

Share-based payments\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to share-based payments\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe operate a number of equity-settled share-based payment arrangements, under which we receive services from employees in consideration for equity instruments (share options and shares) of the group. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. Market-based performance criteria and non-vesting conditions (for example, the requirement for employees to make contributions to the share purchase programme) are reflected in this measurement of fair value. The fair value determined at the grant date is recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the group's estimate of the options or shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions. Fair value is measured using either the Binomial options pricing model or Monte Carlo simulations, whichever is more appropriate to the share-based payment arrangement.\n\nService and performance conditions are vesting conditions. Any other conditions are non-vesting conditions which are taken into account to determine the fair value of equity instruments granted. In the case that an award or option does not vest as a result of a failure to meet a non-vesting condition that is within the control of either counterparty, this is accounted for as a cancellation. Cancellations are treated as accelerated vesting and all remaining future charges are immediately recognised in the income statement. As the requirement to save under an employee saveshare arrangement is a non-vesting condition, employee cancellations, other than through a termination of service, are treated as an accelerated vesting.\n\nNo adjustment is made to total equity for awards that lapse or are forfeited after the vesting date.\n\n| Year ended 31 March                        | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Employee saveshare plans                   | 21        | 29        |\n| Yourshare                                  | 12        | 28        |\n| Executive share plans:                     |           |           |\n| Incentive Share Plan (ISP)                 | -         | 14        |\n| Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP)                  | 12        | 11        |\n| Retention and Restricted Share Plans (RSP) | 35        | 26        |\n|                                            | 80        | 108       |\n\n## What share incentive arrangements do we have?\n\nOur plans include savings-related share option plans for employees and those of participating subsidiaries and several share plans for executives. All share-based payment plans are equity-settled. Details of these plans are set out below.\n\n## Employee Saveshare Plans\n\nUnder HMRC-approved savings-related share option plans, employees save on a monthly basis, over a three- or five-year period, towards the purchase of shares at a fixed price determined when the option is granted. This price is set at a 20% discount to the market price for five-year plans and 10% for three-year plans. The options must be exercised within six months of maturity of the savings contract, otherwise they lapse. Similar plans operate for our overseas employees. The scheme did not operate in FY23 or FY22.\n\n## Yourshare\n\nIn FY22 and FY21, all eligible employees of the group were awarded \u00a3500 of BT shares. The shares are held in trust for a three-year vesting period after which they will be transferred to employees, providing they have been continuously employed during that time. A similar plan operates for overseas employees.\n\nUnder the terms of Yourshare and the executive share plans, dividends are reinvested in shares that are added to the relevant share awards.\n\n## Incentive Share Plan (ISP)\n\nParticipants are entitled to shares under the ISP in full at the end of a three-year period only if the group has met the relevant predetermined corporate performance measures and if the participants are still employed by the group. The last ISP award was granted in 2019 and vested in 2022. For this award, 40% of each award is linked to a total shareholder return (TSR) target for a comparator group of companies from the beginning of the relevant performance period; 40% is linked to a three-year cumulative normalised free cash flow measure; and 20% to growth in underlying revenue.\n\n## Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP)\n\nAwards are granted annually to selected employees. Shares in the group are transferred to participants at the end of three years if they continue to be employed by the group throughout that period.\n\n## Retention and Restricted Share Plans (RSP)\n\nAwards are granted to selected employees. Shares in the group are transferred to participants at the end of a specified retention or restricted period if they continue to be employed by the group throughout that period.",

Awards under the ISP were valued using Monte Carlo simulations. TSRs are generated for BT and the comparator group at the end of the three-year performance period, using each company's volatility and the cross correlation between pairs of stocks.\n\nVolatility has been determined by reference to BT's historical volatility which is expected to reflect the BT share price in the future. An expected life of six months after vesting date is assumed for Employee Saveshare options. For all other awards the expected life is equal to the vesting period. The risk-free interest rate is based on the UK gilt curve in effect at the time of the grant, for the expected life of the option or award.\n\nThe fair values for the DBP and RSP were determined using the market price of the shares at the grant date.

Divestments and assets & liabilities classified as held for sale\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to divestments and assets & liabilities classified as held for sale\n\nWe classify non-current assets or a group of assets and associated liabilities, together forming a disposal group, as 'held for sale' when their carrying amount will be recovered principally through disposal rather than continuing use and the sale is highly probable. Sale is considered to be highly probable when management are committed to a plan to sell the asset or disposal group and the sale should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed divestment within one year from the date of classification. We measure non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held for sale at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs of disposal. Intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets classified as held for sale are not depreciated or amortised.\n\nUpon completion of a divestment, we recognise a profit or loss on disposal calculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest less costs incurred in disposing of the asset or disposal group and (ii) the carrying amount of the asset or disposal group (including goodwill). The profit or loss on disposal is recognised as a specific item, see note 9.\n\nIn the event that non-current assets or disposal groups held for sale form a separate and identifiable major line of business, the results for both the current and comparative periods are reclassified as 'discontinued operations'.\n\n## Divestments\n\nDuring the year, we completed the disposal of BT Sport operations through forming a sports joint venture (Sports JV) with Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). We recognised a profit on disposal after tax of \u00a328m, see below for further details. We disclosed a profit on disposal after tax of \u00a33m in our Q2 results which has subsequently been adjusted to \u00a328m for FY23. The difference is driven by a \u00a333m increase in the profit on disposal before tax, as a result of correcting certain errors in the provisional calculation of the minimum guarantee liability completed at Q2, offset by an \u00a38m decrease in the related deferred tax credit recorded on the same liability. The difference is not quantitatively material and does not impact qualitative disclosures of our KPIs.\n\nIn FY22 we completed the disposals of Diamond IP, a non-core software business in America, and certain business units in Italy serving customers in the public administration and SME sectors, recording a combined net gain of \u00a335m.\n\nThe disposals in the current or prior year have not been reclassified as discontinued operations as they do not meet our definition of a separate major line of business.\n\nThe net consideration recognised on completion of these divestments was as follows:\n\n|                                                            | 2023 a \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-----------|\n| Intangible assets (including goodwill) b                   | 88          | 12        |\n| Property, plant and equipment                              | 13          | 6         |\n| Right-of-use assets                                        | 1           | 1         |\n| Other assets c                                             | 760         | 27        |\n| Liabilities c                                              | (357)       | (15)      |\n| Net assets of operations disposed                          | 505         | 31        |\n| Recycling from translation reserve                         | -           | (1)       |\n| Net financial liabilities recognised d                     | 534         | -         |\n| Net impact on the consolidated balance sheet               | 1,039       | 30        |\n| Profit on disposal, after tax e                            | 28          | 41        |\n| Net consideration                                          | 1,067       | 71        |\n| Satisfied by                                               |             |           |\n| Proceeds received in the year per the cash flow statement  | 29          | 76        |\n| Deferred cash consideration f                              | 70          | (2)       |\n| Investment in A preference shares in Sports JV (note 25)   | 428         | -         |\n| Investment in C preference shares in Sports JV (note 25) g | 161         | -         |\n| Ordinary equity interest in Sports JV (note 25)            | 414         | -         |\n| Transaction costs                                          | (35)        | (3)       |\n| Net consideration                                          | 1,067       | 71        |\n\n- a Balances in FY23 only include the BT Sport disposal.\n- b Includes allocated goodwill of \u00a383m (FY22: \u00a37m).\n- c Other assets includes \u00a3632m of capitalised programme rights (note 16) and \u00a3104m prepayments relating to rights payments made for licence periods that had not yet started.

Divestments and assets & liabilities classified as held for sale continued\n\n## BT Sport\n\nIn August 2022 the group formed a sports joint venture (Sports JV) with Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) combining BT Sport and WBD's Eurosport UK business. As part of the transaction, the group's wholly owned subsidiary, British Telecommunications plc (BT plc or BT) and WBD has each contributed, sub-licensed or delivered the benefit of their respective sports rights and distribution businesses for the UK & Ireland to the Sports JV. Both parties each hold a 50% interest and equal voting rights in the Sports JV.\n\nBT Sport's distribution agreement with Virgin Media has transferred to the Sports JV, and the Sports JV has also entered into a new agreement with Sky extending beyond 2030 to provide for its distribution of the Sports JV's combined sports content.\n\nThe production and operational assets of BT Sport have transferred to WBD who will manage and operate the production of the Sports JV's sport content.\n\nBT plc has entered into a distribution agreement with the Sports JV to procure the sport content required to continue to supply our broadband, TV and mobile customers. BT plc's agreement with the Sports JV will extend beyond 2030 and for the first four years includes a minimum revenue guarantee of approximately \u00a3500m per annum, after which the agreement will change to a fully variable arrangement.\n\nAt completion of the transaction, BT no longer has control of the BT Sport operations based on the assessment of ownership and joint control over the key decisions of the Sports JV (50/50 with WBD) established through the Sports JV agreement. The group's retained ordinary equity interest in the combined business has been classified as a joint venture under IFRS 11.\n\nWBD will have the option to acquire BT plc's 50% interest in the Sports JV at specified points during the first four years of the Sports JV (Call Option). The price payable under the Call Option will be 50% of the fair market value of the Sports JV to be determined at the time of the exercise, plus any unpaid fixed consideration and remaining earn-out as described below. If the Call Option is not exercised, BT plc will have the ability to exit its shareholding in the Sports JV either through a sale or IPO after the initial four-year period.\n\n## Critical & key accounting estimates and significant judgements made in accounting for the BT Sport disposal\n\n## Assessment of whether BT has joint control over the Sports JV\n\nSee note 25 for assessment on control.\n\n## Valuation of investment in A preference shares (akin to contingent consideration)\n\nBT will receive an earn-out from the Sports JV (subject to liquidity and usual UK company law requirements), which will end at the earliest of:\n\n- -  four years post completion of the transaction;\n- -  the exercise by WBD of the Call Option; and\n- -  if the earn-out reaches an agreed cap.\n\nThe earn-out cash flows to BT are dependent on the cash profit generation of the Sports JV over the earn-out period and is therefore akin to contingent consideration, initially recorded at a fair value of \u00a3428m reflecting the present value of expected cash flows. The valuation of the earn-out consideration is supported by a jointly-agreed business plan and internal valuation model.\n\nThe key assumptions within the jointly-agreed business plan and internal valuation model are:\n\n- -  approximately 50% of revenues and 80% of costs during the four years of the jointly-agreed business plan are contractually committed;\n- -  material contracts are renewed at an economic value no less than current terms;\n- -  the total premium sports subscriber base does not materially grow or decline over the earn-out period; and\n- -  revenue growth and production costs are driven by contractual terms.\n\nWe have also assumed that the earn-out period ends at four years post completion of the transaction; however given the mechanics of the deal arrangements if there is an earlier exercise by WBD of their Call Option this would also not materially impact the amounts disclosed in the financial statements.\n\nSubsequent to the initial recognition, the group's carried forward investment in A preference shares will be remeasured to fair value at each reporting date in accordance with IFRS 9, see note 25.",

        "page_content": "## 23. Divestments and assets & liabilities classified as held for sale continued\n\n## Valuation of the minimum revenue guarantee in BT's distribution agreement with the Sports JV\n\nBT plc's obligation under the minimum revenue guarantee of c. \u00a32bn over the first four years of the Sports JV represents both a trading arrangement on market terms and a financing arrangement for the off-market element of the revenue guarantee, which has been recorded as a financial liability within trade and other payables on the balance sheet. The liability will be held at amortised cost and will unwind through payments made to the Sports JV over the next four years on the minimum revenue guarantee.\n\nThe valuation of this financial liability, and what a fair cost-per-subscriber would be, is sensitive to a number of assumptions on volumes and price, and there is a range of outcomes which we could have arrived at. Alternative scenarios considered, based on the different prices and terms used with other market participants, could have resulted in a liability ranging from \u00a3543m to \u00a3837m, and we initially recognised a financial liability of \u00a3712m.\n\nThe key assumptions in calculating the financial liability are in estimating what is a market wholesale price at market volume commitment that is supported by the forecast volumes for the related revenue streams. The volumes used are consistent with those included in the jointly-agreed business plan as described above. We note that the bottom of the range disclosed above is based on the price that we will pay after four years when the minimum revenue guarantee has ended, however we do not believe that is an appropriate rate from the outset due to existing volume commitments.\n\n## Valuation of BT's equity interest in the Sports JV\n\nWBD will have the option to acquire BT plc's 50% interest in the Sports JV at specified points during the first four years of the Sports JV. If the Call Option is not exercised, BT will have the ability to exit its shareholding in the JV either through a sale or IPO.\n\nThe group has valued its interest in the Sports JV based on the estimated fair value at exit and using the following key assumptions:\n\n- -  BT expect to realise its interest in the Sports JV through exit rather than ongoing value in use;\n- -  BT expect WBD to exercise its option to acquire BT's 50% interest in the Sports JV at the end of the first four years of the Sports JV; and\n- -  An earnings multiple has been applied to the expected year 5 EBITDA per the jointly-agreed business plan - the multiple is at the lower end of a possible range identified from comparable peers and transactions in the premium sports subscription and broadcasting market.\n\nAs the group's interest is recorded on a point in time valuation, based on forecast earnings and current market returns on similar investments, it carries both upside and downside risk from changes in micro- and macroeconomic factors affecting the sports content subscription market and risk appetite of investors in that market.\n\nWe have applied the following sensitivities on these risk factors:\n\n- -  EBITDA impact from revenue loss due to ongoing cost of living pressures or changes in the Sports JV's rights portfolio;\n- -  An increase or decrease in the valuation multiple achieved; and\n- -  An increase or decrease in the discount rate applied.\n\nNone of these sensitivities individually resulted in a material change to the investment value. All downside or upside factors in combination could lead to a \u00a370m decrease or \u00a3200m increase in the fair value respectively. However, in our view, combining all downside factors is not a reasonable scenario given the financial and commercial levers available to both the JV and BT to mitigate the impact; and we have taken a prudent approach in not recognising a higher investment value upfront based on possible but uncertain changes in market conditions in the future.\n\nThe investment will be subsequently accounted for using the equity method and will be subject to impairment testing at each reporting period, with any impairment losses recognised through specific items, see note 25.\n\n## Discounting of cash flows\n\nAll cash flows expected to be received or paid over time have been discounted at a rate applicable to the risks associated with the cash flows:\n\n- -  Deferred payments due to BT from WBD have been discounted at an appropriate post-tax cost of debt (3.3%);\n- -  BT's earn-out from the Sports JV has been discounted at the weighted average cost of capital for the Sports JV at completion date (6.7%); and\n- -  BT's commitments under the minimum guarantee have been discounted at the group's post-tax cost of debt (2.8%).\n\nWe do not consider the net present value of the transaction would be materially affected by a reasonable change in the discount rate.\n\n## Assets and liabilities held for sale\n\nAssets and liabilities held for sale at 31 March 2023 relate to certain city fibre networks and associated infrastructure assets in Germany and Pelipod Limited, a connected-locker business used in our UK supply chain operations. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) formally opened its investigation into the proposed disposal of Pelipod Limited on 29 March 2023 which we expect to conclude by 31 May 2023. We have classified the business as held for sale on the basis that the IFRS 5 criteria have been met at 31 March 2023.\n\nIn FY22, the group had one disposal group held for sale, BT Sport.\n\nThe assets of the disposal groups have been tested for impairment under existing relevant standards immediately prior to classification as held for sale with no impairment recognised. As the estimated fair value from the transactions, net of any costs incurred or liabilities recognised, is higher than the carrying value of the disposal group, no impairment has been recognised subsequent to classification as held for sale.",

Divestments and assets & liabilities classified as held for sale continued\n\nWhere the group is disposing of 100% of underlying operations and assets, we used the selling price agreed with the prospective purchaser as the fair value for the impairment test, which was classified as Level 3 on the fair value hierarchy. For the BT Sport transaction, we used the discounted cash flows due to BT over the first four years of the Sports JV, plus a potential exit value from the sale of the group's equity interest, as total gross consideration; BT's obligation under the minimum revenue guarantee in the distribution agreement has been treated as a reduction to the fair value of the consideration in the impairment test.

Joint ventures and associates continued\n\n## Accounting policies adopted by the Sports JV\n\nThe Sports JV has a financial year-end of 31 July and therefore has not yet prepared its first set of audited financial statements. In order to recognise our share of the Sports JV's results for our equity-accounted investment, we have prepared the Sports JV's financial information disclosed below based on management accounts for the period ending 31 March 2023 after making certain adjustments to comply with IFRS.\n\nSignificant judgements made in preparing the Sports JV's financial information:\n\n- -  IFRS 3 acquisition accounting should be applied by the Sports JV over the business combination achieved through the transfer of the BT Sport and Eurosport UK businesses from BT and WBD respectively, recognising acquired intangibles on the current and future value of programme rights, and goodwill.\n- -  Revenues from the minimum guarantee in the Sports JV's distribution agreement with BT should be adjusted to reflect a trading agreement on market terms with a separate financing arrangement for the off-market portion accounted for under IFRS 9 - this mirrors the accounting treatment applied by BT (see note 23).\n- -  A and C preference shares issued by the Sports JV to BT should be classified as a financial liability at fair value through profit or loss under IFRS 9.\n- -  Hedge accounting should be applied on the Sports JV's forward contracts with BT (see note 31) with fair value movements on the derivatives recognised in other comprehensive income and held in the cash flow hedge reserve until recycle on settlement of the forward contracts.\n- -  Programme rights should be recognised on the balance sheet from the point at which the licence period begins and are consumed by the Sports JV on a straight-line basis over the programming period which is generally 12 months - this is consistent with the group's accounting policy (see note 16).\n\nAccounting policies in other areas are consistent with those applied by the group.\n\n## Ordinary equity shares\n\nOn completion of the BT Sport transaction, the group recorded an investment in joint venture at an initial fair value of \u00a3414m, relating to our retained ordinary equity interest in the Sports JV entity, in accordance with IFRS 10 and IAS 28. The group has valued this interest in the Sports JV at the estimated fair value at exit, see note 23. Consistent with our accounting policy on associates and joint ventures, we will recognise our share of the change in the Sports JV's net assets under the equity method of accounting.\n\n| Year ended 31 March                                               | 2023 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Group's equity-accounted investment in the Sports JV at formation | 414       |\n| Share of total comprehensive loss                                 | (62)      |\n| Dividends received during the year                                | -         |\n| Carrying amount at the end of the year                            | 352       |\n\nAs required by IAS 36, we have assessed the investment for impairment. There is no impairment at 31 March 2023 as the fair value less costs to sell is higher than the carrying amount of the investment. See below for sensitivities we have applied in determining the fair value less costs to sell.\n\nThe following is summarised and unaudited financial information for the Sports JV prepared in accordance with IFRS and including adjustments required to align with the group's accounting policies and provisional fair value adjustments. These results are subject to true-up within the 12 months from Sports JV formation, however any adjustments are not expected to materially impact our share of the Sports JV's results recorded in the period.\n\n| Summarised statement of total comprehensive income for year ended 31 March   | 2023 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Revenue                                                                      | 557       |\n| Loss for the year a                                                          | (121)     |\n| Other comprehensive loss                                                     | (2)       |\n| Total comprehensive loss                                                     | (123)     |\n| Summarised balance sheet at 31 March                                         | 2023 \u00a3m   |\n| Current assets b                                                             | 1,106     |\n| Non-current assets c                                                         | 1,236     |\n| Current liabilities d                                                        | (702)     |\n| Non-current liabilities e                                                    | (543)     |\n| Net assets                                                                   | 1,097     |\n\n- d Includes current financial liabilities (excluding trade and other payables and provisions) of \u00a3(281)m of which \u00a3(268)m relates to the outstanding liability on the RCF provided by BT (see note 24).\n- e Includes non-current financial liabilities (excluding trade and other payables and provisions) of \u00a3(416)m.",

        "page_content": "## 25. Joint ventures and associates continued\n\nThe Sports JV's accounting loss for the year reflects amortisation of acquired intangibles from the BT Sport and Eurosport business transfers, reduced revenues from IFRS 15 adjustments for the off-market minimum guarantee with BT (see note 23) and underperformance against business plan. Underperformance has been driven by cost of living pressures affecting the premium sports subscription market and impacts from a prolonged winter break in European club football from the World Cup. Underlying trading, before accounting adjustments, is expected to recover in the medium to long term as wider macroeconomic and inflationary pressures ease and through the Sports JV reducing its cost base to mitigate any future revenue loss.\n\n## Preference shares\n\nIn addition to BT's ordinary shareholding, BT held the following investments in preference shares in the Sports JV that have not been included within the equity-accounted interest above.\n\n| At 31 March                       |   2023 \u00a3m | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Investment in A preference shares |       429 | -         |\n| Investment in C preference shares |       126 | -         |\n| Total                             |       555 | -         |\n\n- -A preference shares - we expect these shares to be redeemed by the Sports JV over the 4-year earn-out period in order to effect the distribution of cash to BT under our earn-out entitlement. The fair value of the shares is driven by the underlying cash profit generation of the Sports JV and therefore have been classified as a fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) financial asset under IFRS 9. In our view, the cash flows due to BT from the A preference shares are akin to contingent consideration and therefore the fair value of \u00a3428m on initial recognition has been included in the consideration within the profit on disposal recognised on the BT Sport transaction (see note 23). Subsequent to the initial recognition, \u00a31m of fair value gain has been recognised through specific items (see note 9) driven by an increase in forecasted cash flows offset by an increase in the discount rate applied to cash flows.\n- -C preference shares - these shares are expected to be sold to WBD at the end of BT's earn-out entitlement in consideration for any sports rights funded by BT at that point and have been recognised as a financial asset held at FVTPL under IFRS 9. In our view, the cash flows due to BT from the C preference shares are akin to deferred consideration and therefore the fair value of \u00a3161m on initial recognition has been included in the consideration within the profit on disposal recognised on the BT Sport transaction (see note 23). Subsequent to the initial recognition, \u00a335m of fair value loss has been recognised through specific items (see note 9) driven by an expected reduction in the Sports JV's cost base to mitigate short- to medium-term revenue loss, which will reduce the expected payment to BT for pre-funded sports rights.\n\nThe preference shares are held at Level 3 on the fair value hierarchy, reflecting a valuation methodology that does not use inputs based on observable market data. See note 24 for further details on fair value estimation. See below for sensitivities we have applied in determining the fair value.\n\n## Sensitivities\n\nThe group's ordinary equity and preference share investments in the Sports JV, carry both upside and downside risk from changes in micro and macroeconomic factors affecting the sports content subscription market and risk appetite of investors in that market.\n\nWe have applied the following sensitivities to these risk factors:\n\n- -  EBITDA decline from loss of material sports rights or a significant decline in the Sports JV's revenues from ongoing cost of living pressures;\n- -  EBITDA improvement from outperformance against revised forecasts, particularly with respect to wholesale revenues;\n- -  an increase or decrease in the valuation multiple achieved; and\n- -  an increase or decrease in the discount rate applied.\n\n| Sensitivity                                | Fair value of A and C preference  shares in Sports JV   | Headroom on impairment test over  equity-accounted investment   |\n|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 5% increase or decrease in EBITDA          | +/- \u00a332m                                                | +/- \u00a326m                                                        |\n| 10pp increase or decrease in discount rate | +/- \u00a38m                                                 | +/- \u00a315m                                                        |\n| 10% change in valuation multiple           | -                                                       | +/- \u00a352m                                                        |\n\nNone of these sensitivities generated an impairment on the group's equity-accounted investment in the Sports JV. Headroom on the investment has increased since formation of the Sports JV driven by an expected increase in long-term value from the Sports JV reducing its cost base.",

All are held at amortised cost on the balance sheet, equating to fair value.\n\nFor the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are as defined above net of outstanding bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are included within the current element of loans and other borrowings (note 27).\n\n| At 31 March                                           | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cash at bank and in hand                              | 336       | 324       |\n| Cash equivalents                                      |           |           |\n| UK deposits                                           | -         | 353       |\n| Indian rupee deposits                                 | 55        | 90        |\n| Other deposits                                        | 1         | 10        |\n| Total cash equivalents a                              | 56        | 453       |\n| Total cash and cash equivalents                       | 392       | 777       |\n| Bank overdrafts (note 27)                             | (11)      | (85)      |\n| Cash and cash equivalents per the cash flow statement | 381       | 692       |\n\nCash and cash equivalents include restricted cash of \u00a3131m (FY22: \u00a324m), of which \u00a323m (FY22: \u00a322m) was held in countries where local capital or exchange controls currently prevent us from accessing cash balances. The remaining balance of \u00a3108m (FY22: \u00a32m) was held in escrow accounts, or in commercial arrangements akin to escrow.\n\nFollowing an IFRIC agenda decision relating to demand deposits the group identified one bank account with restrictions on use that nonetheless meets the IAS 7 definition of cash. This bank account, which has a balance of \u00a396m (FY22: \u00a3148m) is now reflected in cash and cash equivalents. Comparatives have not been restated as the impact is not considered material. Please see note 1 for further information.\n\n## 27. Loans and other borrowings\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to loans and other borrowings\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe initially recognise loans and other borrowings at the fair value of amounts received net of transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method and, if included in a fair value hedge relationship, are re-valued to reflect the fair value movements on the associated hedged risk. The resulting amortisation of fair value movements, on de-designation of the hedge, is recognised in the income statement.\n\n## What's our capital management policy?\n\nThe objective of our capital management policy is to target an overall level of debt consistent with our credit rating target while investing in the business, supporting the pension scheme and meeting our distribution policy. In order to meet this objective, we may issue or repay debt, issue new shares, repurchase shares, or adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders. We manage the capital structure and make adjustments to it accordingly to reflect changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the group. The Board regularly reviews the capital structure. No changes were made to these objectives and processes during FY23. For details of share issues and repurchases in the year see note 21.\n\nOur capital structure consists of net debt and shareholders' equity. The analysis below summarises the components which we manage as capital.\n\n| At 31 March                         | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|-------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Net debt                            | 18,859    | 18,009    |\n| Total parent shareholders' equity a | 14,490    | 15,274    |\n| Capital structure                   | 33,349    | 33,283    |\n\n- a Excludes non-controlling interests of \u00a324m (FY22: \u00a322m).",

The fair value of listed bonds is \u00a316,979m (FY22: \u00a316,750m).\n\nThe fair value of our listed bonds is estimated on the basis of quoted market prices (Level 1).\n\nThe carrying amount of other loans and bank overdrafts equates to fair value due to the short maturity of these items (Level 3).\n\nThe interest rates payable on loans and borrowings disclosed above reflect the coupons on the underlying issued loans and borrowings and not the interest rates achieved through applying associated cross-currency and interest rate swaps in hedge arrangements.\n\nDuring the period the group entered into the sale of cash flows related to contract assets related to mobile handsets where the performance obligations have been substantially delivered to the customer in the amount of \u00a3100m (FY22: \u00a3nil). The right to receive cash is dependent on the group's further performance in relation to airtime and so a financial liability has been recognised and the related cash flows have been included within financing activities in the cash flow statement.",

Financial instruments and risk management\n\nWe issue or hold financial instruments mainly to finance our operations; to finance corporate transactions such as share buybacks and acquisitions; for the temporary investment of short-term funds; and to manage currency and interest rate risks. In addition, various financial instruments, for example trade receivables and payables arise directly from operations.\n\n## How do we manage financial risk?\n\nOur activities expose us to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.\n\n## Treasury operation\n\nWe have a centralised treasury operation whose primary role is to manage liquidity and funding requirements as well as our exposure to associated market risks, and credit risk.\n\n## Treasury policy\n\nTreasury policy is set by the Board. Group treasury activities are subject to a set of controls appropriate for the magnitude of borrowing, investments and group-wide exposures. The Board has delegated authority to operate these policies to a series of panels responsible for the management of key treasury risks and operations. Appointment to and removal from the key panels requires approval from two of the following: the Chairman, the Chief Executive or the Chief Financial Officer.\n\nThere has been no change in the nature of our risk profile between 31 March 2023 and the date of approval of these financial statements.\n\n## How do we manage interest rate risk?\n\n## Management policy\n\nInterest rate risk arises primarily from our long-term borrowings. Interest cash flow risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates, partially offset by cash held at variable rates. Fair value interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at fixed rates.\n\nOur policy, as set by the Board, is to ensure that at least 70% of ongoing net debt is at fixed rates. Short-term interest rate management is delegated to the treasury operation while long-term interest rate management decisions require further approval by the chief financial officer, the corporate finance director or the group treasury director who each have been delegated such authority from the Board.\n\n## Hedging strategy\n\nIn order to manage our interest rate profile, we enter into cross-currency and interest rate swap agreements to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are fixed. The duration of the swap agreements matches the duration of the debt instruments. The majority of the group's long-term borrowings are subject to fixed sterling interest rates after applying the impact of these hedging instruments.\n\n## How do we manage foreign exchange risk?\n\n## Management policy\n\nForeign currency hedging activities protect the group from the risk that changes in exchange rates will adversely affect future net cash flows.\n\nThe Board's policy for foreign exchange risk management defines the types of transactions typically covered, including significant operational, funding and currency interest exposures, and the period over which cover should extend for each type of transaction.\n\nThe Board has delegated short-term foreign exchange management to the treasury operation and long-term foreign exchange management decisions require further approval from the chief financial officer, the corporate finance director or the group treasury director.\n\n## Hedging strategy\n\nA significant proportion of our external revenue and costs arise within the UK and are denominated in sterling. Our non-UK operations generally trade and are funded in their functional currency which limits their exposure to foreign exchange volatility.\n\nWe enter into forward currency contracts to hedge foreign currency capital purchases, purchase and sale commitments, interest expense and foreign currency investments. The commitments hedged are principally denominated in US dollar, euro, Indian rupees and Hungarian forint. As a result, our exposure to foreign currency arises mainly on non-UK subsidiary investments and on residual currency trading flows.",

To demonstrate this volatility, management has concluded that the following are reasonable benchmarks for performing sensitivity analysis:\n\n- -  For interest, a 1% increase in interest rates and parallel shift in yield curves across sterling, US dollar and euro currencies.\n- -  For foreign exchange, a 10% strengthening of sterling against other currencies.\n\nThe impact on equity, before tax and excluding any impact related to retirement benefit plans, of a 1% increase in interest rates and a 10% strengthening of sterling against other currencies is as detailed below:\n\n| At 31 March              | 2023 \u00a3m  Increase  (reduce)   | 2022 \u00a3m  Increase  (reduce)   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Sterling interest rates  | 579                           | 666                           |\n| US dollar interest rates | (371)                         | (429)                         |\n| Euro interest rates      | (284)                         | (247)                         |\n| Sterling strengthening   | (169)                         | (203)                         |\n\nA 1% decrease in interest rates and 10% weakening of sterling against other currencies would have broadly the same impact in the opposite direction.\n\nThe impact of a 1% change in interest rates on the group's annual net finance expense and our exposure to foreign exchange volatility in the income statement, after hedging, (excluding translation exposures) would not have been material in FY23 and FY22.\n\n## Credit ratings\n\nWe continue to target a BBB+/Baa1 credit rating over the cycle, with a BBB/Baa2 floor. We regularly review the liquidity of the group and our funding strategy takes account of medium-term requirements. These include the pension deficit and shareholder distributions.\n\nOur December 2030 bond contains terms that require us to pay higher rates of interest when our credit ratings are below A3 in the case of Moody's or A- in the case of Standard & Poor's (S&P). Additional interest of 0.25% per year accrues for each ratings category downgrade by each agency below those levels effective from the next coupon date following a downgrade. Based on the total notional value of debt outstanding of \u00a32.2bn at 31 March 2023, our finance expense would increase/decrease by approximately \u00a311m a year if the group's credit rating were to be downgraded/upgraded, respectively, by one credit rating category by both agencies.\n\nOur credit ratings were as detailed below:\n\n|                   | 2023   | 2023    | 2022   | 2022     |\n|-------------------|--------|---------|--------|----------|\n| At 31 March       | Rating | Outlook | Rating | Outlook  |\n| Rating agency     |        |         |        |          |\n| Fitch             | BBB    | Stable  | BBB    | Stable   |\n| Moody's           | Baa2   | Stable  | Baa2   | Negative |\n| Standard & Poor's | BBB    | Stable  | BBB    | Stable   |",

        "page_content": "## 29. Financial instruments and risk management continued\n\n## How do we manage liquidity risk?\n\n## Management policy\n\nWe maintain liquidity by entering into short and long-term financial instruments to support operational and other funding requirements, determined by using short- and long-term cash forecasts. These forecasts are supplemented by a financial headroom analysis which is used to assess funding adequacy for at least a 12-month period. On at least an annual basis the Board reviews and approves the long-term funding requirements of the group and on an ongoing basis considers any related matters. We manage refinancing risk by limiting the amount of borrowing that matures within any specified period and having appropriate strategies in place to manage refinancing needs as they arise. The maturity profile of our loans and borrowings at 31 March 2023 is disclosed in note 27. We have term debt maturities of \u00a30.8bn in FY24.\n\nOur treasury operation reviews and manages our short-term requirements within the parameters of the policies set by the Board. We hold cash, cash equivalents and current investments in order to manage short-term liquidity requirements. At 31 March 2023 we had undrawn committed borrowing facilities of \u00a32.1bn (FY22: \u00a32.1bn) maturing in March 2027.\n\nThe following table provides an analysis of the remaining cash flows including interest payable for our non-derivative financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis, which may therefore differ from both the carrying value and fair value.\n\n| Non-derivative financial liabilities At 31 March 2023   | Loans and  other  borrowings \u00a3m   | Interest   on loans  and other  borrowings \u00a3m   | Trade and  other  payables \u00a3m   | Provisions \u00a3m   | Lease   liabilities \u00a3m   | Total \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|------------|\n| Due within one year                                     | 1,512                             | 643                                             | 5,451                           | 3               | 800                      | 8,409      |\n| Between one and two years                               | 1,165                             | 637                                             | -

counterparty have the right to terminate the swap on certain dates. If the break clause was exercised, the mark to market position would be settled in cash.\n- b Foreign currency-related cash flows were translated at closing foreign exchange rates as at the relevant reporting date. Future variable interest rate cash flows were calculated using the most recent rate applied at the relevant balance sheet date.\n\n## How do we manage energy price risk?\n\n## Management policy\n\nUK (excluding Northern Ireland) and European energy prices continue to be exposed to volatility driven by fears of reduced gas supply as Europe continues the shift from Russian gas to LNG and renewables (which themselves are subject to short-term fluctuations given their intermittent nature). In order to manage our exposure to fluctuating energy prices, we have a target for UK (excluding Northern Ireland) energy demand to be at least 80% hedged one quarter before the start of the next financial year, and 50% hedged for the following financial year. We achieve this through forward over the counter hedges and a mixture of new and existing power purchase agreements (PPAs) and derivative virtual PPAs (vPPAs).\n\n## Hedging strategy\n\nIn each financial year our strategy is to build our PPA and vPPA portfolio, exploring opportunities with 5-10 year contracts delivering favourable net present values. We complement this by monitoring the markets and forward purchasing electricity (power) when the market is favourable. In the forthcoming financial year (FY24) the aim is to be 95% hedged, which allows for headroom for increased outputs from the renewable sources should weather conditions prevail.\n\n## How do we manage credit risk?\n\n## Management policy\n\nOur exposure to credit risk arises from financial assets transacted by the treasury operation (primarily derivatives, investments, cash and cash equivalents) and from trading-related receivables.\n\nFor treasury-related balances, the Board's defined policy restricts exposure to any one counterparty by setting credit limits based on the credit quality as defined by Moody's and Standard & Poor's. The minimum credit ratings permitted with counterparties in respect of new transactions are A3/A- for long-term and P1/A1 for short-term investments. If counterparties in respect of existing transactions fall below the permitted criteria we will take action where appropriate.\n\nThe treasury operation continuously reviews the limits applied to counterparties and will adjust the limit according to the nature and credit standing of the counterparty, and in response to market conditions, up to the maximum allowable limit set by the Board.\n\n## Operational management policy\n\nOur credit policy for trading-related financial assets is applied and managed by each of the customer-facing units (CFUs) to ensure compliance. The policy requires that the creditworthiness and financial strength of customers are assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis. Payment terms are set in accordance with industry standards. Where appropriate, we may minimise risks by requesting securities such as deposits, guarantees and letters of credit. We take proactive steps including constantly reviewing credit ratings of counterparties to minimise the impact of adverse market conditions on trading-related financial assets.",

Where multiple transactions are undertaken with a single financial counterparty or group of related counterparties, we enter into netting arrangements to reduce our exposure to credit risk by making use of standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) documentation. We have also entered into credit support agreements with certain swap counterparties whereby, on a daily, weekly and monthly basis, the fair value position on notional \u00a32,024m (FY22: \u00a32,024m) of long-dated cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps is collateralised.\n\n## Offsetting of financial instruments\n\nThe table below shows our financial assets and liabilities that are subject to offset in the group's balance sheet and the impact of enforceable master netting or similar agreements.\n\n|                                                   |                                             | Related amounts not set off in the balance sheet     | Related amounts not set off in the balance sheet   | Related amounts not set off in the balance sheet   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|\n| Financial assets and liabilities At 31 March 2023 | Amounts  presented in the  balance sheet \u00a3m | Right of set off  with derivative  counterparties \u00a3m | Cash  collateral \u00a3m                                | Net  amount \u00a3m                                     |\n| Derivative financial assets                       | 1,479                                       | (323)                                                | (557)                                              | 599                                                |\n| Derivative financial liabilities                  | (383)                                       | 323                                                  | 48                                                 | (12)                                               |\n| Total                                             | 1,096                                       | -                                                    | (509)                                              | 587                                                |\n| At 31 March 2022                                  |                                             |                                                      |                                                    |                                                    |\n| Derivative financial assets                       | 1,091                                       | (431)                                                | (555)                                              | 105                                                |\n| Derivative financial liabilities                  | (870)                                       | 431                                                  | 67                                                 | (372)                                              |\n| Total                                             | 221                                         | -                                                    | (488)                                              | (267)                                              |\n\n## Derivatives and hedging\n\nWe use derivative financial instruments mainly to reduce exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks.

Financial instruments and risk management continued\n\n## Significant accounting policies that apply to derivatives and hedge accounting\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAll of our derivative financial instruments are held at fair value on the balance sheet.\n\n## Derivatives designated in a cash flow hedge\n\nThe group designates certain derivatives in a cash flow hedge relationship. Where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the hedge. To qualify for hedge accounting, hedge documentation must be prepared at inception, the hedge must be in line with BT's risk management strategy and there must be an economic relationship based on the currency, amount and timing of the respective cash flows of the hedging instrument and hedged item. This is assessed at inception and in subsequent periods in which the hedge remains in operation. Hedge accounting is discontinued when it is no longer in line with BT's risk management strategy or if it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.\n\nThe group targets a one-to-one hedge ratio. The economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument is assessed on an ongoing basis. Ineffectiveness can arise from subsequent change in the forecast transactions as a result of altered timing, cash flows or value.\n\nWhen a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity. For cash flow hedges of recognised assets or liabilities, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the same line of the income statement and in the same period or periods that the hedged transaction affects the income statement. Any ineffectiveness arising on a cash flow hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\n## Other derivatives\n\nOur policy is not to use derivatives for trading purposes. However, due to the complex nature of hedge accounting, some derivatives may not qualify for hedge accounting, or may be specifically not designated as a hedge because natural offset is more appropriate. We effectively operate a process to identify any embedded derivatives within revenue, supply, leasing and financing contracts, including those relating to inflationary features. These derivatives are classified as fair value through profit and loss and are recognised at fair value. Any direct transaction costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. Gains and losses on re-measurement are recognised in the income statement in the line that most appropriately reflects the nature of the item or transaction to which they relate.\n\nWhere the fair value of a derivative contract at initial recognition is not supported by observable market data and differs from the transaction price, a day one gain or loss will arise which is not recognised in the income statement. Such gains and losses are deferred and amortised to the income statement based on the remaining contractual term and as observable market data becomes available.\n\nThe fair values of outstanding swaps and foreign exchange contracts are estimated using discounted cash flow models and market rates of interest and foreign exchange at the balance sheet date.\n\n| At 31 March 2023                | Current  asset \u00a3m   | Non-current  asset \u00a3m   | Current  liability \u00a3m   | Non-current  liability \u00a3m   |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Designated in a cash flow hedge | 78                  | 1,330                   | 62                      | 255                         |\n| Other                           | 4                   | 67                      | 24                      | 42                          |\n| Total derivatives               | 82                  | 1,397                   | 86                      | 297                         |\n| At 31 March 2022                |                     |                         |                         |                             |\n| Designated in a cash flow hedge | 77                  | 878                     | 25                      | 712                         |\n| Other                           | 11                  | 125                     | 26                      | 107                         |\n| Total derivatives               | 88                  | 1,003                   | 51                      | 819                         |\n\nAll derivative financial instruments are categorised at Level 2, with the exception of the energy contracts which are categorised at Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as defined in note 24.\n\nInstruments designated in a cash flow hedge include interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps hedging euro, US dollar and Japanese yen- denominated borrowings.

It is initially recognised in other comprehensive income and accounted for similarly to gains or losses in the cash flow reserve.\n- c The translation reserve is used to record cumulative translation differences on the net assets of foreign operations. The cumulative translation differences are recycled to the income statement on disposal of the foreign operation.\n- d Movement in translation reserve includes \u00a3nil (FY22: \u00a31m) which relate to disposals (see note 23).\n- e Excludes \u00a32m (FY22: \u00a31m) of exchange differences in relation to retained earnings attributed to non-controlling interests.\n- f The large swing in the year of \u00a31,055m (FY22: \u00a3204m) was due to large fluctuations in interest rates, energy prices and foreign exchange rates.\n- g Movements in cash flow hedge-related reserves recognised in income and expense of \u00a3713m (FY22: \u00a354m) include a net charge to other comprehensive income of \u00a3679m (FY22: \u00a3126m) which have been reclassified to operating costs, and a net charge of \u00a334m (FY22: credit of \u00a372m) which have been reclassified to finance expense (see note 28).\n- h Realised profit includes profit on disposal of investments held at fair value through other comprehensive income.\n- i Reclassification on cash flow hedges includes \u00a3472m (FY22: \u00a3nil) reclassification from cash flow hedge reserve to cost of hedging reserve.",

Compensation of key management personnel is disclosed in note 6.\n\nAmounts paid to the group's retirement benefit plans are set out in note 20.\n\nAssociates and joint ventures related parties include the Sports JV formed in August 2022 (see note 23). Sales of services to the Sports JV during FY23 were \u00a323m and purchases from the Sports JV were \u00a3176m. The amount receivable from the Sports JV as at 31 March 2023 was \u00a310m and the amount payable to the Sports JV was \u00a3123m.\n\nAs part of the BT Sport transaction, the group has committed to providing the Sports JV with a sterling Revolving Credit Facility (RCF), up to a maximum for \u00a3300m, for short-term liquidity required by the Sports JV to fund its working capital and commitments to sports rights holders. Amounts drawn down by the Sports JV under the RCF accrue interest at a market reference rate, consistent with the group's external short-term borrowings. The outstanding balance under the RCF of \u00a3268m is treated as a loan receivable and held at amortised cost, see note 17. The capacity of the RCF is expected to reduce to \u00a3200m during FY24. There is also a loan payable to the Sports JV of \u00a311m, see note 27.\n\nThe Sports JV has a foreign exchange hedging arrangement with the group to secure Euros required to meet its commitments to certain sports rights holders; the group has external forward contracts in place to purchase the Euros at an agreed sterling rate in order to mitigate its exposure to exchange risk. The group holds a \u00a314m derivative liability in respect of forward contracts provided to the Sports JV.\n\nTransactions from commercial trading arrangements with associates and joint ventures, including the Sports JV, are shown below:\n\n| At 31 March                                           |   2023 \u00a3m |   2022 \u00a3m |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Sales of services to associates and joint ventures    |        29 |         5 |\n| Purchases from associates and joint ventures          |       216 |        44 |\n| Amounts receivable from associates and joint ventures |        10 |         2 |\n| Amounts payable to associates and joint ventures      |       124 |         1 |\n\nOther related party transactions include the purchase of energy from an entity owned by the BT Pension Scheme. Total purchases during the year were \u00a313m (FY22: \u00a312m). \u00a31m was due to the other party as at 31 March 2023 (FY22: \u00a31m). The balance is unsecured and no guarantees have been given.\n\n## 32. Financial commitments\n\nFinancial commitments as at 31 March 2023 include capital commitments of \u00a31,480m (FY22: \u00a31,596m) and device purchase commitments of \u00a3217m (FY22: \u00a3295m). TV programme rights commitments were \u00a3nil (FY22: \u00a3997m) as these were transferred to the Sports JV formed with Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) during FY23 (see note 23); both the group and WBD have guaranteed the Sports JV's obligations under certain programme rights commitments but we consider the risk of these guarantees being called as remote.\n\nOther than as disclosed below and in note 19, there were no contingent liabilities or guarantees at 31 March 2023 other than those arising in the ordinary course of the group's business and on these no material losses are anticipated. We have insurance cover to certain limits for major risks on property and major claims in connection with legal liabilities arising in the course of our operations. Otherwise, the group generally carries its own risks.\n\n## Guarantees\n\n## BT plc\n\nFrom March 2019 a formal guarantee was put in place by BT Group plc to fully and unconditionally guarantee the obligations of its wholly owned subsidiary British Telecommunications plc ('BT plc') under its corporate bonds. This guarantee has been given in respect of all bonds issued since that date and was retrospectively applied to bonds issued prior to that date. It applies to all bonds issued in BT plc's Yankee, Euro Medium Term Note and hybrid bond programmes, and under the BT plc \u00a3600m 5.75% bonds due in 2028.\n\n## Legal and regulatory proceedings\n\nSee note 19 for contingent liabilities associated with legal and regulatory proceedings.\n\n## 33.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the company financial statements\n\n## 1. BT Group plc accounting policies\n\n## Principal activity\n\nThe principal activity of the company is to act as the ultimate holding company of the BT Group.\n\n## Accounting basis\n\nAs used in these financial statements and associated notes, the term 'company' refers to BT Group plc (a public company limited by shares). These separate financial statements are prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (FRS 101). In preparing these financial statements, the Company applies the recognition, measurement and disclosure requirements of UK-adopted international accounting standards, but makes amendments where necessary in order to comply with Companies Act 2006 and has set out below where advantage of the FRS 101 disclosure exemptions has been taken.\n\n## Financial statements\n\nThe financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention. Refer to page 155 for further details of this assessment.\n\nAs permitted by Section 408(3) of the Companies Act 2006, the company's profit and loss account has not been presented.\n\n## New and amended accounting standards effective during the year\n\nBT adopted IFRS 17 with retrospective application on 1 April 2023. It is therefore effective from FY24 onwards.\n\nThe standard establishes principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of insurance contracts. The measurement method for insurance contracts required by IFRS 17 is a probability weighted discounted cash flow model, including a best estimate and an adjustment for non-financial risk calculated for groups of similar contracts.\n\nIFRS 17 primarily impacts insurance entities, however as it applies to individual contracts it is possible that non-insurers could issue contracts that are in scope of the standard such as product breakdown contracts or warranties.\n\nWe have assessed the impact of the standard on the BT Group plc legal entity, and concluded that its impact is not material. Contracts in scope of the standard are restricted to parent company guarantees, which we have assessed to have no material impact.\n\n## Exemptions\n\nAs permitted by FRS 101, the company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to business combinations, share-based payments, non-current assets held for sale, financial instruments, capital management, and presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, presentation of a cash flow statement, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets and related party transactions. The company intends to continue to take advantage of these exemptions in future years. Further detail is provided below.\n\nWhere required, equivalent disclosures have been given in the consolidated financial statements of BT Group plc.\n\nThe BT Group plc consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023 contain a consolidated cash flow statement. Consequently, as permitted by IAS 7 'Statement of Cash flows', the company has not presented its own cash flow statement.\n\nThe BT Group plc consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023 contain related party disclosures. Consequently, the company has taken advantage of the exemption in IAS 24 'Related Party Disclosures' not to disclose transactions with other members of the BT Group.\n\nThe BT Group plc consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2023 contain financial instrument disclosures which comply with IFRS 7 'Financial Instruments: Disclosures'. Consequently, the company is exempt from the disclosure requirements of IFRS 7 in respect of its financial instruments.\n\n## Investment in subsidiary undertaking\n\nInvestment in subsidiary undertaking is stated at cost and reviewed for impairment if there are indicators that the carrying value may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying amount cannot be recovered either by selling the asset or by continuing to hold the asset and benefiting from the net present value of the future cash flows (value in use) of the investment.\n\nInvestment impairment is assessed at each reporting date. Estimating value in use and key assumptions used (discount rate and growth rate) in performing the impairment assessment are in line with how we assess the group's goodwill in note 13 to the consolidated group financial statements. There is significant headroom between the carrying value of the investment and the calculated value in use.\n\n## Taxation\n\nFull provision is made for deferred taxation on all temporary differences which have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be sufficient taxable profits from which the underlying timing differences can be deducted. The deferred tax balances are not discounted.\n\n## Dividends\n\nDividend distributions are recognised as a liability in the year in which the dividends are approved by the company's shareholders for final dividends. Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid. Dividend income is recognised on receipt.\n\n## Share capital\n\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity. Repurchased shares of the company are recorded in the balance sheet as part of Own shares and presented as a deduction from shareholders' equity at cost.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and current balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily convertible to cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have an original maturity of three months or less.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nThe issuance by the company of share options and awards to employees of its subsidiaries represents additional capital contributions to its subsidiaries. An addition to the company's investment in subsidiaries is recorded with a corresponding increase in equity shareholders' funds. The additional capital contribution is determined based on the fair value of options and awards at the date of grant and is recognised over the vesting period.",

        "page_content": "## Additional information\n\n## Alternative performance measures\n\n## Introduction\n\nWe assess the performance of the group using a variety of alternative performance measures that are not defined under IFRS and are therefore termed non-GAAP measures. The non-GAAP measures we use are: adjusted revenue, adjusted operating costs, adjusted finance expense, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating profit, adjusted profit before tax, adjusted earnings per share, return on capital employed, normalised free cash flow and net debt. We also reference adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA on a Sports JV pro forma basis. The rationale for using these measures, along with a reconciliation from the nearest measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, is presented below.\n\nThe alternative performance measures we use may not be directly comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies.\n\n## Specific items\n\nOur income statement and segmental analysis separately identify trading results on an adjusted basis, being before specific items. The directors believe that presentation of the group's results in this way is relevant to an understanding of the group's financial performance as specific items are those that in management's judgement need to be disclosed by virtue of their size, nature or incidence.\n\nThis presentation is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured by management and reported to the Board and the Executive Committee and assists in providing an additional analysis of our reporting trading results.\n\nIn determining whether an event or transaction is specific, management considers quantitative as well as qualitative factors. Examples of charges or credits meeting the above definition and which have been presented as specific items in the current and/or prior years include significant business restructuring programmes such as the current group-wide cost transformation and modernisation programme, acquisitions and disposals of businesses and investments, charges or credits relating to retrospective regulatory matters, property rationalisation programmes, significant out of period contract settlements, net interest on our pension obligation, and the impact of remeasuring deferred tax balances. In the event that items meet the criteria, which are applied consistently from year to year, they are treated as specific items. Any releases to provisions originally booked as a specific item are also classified as specific. Conversely, when a reversal occurs in relation to a prior year item not classified as specific, the reversal is not classified as specific in the current year.\n\nDetails of items meeting the definition of specific items in the current and prior year are set out in note 9.\n\nReported revenue, reported operating costs, reported operating profit, reported net finance expense, reported profit before tax and reported earnings per share are the equivalent IFRS measures. A reconciliation from these can be seen in the group income statement on page 150.\n\n## Net debt and net financial debt\n\nNet debt consists of loans and other borrowings, lease liabilities (both current and non-current) less current asset investments and cash and cash equivalents, including items which have been classified as held for sale on the balance sheet.\n\nCurrency-denominated balances within net debt are translated to sterling at swap rates where hedged. Fair value adjustments and accrued interest applied to reflect the effective interest method are removed. Amounts due to joint ventures held within loans and borrowings are also excluded.\n\nNet debt is a measure of the group's net indebtedness that provides an indicator of overall balance sheet strength. It is a key indicator used by management to assess both the group's cash position and its indebtedness. The use of the term 'net debt' does not necessarily mean that the cash included in the net debt calculation is available to settle the liabilities included in this measure.\n\nNet financial debt is net debt excluding lease liabilities. It allows for the comparison to net debt measures reported before the introduction of IFRS 16 on 1 April 2019, and reflects a view that lease liabilities are operational debt in substance, rather than financing transactions.\n\nNet debt and net financial debt are considered to be alternative performance measures as they are not defined in IFRS. A reconciliation from loans and other borrowings, lease liabilities, cash and cash equivalents, and current asset investments, the most directly comparable IFRS measures to net debt and net financial debt, is set out in note 27.\n\n## Return on Capital Employed\n\nWe use a return on capital employed (ROCE) measure that serves as an indicator of how efficiently we generate returns from the capital invested in the business. It is a group KPI that is directly relatable to the outcome of investment decisions.\n\nROCE represents the group's returns as percentage of capital employed.\n\nReturns are defined as adjusted earnings before interest and tax. We use an adjusted measure (before specific items) for the reasons explained in the 'specific items' section above.\n\nCapital employed represents equity, debt and debt-like liabilities. We net the derivative financial instruments and cash and cash equivalent balances that we use to manage financial risk against gross debt, and exclude current and deferred tax balances as the measure is determined on a pre-tax basis.\n\nWhile our long-term capital investment programmes such as our full fibre rollout deliver value-creating long-term returns, they suppress ROCE in the short-to medium-term.",

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as the group profit or loss before specific items, net finance expense, taxation, depreciation and amortisation and share of post tax profits or losses of associates and joint ventures.\n\nWe consider adjusted EBITDA to be a useful measure of our operating performance because it approximates the underlying operating cash flow by eliminating depreciation and amortisation. Adjusted EBITDA is not a direct measure of our liquidity, which is shown by our cash flow statement, and needs to be considered in the context of our financial commitments.\n\nA reconciliation of reported profit for the period, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to adjusted EBITDA, is set out below.\n\n| Year ended 31 March                                                  | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Reported profit for the period                                       | 1,905     | 1,274     |\n| Tax                                                                  | (176)     | 689       |\n| Reported profit before tax                                           | 1,729     | 1,963     |\n| Net finance expense                                                  | 831       | 922       |\n| Depreciation and amortisation, including  impairment charges         | 4,818     | 4,405     |\n| Share of post tax losses (profits) of  associates and joint ventures | 59        | -         |\n| Specific revenue                                                     | (12)      | (5)       |\n| Specific operating costs before  depreciation and amortisation       | 503       | 292       |\n| Adjusted EBITDA                                                      | 7,928     | 7,577     |\n\n## Normalised free cash flow\n\nNormalised free cash flow is one of the group's key performance indicators by which our financial performance is measured. It is primarily a liquidity measure. However, we also believe it is an important indicator of our overall operational performance as it reflects the cash we generate from operations after capital expenditure and financing costs, both of which are significant ongoing cash outflows associated with investing in our infrastructure and financing our operations.\n\nNormalised free cash flow is defined as free cash flow (net cash inflow from operating activities after net capital expenditure) after net interest paid and payment of lease liabilities, before pension deficit payments (including their cash tax benefit), payments relating to spectrum, and specific items. It excludes cash flows that are determined at a corporate level independently of ongoing trading operations such as dividends paid, share buybacks, acquisitions and disposals, and repayment and raising of debt, cash flows relating to short-term funding arrangements with joint ventures, and cash flows relating to the Building Digital UK (BDUK) demand deposit account which have already been accounted for within normalised free cash flow. For non-tax related items the adjustments are made on a pre-tax basis.\n\nNormalised free cash flow is not a measure of the funds that are available for distribution to shareholders.\n\nA reconciliation from cash inflow from operating activities, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to free cash flow and normalised free cash flow, is set out below.\n\n| Year ended 31 March                                                  | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Cash generated from operations                                       | 6,588     | 5,962     |\n| Tax paid                                                             | 136       | (52)      |\n| Net cash inflow from operating activities                            | 6,724     | 5,910     |\n| Net purchase of property, plant and  equipment and intangible assets | (5,307)   | (4,607)   |\n| Free cash flow                                                       | 1,417     | 1,303     |\n| Interest received                                                    | 41        | 6         |\n| Interest paid                                                        | (709)     | (755)     |\n| Payment of lease liabilities                                         | (727)     | (659)     |\n| Dividends received from joint ventures,  associates and investments  | 9         | 1         |\n| Net purchase of non-current asset  investments                       | (5)       | (8)       |\n| Add back pension deficit payments                                    | 994       | 1,121     |\n| Remove cash tax benefit of pension deficit  payments                 | -         | -         |\n| Add back net cash flow from specific items                           | 404       | 606       |\n| Add back refund in respect of spectrum  licence auction              | -         | (223)     |\n| Remove cash flows relating to the BDUK  demand deposit account       | (96)      | -         |\n| Normalised free cash flow                                            | 1,328     | 1,392     |",

This is a financing cash flow in the cash flow statement as certain performance obligations in the contract need to be fulfilled before the right to consideration is unconditional, but we believe that it is appropriate to include these cash flows in our normalised free cash flow metric because the sale of these cash flows is part of our working capital management, as handset costs are incurred up front but recovered throughout the customer contract term. The corresponding operating cash inflow received from customers will be excluded from normalised free cash flow if it has previously been included at the time of the sale of the contract assets.\n\n- -  We will include monies received as prepayment for the forward sale of future redundant copper. This is a financing cash flow in the cash flow statement as certain benefits of the asset have not yet been transferred to the buyer, but we believe that it is appropriate to include these cash flows in our normalised free cash flow metric because the forward sale of this asset is in line with our operating activities and is similar in nature to cash flows arising from the net purchase of property, plant and equipment which are already included within normalised free cash flow.\n\n## Sports JV pro forma basis\n\nOn 3 September 2022 BT Group and Warner Bros. Discovery announced completion of their transaction to form a 50:50 sports joint venture (Sports JV) combining the assets of BT Sport and Eurosport UK. On 18 October 2022 we published unaudited pro forma financial information estimating the impact on the group as if trading in relation to BT Sport had been equity accounted for in previous periods, akin to the Sports JV being in place historically.\n\nWithin this Annual Report we reference pro forma information relating to the years ended 31 March 2023 and 2022.
